                                                                    v-.-

         (h)     responsibility for implementation of the Safety of Sports Grounds

         (i)     to assimilate and implement the increasing items of new legislation

                 relevant to the Council's licensing functions.


         The Licensing Section deals with 33 licensing systems, for example,

             those involving taxis and private hire vehicles, operators and drivers,

         cinemas, theatres and places of public entertainment.


         Legislation and the Green Guide

             On 1st August, 1975 Royal Assent was given to the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Act 1975 (Document 1, pages 1-16) which established a ' Certification

             system for sports grounds capable of holding more than   10,000   spectators.

             When a sports ground is designated by the Secretary of State an

             application needs to be made to the Certificating Authority for a General

             Safety Certificate under the 1975 Act.


             At the time the Safety Certificate was granted in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday Football Club the South Yorkshire County Council (the

             Certificating Authority) was obliged to attach to the Safety Certificate

             such terms and conditions as they considered necessary or expedient to

             secure reasonable safety at the sports ground when it is in use for

              specified activities.   The terms and conditions at this time had to

              include:-




HB5AAA/JJJ
         (a)     The maximum number of spectators to be admitted to the stadium and;

         (b)     Terms and conditions as to the number, size and situation of

                 entrances to and exits from the stadium or any part of it and the

                 means of access to any such entrances or exits and requiring those

                 entrances, exits and means of access to be properly maintained and

                 kept free from obstruction and as to the number, strength and

                  situation of any crush barriers.    (Section 2(2) of the Safety of

                  Sports Grounds Act 1975).


             Section 2(2) of the 1975 Act was repealed by the Fire Safety and

             Safety of Places of Sports Act 1987.    However, Home Office Circular

             71/1987 (Document 2, pages 20-29) advised that those conditions should

             still be included.


   8.    Certificate conditions must also be framed with reference to the plan

             attached to the Certificate, where appropriate.


    9.       Section 10 of 1975 Act provided for an emergency procedure which could be

             used by the Council if it thought that there was a serious risk to

             spectators at a sports ground.    The procedure involved applying to a

             Magistrates'   Court for an Order prohibiting or restricting the admission

             of spectators to the sports ground.


   10.   Under Section 11 of the 1975 Act a person authorised by the Local

             Authority or the Chief Officer of Police, or the Building Authority, or

             the Secretary of State, could on production of his authority enter a

             sports ground to make inspections and examine records and make enquiries

             as he thought fit.    On local government reorganisation on 1st April, 1986

             (when the South Yorkshire County Council was abolished and its functions

             passed in the main to District Councils) the reference to the Building

             Authority was changed to the Fire Authority.




HB5AAA/JJJ
    11.   In 1976 the Home Office issued the "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

          (Football)" which is a guide to measures for improving spectator safety at

          Football Grounds, i.e., at rugby union and rugby league grounds as well as

          at soccer grounds.      A revised edition of the Green Guide was issued in

          1986 following the Bradford Disaster and the Popplewell Inquiry.             The

          scope of the Green Guide was amended to cover measures for improving

             spectator safetx at existing sports grounds.        It is a voluntary code.     The

          Green Guide makes comments on such matters as the spacing of crush

             barriers, estimation of safe ground capacity, terraces, etc.        The

          Guide makes the point that deviations from individual guidelines are

^            possible without necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the

             ground.    A flexible approach should be maintained to take account of the

             particular circumstances at individual grounds (paragraphs 6 to 8 of the

             Guide) .


    12.      The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act, 1987 amended the 197 5

             legislation in a number of areas.        In particular, the old Section 10 of

             the 1975 Act (Document 1, page   8   )   was replaced by a more wide ranging

             provision which gave local authorities the power to issue a Prohibition

             Notice in respect of either a whole sports ground or part of it.          A

             Prohibition Notice can only be issued where the Local Authority is of the

             opinion that there is a serious risk to spectators if they are admitted to

             the sports ground.    A Prohibition Notice may include directions as to the

             steps which will have to be taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level

             and these may require alterations or additions to the ground or things to

             be done or omitted, which would contravene the terms or conditions of a

             Safety Certificate for the ground or for any stand at the ground.

              (Section 10(4) of the 1987 Act).        A prohibition or restriction contained

              in a Notice may take effect immediately if certain conditions are

              fulfilled, or after a specified period contained in the Notice.          An appeal

              may be lodged with the Magistrates'       Court against a Prohibition Notice but



HB5AAA/JJJ
         that appeal does not suspend its operation.        The Court may either cancel

         or affirm the Notice.


 13.     In the new Section 10B of the Act it is the duty of every Certificating

         Authority to enforce the provisions of the Act and regulations made under

         it and also to carry out an inspection of each designated sports ground

         at least once every      12   months and to act in accordance with guidance given

         to them by the Secretary of State.


  14.    The 1987 Act also made provision for Safety Certificates for various

         stands at sports grounds.         Also, in order to give effect to various

         Popplewell comments on indoor sporting activities, the definition of

         public entertainments which require licensing was extended.


  15.    The Safety of Sports Ground Regulations 1987 (Statutory Instrument

         1987/1941) sets out the prescribed form of application for a Safety

         Certificate and also refers to appeal procedures, etc. (Document 3, page

          30-35).

                                          Home Office Circulars

   16.       Home Office Circular 71/1987 (Document 2, page 17-29) introduced the

             provisions of Part 2 of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the effects and

             operation of them.    There is also specific reference to the new

             Prohibition Notice procedure and a draft Prohibition Notice.


   17.       Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Document 4, page 36-43) sets out the

             Statutory Guidance on inspections which is mandatory.


                          Administration of the Certificating Function by
                                   South Yorkshire County Council

             Background to Certification

   18.       The County Council set up an "Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)"

             which consisted of representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the

              Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the South Yorkshire County

              Council Administration Department.     This Working Party was set up


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                 -6-


         following a report to the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee on

         8   th January, 1976.   There were four such Working Parties, one covering

         Sheffield, one Rotherham, one Barnsley and one Doncaster.


         jjj the early part of 1976 discussions took place between the South

         Yorkshire County Council and the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club about

         the possibility of certification in view of the commencement of the Safety

         of Sports Grounds Act on 1st September, 1975.      On 30th March, 1977 the

         South Yorkshire Police became involved in the discussions and wrote

         to the Home Office indicating that they felt certification should be

         considered when the matter was next reviewed, owing to the large scale

         events that were held at Hillsborough.


  20.    At a football match held on Saturday, 23rd April, 1977 there were

             incidents at Hillsborough involving some injuries and a number of arrests.

             This prompted further discussions about certification and the involvement

             of the Fire Service Committee of the County Council as well as the Police.

             At a meeting of the South Yorkshire County Council on 27th April, 1977

             questions relating to the problems at the football match were raised and a

             specific complaint was later made by a member of the public in connection

             with an incident that allegedly took place at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.


   21.       The Chief Constable subsequently agreed to take up the designation

             question once again with the Home Office.   On 24th August, 1977 the Home

             Office wrote to the Chief Constable stating that the case for designation

             of Sheffield Wednesday was not overwhelming at that time - but they would

             reconsider the matter later.


   22.       The County Council continued to press the case for designation with the

             Home Office on the grounds that because of the importance of the games

             played there and the consequent crowd capacities, only if the Stadium had

              been designated could the Authorities satisfy themselves as to standards


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                       -7-


         of safety within the ground.            The Home Office once again declined to

         designate the stadium.


 23.     In April, 1978 the County Council prepared and submitted a lengthy paper

         to the Home Office on the case for designating the Hillsborough Stadium

         under the 1975 Act.


  24.    In August of 1978, the Home Office wrote to the County Council

         indicating that they would recommend to the Home Secretary that an order

         be made designating Hillsborough in due course.                The County Council then

         began the Safety Certificate drafting exercise..               The exercise was carried

         out in consultation with the Police, the Fire Service, the Building

         Surveyor and the Club.


  25.    The Safety of Sports Grounds (Designation) Order 1978 (Statutory

          Instrument 1978 No. 1091) designated the Sheffield Wednesday Football

          Stadium as requiring a Safety Certificate with effect from 1st January,

          1979 (Document 5, page 44).


  26.    The Club applied for a Safety Certificate on            8   th September, 1978

             (Document   6   , page 45-48).


             Progress of the Safety Certificate Application with particular
             reference to the Leppings Lane End of the Stadium

   27.   In support of the Club's application, a report was submitted to the                County

             Council by Messrs. Eastwoods & Partners, Consulting Engineers, in January,

             1979 (Document 7, page 49-58) which dealt with the question of ground

         ■capacity at the stadium.            The report     .   .     deals in broad terms with

             the necessary strengthening and supplementation of the crush barriers on

             the terraces, and calculations are made of theoretical exit times .             .

             All the stands and terraces were dealt with in.the report.             Pages 4 and 5

             (Document 7, pages 53 and 54) of the report indicates that the west

             terrace (which is at the Leppings Lane end) has a total area of some 1,480

              square metres, but there are no gangways.          It is suggested that the full


HB5AAA/JJJ
           area would justify about   8,000     spectators, but after making a    10%


           allowance as the equivalent of gangways, a capacity of 7,200 would be

           appropriate.   The report says that the barriers should be designed to

           match this figure approximately and that those barriers which could not

           withstand test load should be appropriately strengthened and extra ones

           provided where necessary.         Proposed extra barriers were shown on drawing

           1610/2X.    The three exits from the west terrace have a total width of

           about 11.5 metres which would permit some 1,250 persons per minute to

             leave the terrace.   The terrace could, therefore, be emptied in about          6


           minutes.    The report goes on that the Guide suggests that everyone on the

)            terrace should be within 12 metres of a gangway or exit.         As there are no

             gangways some spectators would be 25 metres from an exit.         The report goes

             on to say that this is felt to be of no consequence as movement

             horizontally along the terrace will be easy and quick.


    28.      The north west corner reinforced concrete terrace is also referred to in

             the report which is noted as covering a net area of approximately 535

             square metres.   The recommended number of spectators was 2,900, bringing

             the total standing at the Leppings Lane end to 10,100.          It was also noted

             that the exits serving the north west terrace were adequate in width and

             emptying should take place within      8   minutes.   The significance of the   8


             minute time relates to the recommended maximum time for departure of

             spectators from a terraced area of a football ground.          This recommendation

             is contained in the original "Green Guide" at Paragraph 15.5 and the new

             Guide at paragraph 56.    The last page of the report, recommends a ground

             capacity of 50,100 spectators (consisting of approximately 24,000 seated

             spectators, 16,000 standing on the spion kop and 10,100 at the Leppings

             Lane end).


     29.     Following the submission of Eastwoods' report to the County Council there

              was a meeting of the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) on 12th

              February, 1979 (Document   8   , page 62) at which the west terrace and north


HB5AAA/JJJ
          west corner reinforced concrete terrace were discussed.           As far as the

          west terrace was concerned it was agreed that ".                 In view of the

             lack of depth of this terrace, the Club's offer to reduce the spectator

             limit to 7,200, and the discharge time of     6.6   minutes, the Working Party

             agreed that it would be unreasonable to insist that gangways or additional

             exits must be provided." The Working Party also noted that special

             attention would be required to the crush barriers in addition to         the

             ordinary testing in view of the apparent sharp edges, corrosion,         etc.    The

             Working Party agreed that there were no real problems with the north west

             terrace but reference is made to the corrugated sheeting which would be

^            required to pass the appropriate tests, along with the crush barriers.


    30.      On 30th March, 1979 (Document 9, page   66)   the Officer Working Party

             considered further the question of the west terrace and the north west

             terrace.   As to the west terrace it was noted that the terracing in small

             areas near to the stand was in poor condition and that the cross-fall on

             the steps on the north west corner exit would also require attention as it

             tended to throw people forward.   The height of the crush barriers was also

             mentioned as being below the Guide recommendations.        The Working   Party

             agreed that these points should be drawn to the attention of the         Club.    As

)            far as the north west terrace is concerned, the Building Authority now

             took the view that the corrugated sheeting would require alteration in

             order to meet the requirements of the Green Guide.


    31.      On 2nd April, 1979 (Document 10, page 71) the Officer Working Party

             visited Sheffield Wednesday and a joint meeting was held with the Club

             representatives.   The Working Party agreed that the Club's proposals

              (including a capacity limit of 7,200 spectators) was acceptable, without

              the need for additional gangways.   It was also agreed that the question of

              the cross-fall on the steps on the north west corner exit, the height of

              some of the existing crush barriers as well as their corrosion and sharp

              edges in places, should be the subject of detailed discussion between Dr.

HB5AAA/JJJ
         Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.        The Club's proposals in respect to

         the north west terrace were also accepted, with a capacity limit of 2,900

         and the improvement of existing barriers and addition of some new

         barriers.     It was also agreed that the improvement or replacement of the

         existing corrugated sheeting should be subject to discussion between the

         Building Surveyor and Dr.      Eastwood.


   12.   On 18th April, 1979, (Document 11, page 75) a joint meeting of the Officer

         Working Party was held at Sheffield Wednesday.        Ihe meeting was held to

             discuss further the proposals in relation to the Hillsborough Stadium.

             The comments made on the west terrace were that the Club accepted that in

             view of the cross-fall on the north west corner exit, the steps should be

             rebuilt and that the other matters previously raised would be reconsidered

             after it was seen which of the crush barriers failed on testing.    Whilst

             accepting the need for improvement or replacement of the existing

             corrugated sheeting on the north west corner terrace, the Club wished to

             consider whether to carry out more extensive works so as to bring an

             existing unused area into use for the accommodation of further

             spectators.


   33.       On 1st May, 1979 (Document 12, pages 78-80) the Sheffield City Council's

             Building Surveyor wrote to the County Council indicating that as far as

             the west terrace was concerned, the downward slope of the exit steps

             needed to be corrected and that the limitation in capacity should remain.

             It was noted that, on the north west terrace, the replacement of the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear was required, as was the removal of

             understrength barriers and their replacement by new ones constructed to

             Guide recommendations.


   34.       On 16th May, 1979 (Document 13, page 82) the Chief Fire Officer wrote to

              the County Council with a work schedule in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

              It is noted that the west and north west terrace exit routes were regarded



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -11-


         as satisfactory.      It was noted that the capacity of the west terrace was

         7,200 persons and that of the north west terrace 2,900 persons.


  35.    As a result of these consultations between the Working Party and the Club

         on 8th June, 1979 (Document 14, page 85 and Document 15, pages 86-92) a

          list of "Matters requiring attention at the Sheffield Wednesday Football

         Ground, Hillsborough, Sheffield" was sent to the Club for its attention.


  36.    On 15th August, 1979 (Document 16, page 93) the Officer Working Party met

          again to consider matters relating to Sheffield United, and also to review

             the progress of work at Sheffield Wednesday since the last meeting on 12th

          July.     It was noted, amongst other things, that no strengthening of the

             corrugated sheeting on the north west terrace had been carried out.


  37.    On 19th September, 1979 (Document 17, pages 96 and 97) Eastwood & Partners

             wrote to the County Council about the emergency lighting installation in

             the stadium.   Eastwoods proposed in the letter that new emergency circuits

             and fittings be installed in areas of the stadium including the north west

             terrace, the south west terrace and the Leppings Lane exit.


   38.   Between 31st October, 1979 and 12th November of the same year, there was

             correspondence between Eastwoods and the County Council about the

             corrugated sheeting at the rear of the north west terrace.      It was finally

             agreed that a continuous horizontal timber member should be fixed to the

             front of the corrugated sheeting at a Working Party visit to the ground

             to assess the progress of works.      (Document 18, page 99).

             Grant of the Certificate

   39.       The County Fire Services Committee of the South Yorkshire County Council

             at its meeting on 29th November, 1979 approved the issue of a General

              Safety Certificate and the terms and conditions of that Certificate to

              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.     This decision was ratified by the full

              County Council meeting on 19th December, 1979.     Prior to the grant of a

              certificate the Working Party visited the ground on 18th December, 1979

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                       -12-


             (Document 97, pages 299-301).     The grant of a Certificate was made subject

             to remedial works to the south stand steel columns and the emergency

             lighting system being carried out.        The Safety Certificate document itself

             was issued on 21st December, 1979 under the signature of Mr.         F.   A.

             Mallett, the Chief Executive of the County Council.


    40.      The Certificate is attached to this Statement:- (Document 19, pages

             103-112)

             The Inspection System operated by South Yorkshire County Council

    41.      The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) carried out regular

             inspections of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in accordance with the

             South Yorkshire County Council policy of twice yearly visits to football

             league grounds in South Yorkshire.        A list of the dates of inspections

             carried out under South Yorkshire County Council are set out below:-

             Example of Inspection

   42.       At the Working Party inspection on 11th August, 1983 (Document 20, pages

             113-116) there were two representatives from the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club (Dr.     Eastwood and Mr.     E.   England), two from the South

             Yorkshire Police (J.     Barker and C.     Calvert), one from the South

             Yorkshire County Fire Service (J.        Miles), two from the Sheffield City
                                                                  \

             Council (Building Authority) (A.     Roberts and D;;     Sheriff) and one from


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -13-

             the South Yorkshire County Council Administration Department (D.

             Vaughan).   For illustrative purposes, I would refer to the last two

             paragraphs on the first page of the notes of the Working Party visit.      In

             the first of the two paragraphs it is clear that a problem in relation to

             the brickwork at the rear corner of the stand nearest the north west

             terrace had been raised at the previous meeting of the Working Party and

             this was further explored at the meeting on 11th August.   In the second

             paragraph, Dr.   Eastwood (the Club's Consulting Engineer) gave details of

             testing of the crush barriers on the terrace and indicating that

             appropriate remedial action had been taken, where necessary and that the

             first cycle of the barrier testing had thus been completed.


             Issues arising other than on inspections

    43.      The County Council was made aware of various problems in connection with

             the use of the stadium.   An example as to how these matters were dealt

             with can be seen by reference to a letter from the South Yorkshire County

             Fire Service (Document 21, pages 117-118) to the Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club regarding a test which the Fire Service did of the emergency

             procedures at a match on 4th October, 1983.   There was particular concern

             that stewards could not hear the emergency procedure announcement on the

             public address system, which resulted in stewards failing to carry out

             their emergency procedure duties.   Consultations then took place between

             the Club and the Fire Officer (with reference to the County Council) which

             resulted in the system being checked and found satisfactory by the County

             Fire Service on 29th October, 1983, (Document 22, page 119, and Document

             23, page 120).


                          Sheffield City Council as Certificating Authority
                                  (with effect from 1st April, 1986)

             Initial Administrative System

    44.      At the meeting of the General Purposes Panel on 3rd March, 1986 (which is

             a Sub-Comraittee of the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme



HB5AAA/JJJ

          Committee of the City Council) a report was considered from the Head of

          Administration and Legal Department on Safety of Sports Grounds

          (Document 24, page 122). The Panel adopted the recommendations contained

          in the report which were:-


          (a)      All the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of Sports

                   Grounds Act 1975 be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.


          (b)      The emergency procedure powers under Section 10 of the 1975 A-ct be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department in

                   consultation with the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the Panel or of

                   the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Programme Committee as

                   appropriate.


             (c)   The power to authorise Officers under Section 11 of the Act be

                   delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.


             The Panel's decision was subsequently confirmed by a full meeting of the

             City Council which took place on 9th April, 1986.


    45.      The General Purposes Panel considered a more detailed report on the Act at

             its neeting on   6   th May, 1986 (Document 25, pages 123-127).


             Review of the Administrative System

    46.      At its neeting on 7th September, 1987 the General Purposes Panel

             considered a report (Document 26, pages 128— 130) on the future

             administration of the Council's Certificating function.


    47.      As the report accepts that the Council, as the Certificating Authority,

             will act on the basis of advice from experts (such as the Fire Service),

              the question arose as to how that advice may best be formulated.      In this

              respect it was recommended that a "Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory

              Group" should be established which would consist of representatives from

              the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor's Division and the



HB5AAA/JJJ
        Department of Health and Consumer Services.       Both the Building Surveyor's

         Division and the Department of Health and Consumer Services are part of

         existing Council structure.     It was envisaged that the Advisory Group

         would function as a forum for discussion between Officers and its most

         regular use would probably be the discussion of advice to the Council

         before recommendations were finally formulated by the appropriate

         Authority.


  48.    It was also anticipated that meetings of the Group would be held at the

         request of one or more Authorities and on receipt of a request the

         Administration and Legal Department would arrange a meeting and despatch a

         list of items to be discussed.      At the conclusion of the meeting a further

         list of items would be prepared and the details of action agreed to be

             taken by each Authority would be noted.   It was then envisaged that

         detailed written advice would be provided by each discipline and acted

         upon as appropriate.



  49.        The reD ort went on to suggest various areas of responsibility for each

             Authority


             Authority                         Area of Responsibility

             The Building Surveyor,            All matters relating to the structure
             (Sheffield City Council)          of stadia, including crush barriers,
                                               walls, etc.

             South Yorkshire County            Fire precautions, fire alarms, means
             Fire Service                      of escape, emergency lighting, stadium
                                               capaci ty.

             South Yorkshire Police             Stadium policing, evacuation procedures,
                                                access of emergency vehicles and
                                                emergency planning.


             It should be noted that there is, of course, an independent duty in

             relation to safety at the sports ground which falls on the club as

              certificate holder and the management of the business carried on at the

              ground as occupier.




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                -16-


  50.    It was also anticipated that the Health and Consumer Services Department

         would have an input into the Advisory Group on:- aspects of general

         safety, the general safety management of stadia, and various special items

         such as first aid requirements.      These lists were of course not

         exhaustive and several of the functions overlapped.


  51.    The report considered the question of inspections and it was suggested

             that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried

         out each year.      It was also envisaged that some additional inspections

         would take place during events.      It was noted that the proposal was in

             line with the Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other

             areas.


  52.    The Panel approved the revised administrative system which therefore came

             into effect immediately and delegated all routine matters in connection

             with that system to the Head of Administration and Legal Department.     The

             system remains in effect.


   53.   The report was seen in draft by all the interested officers and its

             proposals modified in the light of comments made.   Prior to the

             preparation of the report the administrative system was discussed at

             length at both a meeting and in correspondence with proposed members of

             the Advisory Group.


             Comments on the New Administrative System

   54.       Basically, the Council's responsibility divides into three parts, i.e. (a)

             inspections of sports grounds; (b) dealing with proposed alterations to

             sports grounds and (c) dealing with serious risks to spectators.   The

             inspection system is dealt with at paragraphs 61 to 78.


   55.       Sports ground management sometimes wish to alter or improve their facility

             and usually these proposals involve the Council as Certificating

             Authority.   Recent examples of such developments include the extension and



HB5AAA/JJJ
            roofing over of the Kop and also the installation of facilities for people

            with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.       The administrative

            system for dealing with those alterations is that copies of the proposals

            are circulated to all the members of the Advisory Group for comment.

            Where comments are received, they are collated and passed on to the Club -

            if necessary following discussions between officers either informally or

            via the Group itself.     This system works reasonably well where proposals

            are straightforward and there is no disagreement between the officers and

            the Club about individual items.       An example of a relatively

            straightforward alteration to the Hillsborough Ground is the "Gate 'O'

            Development" (Document    86   , pages 269-270) which involved the creation of a

            new entrance to the Ground on Penistone Road.


  56.       Unfortunately, some developments are not quite so straightforward and an

            example of the sorts of problems that can arise are contained in the large

            volume of correspondence in relation to the proposed facilities for people

            with disabilities in the North Stand at Hillsborough.        In that

             particular instance, a considerable amount of time was expended on what

             was essentially a fairly straightforward development.       The amount of

             officer time spent on dealing with alterations to sports grounds obviously

             has to be included in the total amount of time applied to the Safety of

             Sports Grounds system.


   57   ^    if the Council were of the opinion that admission of spectators to the

             Sports Ground involved a serious risk then immediate steps would be taken

             to secure rectification of the problem.       If rectification was not

             possible prior to spectator admission then if appropriate steps would be

             taken to issue a Prohibition Notice.


   58.       The administrative system has not yet been in operation for a long enough

              time to enable a true assessment of it to take place and it will, as with

              any similar system, no doubt be capable of modification in order to



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                      -18-


           improve its efficiency.        It is and has been my practice to review

           administrative systems after they have been in operation for a reasonable

           time (for example in this case perhaps a period of two years would be an

           appropriate time to review it).


           Role of the Administration and Legal Department
           in the Certificatiori System

   59.     The basic role of the Department is to co-ordinate the administration of

             the Certification System and also to keep the records of it.


   60.     An example (Document 27, page 131-132) of an Agenda and notes of a meeting
                     t


           are attached, dated 28th April, 1988, which shows the sort of items

             discussed at the Advisory Group.


             The Inspection System operated by Sheffield City Council

   61.     Every year inspections of stadia are fixed by the Head of Administration

             and Legal Department in consultation with the clubs and the interested

             authorities.   Inspections have taken place on the following dates:-

             7th August, 1986;   6   th August, 1987; 19th May, 1988.


             The Inspection System

. _ 62 .   The inspection system basically consists of six stages:-

             Stage                           Action

             \                              Arrange the inspection

             2                              Carry out the inspection

             3                              Receive comments from Advisory Group members
                                             in writing

             4                              Co-ordinate the comments if necessary via an
                                             Advisory Group meeting

             5                              Send the co-ordinated list to the sports
                                             ground management

             6                              The Advisory Group Officers check that work is
                                             done either on the next inspection or at some
                                             earlier stage if appropriate.




WRSAAA/JJJ
        This procedure is of'course much simplified in the table above and many

        variations of it can occur.     The system itself should in most

        circumstances work well but in practice some difficulties do occasionally

        arise.


         Inspections are attended by persons representing:- the County Fire

         Service, the Police, the Council's Director of Health and Consumer

         Services and the Council's Building Surveyor.        Often, the Club is

         represented at the inspection by a consultant engineer, together with

         another representative, usually the Club Secretary or similar Officer.

         The inspection is carried out by the various officers who meet at the

         ground and then disperse to various areas in which their particular

         interest lies.


         The Officers can draw points to each other's attention during the

         inspection and Club representatives are sometimes asked for

         information.


         If Officers discover a serious safety defect then the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department is informed and immediate steps are

             taken to secure its rectification.   If rectification is not possible prior

             to spectators being admitted into the stadium, then steps would be taken

             to issue a Prohibition Notice, if appropriate.


             Officers at the conclusion of the inspection write to the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department setting out their comments on matters

             which ought to be raised with the Club.   These are then collated and

             discussed with the officers (when necessary at an Advisory Group) and

             finally formulated into a list which is sent to the Club for action.
                                %




             As an example, a copy of Officers' comments following the 1987 inspection

             are attached to this Statement (Document 28, pages 133-134).




HB5AAA/JJJ
         The actual time spent on each ground inspection alone usually exceeds two

         man days per year.           This does not include the subsequent administrative

         work or the consideration of proposals submitted by sports ground owners.

         Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Document 4, pages 36-43) states that

         inspections are not expected to take more than about two man days per

         ground on average.


         Details of the Inspections at Hillsborough in 1986, 1987 and 1988

         7th August, 1986

             There is no written record of the inspection on 7th August, 1986,Thereare

             two reasons for       this.   The first is that no significant problems were

         discovered on the inspection and the only point of significance raised was

             that in relation to barrier 144 which is referred to in paragraphs 174-175

             of my statement.       The second reason is that at the same time as the

             inspection was being carried out, the lengthy and complex debate in

             relation to the Spion Kop was fully underway and by far the majority of my

             own efforts and those of the other participants in that debate were

             concentrated in that area.        I do, however, recall that the inspection

             followed the County Council system and it helped firm my views in that

             a rea.


             6   th August, 1987

             The Building Surveyor and the Director of Health and Consumer Services

             made a number of comments on the annual inspection.         These comments

             were considered and discussed between officers and a consolidated

             list was drawn up and sent to Sheffield Wednesday on 4th December, 1987

              (Document 28, pages 133-134).        No comments were received from the Fire

             Service or the Police.         The list was circulated to the Fire Service, the

             Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building Surveyor, the Police

              and Messrs.    Eastwood & Partners.




HB5AAA/JJJ
         Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote back to the Council (Document 82, pages

         242-245) on 15th January, 1988, indicating that the majority of the points

         raised from the list of comments had been completed but raising one or two

         questions on some of the items.          Copies of Eastwoods letter were passed on

         to the Health and Consumer Services Department and the Building Surveyor

         but owing to the impending May inspection no further action was taken at

         that stage.       I should explain that it had been decided to move the annual

         inspection from August to May, in order that any work that needed to be

         done could be identified and carried out during the close season.


         As already noted, the Fire Service did not make any comments in relation

             to the inspection.   The Fire Service sent a letter to the Council on 18th

             February, 1987 (Document 91, pages 279-284) containing a large number of

             comments on Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.        After discussions with

             the Fire Service, the City Council sent a copy of the Fire Service letter

             (along with various comments) on 22nd April, 1987 (Document 92, pages

             285-286) to Sheffield Wednesday.      After being reminded, the Club via

             Eastwood & Partners responded to the County Fire Service letter on 3rd

             February, 1988 (Document 93, pages 287-293).         The letter was very detailed

             and was passed on to the Police, the Health and Consumer Services

             Department and the Building Surveyor on     8 th   February.   The letter was sent

             to the Fire Service on   8   th February, 1988, with a covering letter

             (Document 94^ page 294).      In view of the comments in this letter, the Fire

             Service were invited to respond directly to Eastwood & Partners.          The

             letter also requested comments on the remainder of the points raised in

             Eastwoods letter.    A Senior Fire Officer rang me in February, 1988,

             indicating that the Fire Service did not wish to reply to the letter at

              that time.




HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                  -22-


             19th May, 1988

   74.       The inspection was attended by representatives of the Police, the Fire

             Service, the Building Surveyor and Health and Consumer Services

             Department.


   75.   The     Fire Service and the Health and Consumer Services Department both

             commented on the inspection by letter dated 25th May, 1988 (Document 95,

             pages 295-296) and memorandum of 3rd June, 1988 (Document 96, pages

             297-298) respectively.


   76.   The     Fire Service had not yet replied to Eastwoods letter (Docuaent 93,

             pages 287-293) referred to above.    I was therefore reluctant to send their

             further letter (Docuaent 95, pages 295-296) to the Club before the

             previous issue had been resolved.    I had thought to write back to the Fire

             Service in this way but unfortunately time simply did not permit owing to

             other commitments within the Licensing Section.    I should say that at no

             time has the Fire Service indicated that any of the points mentioned in

             their letter required immediate attention or presented any serious hazard

             to the public.


   77.   TheDirector of Health and Consumer Services made a number of points

             similar to ones raised previously.


   78.   Ideally,     what should have happened in June or July 1988 was that the

             outstanding Fire Service issues should have been resolved and that a

             co-ordinated set of comments submitted to the Club.    This did not

             however happen owing, as I have mentioned previously, to pressure of work

             within the Licensing Section.   As I have already said, none of the points

             raised by either the Fire Service or the Health and Consumer Services

             Department had been highlighted as being of a serious nature.

           Why were the Administrative and Inspection Systems changed when
           Sheffield City Council became the Certificating Authority?_____

  79   .   In April, 1986, I recall visiting the South Yorkshire County Council

           Offices in Barnsley and collecting the large number of files in relation

           to both designated sports grounds in Sheffield.         In addition to applying

           some time to reading the files, I talked to officers who had

           been involved with the system for some time.


  80.      It seemed to me that the key test of the South Yorkshire County Council

           administrative system was whether or not it achieved a reasonable degree

           of public safety within the sports grounds which were subject to the

             certificating system.   Bearing this principle in mind, I formed a number

           of tentative views about the County Council's administrative system.         The

             first and most obvious point was that the issues at sports grounds were

             complex and required the allocation of a considerable amount of time in

             order to deal with them.   Also, although it appeared on the face of it

             that the system itself worked well, it struck me that there were a number

             of points which required clarification.     For example, it was not clear who

             made what decisions.    There were plenty of "agreements" on the file and a

             lot of letters to the Clubs but there was no evidence to indicate who had

             the authority to make requirements, etc.        It was also difficult to pick up

             from the files exactly where the technical responsibilities lay and often

             "agreements" were noted as having been arrived at without an indication as

             to who contributed to them.    There was also no clear indication in a lot

             of cases as to the basis on which agreement was reached.        The constitution

             of the Working Party was also rather confused as evidently Club

             representatives were present and made comments at various meetings at

             which agreements were reached.
                                                         V

   81.        I also looked at the question of inspections of the sports grounds and

             wondered about their thoroughness.    The inspection records did not

              clearly show which areas of the sports grounds had been looked at and it



HB5AAA/JJJ
         seemed to me that in view of the size of sports grounds quite a number of

         points would be raised on an inspection - although these points would

         obviously vary in importance.         The question of the time taken on

         inspections was also a matter which I thought about.          I also noted that

             the Safety Certificate had now been in force for seven years and perhaps

             should be reviewed.     Obviously, this review process would take a

             considerable time.


  82.        I also looked into the question of the amount of time which should be

             spent on safety of sports grounds and took particular note of paragraph       10


             in the letter accompanying the Home Office Circular 136/78 (dated 23rd

             August, 1978) which stated that "... Local Authorities should not in the

             normal course find it necessary to charge fees representing more than 17

             man/days work          This statement is in relation to charging fees for the

             grant of Safety Certificates and is a clear indication that from the point

             of view of the Home Secretary, even the work prior to Certification which

             the Council would need to carry out should not exceed the rather limited

             17 man/days.     It should be noted that Home Office Circular 72/1987

             (Document 4, page 37) indicated that inspections are not expected to take

             more than about 2 man/days per ground on average.      It seems to me that far

             more than   2   man days per ground are required.


   83.       It is, in my opinion, vitally important that a licensing authority should,

             whilst arranging adequate systems of communication, also be completely

             independent of licensees themselves.      Such independence is crucial in

             order that the Authority can form properly balanced views which are based

             on a d e q u a t e information and which are not unduly influenced by the view of

              licensees themselves.     I should emphasise once again, however, that

              licensees have a part to play in discussions but decisions finally rest

             with the Authority.      Carefully maintained independence also tends to breed

              objectivity whereas inter-dependence (i.e.     relationships which become too




HB5AAA/JJJ
             close) tend to obscure it.    In the area of public safety, independence

         must be maintained.


  84.        In March/April, 1986, having formed the tentative views I have set out

             above, I then decided to see exactly how the system worked in practice.       I

         had no wish to interfere with what appeared to be a smoothly running

             system unless significant factors emerged which required immediate

             attention.


  85.        In relation to the administrative system, the matter was first considered

             by the Council on 3rd March, 1986 (Document 24, page 122) when all powers

             and duties under the Act were delegated to the General Purposes Panel and

             various powers were then delegated to the Head of Administration and Legal

             Department (paragraph 44).    A further report was considered on 6th May,

             1986 (Document 25, pages 123-127) when it was agreed that the old system

             should continue for the time being and that the certificate conditions

             should be reviewed.     Finally, at its meeting on 7th September, 1987

             (Document 26, page 128-130) the current administrative system was approved

             (paragraph 46 to 53).


   86.       The inspections in 1986 followed the pattern of the previous County

             Council inspections where Officers of the Working Party accompanied a Club

             representative around the sports ground over a period of possibly two

             hours.   Two things struck me about these inspections.    The first was that

             they were not particularly efficient as Officers representing the various

             disciplines were not all interested in the same items and therefore much

              time was wasted while discussions took place between a particular

              specialist and the Club.    Secondly, the lead appeared to be taken by the

              Club in directing the inspection.    I am quite sure that if officers had

              said that they wished to visit a particular area of the sports ground or

              to take more time with their inspection this would have been allowed by

              the Club.   There is no suggestion that the Club or its representatives



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                -26-


            either attempted or intended to control the areas of the sports ground

            which the officers visited.


  87.       However, during the 1987 and 1988 inspections of the sports grounds, I

            attempted to encourage Officers to feel free to visit all parts of the

            sports grounds and gradually this did indeed happen.     I recall that

            initially the Clubs were perhaps somewhat concerned about this move as

            were some of the officers, but its value has been demonstrated several

             times.   For example, during the 1987 inspection of one of the sports

            grounds in Sheffield it was discovered that there was an accumulation of

             combustible material beneath a wooden stand.   This situation was dealt

            with most promptly by the Club concerned in consultation with the relevant

             officers.


  88    .    One of my suggestions was to involve officers of the Council's Health and

             Consumer Services Department in the Safety of Sports Grounds System.      This

             stemmed from recommendation 9 in the Popplewell Report which related to

             the Health and Safety experts.   I recognised that unlike other similar

             licensing systems (for example, public entertainments, theatres and

             cinemas), there was no input in the old County Council system from

             appropriately qualified Health and Safety experts.     There were some

             resistance to the idea of their inclusion, but I believe that their

             contributions have been and will continue to be most valuable.


   89.       Obviously, any system can be improved in the light of experience but I

             believe that any serious safety problem would be discovered and dealt with

             under the current system.    In the light of the tragic events at

             Hillsborough and with the benefit of the Inquiry report these issues will

              be reconsidered.


                                      The role of the Home Office

    90.       The Home Office is the Central Government Department which is responsible

              for safety of sports grounds.   Its functions can be described in brief as

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -27-




         follows:

         (a)     To advise Parliament on legislation;

         (b)     To issue circulars informing interested persons about legislation
                 and to offer guidance;

         (c)     To issue Statutory guidance (for example, in relation to
                 inspections); and

         (d)     To issue the "Green Guide" which is an advisory document to assist
                 the improvement of safety standards at sports grounds.



                  The Certificating Authority's response to the Bradford Disaster
                                    and the Popplewell Report

  91.        The South Yorkshire County Council issued a press release on 10th May,

         1985 (Document 29     ,   page 135) outlining the certification system in

         operation throughout the County.         The press release went on to say that

             the forthcoming "Summer" inspections will take into account the lessons of

             the recent tragic event at Bradford and any revised advice and

             requirements which may be issued by the Home Office.     On 13th May, 1985

             the South    Yorkshire County Council sent a letter to the Secretary of

             Sheffield    Wednesday (Document 30, page 136)    enclosing acopy of the press

             release and stressing that it is vital necessity for safety stewards to be

             fully aware of and trained in their duties on the manning and opening of

             doors and gates on egress routes and in the use of fire fighting

             equipment.


   92.       The South Yorkshire County Council wrote again to Sheffield Wednesday on

             9th August, 1985 (Document 31, pages 137— 138) indicating that the Interim

             Report of the Popplewell Inquiry had been produced and advice had been

             received from the Home Office.     The letter drew attention to a review of

              the evacuation procedures in consultation with the Police and the Fire

              Service and also to the duties of safety stewards.     It also indicated that

              the Police and the Fire Service were willing to assist clubs in these

             matters.      Detailed comments were also made     about the first aid facilities

              at the stadium and     the requirements of the    Certificatein respect of them.


HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                    -28-


             There was also a comment about stands which are constructed of combustible

         materials and that they should have "no smoking" signs prominently

             displayed.   The Club responded (Document 32, page 139) to the County

             Council's letter of 14th August 1985 and comments were made about steward

             training procedures.


   93.       The Sheffield City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday on 15th October,

             1987 (Document 33, page 140) referring to the revised Green Guide which

             had been published by H.     M.   Government following the Popplewell Report

             drawing attention to the new Guide and particularly to Chapter 2, which is

             entitled "Management Responsibility".      The letter asks Sheffield Wednesday

             to confirm in writing that the Club intends to retain a copy of the

             revised Green Guide on the premises and that they should take immediate

             steps to appoint a safety officer as defined in Chapter 2.      The Club

             responded to that letter on 23rd October, 1987 (Document 34, page 141) and

             Mr.   Mackrell stated "I confirm that I do have a copy of the Guide to

             Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 edition and have had such for many months.

             With regard to the appointment of a Safety Officer, my duties encompass

             those of the Safety Officer and I would be grateful if you could amend

             your records to note that I am responsible for all matters of safety

             within the ground".


                                          The Semi-Final in 1981

   94.       On 7th April, 1981 the Officer Working Party (Document 35, pages 142-143)

             inspected the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium, bearing in mind that an F.A.

             Cup Semi-Final was to take place on 11th April, 1981.


   95.       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club wrote to the County Council on 15th

             April, 1981 (Document 36, pages 144-145) outlining an incident which took

             place at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at the Semi-Final Match on

              11th April, that year.     It is noted that there were injuries to spectators

             because of crushing.      The Club goes on to say that from its enquiries it



HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                     -29-




         appears that the crushing was caused by Tottenham supporters arriving late

         due to travelling problems and rushing to their places after the game had

         commenced, thereby causing problems to spectators at the front of the

         terracing who had been in the ground for a considerable length of time.

         The turnstile readings indicated 335 persons in excess of the

         capacity for Leppings Lane end which was the result of Tottenham fans

         having purchased tickets from Wolverhampton and on arrival at turnstile

         'N' (in Penistone Road) which was the Wolverhampton standing area, were

         directed by the Police to the other end of the ground where Tottenham fans

         ‘were standing.       Apparently, 30 spectators were treated by St. John

         Ambulance for minor ailments and        8   spectators were treated at the Royal

         Hallamshire and Northern General Hospitals.           According to the Police,

             three people had broken limbs, one had head grazing and another had

         unspecified injuries.          The Club finally commented that the crowd behaviour

             both inside and outside the stadium was very good.


   96.       On 22nd April, 1981 the Chief Executive of the County Council wrote

             (Document 37, page 146) to the Police asking for a copy of their report on

             the Semi-Final incident.


     #           Brownlow, the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, wrote to the

             Secretary of the Football Association on 3rd June, 1981 (Document 38,

             pages 147-148) commenting in detail on the incident at the match on       1 1 th


             April.   The Chief Constable starts by noting the basic facts relating to

             the stadium and indicating that there had been many similar Semi-Final

             matches at Hillsborough without previous incident.        The Police apparently

             envisaged difficulties prior to the match because both sets of supporters

             would need to use the Ml motorway.        There were a number of problems which

              slowed down the arrival of spectators, namely a major road accident, a

              coach breaking down and extensive road works.       *niese resulted in Tottenham

              Hotspur fans being held up on the motorway for some 90 minutes.       This all

              resulted in ".    .   .   a sudden influx of large numbers of football

HB5AAA/JJJ
                                                   -30-


         supporters to the area of the ground at around the time for the start of

         the match .      •     •"


  98.    Mr. Brownlow went on to indicate that Tottenham Hotspur supporters managed

         to obtain tickets from Wolverhampton.        He noted that this completely

         defeated the spectator policy which places the largest groups of standing

             supporters at opposite ends of the football ground.    Apparently, neither

         participating football club told the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield

         Wednesday, or the Football Association about this situation and the mixing

         of supporters was not properly catered for.        Some 400 Tottenham fans had

             to be removed from the kop and accommodated in the Leppings Lane end.


  99.    According to Mr. Brownlow the Tottenham Hotspur fans who had arrived early

             took up advantageous viewing points and refused to move to the centre of

             the Leppings Lane enclosure " . . .   thereby creating a jamming effect at

             the extremeties of it . .      The late arrivals then caused a problem

             because they rushed forward immediately upon entering after Tottenham

             Hotspur had scored an early goal.     The resulting injuries included broken

             arms, legs and crushed ribs.   It is noted that some 38 people received

             treatment.   The pitch perimeter gates at the front of the Leppings Lane

             enclosure were opened and spectators were allowed to go on to the

             perimeter track to relieve pressure.     Police Officers also refused access

             to the Leppings Lane enclosure to spectators waiting to get in, in view of

             the crushing problem.   In Mr. Brownlow's view, no other course of action

             could have been adopted in the interests of public safety.


  100.       Mr. Brownlow does note that the circumstances he outlines in the letter

             had been discussed at length and would be borne in mind in planning other

              similar events.

                      The installation of, and alterations to, the radial fences
                                     on the Leppings Lane terrace



          The 1981 Proposals

 101.     Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 2nd September,

          1981 (Document 39, pages 149— 150) indicating that ".      .    .   we have been

          instructed by the Club to organise the installation of two radial fences

          on the terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground .         .        It was

          noted that the intention of these fences was to divide the terrace into

          approximately three equal areas, each served by its own entrance.          The

          object of dividing the terrace was to exercise more control over

             supporters and for example, a visiting team with only a few followers

          would be allocated one section with the other two sections retained for

             home supporters.   A 1.15 metre wide gate was proposed at the rear of each

             fence, to give access for maintenance and also policing during the game.

             The gates could be left open, but fastened back to connect the areas

             during the game if appropriate.    In order to preserve spectators' views

             Eastwoods recommended that the top of the fence should be approximately

             1680 mm above the terrace.     It was noted that a fence of this height would

             not prevent individual spectators from climbing the fence, but it should

             eliminate a mass "invasion" from one area to another.       Apparently, fences

             of this height worked successfully at St.     James' Park (the Newcastle

             United ground).    The plans referred to in the letter are 3563/1 and 3563/2

             and 3.


  102.       On 9th September, 1981 (Document 40, page 51) Eastwoods wrote to the

             County Council indicating that radial barrier work is likely to begin in

             early October, subject to their being no objections from the Council.

             Eastwoods indicated that major changes to the proposed scheme should be

              received by 23rd September.


   103.      The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 11th September 1981 (Document

              41, page 152) considered the question of the proposed new radial barriers


HB5AAC/JJJ
         on the west terrace.        It was noted that there were drawbacks to the

         division of the terrace into approximately three equal areas, but the

         Working Party felt that increased control on the terrace should result.            A

         "for instance" was quoted in that there could well be problems with

         opposing fans mixing at the rear of the west stand and/or the final exit

         gates, but the Police considered that they could cope with these

         problems.


 104.    The adequacy and positioning of the gates at the rear of the radial

         barriers was discussed as well as the use of the existing gates in the

         pitch perimeter fence.        It was noted that the plans did not indicate the

         headroom which would be available at the rear of the terrace should the

             radial barriers and gates be installed.       The Working Party agreed that

             there was no objection to the proposals subject to further calculations as

             required by the Building Authority being satisfactory, confirmation of

             adequate headroom at the rear of the terrace and those gates being under

             Police control.   The County Council wrote to Eastwoods confirming the

             Working Party views on 14th September (Document 42, pages 154—155).         In a

             letter of 14th December, Eastwoods indicated that the works were now

             substantially complete (Document 43, page 156).


  105.       The South Yorkshire Police wrote (Document 44, pages 157-158) to the

             County Council on 18th January, 1982 about, amongst other things, the new

             radial fencing at Leppings Lane.     It is confirmed in the letter that the

             fences are working well.     It is commented that since there have been no

             games resulting in the whole of the terracing being occupied by one group

             of fans, the Police are unable to comment in that respect, but they

              foresee no problems.    The Chief Constable goes on to say that as existing

             barrier rails have been extended up to and completely through the new

              radial fencing, fans could climb over from one pen to another.       Also, it

              was noted that there were some ".    .   •   dangerous pieces .

              protruding from the cut off ends of some barrier rails.       The County

HB5AAC/JJJ
         Council wrote (Document 45, page 159)     to Eastwood and Partners indicating

         that the radial fences appear to be working satisfactory and also

         outlining the Police views on them.     Messrs.   Eastwood and Partners wrote

         back to the County Council on 26th January, 1982 (Document 46, pages

         161-163) accepting the possibility that fans could climb over the radial

         fence, but stating that it would be unacceptable to leave a gap along side

         each radial fence completely free of crush barriers as that would present

         a major hazard.      The Police comment on the dangerous pieces of rails is

         no ted.


         At an Officer Working Party meeting on 4th February, 1982 (Document 47,
 106.
         page 164) the Police views on the barriers was again discussed.      It was

         however, agreed that the existing arrangement was, on balance, preferable

          from a safety point of view to prevent crowd surge.     It was agreed to

          review the issue at the end of the current season.


          The 1985 Proposals

          Messrs. Eastwood & Partners wrote to the County Council on 9th April, 1985
 107 .
          (Document 48, page 167) indicating that the Club was anxious to segregate

          visiting teams' supporters as they entered the ground and also to enable

             the Police to control their exit at the end of the game.   A scheme showing

             a possible modification to the Leppings Lane end was prepared and shown on

             drawing 6705/2 which involved the construction the two new banks of

             turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new gates.


             The Officer Working Party considered these plans on 18th April
  108.
             1985 (Document 49, pages 168-169). They were agreed, subject to a number

             of conditions.


             Particular reference was made by the Working Party to the inclusion of two
  109.
             gates in the new central radial fence and a second gate in the radial

              fence dividing the neutral area and home supporters.

 HO.      On 30th April, 1985 (Document 50, page 170) the Fire Service wrote to the

          County Council indicating that from a means of escape point of view, the

          scheme was satisfactory, providing the gates had minimum widths as

          indicated on the plan enclosed with the letter.         The Fire Service also

          stated that it was understood that these gates will be supervised either

          by the Police or Club officials.       The County Council on 2nd May

          transmitted its views to Messrs.       Eastwood & Partners by letter.

          (Document 51, pages 171— 172).


 HI t     Eastwoods responded to the County Council s letter on        8   th May

             1985 (Document 52, page 173) and indicated that several of the points made

          had already been incorporated into the latest scheme.            Eastwoods say in

             the letter:- ".   .   •   However I would ask that further consideration

             should be given to the request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a

             second gate to be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial

             barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.      If these gates are

             meant for use in emergency it would mean having a steward in attendance on

             each occasion, the expense of which would hardly be justified.         It is our

             view that in the event of emergency , spectators can be evacuated quickly

             enough by the gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the

             rear.   We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the Fire

             Officer's staff should you so wish .        .   ."


  112.       The County Council sent a letter to Eastwoods on 10th May, 1985 (Document

             53, page 174) indicating that the Police were prepared to concede the

             request for two gates per radial fence in the right hand area of the

             Leppings Lane End Terrace, provided that the remainder of the points

             raised by the Officer Working Party were incorporated.


   113.      Subsequently, Eastwood & Partners submitted a further detailed proposal

              for a revised layout of the Leppings Lane end and related works on 25th
                                                  \


              July 1985 (Document 54, pages 175-^76). Fourteen plans were included in



HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                    -35-


        the submission and it was considered by a meeting of the Officer Working

        Party on 29th July 1985 (Document 55, pages 177-178). The Working Party

         accepted the proposals in principle, but made a number of comments which

        were transmitted to the Consulting Engineers by a letter of 30th July

         (Document 56, pages 179-180). The comments were made by reference to the

         plans submitted:-

         "(a)        Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress
                     purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

         "(b)        Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by turnstile 23 to be either
                     shortened or realigned so as to maintain the exit width between the
                     outer (river) wall and turnstile 23, and the exit width between
                     turnstile 16 and the new handrail not to be less than the width of
                     the roller shutter gate between turnstiles 16 and 17";

         "(f)        Plan No. 6705/12 -    . . . no objection in principle, but no barrier
                     height indicated .    . .";

         "(i)        Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency        egress
                     purposes, a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided";

         "(j)        Stewarding of new gates - as mentioned in my letter of 2nd May,
                     1985, it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by
                     stewards, who must be fit, able and properly trained".


         Eastwoods responded to the County Council's letter on 1st August (Document
 114.
             57   , pages 181-182) and indicated that it might be easier for discussions

             to take place when the works are under construction.           Eastwoods' letter

             made the following comment on (a) above "We are not sure of the location

             on the West terrace of the proposed extra security gate.           There is already

             a gate in the    2m   wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the

             police.     This same gate will still be available for the spectators in

             emergency as there are gates into the         2m   gap from the terrace which will

             be under the control of the police.       This point may perhaps be clarified

             during the Working Party's visit on 7th August".            It is also noted in the

              letter that the stewarding would "...         no doubt be taken care of by Mr.

              Chester ..." (the Sheffield Wednesday Club Secretary at that time).              A

              copy of the letter was sent to Mr.      Chester by Eastwoods.




HB5AAC/JJJ
         The Officer Working Party visited Hillsborough on 7th August 1985
115.
         (Document 58, pages 183-184) and noted the progress of works to segregate

         supporters at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and on the terrace.            The

         note states "On the Terrace itself, it was noted that there was an

         existing gate in the new      2m   wide gap formed by the new radial fence for

         use by the Police.      This gate would still be available for the use of

         spectators in an emergency as the gates at the top of the Terrace under

         the control of the Police would enable spectators to be directed down the

         2m wide gap.      However,   it was agreed that steps or a longer gate would be

         required.       It was also agreed that a new gate would be required from the

         new South Central Terrace Pen."         The Working Party agreed "(b) that the

         existing gate in the pitch perimeter fence should either be extended or

         have steps to provide easier access from the new two metre wide gap formed

         by the new radial fence; (c) that a new gate in the pitch perimeter fence

          should be provided from the south central terrace pen".        There are several

          other comments about general matters in the west terrace.



 116.     At a meeting at the Police Sports and Social Club at Niagra, Sheffield,

             the Officer Working Party on 13th November 1985 (Document 59, page 187)

             considered the Club's proposals in' relation to various projects at the

             stadium.    It was also noted that the Police reported on the continuing

             problems caused by the merging of spectators at the Leppings Lane end of

             the ground.    The Working Party noted that it was difficult to see how this

             could be overcome as the physical restraints to achieve this could

             conceivably be more of a danger than allowing the present situation to

             continue.


  117.       When Eastwoods were notified of these problems by the County Council in a

             letter of 14th November 1985 (Document 60, page 190)      in a response dated

             29th November, 1985 (Document 85, page 268) it was stated that they found

              it very difficult to envisage anything more which could be done at




HB5AAC/JJJ
           reasonable expense, as major work had been undertaken during the last

           close season.


  .8 .     The Officer Working Party at its inspection of Sheffield Wednesday on 22nd

           January, 1986 (Document 61, page 193) next considered the segregation

           arrangements at the Leppings Lane end.   The Police confirmed that the new

           arrangements worked well on by far the majority of occasions.    Other minor

           matters were referred to in relation to advertising hoardings, spalling

           concrete and the north west terrace.


           Other references to the Leppings Lane end of the Stadium 1980 to 1988

           1980


  119.     On 11th September, 1980 a report from Dr. Eastwood as to an inspection of

            the Hillsborough Football Stadium indicates that in the north west corner

           of the concrete terrace there are a number of cracks which have grown more

            pronounced in the past year. The recommendation is that the cracks should

           be sealed to prevent the reinforcement corroding.    (Document 62, pages

            194-195).


             1981

   120.      On 10th February, 1981 the Officer Working Party met (Document 63, pages

             196-198) to inspect the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium.   It was noted that

             the Club had received quotations for making good the cracking of the

             concrete at the north west terrace, which would be considered shortly.

             The Working Party also heard the Club outline the consideration it was

             giving to the siting of caravans outside the Penistone Road and Leppings

             Lane ends of the ground to sell tickets.   It was hoped that if this took

             place, increased entry flow of spectators to the ground would result by

             reducing delays at the turnstiles.


    121.     On 7th April, 1981 (Document 35, page 143) the Working Party noted that

              the cracking of the concreting at the north west terrace had been attended



HB5AAC/JJJ
         to by injecting material from the top.      The results had been satisfactory,

         except in two small areas where water seepage had taken place and

         they were to receive further attention.


         The next entry on the file relates to a visit of the Officer Working Party
 122.
         to Hillsborough on 8th June, 1981 (Document 64, page 200) at which some

         water seepage was again noted at the north west terrace.       There was also a

         note that the tie bars through the upper level concrete area to the rear

         had been protectively wrapped.

                                                                                 i
         1982

         The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 24th August, 1982 (Docunent 65
 j.23.
         pages 201-203) and a letter from Messrs.       Eastwood & Partners of 27th

         August, 1982 (Document 66, page 204) deal with some minor problems which

         did not apparently involve visitor spectators in the concrete at the north

         west terrace.     Similar problems were alluded to on 21st February, 1983 at

          a Working Party meeting.       (Document 67, page 206) On 8th September, 1982,

          Eastwoods submitted a certificate relating to their annual inspection of

             the Hillsborough Stadium (Document 68, pages 208-209) and it was noted

             that the two radial fences had been installed on the Leppings Lane

             terrace.


             1983

             The fact that the crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace had been
  124.
             tested was noted by the Officer Working Party on 11th August, 1983

             (Document 69, pages 210-213) which testing had completed the first cycle

             of crush barrier testing at the stadium.    There was also mention of water

             seepage again at the north west terrace.     On 29th August, 1983 (Document

             70, pages 214-215).   Dr.   Eastwood copied a letter to the County Council

             confirming the testing of crush barriers at the Leppings Lane End of the

             ground and amongst other things, certified that in his opinion "...      the

              various structures on the ground are in a satisfactory condition and are



HB5AAC/JJJ
            appropriate for the stadium to be used to the full capacity laid down in

            the Certificate of Ground Safety..."


            1984

 125.       The former A.R.P.     building adjacent to the boundary wall (near to Gate

            'C') of the Leppings Lane entrances to the stadium was in the process of

            being demolished when the Officer Working Party visited the stadium on

            29th February, 1984 (Document 71, pages 216-217). Once again, water

            seepage was noted on that day at the north west terrace.      In June, 1984

            the crush barriers at the north west corner were tested by the Club's

            Consulting Engineers (Eastwood & Partners) (Document 72, page 218 and

            Document 73, pages 219-228).


  126.       It was noted that there was some cracked brickwork at the rear of the west

             stand and that there were damaged angled support brackets to the pitchside

             security fence at the front of the Leppings Lane terrace, at an Officer

             Working Party inspection of the stadium on 9th August, 1984 (Document 74,

             page 229).   It was also noted that the wire mesh barriers on the north

             west terrace had been successfully test loaded.

             1985

    127 .    There was some discussion at an Officer Working Party meeting on 23rd

             January, 1985 (Document 75, pages 232-233) about the segregation of home

             and visiting supporters at the rear of the west stand at certain matches

             by erecting temporary barriers.     It was noted that it was the policy of

             the Police to aim for the exclusive use by visiting supporters of the west

             stand and terrace.     The Working Party agreed that the Club would consider

             a scheme for permanent barriers at the rear of the stand subject to the

             necessary approvals.      It was also noted that the cracked brickwork

             previously mentioned should continue to be monitored and that the apparent

             rusting of steel columns at the rear of the stand should receive

              appropriate treatment.

   128.       There are no other file references in respect of the Leppings Lane End      of

              the sports ground other than those dealt with    elsewhere in the statement.

              It should also be noted that inspections were    taking place on a

              regular basis throughout this period.


                               Further Comments on the Certificating System

              Further comments

   129. At the time the current Safety Certificate was issued, the terms and

              conditions contained therein were those thought by the South Yorkshire
   l


              County Council on the advice of the various interested parties to be

              necessary or expedient to secure reasonable safety of spectators at the

              sports ground.     There is no evidence from the files that the Certificate

              Holder or any other interested party has appealed to the Secretary of

              State (up to 1st January, 1988) or to a Magistrates' Court (thereafter) in

               respect of the Certificate Conditions.


       130.    Section 2(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) states that the Safety

               Certificate must have attached to it a plan and the terms and conditions

               shall be framed by reference to it, where appropriate.    Paragraph 5 of the

               General Safety Certificate refers to plans.    Under Schedule 1 of the

               Certificate, the definition of plans is "document or documents attached to

               and forming part of the General Safety Certificate and signed by the

               person signing the Certificate ...".     When the files were handed over to

               the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986 a copy of the General Safety

               Certificate for Hillsborough was in an envelope, together with a number of

               plans, none-of which were signed by Mr.     Mallett (the original signatory

               of the Certificate).    The original Safety Certificate and plans are lodged

               with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited (the Holder).


   131.        Under Section 3(3) of the 1975 Act applications for Certificates had to be

                 ,pied to the Police and the Building Authority.
               cot                                                  Sheffield Wednesday



HB5AAC/JJJ
          applied for a Safety Certificate on 8th September, 1978 (Document 6, pages

          45-48).    Copies of the application were sent to the Building Authority,

          the Police and the Fire Service on 13th September, 1978 (Document 76, page

          235, Document 77, page 236, Document 78, page 237).     There was no formal

          notice issued by the County Council requiring the Holder to supply further

          information to enable it (the Council) to determine the terms and

          conditions of the Certificate.     The matter was dealt with in lengthy

          correspondence and by consultation.


  132.    The amendment and replacement of Certificates is governed by Section 4 of

             the 1975 Act (as amended) and the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations

             1976, which were superceded on 1st January, 1988 by the Safety of Sports

          Grounds Regulations 1987 (Document 3, pages 30-35).


   133.      The 1975 Act (as amended) provides that a local authority may, if it feels

             it appropriate to do so, amend a Safety Certificate by notice in writing

             to its holder or replace it.   A Safety Certificate may be amended or

             replaced either with or without the application of the Holder of the

             Certificate.   Section 4(4) of the 1975 Act (as amended) indicates that a

             notice under Section 4(l)(a) amending a General Safety Certificate shall

             specify the date on which the amendment to which it relates is to come

             into operation, and the date so specified may be a date later than the

             date of issue of the notice.   The Regulations make further provision with

             regard to the amendment of the Certificates.   Regulation 5 provides that

             where a local authority issues or amends a Certificate it shall as soon as

             practicable give notice in writing of the issue or amendment . . .       to

             every interested party.   Xn addition, the local authority in giving

             notices must inform the persons to whom notice is given that a copy of the
                   *
             Safety Certificate and the application may be inspected and where and at

                   time such inspection may be made.   Xn addition, the local authority

             must publish a notice in a newspaper as soon as maybe after the

             decision including certain information.

  134.    On 3rd September, 1981 the South Yorkshire County Fire Service Committee

          resolved to amend the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club General Safety

          Certificate by replacing Conditions 10 and 26 of the Safety Certificate.

          The amended Condition 10 contains slight wording differences to the

          original.      Condition 26 varied the time limits in relation to

          electrical     certificates.   There is no evidence from the file that these

             revised conditions were in fact properly brought into effect.



  135.       At a meeting on 21st August, 1986 (Document 79, pages 238-239) the City

             Council's General Purposes Panel resolved to amend the capacity of the

             Spion Kop at Sheffield Wednesday    to 21,000 spectators.   The Panel agreed

             to amend the Certificate subject    to a number of conditions, one of

             which related to temporary additional stewarding to be provided until

             certain works on crush barriers on the new Spion Kop were completed.        This

             condition related to two matches.   The amendment to the Certificate only

             affected the capacity at the Spion Kop end of the ground.     The Inquiry has

             prompted a review of this amendment and it transpires that no notice was

             inserted in a newspaper in connection with this amendment.     The Panel's

             deliberations attracted considerable publicity and copy of       a reportin the

             'Star' newspaper of Friday, 22nd    August, 1986, is attached to this

             Statement (Document 80, page 240). Additionally, the General Safety

             Certificate is regarded as a public document and therefore the spirit of

             the legislation has been met.


   136.      On 1st December, 1986 the General Purposes Panel   resolved (Document 81,

             page 241)   to amend Schedule 1 of the Certificate so as to extend    the

             definition of specified activity to include Royal visits.     Again, the

             notice provisions of the legislation were not observed.



   137.      Under Section 5 of the 1975 Act (as amended) interested parties may appeal

              against or about the terms and conditions in a Certificate and the




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                 -43-


             Council's refusal to amend or replace it.   According to the files, there

             have been no appeals.


  138.       Under Section 8 of the 1975 Act (as amended), the Certificate Holder must

             give notice to the Council if he intends to alter or extend the sports

             ground or any of its installations (if that alteration or extension is

             likely to affect the safety of persons at the ground).     To the best of my

             knowledge, this Section has been complied with by Sheffield Wednesday

             Football Club; the developments which have taken place have been the

             subject of lengthy correspondence in each case.


   139.      The Council as Certificating Authority may issue a Prohibition Notice

             under Section 10 of the Act if it feels there is a serious risk to

             spectator safety.   No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of

             Sheffield Wednesday.


   140.      It is the duty of the Council under Section 10B(1) of the Act to arrange

             for the inspection of stadia at least once every 12 months.     At its

             meeting on 7th September, 1987 (Document 26, pages 128-130) the General

             Purposes Panel noted the details contained in a report by the Head of

             Administration and Legal Department about the operation of the Council's

             certification function for the safety of sports grounds.     One of the

             details mentioned in the report relates to inspections and the proposal

             that one large scale inspection per stadium should be carried out.        In

             fact the report itself does not make clear my intention that these

             inspections should be annual.   My intention at the time, and the Council's

             practice since has been to arrange annual inspections of sports grounds.

              The report goes on to indicate that these inspections would be backed up

             by a series of "during event" inspections which proposal was in line with

              both the Popplewell Report and with licensing practice in other areas.        I

              am aware that the Fire Service visit the sports ground during events and

              of course the Police are present during most specified activities.

                     The Safety Certificate

             141.   Under Condition 1(1) of the Safety Certificate, the Holder's nominee must

                     be approved in writing by the Council.


i            142.    Currently, the nominee is the Club Secretary.    On the 15th October, 1987,

                     the City Council wrote (Document 33, page 140) to Sheffield Wednesday
t

                     pointing out various provisions of the new Green Guide and making

                     particular reference to the appointment of a Safety Officer as defined in

                     Chapter 2 of'the Guide.    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic responded

                     to this letter on 23rd October (Document 34, page 141) and confirmed that

                     Mr.   Mackrell's duties encompassed those of the Safety Officer and

                     requesting that the Council's records be amended to note that he is

                     responsible for all matters of safety within the ground.



             143.    Under Condition 8(1) of the Certificate the Holder is required to provide

                     and maintain at the sports ground, to the satisfaction of the Council, a

                     suitably equipped first aid room.    The first aid room was installed and

                     noted by the Officer Working Party to be in use on 21st February, 1983

                     (Document 67, page 207).    The question of first aid facilities was raised

                     and discussed during 1987 and 1988 (Document 28, page 134 and Document 82,

                     pages 243-244).
    •    /
                     Sheffield Wednesday - The Up to Date Position

             144.    On Wednesday, 10th May, 1989 the pre-planned annual inspection of the

                     ground commenced involving Police Officers, Fire Officers and Council

                     Officers from the Health and Consumer Services Department, the Building

                     Surveyor's Division and the Administration and Legal Department.      Detailed

                     enquiries are being made of Sheffield Wednesday pursuant to the

                     inspection.




        HB5AAC/JJJ
                                      FURTHER GENERAL COMMENTS


         General Safety Certificate Conditions

 145.    A copy of the Safety Certificate and the Conditions which form part of it

             is attached to this Statement (Document 19, pages 103-112).        There are

             some 31 terms and conditions contained in Schedule 2 to the Certificate.

             The Holder is required to comply with various terms and conditions

             to the satisfaction of the Council, the Fire Officer or the Chief

             Constable as provided for in the particular condition.       Generally, for

             monitoring the ground the Council relies on annual inspections, during

             activity inspections and being notified by, for example,       the Club of any

             proposed development or the Police (as they are present during most

             specified activities) of any matter which causes them concern.        In

             addition, following the Home Office Circular 72/1987 (Document 4, pages

             36-43) the Council would (where practicable) obtain copies of relevant

             certificates of testing, etc.       on annual inspection.   I set out below my

             comments on certain of the conditions.


             Condition 3

  146.       This condition relates to the number of spectators who may be admitted to

             the various areas of the Stadium.       These restrictions on the numbers of

             spectators admitted to the Stadium are also referred to as capacities.


  147.       At the 1989 inspection a sample of the turnstile records was obtained.           It

             is understood that these records are available from the Club for past

             events.   There is reference on the file to individuals obtaining access to

             the ground with forged tickets (Document 38, page 148) and reference to

             numbers of people with tickets for the "opposing" end of the ground being

              removed to "their" end of the ground (Document 38, pages 147-148).        There

              is no evidence on file to suggest that the Club deliberately allow more

              people into the ground than is provided for in the certificate.
                                         \


              Paragraphs 27-29, 31, 34 and'-95 of my Statement refer to capacity on the
                                             V




HB5AAC/JJJ
         Leppings Lane Terrace and there are other references to capacities on the

         Spion Kop.        There have been no amendments to spectator capacities in

         respect of any part of the ground since the Spion Kop development in

         1986.


 148.    Questions have been raised about the adjustment to capacities in relation

         to the alterations to the Directors' Box in the South Stand and also in

         relation to the incorporation of facilities for people with disabilities

         in the North Stand.        There is no reference on file about any changes to

         the Directors' Box on the South Stand.        At no time during the discussions

             in relation to the new facilities    for the disabled was any   mention made of

         changes in capacity for the north        stand.   Had the question of capacity

             been an issue I would have expected the Advisory Group members to raise

             it.


             Condition 8

  149.       This Condition relates to first aid facilities and associated matters.


  150.       The County Council,   in 1979, approached the Area Health Authority for

             advice on first aid facilities at Sheffield Wednesday.      The Area Health

             Authority responded on 31st May, 1979 (Document 87, pages       271-273) with a

             list of requirements.    References are made in the list to     two or three

             treatment couches; six stretchers, two sets of stretcher wheels, 20

             blankets, six pillows and one "minute man" resuscitator.        Other comments

             are made about water requirements, lighting, etc.      On 15th August, 1979

             (Document 16, pages 93-95) the Officer Working Party requested the Club to

             provide a permanent first aid structure during the 1980 close season,

             subject to the Club agreeing to provide the recommended first aid

             equipment immediately.


  151.        On 21st December, 1979 (Document 88, page 274) the County Council wrote to

              Sheffield Wednesday indicating that the existing first aid facilities were

              accepted on an interim basis only pending the erection of purpose built

HB5AAC/JJJ
         facilites in the 1980 close season.      On 20th April, 1982 (Document 89,

         pages 276-277) the County Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday following

         an Officer Working Party meeting at which the Club's outline drawing for

         new Police and first aid facilities was considered.        As far as the first

         aid facilities were concerned, four comments were made in particular:-

              (a)    The walls of the first aid room should be lined with a suitable
                     non-combustible and easily cleaned material, which would not need to
                     be redecorated.

              (b)    Lockable storage facilities for blankets, stretchers, etc. were to be
                     provided.

              (c)    A telephone point was to be provided in the first aid room.

               (d)   The floor was to be of easily cleanable material (such as quarry
                     tiles, etc.)


 152.        The Officer Working Party at its meeting on 21st February, 1983

             (Docunent 67, page 207) noted that the new Police and first aid facilities

             under the north stand had been welcomed by the users and were proving to

             be most useful.


  153.       Following the interim Popplewell report, the County Council wrote to

             Sheffield Wednesday on 9th August, 1985 (Document 31, page 138) and drew

             attention to the necessity of providing adequate first aid and first aid

             room facilities.   Attention was also drawn to Condition 8 of the Safety

             Certificate.   In December, 1987 (Document 90, page 278 and Document 28,

             page 134) the City Council wrote to Sheffield Wednesday in response to the

             annual inspection which took place on 6th August, 1987.    It was noted on a

             schedule attached to the notification letter to Sheffield Wednesday that

             "The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate first aid

             equipment for the treatment of spectators .    .   ." It was also mentioned

             that the provision of qualified first aiders was being reviewed and the

             views of the Club on this subject were sought.



  154.        In a letter dated 15th January, 1988 (Document 82, pages 243-244) Messrs.

             Eastwood & Partners responded to the Council’s comments and noted the



HB5AAC/JJJ
         views expressed on first aid equipment.         They went on to say that the Club

         regularly liaise with St.      John Ambulance about manning levels and a

             sufficient number of first aiders is provided for each game in line with

             the recommendations given by the football league.


 155.        The Green Guide deals with the question of first aid in paragraph 29

             (Management Responsibility).   Paragraph (x) is "to provide first aid

             facilities and first aid staff".


             Paragraphs 50 and 143 of my Statement also refer to first aid facilities.


             Condition 8(2) requires that during every specified activity a doctor

             shall be available to attend at the first aid room if required.


             Condition 8(3) relates to the number of first aid assistants required to

             be in attendance at specified activities and the condition states that

             there must be one first aid assistant for every 2,000 spectators.      Neither

             the County Council nor the City Council have varied that ratio.


             Condition 9

  156.       This condition relates to stewarding and makes particular reference to

             fitness and capability to carry out   their duties, training and

             instruction, identifiable dress and   written instructions astotheir

             general duties.


             A schedule specifying the duties and responsibilities of safety stewards

             was handed to Club representatives on 10th April, 1980 at a meeting of the

             Officer Working Party (Document 98,   page 302).


             At a meeting of the Officer Working Party on 13thNovember, 1985      (Document

             5 9 , page 187) it was agreed that a draft booklet which had been prepared

             by the Police outlining the duties of safety stewards was acceptable and

              that it should be distributed to designated grounds for the information

              and guidance of stewards employed there.     Factors peculiar to particular



HB5AAC/JJJ
           grounds could of course be added if considered appropriate.

           Unfortunately, there is no copy of the booklet (which is identifiable as

             such) on the file.      The Police and the Fire Service are involved in annual

           briefing exercises for stewards and in addition there are tests of the

             emergency procedures which include the stewards duties.           I also understand

             that there are pre-match briefings of stewards.           There are two emergency

             evacuation procedure drills particularly referred to on the files; the

             first being mentioned at Paragraph 43 of my Statement.           Ihis relates to a

             test on 4th October, 1983 by the Fire Service.           The Fire Service stated

             that ". . . the stewards they questioned would have known what to do if

             this message had been heard . . ." (Document 21, page 118).


    157.     On 14th November, 1987      (Document 99, pages 305-306) the Police instigated

             a trial of the emergency evacuation procedure during a match and found

             there to be some deficiencies in the Public Address System which were

             subsequently reported to the Club.          Again,   there is no comment that the

             stewards' responses were in any way inadequate.


    158.     Paragraphs 43, 91,       92, 111, 113, 114, 171 and 191 of my Statement refer to

             stewarding.     There   has been no concern recently expressed about stewarding

(            at the Leppings Lane end of the sports ground, but the Building Surveyor

             did comment on the Spion Kop stewarding in a memorandum dated 2nd

             February, 1988 which was considered by the Safety of Sports Grounds

             Advisory Group on       23rd March, 1988.    It was indicated by the Police

             Representative at       that meeting that the point had been taken up with

              Sheffield Wednesday.      Some records of steward training were produced at

              the 1989 inspection of the ground and further details are being obtained.


              Condition 10

    159.      Condition 10 refers to the immediate and easy opening of final exit

              doors/gates, the manning of those doors/ gates by stewards and the opening

              of them at appropriate times.       The Police determine which doors/gates are



HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                 -50-


         opened/closed on match days and no complaints have been received from the

         Police or the Fire Service about this procedure.        Neither have there been

         complaints about the manning of doors/gates by stewards.         The final exit

         gates are subject to at least annual inspection by the Fire Service and

         occasionally by the Building Surveyor.         Other references in my Statement

             to the type of items covered by Condition 10 can be found at paragraphs

         43, 92, 103, 110 and 134.




             Condition 11(4)

 160.        This Condition refers to the maintenance of all means of ingress to and

             egress from the sports ground in good condition and free from obstruction.

             Generally these routes are checked both on annual inspection and during

             specified activities by the appropriate Advisory Group members.


             Condition 15(1)

  161.       This Condition relates to the structural parts of the sports ground which

             are required to be maintained in sound order and to the appropriate and

             relevant standards in the Guide, and in all cases to the satisfaction of

             the Council.


             Presumably when the County Council issued the Safety Certificate to

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd in December, 1979 it was satisfied

             (subject to compliance with certain conditions) that this ground was

             reasonably safe (Document 14, page 85).


             Various structural parts of the sports ground are also checked on

             inspection. It should be borne in mind that full structural surveys of

             buildings at the sports ground is rarely practicable in view of their

              considerable size.   Separate consideration is, of course, given to

              structural alterations at each sports ground as and when they are

              proposed.




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -51-


  162.       My Statement refers at some considerable length to structural matters.


  163.       As far as the Leppings Lane Terrace is concerned, it was subject     to a

             visual inspection by the Building Surveyor on the 1988 inspection.         The

             tunnel (connecting the Leppings Lane Terrace and the open area at the

             back of the West Stand) and the turnstile wall were inspected at that

             time.


             Condition 16

  164.       This Condition covers the maintenance of emergency equipment and     the

             maintenance, repair or renewal of any items within the Stadium as may from

             time to time be necessary.   There is also a requirement to maintain the

             operational parts of the Stadium in good and efficient working order.            The

             matters covered by this Condition are generally dealt with on annual

             inspections and by during event visits where appropriate.


             Condition 18(2)

  165.       Emergency vehicle access routes are covered by this Condition.       The Fire

             Service has commented on 16th May, 1979 (Document 13, page 84) that

             adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct access

             can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of the

             stadium.   They also mentioned that it was necessary to ensure that parked

             vehicles would not obstruct this access.    I understand from this

             letter that the Fire Service only require vehicular access to the exterior

             of each building in the football ground.    The emergency access routes are

             shown on plan 1610/11A.   The Officer Working Party at a meeting on 12th

             November, 1979 (Document 18, page 101) agreed that whilst no real problems

             had occurred in the past the Club would in consultation with the Fire

             Service and the Police mark out a lane from the main gates to the south

             stand in which parking would not be allowed.    It was also agreed that the

             hydrant outside the south stand would have to be kept clear.     The Police

             noted on 26th March, 1980 (Document 84, page 264) that they did not have


HB5AAC/JJJ
         an^ current problems in respect of the access for emergency vehicles.

         Access for ambulances is referred to at Document 87, page 273 and Document

         8 6 , page 269.   The reference in Document 86 is set out in greater detail

         be low.


         During the planning stage for the redevelopment of the kop, the Club
166.
         offered (letter from Eastwoods 29th November, 1985 - Document 85, page

         268) to widen the gangway between the North Stand and the retaining wall

         of the kop to enable fire engines to get to the front of all stands.       The

         Fire Service responded to this at an Officer Working Party meeting (22nd

         January, 1986 - Document 61, page 193) by saying that whilst they felt

         that such a facility was not essential for their purposes it could be

         useful for use by emergency vehicles in certain situations and generally

          should be supported.     In a letter from Eastwoods dated 18th December, 1986

          (Document 86 , pages 269-270) proposals were submitted for creating a new

          entrance to the Sports Hall off Penistone Road so that the public would no

             longer have to use gate 'O', (Plan numbers 7593/1 and 2).   Another purpose

          of the development was to provide separate access for Police vehicles,

             ambulances, etc.   on match days; the proposal effectively reduced dangers

             which could result from vehicles having to pass queueing spectators to
             gate
             'O'.   This development did take place.


             It is the responsibility of the Club to maintain these access routes, free
  167.
             of obstruction, and the emergency services have never indicated that there

             have been problems with them.   I would expect the Police (who are present

             during the majority of specified activities) to make appropriate comments

             should the lieed arise.


             1 understand that meetings have taken place between the Police, the Fire

             Service and the Ambulance Service on the emergency evacuation procedures

             at Sheffield Wednesday.    I assume those discussions dealt with the




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                     -53-


            emergency access of vehicles to the sports ground.        The City Council has

            had no direct contact with the Ambulance Service on this matter.


            Condition 24

 168.       This Condition relates to the engineers' annual inspection of the sports

            ground.     There is no record of any copies of Certificates being submitted

            in 1984-1987, but a copy of the 1988 Certificate (dated 2nd August 1988 -

            Document 100, page 307) was submitted on 10th May, 1989.        Previous

            Certificates were submitted for 1980 to 1983 - see Document 68 , pages

            208-209 and Document 70, pages 214-215 for examples.


            Condition 28

  169.          This Condition prescribes the various records which need to be kept by the

                Holder and produced to authorised officers on request.    The records kept

                under Condition 28(1),(2) and (3) were checked on 10th May, 1989 and

                subsequent enquiries about them are being made.    The checking of records

                under Condition 28(4) is not practicable,    due to the wide ranging scope

                of the condition.   However, all major work is inspected through specific

                applications or inspections.

                THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE
                WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO PENS 3 AND 4

  170,          In the earlier part of my statement (see paragraphs 101-118) I refer to

                the full history of discussions and decisions between the interested

                parties (the Police,    Fire Service, the Building Authority and   the Club,

                and its Consulting Engineers) leading up to and    following the   installation

                of the radial fences on the Leppings Lane terrace.     It will be recalled

                that the installation of fences took place in two distinct stages in 1981

                and 1985.   In relation to the 1981 proposals it is clear from the

                correspondence on file, which is particularly referred to in my statement,

                 that the fences were   erected only after careful and thorough consideration

                by the appropriately qualified experts.




HRSAAn/.T.T.T
         In early 1985 the Club, via their Consulting Engineers, Messrs.
171.
         Eastwoods & Partners, submitted proposals to alter the Leppings Lane end

         of the ground and to construct two new radial fences on the Leppings Lane

         terrace.     The reasons for the additional fences on the Leppings Lane

         terrace involved the better control of supporters.     Once again, full and

         careful consideration was given to the proposals by the County Council

         involving the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Authority, the Club

         and its Consulting Engineers.     Full details of the discussions dealing

         with the positioning, width and proposed stewarding of the gates in the

         radial fences are related in the earlier part of my statement.


         As far as the Green Guide is concerned, paragraphs 101 to 103 (in
 172.
         Chapter 8) refer to the division of spectator accommodation.      These

         paragraphs of the Guide are drafted in general terms.      There is no

         evidence on the file to suggest that the penning arrangements at Leppings

         Lane conflict with the general statements contained in the Guide.

          Obviously, the pens were constructed over a number of years, and were

             installed and approved in that situation by all the interested parties I

          have already listed.


             Crush Barriers on the Leppings Lane Terrace
             Layout

             The layout of the barriers was approved when the Certificate was issued on
  173.
             21st December, 1979.   The barrier layout must have been reviewed when the

             radial fences were installed in 1981 and 1985.


             On 7th August, 1986, the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was subject
  174.
             to an annual inspection.   During the course of this annual inspection I

             recall that the Police representative requested that crush barrier number

             144 be reduced so that the persons entering the terrace from the tunnel

             would not be obstructed by it.   Apparently, there had been some

             difficulties in this area.   Ihe barrier itself penetrated the central




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -55-


             radial fence immediately in front of the tunnel.       The barrier was indeed

             reduced with the result that barrier 144 now contains only one section,

             that is in the north central pen (see plan 1610/64E).       This issue was

             considered at the time of the inspection in the presence of

             representatives from the Fire Authority, the Police, the Building

             Authority and Messrs.   Eastwood & Partners, the Club's Consulting

             Engineers.   No problems with this revised barrier arrangement have been

             brought to my attention.


  175.       I should, however, point out that no written record of the decision to

             reduce the barrier is noted on the file.    I can, however, say that I

             remember the discussion and that none of the persons present objected to

             the reduction of the barrier.


             Strength

  176.       As far as the strength of the barriers is concerned, they were tested

             by Messrs.   Eastwood & Partners on 14th, 15th, 18th and 19th July, 1988

             and the report (Document 83, pages 246-249) is attached to this statement.

             There were one or two defects discovered on the test which are noted in

             Eastwoods'   letter which were remedied during 1988.     The barriers had also

             been tested in 1979 and 1983.


             Height

  177.       Prior to certification, it was brought to the attention of the Working

             Party (Document 9, page 66) that many of the barriers were below the

             height recommended in the Guide.    This was brought to the attention of the

             Club at a meeting on 2nd April, 1979 (Document 10, page 71), and was the

             subject of detailed discussion between Dr. Eastwood and the Building

             Surveyor.    As the ground was subsequently certificated by the County

             Council without requiring all the crush barriers to be replaced, I

             conclude that the Guide was applied flexibly as advised by the Home Office

             and that the Council were satisfied that the ground was reasonably safe.

          The Access Tunnel to the Leppings Lane Terrace

 178.     This tunnel which runs beneath the west terrace is not of a constant

          gradient and at the end increases to a gradient of 1:6 on the approach to

          the terrace itself.


 179.     The files in my possession indicate that there have been no

          discussions about the tunnel itself.        No complaints have been received

             about the tunnel.   As far as I am aware there have been no problems with

             the tunnel and as it has been used for many years by many thousands of

             spectators without apparent difficulty or incident.


             The Wall at the Leppings Lane Turnstiles

 180.     The wall at the turnstiles is approximately 14* high from ground       level to

             the coping stones and should prevent persons climbing into the ground in

             the majority of circumstances.


             Prohibition Notices in respect of Sheffield Wednesday

  181.    No Prohibition Notices have been issued in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday as there was no indication that there was a serious risk to

             spectators warranting such action.   The Inquiry will be aware that since

             the tragic events at Hillsborough the Leppings Lane end of the ground has

             been largely closed and certainly no spectators have been admitted to the

             terrace or to the west stand.


  182.       On 25th April, 1989 a meeting was held between the Club and the various

             officers and it was agreed that the next two football matches would be

             postponed as the Leppings Lane end of the ground was closed which

             prevented the efficient segregation of spectators and emergency

             evacuation.   It was agreed that reserve matches could go ahead as they

              have a limited number \>f spectators.


   183.       On 2nd May, 1989 there was a meeting held to discuss future games and

              on 4th May, various officers visited the sports ground to look at the
                                     V*
                                     \V
                                      \ "■


HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                  -57-


         pro posed plans for segregation, admission and evacuation of spectators

         for football matches.        It was agreed that matches could go ahead using

         part of the Leppings Lane end, but not the terraces or the stand.          The

         Leppings Lane end remains closed and will not be used for the time being.

             If it appears necessary to do so, the Council will consider issuing a

         Prohibition Notice to prevent the opening of the west terrace prior to the

             interim report of the Inquiry, as extra works required at the ground may

             then be determined.


             The Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987

  ’84.       Following the commencement of the Act, the existing delegations, etc.

             were felt to be sufficient and the matter was fully reviewed in a report

             to the General Purposes Panel in January, 1989.    The various delegations

             were then restated as far as it was necessary to do so.    On receipt of

             Home Office Circulars 71/1987 (Document 2, pages 17-29) and 72/1987

             (Document 4, pages 36-43) were circulated to all members of the Advisory

             Group.


             The Safety Certificate

  185.   The original 1979 Certificate is still in force in respect of Sheffield

             Wednesday.   Amendments to it are dealt with by letter and do not as such

             feature in the body of the Certificate.     Amendments to the Safety

             Certificate are dealt with in paragraphs 133-136 of my Statement.


             Directional Signs in relation to access to the ground

  186.   There has been criticism about the adequacy of directional signs within

             the sports ground which would direct people to pens other than the two

             central pens on the Leppings Lane terrace.     The point has been made that

             fans entering through turnstiles A to G or Gate C could only see the

              tunnel which leads to the two central pens and no other signs.    There is

              in fact one small directional sign to the right of the west stand which

              says "standing".




HB5AAC/JJJ
                                                   -58-


  187.       It is appropriate to point out that spectator flow on match days is a

             matter on which the Council would need to take advice, from the

             Club and members of the Advisory Group.      There is no record on any of the

             files that there was any suggestion of inadequacy in signing arrangements

             for the terrace at Leppings Lane and had it been a significant factor I

             would have expected that the matter would have been raised.      The provision

             of signing is not usually a complex or expensive task.


             Means of egress onto the pitch from Leppings Lane Terrace

  188.       There   is no clear record on the files as to when the pitch perimeter

             fence at Hillsborough was in fact installed, but it appears to have been

             in place when the County Council first looked at the sports ground from

             the point    of view of a Certificating Authority.


  189.       According    to the files, the pitch perimeter gates at Leppings Lane were

             considered in 1985 when the second radial barrier development plan was

             submitted.    It was agreed by the Officer Working Party and the Club and

             its representatives that one pitch perimeter fence gate was to be provided

             per pen.     (Document 49, pages 168-169, Document 55, pages 177-178 and

             Document 58, pages 183-185).


  190.       There   is no information on the files relating to whether or not the

             pitch perimeter gates should be signed.


  191.       The means    of access laterally between the pens on the Leppings Lane

              terrace are the gates at the top of each radial fence immediately adjacent

              to the west stand wall.    The gates are designed so that when they are

             open a clear 1.15 metre opening remains.      Manning of gates is dealt with

              in Document 50, page 170, Document 51, pages 171-172, Document 52,

              page 173, Document 53, page 174, Document 55, pages 177-178, Document 56,

              pages 179-180, Document 57, pages 181-182 and Document 58, pages 183-185.

 192.    There are no gangways as defined by the Guide on the Leppings Lane

             Terrace.   Annex 'A' of the Green Guide defines gangways as being channels

             for the passage of spectators through a terrace running across the slope

             (lateral gangway) or running with the slope (radial gangway).   Paragraph

             96 of the Guide indicates that the aim should be to ensure that every

             spectator on the terrace is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that

             they can move quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the

             event of an emergency.


   93.   All the proposed major alterations to the terraces have been considered by

             the Working Party and therefore subject to full and careful consideration

             by the interested parties.

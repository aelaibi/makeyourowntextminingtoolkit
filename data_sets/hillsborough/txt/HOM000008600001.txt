Mervyn Jonas may now have related to you the conversation 1 had with him
on the evening of 8 August, and I thought I would consolidate our
conversation by writing to you.

rhe natur* of the Inquiry has placed the South Yorkshire Police merely as
witnesses at the disposal of Lord Ju stice Taylor, and quite properly we
*14ve received no communication from the Vest Midlands Police officers
-tigaged in gathering evidence which would indicate th e ir views on issues
    they emerged.

My   Police Authority                  of complaint from Mr Trevor Hicks,
                           received a letfor
                                        .          ^agai ns t the Deputy
       Constable, Peter Hayes, for the comments he made following Chief
Superintendent Duckeafield's evidence to the Inquiry and the allegation
against him of untruthfulness, That is now with the Police Authority who
w ill decide on whatever course of action they feel appropriate in respect
of Mr Hayes. On receipt of the correspondence I regarded i t also as a
complaint against Mr Duckenfield, I caused the complaint to be recorded
and Mr K p D Cooper, A ssistant Chief Constable of Northamptonshire, has
been appointed to investigate the specific allegation of untruthfulness
levelled against Mr Duekenfield.

On receipt of Lord Justice Taylor's report I considered that the question
of crinrinal l i a b i l i t y needed to be addressed and I have asked the Director
of Put:          Prosecutions to give me his advice in th is regard, and that is
awaitec. If he considers that prima facie there i s evidence which
ju s ti f i e s police enquiries then I presume that the^e w ill be carried out
by members of your Force. This leaves the question of possible discipline
offences which may l ie B?r'nst one or more members of the South Yorkshire

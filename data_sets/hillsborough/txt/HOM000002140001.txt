                            THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



STATEMENT OF:    ALAN KEITH SEAMAN



OCCUPATION:      ASSISTANT CHIEF FIRE OFFICER




My name is Alan Keith Seaman.       I am employed by the South Yorkshire             County

Fire   Service   in   the   rank   of   Assistant   Chief   Fire Officer.       My major

reference is that of Fire Prevention/Safety, which amongst a great deal                  of

other matters, encompasses Safety at Sports Grounds.



I   have   been employed within the Fire Service for 23 years and I have been

involved with fire safety matters since April, 1973.



I have held my present post since February/ 1987.           Prior   to   that    I     held

several    specialist   Fire   Safety posts at both Divisional and Headquarters

levels within the Fire Service.



I am a member of the Institution of Fire Engineers.
                            SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975



1.    The involvement of the Fire Service in the implementation of the Safety

      of Sports Ground Act, 1975



1.1   The Safety of Sports Ground Act (SSGA) was passed in 1975 following the

      publication      in    1972 of the Report of the Inquiry into Crowd Safety at

      Sports Grounds which           was    prepared    by   Lord   Wheatley        following          the

      serious     accident     at     Xbrox    Park    Football     Ground    in        1971, when 66

      spectators were killed on a stairway.



      The Home Office issued Guidance to Local Authorities under cover of

      Home Officer Circular 150/1975.                                                                        Ex 1




1.2   The Safety of Sports Ground Act gave the Secretary of                       State        power    to

      require     through     designation orders that safety certificates be issued

      to sports stadia with accommodation for more                  than     10,000       spectators.

      The   intention       was     for the Act to come into force gradually through a

      phased programme of designation orders so as not to place an                             immediate

      financial burden on the smaller and less well off clubs.



1.3   The      first   order was made in August 1976 and applied to first division

       football clubs and          certain    international       grounds.        The    Home     Office

       issued     guidance    to     local    authorities     under       cover     of    Home Office

       Circular 130/76. Sheffield Wednesday's ground was designated in                            August     Ex 2

       1978,     although     the club was not in the fir at. division, beeavise of its

       quasi international use.            Gotsond    division    clubs    were         designated      in

       August     1979.      Third    and fourth division clubs and rugby league clubs

       were designated in August 1985, following the                  Bradford          City    Football

       Club fire.



                                           - 1 -
1.4   In 1976, the Home Office produced a voluntary code called the "Guide to

      Safety at Sports Grounds                 (Football)",       commonly       known      as    the     Green        Ex 3

      Guide.       This      gave     guidance        on    measures for improving the safety of

      spectators at sports grounds and extended the                           recommendations           of   the

      Wheatley      Report.          The      County Council later contacted the Home Office

      regarding the application of the Green Guide and had been informed that

      basically        any     new    work      or construction had to be of a                   standard not

      lower than that set out in the Green Guide but that maximum flexibility

      had to be maintained in the case of existing structures.



1.5   The     former South Yorkshire County Council, as the enforcing authority,

      delegated its powers and duties under the Safety of Sports                                  Ground     Act

      to     the   Fire       Service      Committee.        On 8th January, 1976, the Committee

      decided that           their    functions        should     be    exercised        through        Officer

      Working      Parties          for the     four        borough     council areas, consisting of

      representatives of the               police,         the   Fire    Service      and    the       building

      inspectors of the borough councils, with co-ordination being undertaken

      by David Vaughan who was the responsible officer of the                               Department        of

      Administration.               He also     took the chair and produced the minutes for

       all working party meetings.



1.6 In order to avoid duplication and                       division     of     resources,        a    primary

       authority        v;as    chosen        for   the      carrying     out    of    inspections,          reÂ­

       inspections, and          making        final       technical     recommendations           using     the;

       headings     given       in     the     contents summary of the Green Guide with soma

       additions.       The primary authority responsible was required                            to    confml',::

       the     other authorities concerned before finalising any recommendations.

       It will be seen from the echedula that the Fire Service were designated                                       Ex 4

       the     primary       authority        for   means of escape and fire precautions.                      By

       virtue of their general experience as a                        fire    and     emergency        service,

       they     were     able       to give     advice       on this subject.          However, the Fire

                                              - 2 -
      Service did not attend and have not                       attended       football     matches        as    a

      matter of course.



1.7   It was the practice for all disciplines to report to the Administration

      Department and thereafter for a joint meeting of                            the     Officer     Working

      Party    to    be         held    after     which       the    agreed     recommendations        of all

      disciplines were               amalgamated       into     a    report     by    the   Administration

      Department          and     sent to the club(s).              Copies of all correspondence and

      the minutes of meetings were sent to each member and                               all    arrangements

      for meetings were made by the Administration Department.




1.8   It    was     the         practice for the Officer Working Parties to carry out two

      inspections of the ground each year, commonly                            known     as "summer"            and

      "winter"       inspections.              It was Fire Service practice to be represented

      by officers          from        both    Divisional       and    Headquarters         levels    at        all

      meetings       and        inspections        whenever         possible.        This enabled a common

      standard to be applied.



1.9   With the abolition of the South Yorkshire County Council                                 on 1st April,

      1986 enforcement in South Yorkshire was to pass                            to the four

      Metropolitan              District        Councils,       Rotherham, Barnsley,           Doncaster and

      Sheffield.          The Local Government Act, 1985 amended Section 3 (3) of the

      Safety      of Sports Ground Act so that in future in metropolitan counties

      the local authority,                in    this    case        Sheffield    Metropolitan        Dist.ri.ct

      Council       was         required to        send a copy of any application for a Bafe.t.y

      certificate for a stadium to the chief officer of police and                                   the    fire

       authority      and        to     consult     them       about the terms and conditions to be

       included in the certificate.                    The Officer Working Party was replaced by

      the      Safety           of      Sports      Ground          Advisory     Group         comprising        of

       representatives from               police,       Fire     Service,       the    building      surveyors

                                               - 3 -
    division      and    the    Health    & Consumer Services Department of the local

    authority.      The Home Office issued guidance               on     the     new   arrangements

    under cover of Home Office Circular 7/1986.



1.10 On   18th    February,       1986, a memorandum from the Chief Fire Officer was                      Ex

     circulated to all five Fire Service                divisions       detailing      the    changes

     that were to take place under the Local Government Act 1985 and the way

     the administrative arrangements of the Safety                     of   Sports     Grounds     Act

     1975, would be affected.



     It stressed the importance of establishing and maintaining good liaison

     between divisions and District Councils who would                      be    responsible      for

     administering the Act.



1.11 A letter dated 24th February, 1986, was received from Sheffield City                                 Ex

     Council indicating that as the Council were to take over responsibility

     as the Licensing Authority under the                Safety     of      Sports     Grounds    Act,

     1975,   it     would      be of assistance to the Council and other Authorities

     for an informal meeting to be held to discuss both existing and                             future

     arrangements for administering the Act.



1.12 On the 5th March, 1986 Mr D Vaughan                arranged a joint meeting, for the

     24th    March,      1986 with the officers of the District Councils who would                        Ex

     be taking over responsibility for Sa.fety of Sports Grounds Act                          matters

     which    was       attended by officers from the police and Fire Service.                      Tha

     purpose of the meeting was to hand over the County Council's f.ilen                            and

     have    a    general      discussion       on Safety of Sports Grounds matters.                ThÂ«

      Fire Service said that they hoped the South                 Yorkshire          County   Council

      General     Safety       Certificate      would   be   adopted        by   all the districts

      because this would help            them    standardise      on     one     rather   than     four

      different sets of conditions.
1.13 In Sheffield the Administration and Legal Department became the

    responsible      department and Mr David Bownes was the responsible officer

    within the department.            In a letter dated 5th June, 1986, they attached                      Ex 9

    a   copy   of    a report which had been placed before the General Purposes

    panel on 6th May, 1986 together with a copy of the                      panel's     resolution

     in relation to that report.



    With   reference      to the Safety Certificate Conditions, the report noted

     that these were standardised throughout south Yorkshire and both police

     and   Fire     Service     had indicated that they wished this to continue for

     reasons of administrative simplicity.                    It then went on    to     state    that

     the   conditions     gave     some     cause       for    concern as they appeared to be

     inadequate or inappropriate in some areas.



     It was proposed to re-draft the Certificate Conditions after which                            the

     Sheffield      Wednesday     certificate          would    be   replaced.        The Sheffield

     United certificate could then be issued with the new conditions                            before

     the   start     of   the    1986/87         season. In the covering letter, Mr Bownes               Ex 9

     indicated that the re-drafting               of    the     certificate     conditions       would

     shortly be completed and the comments of the Fire Service would then be

     sought.



     The Panel was asked for authority for the present administrative system

     to be continued for the time being.



1.14 & meeting took place on 10th March, 1987 to deal with the future

     administration       of    the    Council's certification function.                The general      Ex 10

     feeling of the meeting was that the roles of                    each     authority    involved

     should be defined perhaps along the lines of the South Yorkshire County

     Council system.       This was described in a letter dated,                  14th May, 1987,

                                       -   5 -
        from     Mr D Bownes, which enclosed a draft division of responsibilities.

        The letter asked for comments on the proposals                         that,     inter       alia    the    Ex 11

        following        should   be     Fire    Service responsibilities fire precautions,

        fire alarms, means of escape, emergency lighting, stadium capacity.                                  It

        was    also      proposed      there    should     in     future       be   only one inspection

        annually.



    1.15 In a letter dated 7th July, 1987 the Fire Service:-                                                        Ex 12



         (a)   expressed the        view     that      division     of     responsibilities            between

               authorities          should      remain    along
                                                         lines      the                of     the     schedule
                                                       Ex 4

â¢              previously adopted and referred to in Para 1.6



         (b)     accepted the proposal of one inspection annually.



    1.16 At a meeting of the Advisory Group on 16th July, 1987,                             the     definition
                                                                                                                    Ex 13
        of     roles     was   discussed.         DO     Grimshaw       said    that    when determining

         capacity figures each discipline would have                      to    put    forward        figures.

         Those     of    the   Fire     Service        would    only be based on means of escape.

         Following those remarks, it was agreed that:



         (1) Roles should be broadly defined and responsibilities taken                                 on   by

                 the    appropriate of the three "lead authoritiesâ i.e. Police, Fire

                 and Building Surveyors subject, to agreement where overlap occurs.



                 Ml     contact with the        grounds        should    be    through       the     licantsj.uf;

                 authority.



                 Environmental Health would take a "general safety role" and not be

                 a "lead" authority.



                                             - 6 -
(2)   The annual inspection was to be a              joint   full    inspection        to   be

      carried out near the end of each season.



      D.P.   ("during    performanceâ)         inspections    were       to be done on an

      individual basis.       Prior arrangements were to            be    made      with    the

      Police,   but     not   the     Club.    The Licensing Authority were to be

      informed when an inspection had taken place.



(3)   The meeting was informed that legally the group                    was   an    advisory

      authority.      Only the council would be the ultimate decision making

      authority.



(4)   Individual authorities were to correspond with the sports                       grounds

      through   the     licensing authority who would subsequently circulate

      copies of all letters to each "lead" authority.



      Meetings of      the    group    would    be    held   at     irregular       intervals

      depending     on need and would be called by any member of the group.

      Individual authorities did not need to attend specific meetings if

      they had no "interest".



      Agendas were to be issued prior to each meeting.




                                - 7 -
    1.17 On   3rd   August,       1987,   a        draft   report    which    had been prepared for

         submission to the general purposes panel of the City Council                        was      sent   Ex   14

         to   the   Fire   Service.           In     that report, under the heading of "future

         administration of council certification function', it                    was       recommended

         that   the     "Safety     of    Sports Grounds Advisory Groupâ would serve as a

         forum for discussion between officers                 and    would    form   the     basis     of

         written      detailed     advice to the council.            It was also recommended that

         the roles of the various officers should be                   defined    along      the   lines

         discussed      at the meeting of the 16th July, 1987 and the point was made



â¢
         that there were extensive areas of potential overlap.

2.    History: 1978-1986

2.1   The South Yorkshire            County          Council        received         an     application        for     a

      General    Safety       Certificate             in    September,           1978.          The    club engaged

      Eastwood and Partners, a Sheffield based firm of                                    consulting        engineers

      as their consultants.



2.2   In     November    1978, the draft General Safety Certificate which had been

      prepared by the County Council following consultation with the                                          Officer

      Working     Parties      was        submitted         to      the    Fire        Service        Committee for

      approval to be used throughout the county.



2.3   On 2nd January, 1979, the Chief Fire Officer sent a memorandum                                          to     the

      Chief     Executive      of        South       Yorkshire           County      Council suggesting that                  Ex 15

      officers of the working                  party       undertake        a     comprehensive             survey    of

      Sheffield       Wednesday          Football          Club     in unison rather than separately.

      The Chief Fire Officer suggested that a copy                                of      the    report       of     each__

      department        be    provided          to     each       other department involved to enable

      problems to be discussed                  so     that       an     acceptable         approach        might      be

      determined        and    consolidated             into       a     single        report     which should be

      forwarded to the club.               The memorandum made several other                           observations

      regarding the standards necessary.



2.4    (i)    On 17th January, 1979                  the South Yorkshire County Council received
                                                                                                                              Ex 16
              a report prepared by Eastwood and Partners on ground                                     capacity        oÂ£

              Sheffield       Wednesday          Football          Club,        in     connection       with        their

              application          for     a    General        Safety       Certificate.                The        report

              indicated       that       the     Green        Guide       had been used as the basis for

              their     calculations,            although           as    with       probably         all     existing

              grounds,        it         would        not      be        possible         to    satisfy       all     the



                                               - 9 -
    recommendations in the guide and reasonable                    compromise        would    be

    needed.



(ii) Paragraph (b) of the report dealt with the west terrace (including

    the lower level at the north west corner but excluding                       the       north

    west     corner       reinforced concrete terrace).            The report considered

    that despite the fact that the full area of the west terrace could

    accommodate about 8,000 spectators, due to the lack of gangways an

    allowance should be made for circulation space in order that                             good

    packing could be achieved.              It further suggested that an allowance

     of 10% be made for this purpose, resulting in a suggested capacity

     for the west terrace of 7,200.



     Crush       barriers were to be designed to match the capacity of 7,200

     spectators and additional barriers and                   appropriate     strengthening

     of existing barriers would be provided for where necessary.



     Reference       is    also   made      to   the    evacuation     time     for the west

     terrace, this being about six minutes based on the                       exits    already

        available    and    also to the fact that some spectators would be 25m

        from an exit although movement along the terrace would be easy and

        quick.      The    existing   exits      were    through      the tunnel and round

        either side of the west stand.




(iii)        A meeting of the Officer            Working      Party    was    held    on     12th
                                                                                                    Ex 17
             February,       1979,    the    purpose     of    which    was to discuss the

             report prepared by Eastwood and Partners and to consider                         the

             views which should be put to the club.



                                  - 10 -
         With     regard      to the west terrace, it was considered that due

         to the lack of depth of the terrace, the offer to reduce                               the

         spectator       limit       to     7,200     and with a discharge time of 6.6

         minutes it would have been                  unreasonable     to     insist       on    the

         provision       of    gangways or additional exits.                 There was total

         movement laterally               throughout     the    terrace      and    the        three

         entrance/exits            from     the terrace were well situated.                At the

         time, the worst disaster/emergency contemplated                        was       one     of

         fire.      As     the      west     stand     provided a minimum of fire risk

         (because it was constructed in concrete) it was accepted that

         these routes would be available and adequate in an emergency.

         The existing gates in the perimeter fence were discounted for

         means     of    escape          purposes.      At     that time the gates in the

         perimeter       fence       were     considered        to   be    there        for      the

         convenience          of    the     police     for     crowd control purposes and

         suitable as a means of egress for a relatively                        small          number

         of spectators in the event of a localised incident.



         It was noted that, subject to existing crush barriers passing

         the tests, they would require special attention                           in    view     of

         the apparent sharp edges and corrosion.




(iv) On 2nd April, 1979, a meeting was held between the Officer Working                                Ex 18

    Party and the club to discuss the views                     of   the    Officer       Working

    Party in respect of the report submitted by Eastwood and Partners.



    As   far     as the west terrace was concerned, it was agreed that the

    club's proposal for additional barriers and reductions in capacity

    to   7,200    without          the    need   for    additional         gangways should be

                                   - 11 -
      implemented.         The    question     of    the        condition    of   some    of     the

      existing       barriers         and the stepping arrangement on the north west

      corner exit would be the subject of detailed                      discussions       between

      Dr Eastwood and the Building Surveyor.



(v)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club was held on 18th April, 1979 during which                            the    club

      accepted       that       the    stepping arrangement on the north west corner

      exit should be rebuilt.               The matters concerning the crush barriers

      were    to     be     reconsidered       after    it       was seen which of the crush

      barriers failed on testing.



(vi) On 1st May, 1979, the City of Sheffield Building                         Surveyors        wrote

      to     South      Yorkshire       County Council and summarised in the letter,

      their own requirements in relation to matters discussed at                               recent

      meetings.           The    Building     Surveyor indicated that, subject to the

      downward slope of exit steps at the north west corner                            exit     being

      corrected and the capacity being restricted to that agreed between

      the police and the              club,   that     department       considered       the     west

      terrace to be acceptable.



(vii)On 16th May, 1979, the South Yorkshire County Fire Service wrote

      to South Yorkshire City Council, enclosing plans numbered 1610/12,

       1610/11, 1610/9A, 1610/8A, 1610/7A,                   1610/6A,       1610/4A,     1610/2XA,

       1610/lXA and a recommendation of work schedule to be undertaken.



       With    regard to exit routes from the west and north west terraces,

       these were considered to be satisfactory.



       The provision of exit signs was required in the work schedule, the

       siting      of     which       was   indicated      on    the   plans.     There        was no
            requirement for such signs on the west terrace                      exits.        This   was

            because     they were the ones used for normal entrance and exit from

            what was an open terrace.               Further, none       were    required       for   the

            perimeter     fence       gates.        These were not       normal exit routes.          To

            have   exit       signs    for     these    gates    could     cause        problems     and

            confusion.



            The    schedule also detailed that adequate roads should be provided

            to ensure that speedy and               direct    access     could     be    obtained     by

            emergency     vehicles       to all exterior parts of the stadium and that

            it had to be ensured             that    parked     vehicles       would    not    obstruct

            emergency vehicles on these access roads.



      (viii)On the 8th June, 1979, South Yorkshire County Council sent a
                                                                                                            Ex 23
             memorandum to the Chief Fire officer, enclosing the work schedule

            forwarded to Sheffield Wednesday                  Football     Club    which      had    been

            collated      from    the    detailed       comments of the various disciplines

            represented on the Working Party.



      (ix) A meeting of the Officer Working Party and the Sheffield Wednesday

            Football      Club    was    held       on 12th November 1979 when it was noted                 Ex 2J\

            that work detailed in the schedule dated 8th June                          1979   had    been

            carried out as far as the west terrace was concerned.



2.5   The   General      Safety       Certificate      in     respect    of     Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club with plans attached was issued with                        conditions      on    21st
                                                                                                            Ex 25
      December,       1979.    The club's attention was drawn, in particular, to the

      following conditions:



      8(1) acceptance of existing first aid facilities on an interim

             basis only

                                         - 13 -
      12(1) arrangements for emergency lighting in the south stand being

             only acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life.



      14     acceptance of police facilities on an interim basis only.



      30     no spectators being allowed to use the stadium                      in     conditions     of

             extreme wind and/or snow loadings.



             The     Fire    Services'       plans   were     sent    to South Yorkshire County

             Council for duplication and for                attachment      to    the     certificate.
                                                                                                            Ex 26
             Copies were returned to the Fire Service on the 4th February 1980.                             Ex 27




2.6    (i)   On     the     14th    March,    1980, South Yorkshire County Council sent a                   Ex 28

             memorandum to the Chief Fire Officer                    stating     that     despite     the

             fact     that     the    certificate     had    been issued as recently as 21st

             December, it was felt that the Sheffield District Officer                           Working

             Party would have to review the situation due to the pending FA Cup

              semi-final between Arsenal and            Liverpool        on      12th   April,      1980.

             Comments        were    requested on any outstanding matters for which the

              Fire Service had primary responsibility.



       (ii) On the 20th March, 1980, Stn.O. Davies sent a                        memorandum      to   the
                                                                                                            Ex 29
              Chief       Fire Officer       detailing areas of concern that were revealed

              during an inspection of the ground on                  12th     March,     1980.      These

              included:-



              (a)     training of stewards

              (b)     exit    signs not being of the required standard as detailed in

                      schedule II of the certificate.



                                         - 14 -
      (c)     non provision of fire alarm systems as required                    by    Schedule

              II of the certificate



(iii)On the 26th March, 1980, the Chief Fire officer sent a memorandum

      to     South      Yorkshire    County Council detailing what was set out in                   Ex 30

      the memorandum referred to at 2.6(ii) above.



(iv) On the 31st March, 1980, South Yorkshire County Council wrote                             to
                                                                                                    Ex 31
      Sheffield         Wednesday    Football        Club detailing what was set out in

      the memorandum to South Yorkshire County Council                      referred    to     at

      2.6(iii)       above.       Additional        observations    made    by the Building

      Surveyor were also included in this letter.



(v)   On    the   3rd     April,     1980    Sheffield     Wednesday        Football         Club
                                                                                                    Ex 32
      acknowledged         receipt    of     the    letter from South Yorkshire County

      Council referred to at 2.6(iv) above.                An explanation        as    to     the

      lack    of training of stewards was given stating that this would be

      undertaken on completion of the fire alarm                   system    which     was     in

      hand.       All     other    matters     in    the letter of the 31st March were

(vii)A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club was held on 10th April, 1980 to discuss the areas of                            Ex 3 4


      concern recently communicated to the club and in view                      of    the    FA

      Cup Semi-final to be held on 12th April, 1980.                  The points covered

      by the letters from Eastwood and Partners on 4th                     and   8th    April,

                                   - 15 -
           were    discussed       and as far as training of the safety stewards was

           concerned it was agreed that there was little point until the fire

           warning       system    had    been     completely       installed.       It     was noted

           however that the         Fire       Service   had    given      instruction       to       some

           stewards.



2.7   On   the 3rd September, 1980 South Yorkshire County Council wrote to the

      Chief Constable outlining the concern of the                    Chief   Executive          of    the

      police policy of locking away supporters inside grounds until such time

      as home supporters had cleared the area and suggesting that instead                               of

      being   allowed to approach locked gates at the end of a match, the away

      supporters should be held back in a relatively safe place, such                             as    on

      the terrace.



      Concern     was    also     expressed      at modifications being made at Sheffield

      Wednesday Football Club at the               request     of   the    police,    without          the

      knowledge of the Officer Working Party.



2.8   On   the    16th    January,       1981,     Eastwood     and    Partners      wrote to South

      Yorkshire     County      Fire     Service     confirming       that    the      fire           alarm   Ex 36

      installation       and    modifications        to the public address system had been

      completed during July 1980.

       Club was held on 7th April, 1981 the purpose of which was to review the

       ground due to the pending FA cup semi-final to be held on                          11th    April,

       1981. Consultations between South Yorkshire County Fire Service and the

       police had resulted in            the    production     of     an   "Emergency       Evacuation

       Procedure".       The club undertook to circulate copies of the procedure to
                                                                                                               Ex 38

       A copy    of       the    procedure        is    produced     dated      12th   May, 1981.         The

       procedure          detailed     the    signal      to     be adopted to inform stewards and

       police that an emergency had arisen and the actions to be                               followed       on

       hearing further announcements over the public address system.




2.10   A meeting of the Officer Working Party and Sheffield Wednesday Football

       Club     was       held   on    8th    June,      1981.       It   was    noted    that following           Ex 39

       experiences          at   the    FA    Cup        Semi-Final       in April,      the    club      were

       considering          revised arrangements on the terracing in front of the west

       stand and that the Officer Working Party would be consulted when                                 these

       had substance.



2.11   (i)            On    2nd September, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to South
                                                                                                                   Ex 40
                      Yorkshire County Council detailing                   the    club's       proposal       to

                      instal two radial fences on the west terrace in such a manner

                      that the terrace would be divided                   into    approximately         three

                      equal areas, each served by its own entrance.                        The aim was to

                      achieve more control over supporters, a                     visiting       team     with

                      only       a    few supporters being allocated one section, with the

                      other two sections retained by the home supporters.



                      Larger         contingents          of     visiting       supporterscould          be

                      accommodated           in   two    or    all    three      areas as their numbers

                      dictated.        A 1.15 metre gate was proposed at the rear of each

                      fence.



        (ii)          A    meeting      of    the      Officer     Working      Party was held on 11th

                      September, 1981, toconsider the proposed erection of                              radial     Ex 4 1


                      barriers on the west terrace for crowd control purposes.




                                              - 17 -
        Whilst      there were reservations due to problems with opposing

        fans mixing at the rear of the west stand,                  the    police        felt

        that     they could cope with any problems of this nature and as

        they felt that increased control on the terrace should result

        from      the    proposals,     the     Officer   Working         Party    saw    no

        objections to their implementation.



        The adequacy and positioning of the gates to be installed                          at

        the rear of the radial barriers was discussed, as was the use

        of the existing gates in the pitch perimeter fence.                        It    was

        agreed      that   Messrs Eastwood and Partners be notified of the

        Officer Working Party's decision which was subject to:-



        a)     further calculations required by the Building                  Authority

               being satisfactory



        b)     the adequacy of headroom in the vicinity of the proposed

               gates at the rear of the terrace               and



        c)     the new gates at the rear           of   the    terrace      also    being

               under police control.



               It    was clearly understood by the representatives of the

               Fire Service that these gates would be constantly manned

               and      they   would    not     have approved the proposal if the

               situation was to be otherwise. Again, at this time,                       the

               perimeter        fence   gates    were never contemplated for use

               for mass evacuation on to the pitch.



(iii)   On 14th September, 1981, South Yorkshire County Council wrote

        to Eastwood & Partners welcoming the increased control on the                           Ex 42

        radial      barriers       but         pointing out      the reservations of          the

        Officer Working Party                  and     the conditions      referred     to     in

        2 .11(ii)        above     that        theapproval of the scheme was subject

        to.



(iv)    On 14th December, 1981, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                            South

        Yorkshire        County      Council          declaring that work on the radial

        fences was substantially complete.                     Whilst this had not           been   Ex 43


        previously        brought         to    the attention of the Officer Working

        Party,      there had been three first team home games since                         the

        fences had been erected and the police had inspected the work

        and were satisfied with the new arrangements.



(v)     On the 23rd        December,           1981,     the     Chief    Executive      (South

        Yorkshire County Council) sent a memorandum to the Chief Fire
                                                                                                    Ex 44
        Officer      requesting our confirmation that the                     radial     fences

        were satisfactory.



(vi)    On    the    8th     January,          1982     the    Chief     Fire Officer sent a

        memorandum to the Chief                 Executive       (South    Yorkshire      County     Ex 45

        Council)         dated     8th January, 1982 confirming that the radial

        fences were considered to be satisfactory.



(vii)   On the 20th January, 1982, South Yorkshire County Council

        wrote to Eastwood and Partners                    commenting on the fact that
                                                                                                    Ex 46
        the matches played at the stadium since the                         installation      of

        the    barriers confirmed that they appeared to be working well

        and    satisfactorily             effected       the    segregation       of   opposing

        groups      of     fans.      It       was     noted   however,     that the entire



                                 - 19 -
              section of the terrace had yet to be given to                        one        group    of

              fans.



              There   was     also      comment from the police that existing crush

              barriers      extended         up    to   and     completely       through           radial

              barriers      at    a    height       of 4'6" or so, thus enabling fans to

              easily climb over the radial barrier into adjacent pens.




     (viii)   On 26th January, 1982 Eastwood                   &    Partners     wrote        to    South
                                                                                                            Ex **7
              Yorkshire      County Council replying to the police observations

              with regard to crush barriers being up                      to     and    through       the

              radial barriers.



              Mr   Eastwood       observed         that if the crush barriers were to be

              removed up to a distance of 1.2m from                      the     radial       barriers,

              there   would       be     a    consequent           loss of calculated spectator

              capacity which is undesirable from the club's point of                                view.

              However,      from       the    point of view of safety, a strip of that

              width without a single crush barrier would be a major hazard.

                                                                                                            Ex **8
              Wednesday      Football          Club     was     held on 4th February, 1982 in

              order to       discuss         the   apparent         difference     of     opinion      on

              certain     aspects        of the radial barriers on the west terrace,

              these being the observations of the                       police    in     relation      to

              crush barriers passing- adjacent to the new radial barriers.



              It    was   agreed        that,      on    balance, it was preferable from a

              safety point of view to prevent crowd surge by                            the    existing

              barriers       being      extended up to and/or through the new radial



                                      - 20 -
              barriers than to completely prevent                       persons       being        able    to

              climb from one pen to another.




2.12   i)     a     meeting        of    the        Officer       Working   Party          and    Sheffield

              Wednesday Football Club was held on 23rd                          January,          1985,     in   Ex **9

              order to carry out the winter inspection of the stadium.



              The     club recalled the practice followed in consultation with

              the police of separating home and visiting supporters at                                    the

              rear     of     the       west        stand    at     certain matches (such as with

              Liverpool) by             erecting        of    temporary        barriers.          This    had

              worked        well    but        in     all    other normal occasions it was the

              policy of the police to aim for                        exclusive       use     by    visiting

              supporters           of the west stand and terrace. On those occasions

              when the number of visiting                     supporters       was     small       and    the

              weather        was     inclement, it was considered desirable to allow

              home supporters access to a sheltered area.



              It was agreed that the club                      would     consider atsome           future

              date,     a     scheme       for        permanent       barriers at the rear of the

              stand.



       (ii)   On the 9th April, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                                     South

              Yorkshire        County          Council,       enclosing        sketch       plan    6705/2,
                                                                                                                  Ex 50
              stating that the club was anxious to segregate                                the    visiting

              team's        supporters          as     they       entered   the ground and also to

              enable the police to control their exit at the end of a game.

              The     scheme        involved          the     construction       of two new banks of

              turnstiles and various runs                         of fencing    and new gates.              It

              provided        for       separate        turnstiles for the            three        sectionsof

              the west terrace that then existed.

(iii)   A meeting of the Officer                Working       Party      was   held    on       18th
                                                                                                       Ex 5 1
        April,     1985      to discuss the proposals for segregation at the

        Leppings Lane end.



        The police were            already         familiar    with      the   proposals         and

        indicated      that      they        had     instigated       them because of their

        desire to allow greater flexibility in the use of the terrace

        and    stand by both home and away supporters, allowing them to

        vary the neutral area between opposing fans as                          circumstances

        dictated       and    to     achieve such arrangements for ingress that

        would allow turnstiles to be dedicated to specific areas.



        At the meeting, the police suggested                       the    provision       of    two

        further radial fences, one dividing the existing central area

        in half and running from the tunnel                     entrance       to   the     pitch

        side     security       fence        with     gates     to permit entry to either

        section as appropriate, theother dividing the existing north

        end      of the terrace in half and running from the front to the

        back of the terrace.



        In addition, the two new pens created by the provision of the

        radial     fences were to be provided with additional exit gates

        through the pitch perimeter fence, the new                         radial     fence       at

        the    north      end      of    the       terrace    to    have two gates and the

        existing radial fence to the north side of the tunnel to have

        a second gate.



        The    provision        of      the second gate in each of the two radial

        fences to the north of the tunnel was to allow police                               access

        to       all    parts           of     the    terrace      to    control      any      crowd

                                - 22 -
disturbances.         It was felt by the Fire Service however,                           that

only     one       gate in each fence would be necessary for means of

escape.



If the above features were implemented, the                           proposed        radial

barrier        running    parallel       and     2    metres          from the existing

barrier at the north end of the terrace                      could          be    dispensed

with     as    the    police     felt     that       they    would have more than

adequate control for segregation purposes with                              the    creation

of     the     smaller pens.      The creation of smaller pens was also

seen by the police to be a bonus in that                         by    having       smaller

sections       of    crowd,     their job in maintaining order would be

made easier.



At the meeting, the revised              proposals          outlined          above      were

sketched       on    to   the    drawing        by    Hr    Grimshaw, of the Fire

Service and the main concern he expressed was                                                   Ex 50



(a) whether the external gates and exit routes created at the

rear     of    the    stand     would    be      adequate        for the numbers of

spectators in each section of the west stand and terrace,



(b) whether the numbers of spectators being allowed into each

section       of    the   terrace       could    be     controlled           to     prevent

overcrowding, and



(c) what arrangements were to be                 made       to    ensure          that   the

gates in the radial fences would be readily available for use

should lateral movement           along        the    terrace          to    alternative

exits become necessary.



                      - 23 -
Items     (b)      and (c) above were specifically put to the police

as they, along with the club, were responsible                               for    ensuring

that     emergency          evacuation            procedures       were      adequate         and

controlled and had              experience          with    the      club     of    ensuring

correct       crowd       density       packing.         The assurance was given by

the police that all the gates included in the                               proposals         for

the terrace part of the scheme would be manned by them at all

times during games in order that evacuation procedures                                      could

be initiated should this become necessary.                             As far as correct

density       packing       was     concerned,           the    police       stated          that

arrangements           that     they     had with the club were satisfactory

and they felt that the provision of smaller sections                                    on    the

terraces would make overall control of the terrace easier.




In     the    light       of    these assurances, the Fire Service saw no

objections in principle to the proposals subject                               to       a    more

detailed investigation of the means of escape aspects.



It      was       agreed       that     R    Grimshaw          (Fire    Service)            should

 investigate as a              matter       of    urgency      the     means       of       escape

 aspects          of    the      proposals         and     subject      to     satisfactory

 clearance of these matters, the outline                          proposals         submitted

would        be    agreed       as now amended by the suggestions of South

 Yorkshire Police and, to                   the    submission          of    the    necessary

 detailed         plans     and    calculations            under       both the Safety of

 Sports Grounds Act and Building Regulations.
(iv)   (a)   On examination of the plan              by    the   Fire     Service,       the
                                                                                               Ex 5 0
             width    of    the     exit     gates    to    allow for the number of

             spectators that it was anticipated would                   use    them      was

             calculated       and it was decided that the gates would have

             to be supervised by either the police or club officials.

             With    regard       to the terracing arrangements, it was felt

             that the proposal for the new radial fence at the tunnel

             position      had      little    effect on the existing situation.

             The capacities, travel distances and                  exit    arrangements

             from the two new central pens did not change.                       In fact a

             new gate through the pitch perimeter                  fence      was   to    be

             provided.           The new radial fence at the north end of the

             terrace       did     actually    slightly      increase      the      travel

             distance to the normal route of exit i.e. the way across

             the terrace otherwise there was no change.



       (b)   It was not thought necessary to                sign    any    exit     routes

             because:



             (i)     the    principle        ingress/egress        route would be that

                     already familiar to users, and

             (ii) radial fence gates would be manned by police or

                     stewards on the spot.



       (c)   The gates through the perimeter fence were considered to

             be     necessary,       this     being reflected by the request for

             two additional gates in the newly created pens.                        The use

             of     the gates was under the direct control of the police

             and was to allow their access into                  the    terrace      should

             any     disturbance arise and to relieve any local build up

             of pressure at the front of the pens or allow any person

                            - 25 -
            becoming       ill    or    overcome to be removed by that route.

            The police, had always been happy that                         the    gates           were

            adequate for these purposes.



      (d)   It    was never considered that the gates in the perimeter

            fence would be used for the                  evacuation of each                  section

            because        (i)    the   risk    of       fire     in the west stand and

            terrace was low and (ii)                it   was    considered                 that       the

            height     and       strength      of    walls      and    gates outside the

            Leppings Lane end. were such that the                      risk           of     a     door

            being     forced       or   the     walls      scaled      and        fans thereby

            entering in large numbers was remote.                      At        no        time       was

            there any suggestion to the contrary.



            If      any      situation         arose       that       necessitated                total

            evacuation of the central pens this would in                               the        first

            instance be by way of the normal route on to the terrace

            i.e. the tunnel.            Should the tunnel             be    obstructed                for

            any     reason,       the   gates       in the radial fences                    would be

            used as directed by the police with                       the    assistance                of

            the public address system.




(v)   On    the 30th April, 1985, South Yorkshire County Fire Service

      wrote to South Yorkshire County Council                       indicating that                   the   Ex 52

      new     crowd        control      arrangements         were      considered                to    be

      satisfactory providing             that       certain     gates       had        widths          ao

      indicated       on    the    plan     attached to the letter and that the

      gates would be supervised by either police or club officials.




                             - 26 -
(vi)     On the 2nd May, 1985, South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

         Eastwood and Partners             indicating that the proposals outlined
                                                                                                  Ex 5 3
         for crowd      control      arrangements          were    generally      acceptable

         subject to       points a - d set out in the Officer Working Party

         minutes dated 18th April, 1985, and (v) above.




(vii)    On the 8th may, 1985,             Eastwood and Partners wrote to South

         Yorkshire County Council             acknowledging the comments of the

         Officer       Working       Party      but        requesting       that      further
                                                                                                  Ex 51*
         consideration be given to the requirement for the second gate

         in the two radial fences since if they were meant for use                           in

         an     emergency it would mean having a steward in attendance on

         each    occasion,         the   expense      of    which    would       hardly     be

         justified.



(viii)   On     10th   May, 1985,        South Yorkshire County Council wrote to

         Eastwood and Partners             indicating       that    the    two     additional     Ex 55

         gates     were      included      primarily at the request of the police

         who had indicated that they               were     prepared       to    concede    the

         request       for   the     two    additional gates subject to all other

         points raised by the Officer Working Party being incorporated

         into the proposals.



 (ix)    On 18th July, 1985 South Yorkshire County Council wrote to
                                                                                                  Ex 56
         Eastwood and Partners             noting that the Chief Executive (South

         Yorkshire        County     Council)      had     been     made    aware    of     the

          application        for    Building    Regulation/planning              approval    in

          respect of the re-organisation of fences at the Leppings Lane

          end and other matters.

        On    the     19th July, 1985, Stn.O Ryder noted                 that plans which

        had been submitted to Sheffield                City      Council    for        Building          Ex 57

        Regulation approval were different to those discussed between

        the club and the Fire Service.



(xi)    On the 25th July, 1985, Eastwood and Partners wrote to                               South       Ex 58

        Yorkshire         County     Council   enclosing         copies    of drawings in

        respect of segregation of              visiting       spectators         at    Leppings

        Lane    end,       these being further to the preliminary submission

        in April, 1985.            Amongst these drawings          is     Plan        No.6705/8A         Ex 59

        which       showed     a revised layout and which abandoned the means

        whereby separate turnstiles would be used for each sector                                  of

        the     terrace.       The proposed new wall between turnstile 17 and

        the rear of the west stand was shown as                    having        a     door        for

        personnel         access     described      on Plan No. 6705/14A as being a                      Ex 60

        timber door being 838 x 841 x 44mm.                   Plan No. 6705/17              showed       Ex 61

        the proposed new pen arrangements for the west terrace. Under

        this arrangement, spectators would gain access to pens 1 -                                   4

        inclusive         from turnstiles 17 - 23 now A - G and to pens 5, 6

        & 7 from turnstiles 9 - 1 3 .



(xii)   A meeting of the Officer Working Party was held on 29th July,                                    Ex 62
        1985     to       discuss    the   detailed plans submitted to the South

        Yorkshire County Council on                 25th   July,    1985.            Subject        to

        certain       points        detailed   in    the minutes the proposals were

        considered to be acceptable.                 Item (i) made reference to                    the

        need        for    a   new    perimeter      fence gate now marked No.3                    for

        security access and emergency egress purposes.                       Item           (j )    of

        the      points        required    that      all   the     new    gates        be     fully

         supervised by stewards who must be                 fit,    able     and        properly

         trained.

    (xiii)   On     1st     August,     1985,      Eastwood and Partners wrote to South                       Ex 63

             Yorkshire County Council acknowledging the                        comments         of     the

             Officer        Working Party meeting of 29th July, 1985 Dr Eastwood                              gx 62

             asked for further clarification of the location of a proposed

             extra security gate, claiming that an existing gate in the 2m

             wide gap could be used by police and would still be available

             for     use for spectators in emergency as there were gates into

             the 2m gap from the terrace which would be under the                               control

             of     the     police.     With respect to the provision of stewarding

             for all the new gates, (item                  (j),    of    the     minutes         of    the

             29th July,        1985).        Dr Eastwood commented that this would no

             doubt be taken care of by the club.



Â£   (xiv)    A     meeting     of     the    Officer       Working       Party     and         Sheffield      Ex gj,

             Wednesday        Football Club was held on 7th August 1985 to carry

             out the "summer" inspection and in                    particular          to      view    the

             Leppings Lane end improvements.                     The matter for clarification

             dealt with in the letter at (xiii) above was investigated and

             it     was     noted     that there was an existing gate in the new 2m

             wide gap for use by the police.                     Again    it   was       stated        that

             these         gates    would        still    be     available       for     the     use     of

             spectators in an emergency as the gates at                          the     top     of     the

             terrace        under     the control of police would enable spectators



                                    - 29 -
             to be directed down the 2m wide gap? although it              was    agreed

             that steps or a longer gate would be required.



             Also    at this meeting, the club agreed to provide a new pitch

             perimeter fence gate at the Spion Kop end             (as    discussed     at

             the meeting of the 29th        July, 1985 - see 2.12{xii) above).

             There    were already four existing pitch perimeter fence gates

             at the Spion Kop end.         Unlike the gates in the fence          at   the

             Leppings    Lane end, it was contemplated that these gates (and

             other exits) would be used in the event of the whole                 terrace

             having     to be evacuated, and these gates were included in the

             calculation of evacuation time from the Spion Kop.



2.13   (i)   A meeting of the Officer         Working   Party     was    held    on    22nd

             January,     1986,    to   discuss     further   development       proposals

             involving the Kop and to carry out the "winter" inspection of                    Ex 65

             the stadium.



             The      police      representatives     confirmed    that    the    revised

             segregation arrangements to the rear of the west stand worked

             well on the majority of occasions.

      police asked that consideration be given to the removal of the southern

      half       of    the        crush       barrier immediately in front of the tunnel by the

      Officer Working Party.                    The matter was discussed and approval given                        to

      the removal of all but the northern third of that barrier.



3.2   A    Home       Office Circular (75/1986) was sent to the Fire Service on 29th                                    Ex 66

      October, 1986 enclosing a copy of the re-issued Green Guide.




3.3   A letter dated 3rd November, 1986, was received from Sheffield City
                                                                                                                        Ex 67

      of     the      stadium          under     the       1975    Act.         It asked for any outstanding

      matters requiring attention to be detailed.



3.4 An inspection of the                     Hillsborough          ground       was   carried      out     on    17th

      November, 1986.



3.5 On     18th        February,             1987,     a   letter        was    sent by the Fire Service to
                                                                                                                        Ex 68
      Sheffield City Council in response to their                                 letter     of   3rd    November,

      1986.           This    was        a    comprehensive          letter       covering matters that were

      considered             as    requiring          attention          throughout        the    stadium.         In

      particular             it    was       recommended          that     a    satisfactory security device

      easily openable from                    the     pitch       side     be    found     and    fitted    to    all

      perimeter fence gates.

3.6   A     meeting      of   the Advisory Group was held on the 10th March, 1987, in

      order to discuss the contents of the Fire                   Service    letter    dated      18th   Ex 10
                                                                                                         Ex 68
      February, 1987 (and Sheffield City Council's proposals for divisions of

      responsibility between the various bodies on the Officer Working                           Group

      (see 1.14 above).



      With regard to the letter of 18th February 1987, it was agreed that the

      contents should be taken up with the club. Stewarding and the                        securing

      of all gates was discussed and the Fire Service indicated that existing

      arrangements were only acceptable subject to exits being stewarded                           and

      unlocked        for     the whole of any period that the ground was in use for a

      designated purpose.



      The Fire Service also pointed out that the new                   guide    now    included      a

      section        which     defines    in     detail, management responsibility.            It was

      recommended by the Fire Service that the club certificate specify as                           a

      condition that this section be complied with.



3.7   On      28th    March,     1987,    a     copy    of a draft letter from Sheffield City
                                                                                                         Ex 69

      received by the Fire Service for their comments.



      The       letter      referred     to    the     fact   that the police, Fire Service and

      Building Surveyor had been asked to comment on                   the     condition     of    the

      stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act.                        At that time,

      no comments had been received from the Building Surveyor and the police

      had       indicated      that    they     were     quite   satisfied with the stadium and

          indicated that the degree of co-operation that they received                     was    very

          sat is factor y .




                                              - 32 -
      The    letter       then     pointed      out    that   the Fire Service had a number of

      comments to make and these were to be                   attached          in    the     form       of     the

      letter    of    18th       February.        It did not however include further points

      that had been discussed at the Officer Working Party                             meeting          held     on

      10th March.



      Following       a    telephone       conversation with Mr David Bownes to point out

      this omission, a copy of the                letter,     annotated          with       the     additional

      points was returned to him .

     18th    February,         1987,   were     discussed     with Dr Eastwood who tended to

     agree with most of the points.



3.13 On 13th August, 1987, a reply to Sheffield                   City    Council's      letter     of

            preventing         overcrowding by ensuring crowd limits in various parts

            of the ground were complied with, It was "difficult to imagine how

            this     task      could       be controlled by stewards" and that "the matter

            should be considered further".



     (b)    in relation to condition 10(i) which dealt with stewards complying

            with     instructions           given    in   emergency   by the police "reference

           management       duties outlined in Chapter 2.                  To this end, the letter

           stated that immediate steps should be taken to                         appoint          a    Safety

           Officer as defined in Chapter 2 of the Guide and that confirmation

           of that appointment should be sent                   to       the   council        as       soon   as

           possible.



15 By     letter     dated          23rd October 1987, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

   was     received        by       the Fire Service on 26th October, 1987.                    This letter

   confirmed that the club did hold a copy                      of       the   Guide     to        Safety      at

   Sports     Grounds           -    1986   edition    and   the Club Secretary, Mr Mackrell

     3.17 A      letter    from    Sheffield           City    Council dated 8th February, 1988, was

            received.      The letter enclosed copies of a letter dated                       3rd   February,
                                                                                                                    Ex 79
            1988,     received     from Eastwood and Partners that had been sent in reply                           Ex 80
            to the Fire Service            letter       of    18th   February,    1987.       David       Bownes

            expressed      concern        at    the     apparent     criticism    of    the     Fire Service

            contained in the letter from Eastwood and Partners and                        suggested         that

            the Fire Service respond directly to them.



            The     letter    from     Eastwood         and    Partners    dealt with the Fire Service

            letter item by item and in general most of the matters had already been

            dealt     with    or were agreed upon although there were still some matters

            that required attention, some of them to be dealt with when                             the    south

            stand     was refurbished in 1991.                 The concluding paragraph of the letter

            indicated that the club was concerned that with each new member of                               the

            Fire      Service        to        the    Officer    Working    Party,     new     or    different

            recommendations were being put                    forward   which    in    some    cases      openly

            contradicted the recommendations offered by                     predecessors.



     3.18     On    29th      March,       1988,       a     letter was sent to Eastwood        and        Partners in

            reply to their        criticism of the Fire Service.                                                     Ex 81




     3.19 By          letter dated 29th March, 1988, the police informed the FireService

            of      the parking      and       travelling arrangements made for the FA Cup semi

              final on 9th April, 1988.                                                                              Ex 82



     3.20 At the 1988 semi final, two fire officers carried out an inspection                                  of

              the    ground   and made a note of their findings.                  They toured the ground
                                                                                                                     Ex 8 3
              and checked all final exits, finding stewards and police                         in    position.

              Emergency       lighting           and       firefighting     equipment         all      appeared

              satisfactory.       The PA system was also audible                throughout      the       ground.

    However,        it    was       noted    that    a   number    of    stewards    were    without

    identification and no log book was kept.



3.21 On 19th May, 1988, a further inspection was carried out at                        the     ground

    by     the    Fire    Service and the observations of the officer who attended                         Ex 84

    were set out in a letter dated 25th May, 1988 which                        was   sent     to    the

     local authority.



3.22 On    9th August, 1988, ADO Rowlands attended the meeting (referred to at

     Tab.15 of Volume 1 of the South Yorkshire Police documents)                           which    was

     called       by     the    police      to   discuss    the     operational      attendance      at

     Hillsborough Football Ground during the                    coming     season.   ADO     Rowlands

     stressed      that        it   was     essential    that     the    Fire Service received an

     accurate indication of the exact location of an incident                         and    what    it

     was.



3.23 By    letter dated 30th March, 1989, the police informed the Fire Service

     of the parking and travelling arrangements made for                       the    FA    Cup     semi   Ex 85

     final on 15th April, 1989.



3.24 On     3rd April, 1989, a letter dated 30th march, 1989, was received from

     Sheffield City Council enclosing a draft                     copy    of   the   final    revised      Ex 86

     Safety Certificate Conditions which as far as possible incorporated the

     comments made in the Fire Service's letter to                       Sheffield    City    Council

     dated       13th    August,      1987.      The letter listed four points for further

        consideration.

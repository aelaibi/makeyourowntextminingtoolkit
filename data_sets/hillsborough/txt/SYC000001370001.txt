Dear Stan,

1 have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments bat no
amendment to the summaries 1 will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No. 13   Colin Wafer.

a. Summary par 17. Insert "including Photograph Reference RBI/3
RBI/4 and PR3/29A " after the word "photographs” and delete the-last
sentence.

b. Very minor point but page 94 is not complete.

c. Please let me know which are the additions referred to onpage 97.


 No 38. Christopher Edwards.

a. Summary Para 15. An even moreminorpoint.   There is aspelling
mistake of the word "pitch' .

b. Summary Para 16. substitutethe word"including"   forthe word "and”
in the second line and delete "is included with this file" .

b. Page 36. I cannot find the reference to the large male referred to
on this page in the previous statement. Can you direct me please.


 No 51. Kevin Daniel Williams.

a. Summary para 5. I cannot find the evidence in PC1790 statement for
"assisted by other persons, who have not been identified, but without
success. The officer left him with the other person whilst he went to
assist others”. If I am right than can we leave this out but add after
the word "resuscitation" the words "but without success.1*.

b. Summary para 8 . This evidence is quite difficult. I think w« will
have to deal with it at the Inquest. However I wonder whether it night
be better to substitute "several" for the word "six".
c. Summary para 19 insert "including Photograph Reference TT1/30
after the word "photographs" and delete ” Photograph Reference
TT1/30 is included with the file"

d. PC Craighhill on pages 27 -29 describes four cases. Is it possible
to say which of these refers to his video identification ?

e. How do we know that No 51 is the deceased on photographs PR5/32 and
PR5/33 ?

f. I assume that the other PC on the photos mentioned in e above has
not been identified.

g. I notice that there are no photographs of clothing. Is this a
deliberate omission.

h. We need Dr. Slater for this case. Can he be shown the statements
   ________         and Martin ( Highlighting the relevent sections)
and ask him to consider in the light of his PM findings whether the
account of SPC Martin is possible.


 No 76. John Alfred Anderson.

a. Summary Para 2 .delete "four pints to drink" and substitute
"something to drink". It is true that Mr. Gerrard says four pints but
Mr. Anderson does not.

b. Summary Para 5 & 7 . It is difficult to reconcile all the accounts.
It seems to me however that Mr. Southern did not participate in
carrying this person as he left to look for his brother (Page 41).
Would it be better to delete Mr. Southern's name from the summary.

c. Para 14. Please delete "following identification by Detective
Constable

d. Small point but on page 80 the word "Aorta” is omitted from the
cause of death.

e. We will need Dr. Shorland in this case.




Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper.
H.M. Coroner.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my lettar of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries bt t no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 No 79. Graham John Roberts

a. Every time I look at Mr Websters statement I seem to find something
else. Apart from what I have alreeady pointed out before I now
notice:

i. 4.45 am is not 1645.

ii. 1 thought that Ins. Timms had gone off duty and allowed DC Weigold
to hold the fort during the night. If that is so whom did Mr. Webster
brief ?

b. Page 32.     Pathologist was Dr. Clark

c. Page 63. Mr Carden in the last sentence says that he saw Graham
last prior to entering the tunnel. The Plan shows him as having seen
him well within the tunnel. Which is correct ?

d. Have we got a statement from PC          I?



Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper.
H.M. Coroner.

Dear Stan,

Further to our meeting on 13th March at my home in Nottingham
I am writing to inform you that as soon as it possible to do
so the following summaries (together with the front page summary)
may be released to the respective solicitors and Mr. Frazer.

In some of these cases there may be outstanding matters which need
sorting out in respect of statements or plans etc but I do not think
that these affect the release of the summaries.

No 79. Graham John Roberts   Please see comments h/files 30/3/90

Det Superintendent S. Beechey,
West Midland Police,
Nechells Green Police Station,
Fowler St,,
Birmingham,
B7 5DA.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No. 62   Barry Glover.

a» Spall point in Summary Para 6   fourth line should not the word
"them" be "him” .

b. I think we are going to need Prof Usher in this case.


 No. 82   Philip John Steele.

a. Summary para 8 . The position with regard to Mr. Udall is not very
satisfactory as he does not know which bodies he transported nor
does PC Marsh refer to the NGH numbering system.

I think therefore that it might be wiser to delete "including Philip
John STEELE

b. Summary para 9, Delete "Upon arrival at the gymnasium” and insert
” a body which tie subsequently learned was that of” after the words
"reponsibility for” .

c. Do we have statementof Martin McShane.    Page 23 refers.

d. What do we know about the Major Disaster Plan No and documentation
referred to by Mr, Udall ? Who is the police woman who kept the record
and do we know who the six police officers he refers to are ? (Page
37).

e. I have a coniraent on Janet Doore but I willl make it later on one
of the other cases.

f. Page 54. Which photo please ?

g. Can I have a copy ofthe statement of PCSmith   S3254.

h. I think that we will need Prof. Underwood.
  No 87. Stephen Francis O'Neill.

 a. Summary para 4. I think that Mr. Wardrope say on page 17 that it is
 possible that attempts at resuscitation may have taken place.
 I suggest that we add "written" before "evidence" and substitute
  but there is evidence from the post mortem findings that medical
 intervention took place" for "and believes he was triaged as dead on
 arrival". If you do not agree please let me know.

 b. Mr. Wardrope statement starting on page 6 , Has this in fact been
 signed. I ask as there are blanks in it.

 c. P.8 . I think Mr, Duncan is a senior registrarand notan SHO

 d. P. 11. Do we know which family he refers too,

e. P. 14. Time of 1345 is patently incorrect* Whattimedoes he
actually mean?

f. P. 17. He refers to the NGH number as 119 for Mr. Horrocks. Dr
Doore refers to it as 001. Which one is in fact correct.

g. P. 17. Does Mr. Wardrope know what Dr. Calder has saidabout
Steele. If M t should it be drawn to his attention so that he may if
he thinks it right make an amendment to his statement.

h. Page 20. Do we know which body was the one that was brought
in late ?

i . Someone must have told Dr. Doore what our body numbers are. Can you
remind me how the relationship between our numbers and the hospital
numbers was established ?

j. Page 28 There does not appear to be a NHG number 65. Can we get
this sorted out if possible.

k, I think that we should warn Mr. Wardrope that I mightwant    him to
give evidence on day 1 (April 18).


 No 94 Adam Edward Spearritt.

I have phone about a. on 29/3/90.

a. There seems to be rather a lot of confusion about this lad
Page 21. Pc. Pearson says he put him in the ambulance and accompanies
him.

Page 33 Mr, Dale says that it was a group of supporters and
does not really mention Mr, Pearson.
Page 43 Mr, Williams says the patient was in Mr. Garrett's care and
was bleeding heavily. Furthermore on page 45 he says that the patient
was unloaded into casualty and declared BGA and taken to plaster room.
I wonder whether Mr. Williams is really talking about another patient
and not Adam at all. It occurs to me that it could be Philip John
Steele No 82 particularly as he had a laceration of the lung. One
could check with Prof Underwood whether this could cause bleeding.
I think that it might be worth reinterviewing Mr, William and showing
him photo's in case he can recognise the lad.

Page 52 and 53 Mr. Garrett seems to suggest that the lad was left in
the care of the Hospital Drs.

Page 60 Dr. Quartley does not identify the patient but I assume that
you would suggest that because he refers to Dr, Clark who does that
he was dealing with Adam.

Do we know who the junior Dr, who gave the intra cardiac injection.

Do we know whether Dr. Quartley is still in Sheffield ? If not where
is he?

b. Can you please send as soon as possible a copy of Dr. Quartley
statement to Prof S. Jones and ask his to consider whether he wishes
to reconsider his stated cause of death in the light of what is said
on page 60 about the intra cardiac injection and his findings of
severe pericardial effusion and myocardial haemorrhages.

c. Have we any idea who the patient was whom Dr. Quartley intubated at
the Gym ?

d. Can we warn Dr. Clark (the anaethetist) that he might be required
at the inquest.

f.In order not to hold up the release of the summary and in view of
my concerns a b o u t e v i d e n c e do you think it might be better
in Summary Para 7 to delete "Ambulanceman                   and
include him at the Inquest if we decide that he did deal with Adam?

A general point. Do we know were the Drs involved in these hospital
cases are now located in case we need to ask any of them to come to
the Inquests.



Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper.
H.M. Coroner.

          Dear Sirs

          Hopefully yew will by now seen Bulletin 14 issued on the 5th March, this is
          the letter to which Liz Steel refers at the beginning of the second
          paragraph on page one.

          In response to his invitation to this^vQanmittee I appeared before H.M
f         Coroner fa* South Yorkshire Dr.           Popper at the Medico-Legal Centre,
          Watery Street, Sheffield on Tuesday of this week and having            heard
          representations from myself and Solicitors representing various other
          interested bodle Dr. Rapper confirmed that he willresume the 95 inquests on
          a strictly limited basis on the 18th April 1990.

          H.M. Coroner has been under considerable pressure from a variety of sources
          notably this Cccsnittee, the Hillsborough Family Support Group and Messrs
          Hammond Suddard acting far South Yorkshire Police on the instructions of the
          M.M.I.   to release certain information in advance of the resumption of the
          Inquests ... the majority of that pressure relates to the release of what
          Dr. Popper calls ’’nc^-controversial information" which many of the families
          want and which, strictly speaking, has nothing to do
          fer timsqgm gQ any potential criminal proceedings.

          As a result of their investigatictis into the Hillsborough Disaster for Lord
          Justice Taylor and then for the Director of Public Prosecutions and also for
          H.M Coroner himself officers of West Midlands Police have amassed a great
          deal of informatics* about the movements of most (but not all) of the 95 fans
          who died and that information is contained in the statements, still
          photographs, sections of video film etc held by West Midlands Police in
          Birmingham. It is not possible for either West Midlands Police or H.M.
          Coroner to release all the information they have at this stage because some
          °f it relatiOyjKj          "criminal” aspect of the investigation but it is
          possible ter extract from each of the 95 separate files detailed information
          about the mavejnents of each deceased from the time they left home until the
          time death was certified in the temporary mortuary at the ground or in
          hospital and such summaries are currently in the course of preparation.

          The summaries are being prepared by senior officers from the West Midlands
          Force and are being scrutinized by other mere senior officers and then by
          Dr . Popper himself before they are to be released to ensure that they
          contain no controversial details and that they are accurate and as, detailed
          as possible in the circumstances.

          The Director of Public Prosecutions has confirmed to a H.M. Coroner that
          this ncm-controversia 1 information may be released now to the fami lies in
                                                  1990. 0 3 . 0 9   12 8 10             P.   3




    accordance with   a   strictly   laid down procedure and this procedure is as
    it follows.

    As soon as possible copies of the 95 summaries will be sent to this
    Caamittee and a copy of the summary relating to each individual deceased
    will be sent tothe Solicitors on record with H.M. Cbroner as being the
    practice acting for the    immediate next of kin.

    No photographs or video film extracts will be issued but references to these
    will almost certainly be included in the summary and if for any reason the
    family particularly wants to see the photograph or video film extract then
    the Coroner wil1 consider each request for this information on its merits.
    The Coroner pra does not feel that the supplyinyg of photographs etc is
    necessary/at this stage, the pictures may cause further grief and many of
    the families have seen them anyway during discussions with West Midlands
    officers.   There is also the problem of logistics and the Coroner is trying
    to keep everything as simple as possible for the time being.

    A "flow chart” may also to be issued (although no firm decision has been
    made about this) and this chart will show movement of each deceased within
    certain time bands and will indentify the individual (whether a relative, a
    member of the publicor police officer) who identifies the deceased at a
^   particular spot or time either prior to or following his car her death.

    It is for you to advise your client when you have received this summary', we
    strongly recommend that you do not simply send the summary to your client
    without prior warning as they are likely to contain information which may
    cause distress if seen without prior warning and although it is of course up
    to you to decide how you impart this information to your client we recommend
    that you tell your client that you have the summary available and invite
    them to either request a copy or preferably see them to go through it with
    them before deciding whether to release a full copy to them for their own
    use.

    The summary should be read in conjunction with the Post-Mortem Report which
    we anticipate you will have already obtained.

     In our view it is likely that some   families will not want to be made aware
    of the contents of the summary        in detai 1 but we feel that it is important
     that they at least have the option   to choose whether they avail themselves
    of the opportunity to see it          or not, at present they do not have that
^   option.

    We believe that it is likely that many families having seen the summary will
    be satisfied with the factual information it contains and will not want to
    take any further action. Their sunaaary will simply be presented in a formal
    way in open Court in Sheffield and thus taken into public record,

    For details of what we suggest you do in the event that your clients have
    queries arising from the summary or they want to attend the Inquests
    personally please see below,

    Each summary will be presented personally by the officer who prepared it to
    H.M. Coroner in accordance with a timetable which will be published as soon
    as possible and it is hoped that eight summaries a day can be received by
    H.M. Coroner sitting in Open Court with a Jury.

    At the conclusion of the presentation of the 95 summaries the Coroner will
    adjourn his Jury without asking than to return any verdict.

     In the event that the Director of Public Prosecutions then subsequently
     instigates criminal proceedings against any individual or organization
     in connection with this disaster then it is likely (but not certain) that
     the Coroneni w444— adopt— th&f decision or the Crown Court Juryj

Inquests start to run the    timetable must be strictly adhered to ifeverybody
is to be satisfied.

We are not able to tell you when you will receive your client’s summary or
sunmaries at the mcraent, they are not all prepared but you may rest assured
that they will be sentto you by H.M.           Coroner   as socn as they are
available. If you have not already obtained a copy of the Fost-Mbrtesn
Report from the aaroner's office in Sheffield we urge you to do ?=«
immediately.

Please return a separate copy of the enclosed questionnaire In relation to
each deceased for who you act to ourselves and forward a copy to H.M,
Coroner as soon as possible after you have seen the summary and in any event

no later than Tuesday the 10th April in any event as any questions notified
after that date may not be capable of being Investigated and dealt with
before the Inquests begin.
For our part we believe that this move by II.M. Coronar to iwpsart information
to f a ll l e c is to be a p p la u d * * * > taken * * llh8? y of ® aki^. that
point in open Oourt and through the press.             The cbroner Is UflQBr IKJ
obligation to act in the way that he is and we believe that his stated
Intentions to assist families in any way he can by providing this
information are entirely genuine and we trust that those families who you
represent will accept this move on his behalf in the way in which we believe
that it is intended.

Although the primary intention of Dr Popper is to give families information
about how their loved one died, one of the beneficial side effects of you
receiving these summaries now will be that yew will be in a better position
to assess the pre-death terror/pre-death pain and suffering element in the
ffanwgftg claim and you will in due cause receive our further views cn this
aspect in a future Bulletin, together with a report on our continuing
negotiations with the Insurers.

At the meeting on Tuesday H.M,Coroner was at pains to stress that he has no
"inside information" about the intentions of the D.P.P. as regards criminal
proceedings and he stressed that his motives in reopening the Inquests at
this stage were directed only at supplying information to families.

It is unlikely that we will issue a general Bulletin dealing solely with
Inquests before they reopen but the writer will be more than happy to deal
with individual queries which arise either as a result of the contents of
this letter or as a result of problems raised by clients, or letters should
be directed to the Law Library quoting the reference shown in the heading of
this letter.

If there are any significant changes to the information set      out   above we
will get back to you.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mervyn,

AVAILABILITY OF DOCUMENTS POE EM COIONEE'S INQUESTS
TOTO HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.__________________

Thank you for your letter of the 25th of November. My only
reservation on what you have set out is on plans and photographs.
I notice that you have suggested 4 for the Jury, 1 for the Coroner
and 1 spare. In addition to the Jury, there are of course all the
solicitors who are likely to be present. It is difficult to be
certain how many there will be and it may of course be that they
already have, from the Public Inquiry copies of these documents.
It might however be worthwhile having perhaps 2 or maybe 3 spares
to be on the safe side.
With regard to the statements from: witnesses who are not called,
but whose statements will be read, I suspect that the figure
which you have put down is probably correct because although I do
not normally do it this way, it probably would be easier to circulate
these statements to the respective legal advisers and obtain their
confirmation that they will not raise any objection to their use
as documentary evidence before we begin, rather than insist on a
witness being called who we had not intended.

I hope that this is satisfactory to you.

Yours sincerely,



o .xy.rupper,
H.M. Coroner.

 P.S. I think that we will also need copies of the precis for the solicitors
acting for the other parties. It may be that it will not be necessary to
send it to all theparties but I think that some of them (say the parties
that are the defendants to the civil action may need to see it as well.
Perhaps we should have 4 or five copies of this. I am open to counter
a-rguement.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted cut in due course.

 No. 9U. David Leonard Thomas.

a. Page 37 Should be L>r. Clark.

b. See comments re Vardrope and Doore made on other similar cases.


 No 92 Arthur horrocks.

a. Evidence of Lynn II. Franklin. I wonder if the plan which she refers
to would be useful in this case.

I am writing to inform you that as soon as it possible to do
so the following summaries (together with the front page summary)

In some of these cases there may be outstanding matters which need

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No. 59 Gordon Rodney Horn.


a.Summary Para 6 . Time of death should be 1602.

b. Confusion as to time of identification see pages 19and 22
Also 24 hour clock times incorrect.

c. I notice that Hr. Day identifies Paula Smith though heis    not
referred to in her file No 18. Has he in fact got the right
identification?.

d. I have already referred to in other cases to Hr. Wardrope and
continuity of NGH numbers.


 No 61 Colin Andrew Hugh William Sefton.

a. Front page and Para 9. Time of death. Any evidence for the time
stated as Dr. Bull does not specify.

b. Para 13. Please amend by deleting"followingidentification by DC
Weigold".

c. Please insert "Mr” before "Shannon" on page 5. para 15.

d. Please show the pathologist pages 2 and 3 of T, Sefton!s statement
I would like him to attend.

e. Was the body in a body bag?

f. I think we need a birth certificate ifpossible   please.

g. P 69 which photos?
  No 75     Derrick George Godwin.

 a. Summary Para 10. Need amending to remove reference to DC
 Weigold.

 b. P. 40    See previous comments on this man statement.

 c. P 49. Identification to Prof. Henry.

 d. Can we find out how Prof Henry knew whose body he was examining as
 he refers to them by name and number.

 e. P t)9 Which photos?


  No 83 Jon Paul Gilhooley.

 a. Sum. Para 8 . delete "the body of Jon Paul Gilhooley" and
 substitute "several bodies"

b. P. 33 Do we know who the the person is who isreferred too? Could
it be No 91? Is there any way of finding out?

c. P. 68 Date of Death incorrect. Please ask Pathologist to attend.

d. Please let me have statement No S229 of R. Gilhooley.

e.   If possible we need a birth certificate.

f.   Seeearlier comments re Mr. Wardrope and continuity     of No.


 No 84. Paul David Brady.

a. Sum Para 2. Spelling of Me C arthy.

b. Sum Para b See below re cormrient re Dr. Jacob.

c. Sum Para 9 amend this para by deleting "accompanied the body of Mr.
Brady and substitute "accompanied several bodies".

d. How did Mr. Jacob find out the name of Mr. Brady?

©» Is there any evidence of the details on the abdomen eg photograph?

f. Has Mr. Wardrope seen Dr. Jacob's account. Please let him see it in
case he wishes to review his comments.

g. Do we know were Mr. Jacob is working at present?

h. Do we need Dr. Doore statement for continuity with the NGH no.?

i. We are still not out of trouble with DC Weigold. Please see
opening evidence of Mr. Parkin. Similar matter arise in some other
cases as well. Please discus with me.

j • The Gen 18 refers to some other Dr who certified death. Is this a
mispelling?
 No 85 Carl David Lewis.


a. I think that although sum. Para 4 and 5 are factually correct and
give an interesting account it would be better to amend them by
deleting them entirely and substituting
"Brian WILLIAMS saw CARL LEWIS enter the ground through the
turnstyles. He did not see CARL LEWIS again."

This will mean renumbering subsequent paras.

b. Iassume that PC Newbold adds nothing.

c. P54 Deceased is referred to as "James" and indeed also onpage 67
though the identification by Mr. Lewis seems to have been correct
(p63). Was this simply a transcription error by PS Timmins. If so DC
Weigold statement is in error as to the name. Can we check the
original statements please.

d. Who is Dr. Lumb P 64 . Statement please for reference.

e. Inotice that the Gen 18 originally refers to him as James         but was
altered . Perhaps that is the clue but when was it done?

f. probably will want the pathologist.


 No. d6 Gary Philip Jones.

                 .
a. Summary Para 8 insert "(not Gary Philip Jones)" after the word
"casualty" and delete "(believed to be Barry Bennett Deceased
Reference B8 )"

b. Summary para 13.   Delete "It will be seen        these facts".

c. Can we have the spelling of Philip checked as sometimes it is spelt
with two l*s.

d. Can we discuss Mr. Hunter evidence in relation to Hicks and Wild
at some point please.

e. On p 17 and 18 he refers to Gary Jones but does not seem to refer
to him in his original statement. Have I read this correctly?

f. I assume that the man on p 39 is Barry Bennett.

g. P. 46. Is there any way of linking the NGH number to No 86 other
than by using Dr. Doore.

h. p. 55 Which photo please?

i. May need Pathologist.
No 88 Barry Sidney Bennett.

a. Sum. Para 3. I think it might be better to delete "Whilst waiting
in the crowd in Leppings Lane Mr. C saw the outer gates being pushed
open by the crowd. The gates were then closed by the police. Mr. C
then saw the crowd push against the outer gates again which opened and
” . and substitute "Mr. Carroll saw the outer gates open twice. On the
second occassion". (Note the summary is not incorrect it just seems to
me better to summarise as above. I am willing to discus it.)

b.Summary Para 8 . Please put this para, in brackets. Please ensure
that the presenting officer will be able to give evidence of the
reseach undertaken.

c. Sum. para 10. The time stated is incorrect. Presumably typing
error.

d. Para 19. Poor Mr. Shannon has difficulties in putting faces
to cases. I think it would be better if we deleted the whole
of the para from ” visual and photographic........" and substituted
"video and photographic evidence including a recent photograph of Mr,
Bennett. He is certain that Mr. Bennett is one of the persons who he
carried across the pitch on a temporary stretcher."
The presenting officer/ Insp. Layton can then deal with the detail
orally,

e. Para. 20 How do we know that Mr. Meakin helped to carry Mr.
Bennett?

f. Para 22. How do we know that the man on the pitch is Mr. Bennett.

g. To whom did Mr. Turner make the identification?

h. Was there any reason why he declined to make a statement?

i. I assume the presenting officer/InspVLayton will be able to
explain this.

j. Page 4. Is there any way we could get a time when he was separated
ie was it before or at the time the gates were opened?

k. Can we   find out whether Dr. Marsh remembers if he put a cannula
into this   man’s arm or attempted any other method of venous access,
 see page   41. If not and assuming this was done following the incident
than some   other Dr. or paramedic must have had dealings with Mr.
Bennett.

1. Which is Dr. Doore statement S575A?

m.   Can I have a copy of Ins. Bennett's statement S 565.

n. Usual linkage for hospital no. and Mr. Wardrope /Dr/ Doore.
 No 91 Stephen Francis Harrison.

a. Facing Sheet. Cause of death incorrect. See page 71

b. Were does the certification time come from.

c. Do we   know who the person on page 48 is ?    .

d2fP. 50 I am not sure whether Dr, K says that patient intubated
at A & E. If so does not fit in with Dr,Q. unless he was extubated
and reintubated. Can we find out?

e. Do we know whether this patient was labelled NGH 21 in A&E or later
see page 51'.' :
               -~v

f. p. 60 I think it unlikely that the body was labelled 91 in A & E
can Mr, Hogson link the numbers at all?

g. I think we need Mr. Wardrope and possibly Dr. Doore in this case.

h. We definitely need the pathologist.

i. Please let Dr. Slater see Dr. K statement and particularly p 50-51
and ask him whether he needs to review his PM findings?

j. p. 112 How do we know this is Stephen particularly as p 31 seems
to indicate that he was not with friends ?


 No 93   Philip Hammond.

a. Front page   cause of death incorrect, see page 70.

b. Can you remind me who the person is whom Dr. Calderrefers to on
p 58

c. P. 66 ^identification Insp. Timms

d. Can we discuss the evidence on page 22 re the Hicks      files,

e. I would like to discuss the ambulance evidence at some time so that
I can be sure that I have understood it correctly.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref; H/files.


 No 29. Eric Hankin.

a. Summary Para. 4. The word "cursory” has slipped in again. Can we
delete it please.

b. Summary Para 15. insert the word "including" after the words "Pen
3" and delete "is produced".

c. Page 60 and 64. Usual problem of identification with pathologist
and DC Weigold.

d. Plan RL1 referred to in the additional schedule is not included in
the file.

e. I think Plan PRG1 may be useful.


 No. 60 Christopher James Traynor.

a. Summary Para 4. I am having difficulty in sorting out which of the
two bodies that the officers dealt with is the deceased in this file.
Summarising officer seems to have opted for the first body described
on page 13 and 17 but both had the officers number written on right
hand. Perhaps the interviewing officer is able to shed some light on
who is who?

b. Summary Para 5. What enquiries are referred to please?

c. Summary Para 15. Please insert "including" after the word "pitch"
and delete "is included in this file."
 No. 7b Peter Reuben Thompson.

a. Summary para 5. Would I be right in thinking that some one must
be mistaken or can the accounts be reconciled in any way?
I think that the summarising officer should be prepared to deal with
this at the inquest.

b. I find Mr. Wright evidence rather confusing. I assume that Mr.
P.R. Thompson is the person described on page 10 of the officers
statement. He states him as having blue jeans and this is
confirmed PC N.F. Smith on page 36. On the other hand on page 12 where
he identifies him he describes him as being all in white. Has he in
fact got the wrong person ?

c. Still on Mr. Wright in his statement of 19.10.89 he refers to three
persons but in his statement of 5.9.89 he mentions 4. It is not clear
from the statement of 19.10.89 whether the man described as Mr.
Thompson is the man with the large watch page 9 or the man with the
"beer belly” on page 10. Have we got the Daily Mirror photo and do we
know who he is ? Is it possible to try and sort this one out ?

d. I am also confused by Mr. Early. He identifies the deceased on page
33 but I cannot relate it to which one of the various people he helped
and which speaks about in his first statement. Can we find out from
him whom he means?

e. I have not noticed this before but on page 41 I am a little
surprised that Dr. Mohaghan can say that the individuals had numbers
allocated as I think this must have taken place in the gym. Any
comments please?

f. Pages 43 and 50. Which is the correct place of birth please ?


 No 95. Lee Nicol.

a. Facing sheet . There is a spelling mistake in the cause of death
Bronchopneumon ia.

b. I think that plan KRM1 would be useful.

c. I am concerned that both Mr. Flack and Mr Wilson seem to have
misidentified Lee in the temporary mortuary. Have we found out which
lad they are in fact referring too please? Do we know who the police
officer with the beard is?

d. Page 92 . Who is the patient referred to by Dr. Davidson please ?

e. Please note that we will need Dr. Holt at the Inquest and probably
also Dr. Appleyard.

a. Summary Para 4. I cannot find in the statements of PC Larkin C.
Sup. Nesbit or for that matter PC Walton any postive confirmation
tha the body they handled was that of Stuart. I assume that the
summary is based on the statement of PC Jackson and worked backward so
to speak. Can you please confirm that I have understood this
correctly.

b. Page 79. Pc. Weigold's statement refers to Usher rather than Clark.

c. Page 85. Again this should have been Dr. Clark rather than Usher.
I note that the name is given in full but assume that this is because
of the date when the statement was taken.

d. At some point when we have completed the summaries I will want to
go over some of the visual evidence with Ins. Layton so that he can
explain to me how the identification were done. 1519 57 07 is a good
example.


 No 65. William Roy Pemberton.

a. Summary Par. 14. Please insert 11 including Photaraph references
 PR6/2A and AH/11" after the word "photgraphs* in line 3 and delete
* Photograph Reference PR6/2A and AH/11 are produced."

b. On Page 7 Mr. Pemberton is upset about the fact that the officer
dealing with the identification did not recognise "LOTTO" baseball
boots. I assume the photographic evidence shows these boots but do you
know whether there is anything about them which clearly shows than as
LOTTO baseball boots.

c. Dr. Clark will have to come to this Inquest.
 No. 69 Gerard Bernard Patrick Baron.

a. Summary Para.10. Delete "following identification by Detective
Constable Weigold" This is a case were the continuity must still be
sorted out if it is possible to do so.

b. Although we probably have the spelling of the first name correct
we should verify it by obtaining a birth certificate if possible.

c. Page 4. I assume the girls referred to are not the Hicks sisters.

d. Page 75 I notice that DC Weigold spells the first name apparently
correctly but the identifiers spell it differently. Was this spelling
in the original statement?

e. Is photo PR1/20 the same as PR1/20A ?


 No.74 Kester Roger Marcus Ball.

a. Summary Para. 8 . Delete " Following identification by Detective
Constable WEIGOLD on Sunday 16th April 1989,". This is a case were
continuity and identification still need to be sorted out.

b. Page 35 states that certification took place at 4.35pm. At page 40
(which incidentally is the statement rather than the recollection) the
time is given as 3.35 which cannot be right as the Dr. did not turn up
till 4.30. Please check the original statement and if necessary
obtain further statement if that is possible to explain the
discrepancy.

c. I do not think that I made this point when I wrote to you about
Mr. Wild  NO 77 but it applies there as well.


 No 89. Victoria Jane Hicks.

a. Small point but at the foot of the facing sheet the name "Jane"
is ommitted.

b. Summary Para. 12. I think the time was approximately 111537” and not
"1530" see pages 47 and 104.

c.   Summary Para 14. insert "also" after the word "DOORE"

d. Summary Para 15. I am not sure about this para, in this file. I
think it would be best if it were deleted though it is ofcourse very
sad that this added distress ocurred. Please discuss with me if you
feel differently about this.

e. If deleted subsequent paras will have to be renumbered.
Victoria Jane Hicks continued.

f. Summary para 18.(present numbering) delete "following
identification by Detective Constable WEIGOLD". Identification and
continuity needs sorting out if possible.

g. Pages   28-36. Can we include the grid plan he refers to please.

h. Page 75 is missing from my copy . Please let me have it.

i.Page 131. Date of death is incorrect.

j. Page 132. He diescribes a haemothorax, I think this is the first
one that I can remember. Please let Dr. Denmark see a copy of the
statement of J. S. Calder and particularly page 113 and ask him to
consider whether the intra cardiac injection could have caused this or
whether he has any other comments. He can make these at the inquest as
I think that he will have to come to this one.

I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 No 64, Sarah Louise Hicks

a. Who did the identification to Dr. Slater see pages 113 & 114.

b. The photgraphs show a Mr, Mitton , Can I have his statement please.


 No 68. John HcBrien

a. Page 36 P.J. Webster states that he arrived at the tern, mortuary at
-4.20 after loading the bodies from Lepping Lane. Ifthat is correct
than the timing on the front sheet and summary for the death
certification cannot be rig»t as this is shown 9 minutes later but tie
in with Dr. Ashtons timings. Can you help on this,

b. This man's statement also refers to 93 bodies Page 37. I doubt
whether that can be correct as all the bodies were present at the tern,
mortuary for the photgraphs except no 95,

c. Page 51 photo number differ from those in schedule.


 No 80. David John Benson.

a. Roger Utley. Is the statement referred to as the original statement
on page 23 the recollections included as pages 14 - 20 ?

b. Is No 80 the same as the body described in the last line of page


c. Is the daughter referred to on page 42 represented    by solicitors ?

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder sumnaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 No 36. Kevin Tyrrell.

a. Small point but please delete "is produced" from para. 12 of
Summary.

b. P. 15    I note the misspelling of      the Dr. NamewhichI do  notthink
too serious but I wonder where the reference to Middlewood Hospital
comes from as this raises a bigger doubt about correctness.

c. P.   35   Dr. Name "Cyrpen".

d. P. 49    Pathologist is Dr. Clarke. I now understandthatthe main
statement refers to Prof Usher and his team but I think that the
subsidiary statements should also be more or less correct.

e. Your computer has not yet got the trainee out of it system.


 No.41. Eric George Hughes.

a. Facing sheet. I think the time of certification should be the same
as in the summary Para 5 particularly as the stated time is earlier
than the Doctor's tine estimates.

b. I note that the name which I understand is based on my schedules
is never fully stated in any statement, we will need to verify the
name again .


 No. 43. Graham John Wright.

a. I think that there is a mistake in para 15 of the summary
as it refers to Mr. ASP1NALL. It also has a quotation which I do not
object to in principle but it is inconsistent with the rest of the
presentations. Would you consider the following;
Delete 'and states " t h e only one which I feel is a possibility for
the person that I gave resuscitation to was body of Mr. ASPINALL. I
cannot be absolutely sure this is the person."1, and substitute the
following;

"and with hesitation thinks that the body he attempted to resuscitate
was that of Mr.G.J. Wright."

b. I think that we need the plans referred to on page 8 and probably
11 and 20 .

c. Dr. Name on page 31

d. I am not clear where the variants of this deceased middle name
originated from (Sean and Shaun and Shawn the latter on page 50)

e. P 35 and P 42 . The usual problem with the pathologist name.


 No. 67 Raymond Thomas "John" Chapman.

a. Notwithstanding my form it seems that the name which we got was not
complete see Page 1 statement of son. We need to verify the name
if possible with a birth certifcate and then make the necessary
amendments.

b. Previous statement of G.. Glaves please, page 59.

c. P 81. PG. Popplewell did not know the middle name and could not
have therefore identified the deceased as such.. Please also see P 82
were Dr. Slater says it was Ins Timms who did the identification.


 No. 50 Andrew Mark Brookes.

a. Summary para 16. Please amend by inserting " including Photograph
 reference S M I /102 " after the words "number of photographs'* and
deleting " Photograph reference SMR1/102 ".

b. Page 17. I assume that the previous statement is not relevant but
perhaps I should have it for completeness.

c. Page 89. Can you please tell me which are the additions referred
to.

 No. 55 Nicholas Michael Hewitt,

a. Summary Para 15. Please delete "is included with this file".

b. On p 25    line 5 the time is stated as 1410 hours (1440), Which is
correct?


 No. 70 Alan McGlone.

a. Summary para 13. Please delete "is produced which".

b. It is   not relevant to the present activity but I notice that A.J.
Brazener   states that having satisfied himself that Pen 3 was empty he
moves to   Pen 4 and sees 20 to 30 bodies on the floor. I assume he is
mistaken   about the Pens or is there any other evidence for this?
 c. Page 42. I assume previous statement irrelevant but I think I
 better have it.

 d. I am not sure on what basis the identification of the deceased has
 been made on PR7/2 as the named officers disclaim recognising him.

  No. 71. Stephen Paul Copoc.

 a. Summary para 2. I do not think that it is clear that they each had
 three pints. I think it might be safer to delete "each” and "three
 pints to" in line 6 of this paragraph.

  b. Summary para 2 . Last sentence reading "At this stage he lost sight
_ of Stephen COPOC". I cannot find this in his statement. If I am right
  than we should delete or put it in but introduced     as a comment.

 c. Page 32. PC Griffiths did not know the name of     the deceased and
 cannot therefore identify him by name to DC. Weigold.

 d. I notice that on p.47 this lads name is spelt as COPOL. I willask
 Dr. Forrest to check the labelling on the sample.


  No. 77 Martin Kenneth Wild.             *

 a. Summary para 6. Please put the last sentence in brackets or
 otherwise indicate a comment.

b. Pages 36 and 39. Mr. Lawrence in his first statement seems quite
clear that fir. Wild was the first body he dealt With but in his
statement of 05,07.89 he seems to say that the first body was No 74
Kester Ball. I fear that he will need reinterviewing to clear this up.

c. Page 38 . Last Line Is this a typing error "7"?



Yours sincerely.

Dear Stsun,

I have a few consents on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have "other comments but no
amendment to the sunaaarief I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.


 Mo. 8.    David Hawley

a. Suissiary Para 3. I think the evidence is difficult to summarise in
this case as there seems to be some ambiguity about it as well as
contradiction. Please consider the following as an alternative but
feel free to discuss with me.

Delete ".....now known to be David HAWLEY on to the pitch. David
HAWLEY had been passed from the terraces by police officers and
supporters. Evidence suggests that HAWLEY was in Pen 3 but there is
contradictory evidence later in the file, Mr. TURNER left David HAWLEY
on the pitch," and substitute the following:

” whom he subsequently identified as David HAWLEY on to the pitch,
David HAWLEY had been passed to hi® from the terraces. His evidence
would support the view that David HAWLEY was in Pen 3 but other
evidence referred to later (see Paragraph 11) would tend to contradict
this. Mr. TURNER left David HAWLEY on the pitch.M

b. Please chek whether the original statement of Mrs.   A,P. Hawley
spells Mr. Owens name with an apostrophe.

c. Which are the items referred to in the supplemental statement of
Ins. Layton (page 51.)

d. Can you help by explaining to me the oisidentifications referred to
in Mrs. M. Owens statement on page 54 ?


  No 42.   Paul Anthony Hewitson.

 a. I think it would be better to delete "drinking alcohol” from line
 two of paragraph 2 in the sunaaary.

 b. I note that PC, Roberts refers to Dr, Hull in some of his
 statements but I assume this is an error for Dr. Bull.

 c. I think that it might be as well if Statement S1804 Mr. Walters was
 included in this file.
No. 54. Anthony Peter Kelly*

a. Foot of facing sheet the order of the Christian names is incorrect.
See page 10.

b. There seems to be some confusion with regard to the order of
indentlfication of the name. The body came to the mortuary before the
came had been established (see statement of Pont). Mr. Weigold s
statement is therefore technically incorrect. Also PG Glaves statement
of identifcation only refers to one Christian name from mum whilst
there is no statement from him dealing with the identification from
Mr. Jenkins.

c. Is photograph PRI/N/1G the same as PRi/M/lOA ?

d. Dr. Curpen's second statement refers to him as Dr. Cyrpen. I assume
this is a typing error but please check .The error of course Occurs
in all the cases in which he is involved ie 36, 43, 51, 53, 54 , 56
57 58 and 65.


 No. 56. David William Mather.

a. Facing sheet and summary. No evidence of time of death
certification on file.

b. This is not relevant to this file but do we know which body Mr. Fox
(Page 27-28) carried across field.

c. See above re    Dr. Curpen's name.


 No. 63. Richard Jones.

a. Summary. Para. 13. As we may not be using the photographs I think
it would be better if this para was changed. Please consider deleting
" Photograph Reference DB1/6 is produced,H and inserting "including
photograph reference DEI/6"after the words "Three photographs".

b. Summary. Para 14. I wonder if it would be better to use the word
"mistaken" for the word "wrong".

c. Was a statement obtained from Phil Bickley (page 7) and if so who
are the three friends who he says lost their lives? (page 8).

d. I am a little confused by Phot NA63 as this seems to carry a legend
to the effect that the clothes belong to another body No 88,


 No 66. Thomas Steven Fox.

a. Summary Para, 14. Please amend by deleting " Photograph reference
TH/1 " and inserting "including "Photograph reference TH/1'1 after
word "photographs" ,

b. Please check the original of Mr. Pleavin statement re order of
Christian names which differs from the order given by mother and the
order in the identifications,

c. P. 17, Mr. Webster refers to 93 bodies. I thought there were 94.

d. I assume that we do not know to which policeman Mrs. Fox identified
her son (p.62).

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 No. 30. Alan Johnston.

a. There seems to be some confusion as to the spelling of he surname.
David Bower (page 35-36) spells it as Johnston e as does George Hugh
Johnstone (page 45) and Prof Usher (page 48). On the other hand Mr.
Kenneth Johnston and the officers spell it with out an "E". I have
also a record from another brother Charles Johnston who spells it
without an "E".

I think that we should leave the summary as it is but can we obtain a
copy of the birth certificate to verify the spelling please.

 No 35. Christine Anne Jont^u.

a. Mr. Jones (p. 2) seems to say that he found his wife on the pitch
and this seems to be confirmed by Lillyan Akred (pl7) . On the other
hand Mr. Fenwick (p 9 ) indicates that the husband was with him in the
terraces. Do you think that it would be possible to clarify this ?

b. It is rather unclear from Lillyan Akred1s statement whether she
says that she recovered the body fran Pen 3 or Pen 4. Does Plan LAI
help and if so could it be placed with the file.

 No 52 Simon Bell.

a. Video reference (p3) differs from schedule.

b.   I think theplan referred to on page 13 would be helpful.

c. Page 45 Unfortunately th name stated on the schedule of Dr.Forrest
is that of theindentifier. Can we look into where the error occurred
and obtain anynecessary supplemental statements if possible.
H/files   22 March 1990   cont. Page 2

 No 57, Martin Kevin Traynor

a. Just Dr Curpen*s name on the second statement.


 Mo 58. Paul Clark.

a. I think it might be best to include the visual evidence mentioned
on page 13. As this is outside the ground and not confirmed I think
we can let the summary para 10 stand.

b. Also Dr. Curpen as before.

c. I notice that Dr. Curpen (Cyrpen) has spelt Paul’s surname with an
"E". Can we please verify the original statement regarding this. I do
not think it warrants a further statement unless we also need one
because of the Dr's name.

some other comments. Cases where I only have ’’other comments’’ but no

 No. 26 Francis Joseph McAllister,

a. Facing Sheet and Para. 7 of Summary. Time of certification not
specified in statement. If no other evidence suggest follow Dr.
Redgrave wording (page 17).

b. This case seems to be linked with Case 45 (Nicholas Peter Joynes).
I note that in file 45 Mr. Roy Williams states that he identified Mr.
McAllister and also says that he sat in the stands with Mr. Guy who in
his statement does not even refer to him. I do not think that any
amendments need to be made regarding this at this stage other than to
remember the connection.

 No 45 Nicholas Peter Joynes.

a. Summary Para. 1. Please delete ’’(Nicholas Joynes took about three
cans of lager with him.)’’

b. Summary Para 2. Please delete last sentence begining ’’NICHOLAS
JOYNES had three of four pints of lager to drink whilst at the
Sportsman Public House.”

c. Page 29 The usual problems with continuity for the pathologist.



 No. 27 Joseph Daniel McCarthy.

a. Summary. Para 3. A very smalll point but there seems to be typing
error in the spelling of Mr. McCarthy’s name.

b. Summary Para 11. Please put place the last sentence beginning ’’ It
is believed     ’’ in brackets.

c. I assume that on page 11 about line 8 the spelling of the name is
due to typing error rather than from original statement. I do not
think that we need retype the sheets as this can be corrected in ink
as necessary.

d. P 24. Ususal problem with pathologist continuity.

e. Plan NBL1 has a wrong nmae on it. It says Joseph    Douglas
McCarthy.
 No 25. Joseph James Clark.

a. I think that this person's full name is as above, ie "James" is
ommitted from the front of the file the introductory page the facing
sheet and summary Para 1. (Please see page 65 of statements.)

b. The question of next of kin is difficult as the deceased seems to
have had children and I assume that these may technically be closer
than his mother as far as intestacy at least is concerned. There is
also a "common law wife". It may be that we should leave this alone at
this stage as the establishing of the next of kin is not reallymy
concern. I merely mention it so that we do not get caught unaware.

c. On the facing sheet the address of the mother is spelt differently
from that on page 9 of the son. Which is the correct address and
spelling?

d. Continuity see page 23 and 29.

e. Identification of deceased on the video is   at different timeto
that produce on the schedule (see page 67).

f. From photo FBI/do it is difficult to tell whether ?S C Bagnoli has
anything to do with this case. If so should we not include a
statement?



 No 32. Keith McGrath.

a. Summary Par. 13. This may be correct but please recheck that we
mean Gate 2 . See also page 13 . Please note that the time reference
in the statement differs from the time reference produced as the
exhibit.

b. I think that photograph RDOP-32 as well as the plan referred to on
page 23 are needed in the file.

c. On the video/photographic schedule you refer to a recent photograph
but this is not included. I assume that the reference has stayed in in
error.

d. I notice that you have not included the usual photographs of the
deceased clothing. Is there a reason for this?



 No 40.   Peter McDonnell.

a. Summary Para 4. I wonder whether the summarising officer would
consider adding the words "by virtue of photographic evidence" after
the words "It has been established". Can we also please put the last
sentence in brackets. There is a small spelling error in the last
sentence. "su r_ mised".

b. The statement of Mr. Weigold will need amendment. Perhaps this has
already been done as there is a reference in the Anna Cappa to a
statement S1280CS. (Body initially only identified by no. Also usual
problem with continuity.).

hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 No. 37 Ian Thoaas Glover.

completeness.


 No. 46 Carl Brown.

a. Page 12. I think it wold be better if we had   acopy of this

b. Page 36 and 42. Identification of pathologist incorrect but ?
statement S128GAR which might deal with this.



 No. 47 David William Birtle.

a. Page 8 This witness S. Thompson in this statement refers to "mouth

Det Superintendent S. Beechey,
West Midland Police,
Nechells Green Police Station,
Fowler St.,
Birmingham,
B7 5DA.

Dear Stan,

I have a few comments on the following body folder summaries plus
some other comments. Cases where I only have other comments but no
amendment to the summaries I will write to you about in a seperate
letter under reference of ref: H/files.

 No 9. James Gary Aspinall

a. Facing sheet needs time of certification amended to accord with
police officers evidence.

b.   Para 4 of summary has a tying error re time of certification

c. I am not clear whether the identification by C.A. Sterritt of the
deceased on MAP 1 at 14.53.18.20 is the one that has been discounted.
If not I think it should be included in the summary and the file.

d. The continuity of identification to Dr. Siva is incomplete.

e. Plans awaited as agreed.


 No 10. David Steven Brown.

a. The Anna Cappa refers to live identification at 1504 by A.M. Brown.
I cannot find this in the statements though there is some reference to
identification at 14.46.

b. In any event I think some reference to the live identification
should be made in the summary and the evidence included in the folder.

c. It is not clear from the statement of C.M. Fisher (p 23) whether
Mr. D.S. Brown is alive or dead at this point or perhaps better what
Mr. Fisher thought about his status.

d. Plans awaited as agreed.


 No 16.   Paul Brian Murray.

 a. Summary . Para 5. I am not keen on the word ’’cursory” as to me it
has an innuendo. It does not occur in the statement and it would be
better deleted.

b. Plans awaited.
  NO 17 Christopher Barry Devonside.

 a. Summary Para 4   I think that the word "shortly" should be deleted.

 b. Summary Para 4. I think that "laid down" may be more correct that
 "carried from the pen".

 c. The surname name in this case was originally spelt wrong. I notice
 that the computer retype of the PM report spells it correctly but the
 original PM report shows it as "Dev e nside". The family I think were
 very concerned that the name on the PM report should be correct and I
 think that a supplemental statement from Prof. Jones confirming that
 he has been told what the correct spelling is and that he is prepared
 to accept this should be obtained.

 d. Plans awaited.



   No. 19 Tracey Elizabeth Cox

a. SPC Lomax seems very clear that he removed deceased from Pen 4. I
think that it might be better to amend Para. 3 to make that clearer. I
assume that locating Tracey in pen 3 is based on visual evidence but
please confirm. If that is so then SPC Lomax is either mistaken or she
was passed over the fence between 3 and 4 .

I have no particular obj ection to an inference or comment being
included in the summary as long it is picked out as such either by
being in brackets or introduced with some word like "comment". This
would apply in all the body files..

b. I think that it would be better to substitute "after a time" for
the words "a few minutes" in Para 4 of the summary.

c. For the sake of completeness please let me have DC 1895 Latham
statement referred to on p 49.

d. Plans awaited in the usual way.


  No 21   Vincent Michael Fitzsimmons.

   Facing sheet. I am doubtful about the common law wife being next of
kin technically. I think we need to mention the parents as well
(assuming he has no children).

b. There is the usual problem of continuity with Dr. Siva. (P 77 & 79)
I think that we will have to sit down when we have gone through all
the files and review Dr. Siva in particular to decide how best to deal
with the outstanding matters.

c. Dr. Siva’s PM report gives the wrong date of death (16.4.89).

d. As a general comment I notice that William Wood 21-33 mentions
several people where he describes external injuries. Do you know
whether these individuals have been identified so that we can compare
the PM reports with his assessment.

e. plans awaited in the usual way.
  NO 22 Brian Christopher Matthews

 a. Para 11 of summary. Please put the comment ’’but this must be in
 doubt       blood analysis" in brackets or otherwise identify as
 comment.

 b. P.J. McGuiness previous statements are not included in the file.
 For completeness please let me have these.

 c. Identification continuity. The pathologist was Dr. Clark not
 Prof. Usher.

 d. Dr. J. Clark is a Consultant Pathologist not a trainee. Can we
 alter the record for this please.

 e. Plans awaited in the usual way.


  NO 23 Peter Andrew Burkett

 a. Summary Para 1. Could you please amend to say after "(reference
 number 34)" " but initially identified as John Cross".

b. On a rather minor point I notice that PC Walton refers to a time
sequence of 15 28 54 to 15 28 56 whilst the video reference on the
schedule and still is timed at 15.28.52 ie 2 seconds earlier. Any
explanation?

c. Plans awaited.

 No 34 Jonathon Owens

a. Summary. Para 1. I think that in this para we should insert the
^0rdSi|,,initially identified as John Cross" after the words "Jonathon
Owens . I know that para 9 seeks to deals with the error.

b. We have the usual problems with continuity with the pathologist.
Also both PC Weigold and Dr. Siva have the first name spelt wrong. We
can discuss this later as to how to best correct it if the
pathologist is not called.

c. Pages 45-47 are duplicates of pages 42-44. Is there in fact another
statement which should be in the folder?

d. Plans are awaited in the usual way.




Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper
H.M. Coroner.

 Dear Stan,

 As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
 I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
 hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
 for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.

  No 6 . Ian David Whelan

 a. Plans awaited

 b. Continuity of identification to pathologist needs sorting out.

  No 11.   Peter Andrew Harrison

a. I am rather confused as to whose son this lad was. See Mr.
Harrison statement in which he refers to him ashis son and as two
friends of Gerry and Alan Blaney.

b. On page 12 (last paragraph) Alan Blaney seems to be saying that the
deceased was his brother Gerry's son.

c. I am confused with regard to the identification as Mr. Harrison
initially identified the lad by the surname Frith. In the equivalent
statement of PC. Wheatley he says on page 30 that the identification
was made in the name of Harrison. In any case there does not seem to
be any statement which clarifies the identifcations.

d. Page 46 and 47. The Pm was in fact done by Dr. Clark though I
believe that the reports were signed by both Dr. Clark and Prof Usher.
However I think that the samples must have been handed over by Dr
Clark though the officer says Prof Usher. Can we sort this out.

 12. Roy Harry Hamilton

a. There is the usual problem of continuity with the pathologist but
in this case there seems to be a statement available according to the
Anna Cappa (statement 1280C0. Can we obtain this for the file please.

 14. Gary Christopher Church

a. Continuity of identification with pathologist needs sorting out.

b. No plans on file but I assume these will be available as discussed.

 15. Carl William Rimmgr

a. Plans awaited as discussed.
 20. Marian Hazel McCabe.

a. Identification continuity to pathologist. P. 68. I think that there
may be a statement no S1280.CQ which deals with this, (see Anna
Cappa).
b. Can you tell me whether the fencing was torn down in Pen 3 as well
as pen 4?




Yours sincerely,




S. L. Popper.

b. There is the usual problem of continuity with Dr. Siva. (P 77 & 79)
I think that we will have to sit down when we have gone through all
the files and review Dr, Siva in particular to decide how best to deal
with the outstanding matters,

c. Dr. Siva's PM report gives the wrong date of death (16.4,89),

d. As a general comment I notice that William Wood 21-33 mentions
several people where he describes external injuries. Do you know
whether these individuals have been identified so that we can compare
the PM reports with his assessment.

e. plans awaited in the usual way.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in my letter of same date but under reference H/comments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not heed
hold up the sending out of the summaries but no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.

 No 6 . Ian David Whelan

a. Plans awaited

b. Continuity of identification to pathologist needs sorting out.

  No 11.   Peter Andrew Harrison

a. I am rather confused as to whose son this lad was. See Mr.
Harrison statement in which he refers to him ashis son and as two
friends of Gerry and Alan Blaney.

b. On page 12 (last paragraph) Alan Blaney seems to be saying that the
deceased was his brother Gerry’s son,

c. I am confused with regard to the identification as Mr. Harrison
initially identified the lad by the surname Frith. In the equivalent
statement of PC. Wheatley he says on page 30 that the identification
was made in the name of Harrison. In any case there does not seem to
be any ist^tement which clarifies the identifcations.

d. Page 46 and 47. The Pm was in fact done by Dr, Clark though I
believe that the reports were signed by both Dr. Clark and Prof ilsher.
However I think that the samples must have been handed over by Dr
Clark though the officer says Prof Usher, Can we sort this out.

 12. Roy Harry Hamilton

a. There is the usual problem of continuity with thepathologist but
in this case there seems to be a statement availableaccording to the
Anna Cappa (statement 1280C0. Can we obtain this for the file please.

 14. Gary Christopher Church

a. Continuity of identification with pathologist needs sorting out.

b. No plans on file but I assume these will be available as discussed.
 15.   Carl William Rimmer

a. Plans awaited as discussed.

 20. Marian Hazel McCabe.

a. Identification continuity to pathologist. P. 68. I think that there
may be a statement no S1280.CQ which deals with this, (see Anna
Cappa).
b. Can you tell me whether the fencing was torn down in Pen 3 as well
as pen 4?




Yours sincerely,




S. L. Popper.

Dear Detective Superintendent Beechey,

Bo; HTLLSBOBOPGH DISASTER - BODY FILES.


As agreed with Mervyn Jones, I am contacting you in connection
with any detailed amendments which I think perhaps should be
made to the files.

I have already mentioned to Inspector Tobe that the summaries
are fine, my only reservation being because they are in the
third person and do not contain quotes may give rise to perhaps
some extra questions from solicitors. However, as the format
has already been settled, and I believe that the majority of
cases have already been drafted, I do not think that there is
very much we can do about it at this stage.

I have now managed to read through several files and would
like to draw the following points to your attention:-

Deceased Reference No.2. Inger Shah.

On the summary sheet at the front of the file, I notice that
the next of kin are given as Ellen Holbeck a sister. I think     ( &i»
strictly speaking, the next of kin are the children. I wonder f                                   jyo
whether we ougjit to, in this particular case, put the children -J  O
in brackets against next of kin. On the summary sheet paragraph ")
4, I think it might perhaps be a good idea to add a sentence      (  <
to the effect that Gary Oyitech saw Inger Shah within the Pen     f
after a final         and formed the impression that she was      )
obviously dead (Page 24).

With regard to the time of death (referred to in the outlined
summary sheet and also in the summary itself at Paragraph 8 )where                                 ,
there is a specific time of 1555 hours given, I cannotfind the     „—                         —
evidence for this as Dr. Ball merely seems to say thathe
certified various people between 1550 and 1650 hours.                                         ^

 There may be some simple explanation for this but I think
 it may be wiser to give the time bracket, unless there is evidence
 from say a police officer (as there is in one or two of the other
 cases) where a specific time is actually mentioned.
                                                                                     cont1d

                                                -     2     -



There are one or two other points in some of the statements, at
least in one of the statements which I do not find quite right,                               ^
but they are not relevant as far as these Inquests are concerned
so I will not refer to them.

Decgsed Reference No.3. Gary Harrison.

Page 16 of the statement. The statement from Simon Weigold
seems patently incorrect as the body appears to have been identified
to him initially by number only, the full identification not having
taken place until the Sunday.                                                                      .<

I think that this is probably just wording but it might be
better at some point to correct this.                                                  v,   v V T ’S S


Deceased Reference No.4. David George Rimmer.

In the summary Paragraph 2, I think we should specify the time
when they entered the Pen which appears to have been at about 1438
(see Page 10).

Deceased Reference No.81 Thomas Howard.

Page 20 of Peter Muir's statement seems to have a patent error on it.
He says that an ambulance collected the body from the temporary
mortuary at 5.25p.m. and took it to the Medico Legal Centre where
he stayed and identified it to someone as Body 81.

That I think is patently wrong in that the polaroid photographs
were not taken until well after that. The summary seems to have
got it right, but I am not quite sure how.

I am of course open to correction on any comments which I may
maicft to you. In addition, the on|y ones that are really urgent
are any typing corrections to the summary sheets ® those are                                /U
the documents which will have to be sent out.                                                            *-**»

but you will be able to contact me at my home where I will be
a good bit of the time. The phone number is 0602 - 233344                                   (]{x    At\^ ^

Dear

As you will no doubt be aware the interim inquests concerning the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster are being resumed on 18th April 1990.
The first two days will be held at the -Memorial Hall in the centre of
Sheffield and not at the Medico Legal Centre, On the first day we are
starting at 10.30 a.m.

It has also been possible to list the interim resumed inquest into the
death of
for                        April 1990 at ,                am/pm
and this will take place at the Medico Legal Centre , Watery Street
Sheffield. Your legal representatives have also been -written, to. If
any change with regard to these arrangements have to be made you will
be notified.
                              L
Attached to this letter is an information pack regarding location and
other Blatters which I hope you will find useful. If you have some
pressing query regarding the arrangements please contact the Listing
Officer at Furnival House, Sheffield. Tel. 0742 762342.

You will appreciate that there are several inquests listed for each
day. To avoid inconvenience to others and to endeavour to complete
each day’s work my aim is to start at or as near as possible to the
listing times stated. If you wish to be present at the inquest it
is essential that you should be at the location on time.

Having just stated how important it is that you should not be late
I also have to say that you must be prepared to find that the start
of the inquest could be delayed because for example another inquest
has over run* Obviously I do not want to inconvenience you but I a®
sure that you will bear with me if you are in fact kept waiting.

As space is limited at the Medico Legal Centre should you become aware
that a largish number of relatives or friends may wish to attend the
inquest (say more than 12) please let my Listing Officer know and give
him an estimate of the numbers involved. He will then try to reserve
extra seats for you in the court room.

Both I and the officers involved in the preparation for these inquests
are conscious that returning to Sheffield for the inquest is likely to
be upsetting for you. I recognise that this is inevitable and am
sorry that it has to be so. You may like to know that a considerable
amount of effort has gone into the arrangements for the inquest to
try to avoid unneccessary stress or pain to you.


Yours sincerely,

Dear

Because of the time for which the inquest Into the death of your loved
one has been listed arrangements have been made to reserve and make
available to you one twin bedded room at the Rutland Hotel 452,
Glossop Road, Sheffield S10 2PY. (Tel. No, 0742 664411) for one night
on a bed and breakfast basis. You would not be charged for this
accomodation but obviously any charges for extras or additional
services above the bed and breakfast arrangements would have to be for
your account.

If other raesbers of the family also wish to stay overnight in
Sheffield then they will have to make their own arrangements at their
expense. Please note that because of events in Sheffield accomodation
may be scarce.

If you do not wish to take advantage of the accomodation referred to
above please let my Listing Officer know as soon as possible (Tel 0742
762342) so that the room can be released back to the hotel.



Yours sincerely,




S. L. Popper.
H.M. Coroner.

Dear Hr. Fraser,

                Limited Resumed Inquests - iiillsborough


I enclose a copy of a schedule shewing the time and date when each
individual inquest for the 95 deceased of the Hillsborough disaster
will be held.

I have written to the individual solicitors representing specific
persons and no doubt you will have received a letter in respect of
the persons whom your firm represents.

I hope that the listing schedule is clear to you.

To all Pathologist who
undertook post mortem examinations
in connection with the deceased
at Hillsborough Stadium on 15.4.89.


Dear
          Resumed limited inquests - Hillsborough.

I enclose a copy of a schedule showing the times and dates when the
individual inquests into each of the 95 persons who died at
Hillsborough will be held.

Also shown on the schedule are the names of the pathologist who
performed the respective postmortems and I would be grateful if you
could verify that the names shown as applicable to you are as you
understand it. If you spot an error please let me know.

The list has been prepared to take account of the dates and times when
you have indicated that you would be available, I understand from
my listing officers that it has been possible to so arrange the list
as not to encroach on any of the dates which did not individually suit
you. I am very pleased about this.

Would you please reserve the dates and times shewn on the schedule
and assume for the time being that you will be required to attend
each individual inquest.

It may be that once we have got through the first few days it may be
possible to deal with some of the cases by way of documentary evidence
and consequently be able to avoid having to ask you to attend for each
and every case. If that were to happen I will let you know as soon as
possible in order to avoid inconvenience for you. However at this
stage please assume that you will be required at the times and dates
shown on the schedule.


Yours sincerely,

     Dear Stefan

     I refer to my recent telephone conversations with you.

     I now write to confirm that the Conference with Counsel has been
     fixed for 2 p.m. on Wednesday, 17th January next.  The Conference is
     to take place at Dr. Powers' Chambers at 1 Paper Buildings, The
     Temple.   Incidentally, please note that according to my Law List
     there are two sets of Counsels Chambers at 1 Paper Buildings.
     Should you require this information, the Clerk to Dr. M.J. Powers is
     Mr. W.K. Oliver, and his telephone number is 01 583 7355.

     You may recall that my Articled Clerk, Richard Hammond, was present
     at our meeting on the 2 2nd November. With your approval I intend to
     arrange for Richard Hammond to attend the Conference with you.

     I am enclosing a photocopy of my Instructions to Counsel, and you
     will note that with just one or two exceptions my Instructions
     follow your draft Instructions almost word for word.  It is only a
     photocopy of the carbon copy, and so I am afraid that it is not of
     quite the quality of the original.

     With all best wishes for the new year.

     Your sir

            INQUEST ARRANGEMENTS

            You will find attached a very useful report by Detective Superintendent
            Taylor after his visit to Bradford to consider their experiences in
            supporting the Coroner's Inquests. Attached are also some helpful comments
            from the officer in charge, Detective Chief Superintendent Cooper.

            We are also making contact with other forces, including Kent over the
            Zeebrugge Disaster, and no doubt we will be able to add their experience
            which should help us support you in a smooth and efficient operation.

          BRADFORD CITY FIRE DISASTER
SUBJECT                                                          DATE    13 October 1989


          On Monday, 2 October 1989, as you are aware, w ith Detective Superintendent
          Beechey, I travelled to West Yorkshire Police HQ, Wakefield, to liaise with
          Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin COOPER, the Officer in charge of the
          investigation concerning the Bradford City Football Club - Fire disaster. The
          purpose of the visit was twofold, to look at the way in which the Police
          investigated and reported on the disaster, and subsequent arrangements by the
          Police in respect of the Inquest at Bradford. The way the Police serviced the
          Judicial Inquiry I had already ascertained was not dissimilar to that carried
          out by u s .

          Dealing w ith the investigations and reporting to the Coroner, basically each
          officer was allocated responsibility for dealing w ith a body and preparing all
          statements in relation to same. At the completion of his enquiries Itoe prepared
          the sudden death report/a precis of the evidence. Obviously these enquiries
          were supervised and co-ordinated by Detective Chief Superintendent Cooper and
          other Senior Officers working with him.       In addition each of the Senior
          Officers was given responsibility for certain aspects of the disaster i.e. the
          Safety Certificate (and there were problems in relation to this at Bradford).
          These officers prepared separate reports on each aspect again acting under the
          directions   and co-ordination of Detective Chief Superintendent Cooper, who in
          turn worked very closely with the Coroner.        From this series of reports a
          master report was compiled and submitted.

          Moving n o w to the Inquest, a combination of the better witnesses identifed
          during the Judicial Inquiry coupled with selected other witnesses was used to
          establish the general situation i.e. the big picture. Included amongst these
          were   the     professionals,  members   of   the  other   emergency   services,
          representatives from the Club etc..         After they had given their evidence,
          evidence in relation to the individual deceased was dealt with. In my opinion,
          the way in which this was done could be of considerable interest to us in
          relation       to   the Sheffield   Wednesday Football Club disaster inquest,
          consequently I will deal with it in slightly more detail. Let me say from the
          onset that I accept that the inquest into the Hillsborough disaster is likely
          to be much more contentious than that at Bradford and the Coroner for Sheffield
          Dr. Pop pe r ’s approval would have to be sought before we could consider doing
          the same thing.

          I have previously mentioned that each officer conducted enquiries in relation
          to a particular deceased and prepared a precis of the evidence. This precis
          was served on Solicitors acting for each of the deceased by the Coroner. If
          the evidence contained in the precis is accepted, then the officer that
          prepared it was called to the inquest to give evidence and answer questions
          (bypassing the hearsay rules of evidence applicable in a Criminal Court). On
          the other hand, if all or any part of the evidence was challenged, and this
          could not be mutually agreed before the inquest, then either all the witnesses,
 Continued


or only those necessary to deal with the challenged part of the evidence
were called. In the latter case, the Police Officer completing the enquiry
still gave evidence which remained un-challenged.

Clearly implementing this procedure had a considerable effect in reducing
the numbers of witnesses required to give evidence and, therefore, the time
necessary to complete the inquest. Detective Chief Superintendent Cooper
as O . I . C . remained at the inquest from start to finish and gave his
evidence last. At this time he was able to pick up all the relevant points
he needed to clarify or develop from evidence already given. This again
was done in close consultation with the Coroner who identified many of the
points. This course of actions is strongly commended by Detective Chief
Superintendent Cooper.
The copy of a paper produced for us by Detective Chief Superintendent
Cooper concerning this inquest is attached, and he has indicated that he
would be prepared to travel to the Incident Room Nechells Green, in the
future to develop any of the points made. I think this would be of benefit
to us, and subject to your agreement I will arrange at a mutually
convenient time. In the meantime I would suggest we visit the Kent
Constabulary to see how they dealt with the Zeebrugge disaster which has
other involvements w ith crimial aspects.

R. Taylor,
Detective Superintendent
FOR THE ATTENTION OF WEST MIDLANDS OFFICERS
(RE HILLSBOROUGH)



For the information of West Midlands officers

responsible for arranging jury into the inquest

involving the Hillsborough tragedy -

Court Venue

1.    Establish if the usual coroners court facilities

     are sufficient to cater for the requirements.

2.   Consider using a larger court room.


Considerations

a)   is the size of the actual court room large enough

     to accommodate jury,
                                           %
     relatives of deceased,

     lawyers representing relatives,

     lawyers representing other organisations,

     press,

     public.

b)   Accommodation should include -

     waiting room,

     jury room,

     interview room,                             *»
     rest room.

c)   Telephone provision for police, public and media.

d)   Separate entrance and exit for witnesses and jury.

e)   Provision inside the court room for housing montage

     of photographs, model of ground, television screens.
Equipment

Additional seating

notices for identifying areas ie relatives, press, public,

police

Montage of photographs

Notepads and pens for jury

Model of ground


Technical Aids

Provision to tape the entire hearing.

Audio tape recorder.

Video tape recorder.

L o u d s peakers.

Television or television screen.

Note - Advisable to have a technical expert available

throughout trial to cover the eventuality of a technical

breakdown.


Ushers

Numerous ushers and policewomen to be available to smooth

the flow of proceedings.


Advisable to have Detective Officers in court to be used

as runners and       'c ha p e r o n e r s ' of witnesses.


Security

Cover eventuality of public order problems using discreetly

placed uniform personnel.


Cover security of documents - particularly photographs.
                       3.

Consider alarming premises overnight.


Tea and Refreshment

Advisable to have refreshment available throughout.


Medical

Advisable to have St John's Ambulance standing by.

Collapses can occur.


Holding Area for Witnesses

Advisable to use a separate building where witnesses

can be housed prior to being conveyed to the court room.

Advantage - this keeps the witnesses away from members

of the public.
                            -b-ClLjt-t0*aJ-     fJi   iho«A^       n6HU<
Transport

1.   Conveying witnesses to and from the court room

     (from holding area).

2.   For use by jury -

     advisable to collect and deposit daily.

     Maybe that the jury will wish to visit scenes -

     a vehicle will be particularly useful under those

     circumstances.

                   Co*                        LcuJJiihS,
Overnight accommodation                "

Advisable to consider housing the jury overnight whilst

they are considering their verdict.            It is unusual for

the coroners to have to provide this facility but will

very likely occur.
Coroner's clerk

Useful to employ a member of the enquiry team alongside

the Coroner's clerk with a direct line to the incident room.

This will facilitate the easy retrieval of information in

the event of a discrepancy arising.


Shorthand writer

Advisable to have Police shorthand writer in court in

the event of certain evidence being recorded.


Media

Media will almost certainly wish to attend with jury at

the scene.   Security can be a problem (contempt of court

could be useful).


Important to employ a Press Officer to act as liaison

officer between police,   coroner and the media.


Police Behaviour

Important that briefing of police officers reminds them

of conduct specifically loose talk, inappropriate laughter,

etc.


Coroner

Coroner may need to be briefed to the effect that he will

be needed to face the media before, during and after the

inquest.


Good jury bailiff essential.


Selection of foreman is important.
Should decide on a policy regarding commendations

and awards.   May be better to defer all to anoth

place and time.    —    *<Lk~    &


Selection of Witnesses

Police

Fire

Ambulance

Security Ground Staff

Rescuees not injured

Rescuees injured

Escapees

Selection of those with comments about the deaths

Selection of media

Scientists

Last of all SIO who should sit in throughout.




Have copies of public enquiry recommendations available.

X enclose a copy of the transcript of the conversation which
we had on the 21st of July 1989.

There are one or two erross in the transcript bat I have

please aark it and we will try and have another listen, and
re-transcribe that section.

 FILE NOTE DATED 22.11.89. EE HILLSBOROUGH - MEETING WITH IAN ROTHERA
IN NOTTINGHAM AT THE OFFICES OF ROTHERA.____________________________

I met Ian Rothera and his articled clerk to discuss obtaining Counsel's
opinion and in particular on the question of the release of documents
and the form and scope of the Inquest on the assumption that the
D.P.P. does not prosecute.

I outlined the background and handed over draft instruction to Counsel
which I had prepared and which I invited them to use as they wished.
We discussed the matter generally and in particular noted that the
question of criminal prosecution was a difficult one and obviously
the D.P.P. would take a considerable amount of time and one of the
issues which no doubt he would have to consider would be whether a
person who does his best, even it is an incompetent best in someone's
judgement can be ajudged as grossly n«glig§nt within the meaniag of a
manslaughter charge.   By the same token, one had to consider whether
if it is true that a mass of people were pressing forward particularly
outside the turnstiles and if it were true that a large number of these
were neither drunk nor ticketless^seems to be the burden of the Public Inquiry
and if it is correct that they had a single minded determination to enter
as suggested by Lord Justice Taylor whether that could constitute gross
negligence particularly ip. one compared that sort of behaviour with
what would have happened if this had been a religious convention
(.as seems to have been Alluded to by one of the ouimsellijl's in his submissiony
I think the 6he for the Football Supporters Clubj,
The point of course being whether a football crowd is intrinsicaLlyd!fferent
to other crowds.   We noted that quite apart from evidential problems
associated with the crowds, this was a very difficult and complex subject
as if one looked at each individual on his own, that individual could not
have been able to make any difference, but when individual activities are
summed, a different situation arises.
Fortunately this is aproblem at this stage for thevrDJP.P. and not for us.
The matter was left with Rotheras who will no doubt be getting in touch
with me when they are in a position to let me know what Counsel has to say.

                          Conference Preliminary Notes
                 Re: Inquest into Hillsborough Tragedy 15.4.89

                                17 January 1990


Pr e s e n t :

Dr. Stefan Popper (Coroner for South Yorkshire West District)
Dr. Michael Powers (Counsel)


Events outstanding:

The further report by Taylor L.J.;


DPP - West Midlands          Police   dealing with   investigations on the
criminal aspects;

West Midlands Police (and other Forces) also presently dealing
with the complaints to the Police Complaints Authority;

Civil Proceedings - ?first substantive hearing fixed for 19th.
June 1990 - quantum only?



I ssues:

What is the present pressure from public and relatives for the
Inquests to be resumed?


If there is any pressure, what is the nature of the pressure?
- ?to explore issues of liability - criminal / civil
- ?to open up issues of general public concern
- ?to determine how (in a very restricted sense) and where
  individuals died


What statutory pressure is there to resume the inquests?


In the light of the DPP enquiries what should done?
S.16 Coroners Act 1988


The release of documentation - what should be done?

-       the question of     confidentiality
-       the question of     prejudicing the inquest
-the     question           of   restriction  of   use      of       disclosed
        documentation
-       the question of      what documentation eg PM reports


The resumption and scope of the Inquests
?The appointment of an amicus curiae




Options:

(a)   On the release of documentation:

      i)    Only release the PM reports (already done - see Rules);

      ii)   Release all documentation obtained by the coroner for
            the purpose of the inquest;

      iii) Release   only   if compelled   to do    so by Order   of High
           Court;

      iv)   Indicate that no objection will be taken to the release
            of any evidence gathered by the West Midlands Police
            if they choose to do so;

      v)    Seek the approval      of   the   DPP   before   release   of
            documentation.


      My preferred option to be helpful is (iv).          To be safe my
      preferred option is (iii).


(b)   On the resumption of Inquest:

      i)    Wait until threatened with Judicial Review for failure
            to do so;

      ii)   Notwithstanding that it is not necessary to do so
            pursuant to S.16(1) Coroners Act 1988, ascertain from
            the DPP if he would prefer the inquest to be adjourned
            pending the completion of the criminal investigation
            and any decision taken on criminal charges falling
            within S.17 of the Act; - then use this declared
            preference as some protection against (i);

      iii) Proceed with the Inquest into the deaths of each case
           individually dealing only with those matters which
           directly concern the relatives: viz: the time, manner,
           mode and place of death.      This would require very
           strict control of the inquiry - allowing the relatives
           every opportunity to deal with the personal matters
           surrounding the death and leaving in reserve the issues
           common to all the deaths. HOW? and the (non-requisite)
           WHY? would have to be left to a resumed inquest at some
           distant time in the future;

      iv)   Proceed with a full inquiry as soon as enquiries are
            complete for the purpose of the inquest.
My preferred option is iii).    It is very likely that
by the time the inquest has to be resumed to deal with
the sensitive question of HOW, the impetus will be
taken out of interested parties' desire to know etc.,
or the DPP will have pursued criminal charges bringing
the coroner under the protection of S.16(3) of the Act.
This also would go a very long way towards meeting the
requirements of the Steering Committee and those acting
on behalf of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire.

RE CONFERENCE WITH COUNSEL WITH DR. MICHAEL POWERS.

ON 17.1.90 AT 1 PAPER BUILDING, TEMPLE, LONDON.



Dr. Powers advised in conference in considerable detail.




1.     With regard to the release of documentation.   Dr Powers

       was of the opinion that I had no authority to release

       statements which I obtained from the police as part and

       parcel of the inquiry into this death.   He based his

       opinion on two cases one was Hicks reported to Weekly

       Law Report 1980 Page 496 and followed in 1987 in the

       case of Hicks.   Basically what the court decided was

       that the documentation was handed over in confidence

       and that in the circumstances the coroner did not

       have the right to release it without the consent of

       the poice authority.



       He said the only other way in which police could be

       forced would be under Section 34 of the 1981 Supreme

       Court Act Order 24 Rule 7a (2).   In under that order

       discovery of documents could be ordered against non-

       parties.   His very strong advice was that I should not




POPACB
                            2



   produce the documents unless ordered to do so by the

   Co u r t .



   This is not to say that the West Midlands Police

   could not release the documents to the parties,

   provided of course they were released from any

   obligation secrecy/confidentiality by the D.P.P.

   and myself and the Solicitors Complaints Bureau

   probably.



   He felt that once the D.P.P. had indicated that he

   did not wish the documents confidential then if I

   was minded to release them I could indicate to the

   West Midlands that as far as I was concerned I had

   no objection to their release.



   He did note the anomaly that if the West Midlands were

   acting as my officers in this matter, then it would

   be rather strange that I could authorise them to

   release the documents and yet not be able to do so

   myself.      On the other hand, they were of course

   holding the documents in various capacities.



   We spent some time discussing the rights and wrongs of

    leaving the Inquest adjourned.     Dr. Powers pointed out

    thatthe provisions of the Coroners Act did not apply

    at the present time,     because no one had been charged




POPACB
   with any offence which is the pre-requisite of Section

   16.1.    On the other hand, under the Coroners Rules

   (Rules 26 & 27) these Rules do give a certain

   discretion to the Coroner that provided that requests

   have been suitably made, the Coroner may of course

   adjourn, provided that he has exercised his discretion

   judicially.    The thing that concerned Counsel was

   that the Coroner also had a duty to inquire as soon

   as possible, and that in these circumstances, very long

   adjournments could perhaps be challenged.    On the whole

   though, he felt that provided the requests had been

   properly made and that there was good reason, this was

   probably satisfactory.



   We briefly discussed the release of the post mortem

   reports which seemed to be in a somewhat different

   category, although there was some ambiguity in the

   Rules.    The Rule 57 could be construed as authorising

   and release of a post mortem report before the

   conclusion of the Inquest.



   We then turned to the actual running of the Inquest.

   Counsel was quite strongly of the opinion that it would

   be a good thing if prior to the decision of the D.P.P.

    I were to resume the Inquest with a view to taking

    evidence on the matters which directly affected the




POPACB
relatives, namely, the time, manner, mode and place

of death.   He envised that present at the hearing would

simply be the relatives, the pathologist, a senior

police officer.   The senior police officer's job basically

would be to give a summary of the locations where the

deceased was found.   Dr. Powers agreed that one would have

to be very strict to ensure that no questions were asked

or dealt with with regard to how, i.e., the broader

issues of this disaster, bearing in mind the D.P.P's

involvement.   The reason for his suggestion was that he

felt that it the Inquests were dealt with in this way,

it would take a lot of the heat out of the situation, the

relatives would be told what concerned them most, namely,

details about their particular loved ones, and it was

quite possible in his view that when the timne came to

resume the Inquest, to deal with the question of how,

that it might be possible to deal with it very very shortly

(even assuming that the D.P.P. had not taken proceedings).



He also felt that if we dealt with this in this way, a

lot of the information which was required for the civil

proceedings, i.e., the nature of the injuries, the length

and degree of suffering would become available and this

might be of use in their civil litigation side or claims

against the police or other authorities.




POPACB
He also felt that it wo uld be a good idea if I had

an administrative meeting with the interested legal

representatives to discuss the method of dealing with

the matter.



He felt it was v ery important that adequate arrangements

were made for the reception of the families.      That if

possible families should be dealt w ith on an

individual basis,   so that they could feel that they

were important, and that their interests were being

looked after.



I said that I wo uld consider carefully his advice

on this matter.




Counsel's advice is very similar to what Dr. Knapman did

with regard to the Clapham Train Disaster.      The difference

is that in his case, he had the pathology and the location

of the individuals very early on before the D.P.P.      in fact

became involved.    Also bearing in mind that we would not be

willing to disclose statements,   I think there    could be

problems with preparing summaries wh ich were not




POPACB
controversial.   I did suggest to Cousel in fact that we

would agree the precis with the solicitors etc., but

he wasn't that keen on that aspect of the matter.



I also think that judging from what one reads in the

paper about the feelings which Hillsborough has generated,

that it is unlikely that the families would loose interest,

though I have no doubt that their main primary concern is

details of their own individual loved ones.



As always everything hinges on the D.P.P.     If he decides

to prosecute then of course the families will have got

in a sense what they want, a full criminal hearing.     If

it doesn't, then I think it may well be that some will

want to go for a private prosecution and if that is so,

they are going to want to get as much information as

possible out of the Inquest and they are unlikely to

take the view that the how of the Inquest can be dealt

with very briefly.



There was one other interesting observation which Counsel

made namely that he felt that this interim hearing should

be without a Jury and indeed if it turned out that the

interest in the Inquest was lost, he thought it might be

possible to deal with the whole of it without a Jury on the

basis that nobody would complain.

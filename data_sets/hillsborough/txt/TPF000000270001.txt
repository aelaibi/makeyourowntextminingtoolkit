 Dear Member,
      The first quarterly meeting of the Joint Branch Board was held on

  The Chairman welcomed Mr. Graham Revill, the Inspectors     Traffic

  2.      MINUTES OF THE LAST MEETING
                        ih.wh—
                       ]proposed and
                                 —   1           seconded that the minutes
          of the last meeting were a true record. This was agreed by the
          members.
  3. (A) TREASURER'S REPORT
           The Treasurer reported he had presented the accounts and the
           Balance Sheet for 1991, to the members. He said that the
           Auditors were very pleased with the state of the accounts.
           They said we had a good trading.
                                                                                                                             3.

     the experiment can introduce it. We would be looking at the
     next two years before we knew whether it would be successful
     or not.
                 said any Force could introduce it. S he had_ _ _ _ _
     rpr.ent.ly attended a meeting in Birmingham where
     I ’w I   |I I   I w   Q   I- I-C   I IV 1 -V 1   ^   11■* - ^   W   I I I ^4   III   ••   J   ----   |
                                                                                                          ___________________________   I

     had stated this.            H s a i d regarding career breaks she
     had not received the minutes from this meeting as she only
     receives her copy the day prior to the next meeting. It was
     noted that if any officer took a career break they could not
     take another job in that time. It looked like an extended
     leave break without pay.
     The Secretary said we would receive full details because this
     subject would be discussed at the Open Meeting.
C) Hillsborounh Disaster. The Secretary said he had nothing
   further to report other than the matter was still carrying
   on. There had been a meeting at the Grosvenor on the 31
   January, for the lawyers to h ave another discussion about the
   officers' claims.             had attended this meeting as an
   observer. It was noted the claims were progressing but it
   would possibly be years before they were actually resolved.
   Mr. Middup said there were some potentially large claims. He
   added this matter had the full support of the J.C.C.
D) C.P.S. - Court Attendances - Unnecessary Deviations. This
   matter was being dealt with at the J.N.C.C. and a survey was
   being prepared within the Courts and the results were coming
   out with interesting statistics. A considerable number of
   officers were attending Court who were not needed - not
   giving evidence - but we always knew this. The Secretary
   said somebody was going to find the colossal waste of police
   time and money with this research. It was noted that the
   Chief Constable would be pushing this issue.
     Mr. Middup said the survey would be able to show precisely
     the figures and the huge cost.
E)    Sale of Police Houses. The Secretary recommended this item
      could now be removed from the agenda. He said we had been
      successful and we had also been able to sell the houses to
      the recently retired officers. The Police Authority had,
      however, refused to give us any discount but the purchase
      price of the houses had been very reasonable. It appears
      there was a built-in discount in the price anyway. Members
      agreed to remove this item from the agenda.
F) Packed Meals (R).                 Ih ad raised this subject and
   he now asked for it to be removed. If any problems did arise
   then                would take them on board and bring the
   matter back if necessary. It was agreed to remove it from
   the agenda.

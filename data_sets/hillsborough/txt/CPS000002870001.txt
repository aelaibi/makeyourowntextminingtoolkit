                   for Hillsborough j ^
                   Sir: If there is to be a fresh inquiry
                   into the tragedy at Hillsborough
                 . (report, 27 June), would it be too
                   much to ask that representation is
                   taken from some of those who
                   actually tried to cram themselves into
                   the already overcrowded terraces,
                   thereby generating the deadly crush?
                      No matter how many other factors
                   were involved in the disaster, the fact
                   remains that it was the awful dynamics
                   of a moving crowd that caused so
                   many dcaths.This would lie a prime
                   opportunity for those people to accept
                   that they played a massive role in what
                   happened on that awful day, instead
                   of trying to place responsibility solely
                   at the feet of others.

    A futile exercise ^
    T    HERE is nothing to be gained from launching yet
         another inquiry into the 1989 Hillsborough disas­
         ter. The Home Secretary, Mr Jack Straw, is in dan­
    ger of making himself look as foolish as Lord Parkin­
    son, who as Transport Secretary in 1990 re-opened the
    inquiry into the sinking of the Titanic, which, after two
    years, found: “The simple fact is that there are no vil­
    lains in this story — just human beings with human
    characteristics.” The Hillsborough tragedy has already
    been exhaustively studied and a similar explanation
    has been provided. Nobody can benefit from a new and
    expensive trawl through the evidence, in search of
    scapegoats.

    Time for truth                          b
    THE relatives of the Hillsborough
    victims have got what they want. A
    new inquiry.
      Yesterday’s announcement by Home
    Secretary Jack Straw was welcomed
    all-round.
     Now there can be justice for those
    parents who have suffered twice over
    because the tragedy was not investigated
    completely.
      Even the new Shadow Home Secre­
    tary, Bilan Mawhinney, welcomed Mr
    Straw’s announcement.

     The then Tory Home Secretary,
    Michael Howard, said there might be
    grounds for re-opening the case. But
    he did nothing.
     Thankfully we now have a Labour Home
    Secretary who doesn’t just talk, but acts.

                   Straw may open new inquiry ^
                   Mr Jack Straw, home secretary, yesterday raised hopes
                   th at he was to open a new inquiry into the Hillsborough
                   disaster, confirming he would make a Commons state­
                   ment on Monday. Families of the victims, who have long
                   been pressing for a new probe into the 1989 tragedy, have
                   been invited to London on Monday to meet Mr Straw. As
                   Liverpool supporters entered the Sheffield Wednesday
                   ground for an FA cup semi-final match, more than 96
                   people were crushed to death. Families have been
                   demanding an inquiry to look at fresh video and medical
                   evidence which has emerged relating to the handling of
                   events by South Yorkshire police. The Crown Prosecution
                   Service is still reviewing the case.       Liam Halligan

New hope
for justice^
IT has taken eight years but at last
we may learn the truth about what
happened at Hillsborough.
 WE KNOW that 96 people died,
most of them youngsters.
  WE KNOW the suffering of those
who were left to mourn loved ones.
  WE KNOW the battle they have
had to find out exactly what caused
the disaster.
  Now Jack Straw , th e Home
Secretary, is to order a new and
proper investigation into the tragedy.
  T h a t is a vindicaUon o f those who
have fought so hard to find out tKe
truth.
  Hillsborough touched the whole
nation. And the cover-up which
followed caused near-universal
revulsion.
  Those whose failings led to the
disaster must a t least face u v to.w hat
they did.
  Hopefully the new inquiry will
discover the truth. But it is a
triumph that it is being held at all.
  A triumph for Jack Straw, who has
done the decent and right thing.
 And for the H illsborough relatives,
who fought so hard for th is moment;

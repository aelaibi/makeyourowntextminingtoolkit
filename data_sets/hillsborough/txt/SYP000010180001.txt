4.30 pm 18.4.1989

FROM:   ACC (Operations) West Midlands Constabulary

From 19 April 1989 Superintent Roy Taylor will assume responsibility for

the enquiry based at Hammerton Road.             He will be responsible      for all

mattters of policy under the authority of Lord Justice Peter Taylor.



With immediate effect only those enquiries necessary to preserve evidence

will be undertaken.    For example, no interviews will be undertaken, except

under circumstances where people volunteer information and an enquiry is

necessary   to   ascertain   the   nature   of    the   information   and   preserve

evidence.   Superintendent Taylor will make the necessary decision in areas

of ambiguity.

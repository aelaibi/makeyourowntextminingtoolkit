                        C. DIVISION PROSECUTIONS

On Saturday 15th April 19 89 I commenced duty at 8.30 am at Main Street

Police Station, Rotherham, for football duties in connection with the

semi-final at Hillsborough Football Ground.

I was in charge of Serials 4l to 43 on Sub-Sector 1 6 ; my immediate

supervising Officer was Chief Inspector Purdy,

Basically those duties allocated to my serials involved Public Order

patrols both before and after the match in Halifax Road from the Wadsley

Bridge Railway Station to the termination of the dual carriageway at the

junction of Halifax Road and Deerlands Avenue. Halifax Road and the

surrounding streetswere designated as the arrival and parking area for

Liverpool supporters.   I know this area very well having spent the first

seven or eight years of my 22 years service working in that area.

I also worked the semi-final the year before last when Leeds United played

Coventry City and my duties then were almost identical to those on this

occasion.

I live within one mile of that area and regularly use Halifax Road.

I am a football supporter and attend almost all the Sheffield Wednesday

home fixtures at Hillsborough.

I have worked at most of the semi-finals at Hillsborough over the years

and many first division matches in my early years of service.

I was also on duty for the World Cup matches held at Hillsborough in

1966 .

I addition I have regularly performed duties as a Sergeant at the Sheffield

United football ground at Bramvall Lane and occasional duties at the other

three South Yorkshire football league ; grounds.

I was on duty at the semi-final between Liverpool and Notts. Forest in

1988, when my duties concerned supervision of serials responsible for the

Leppings Lane Turnstiles.
On Saturday 15th April 1989 I set off from Main Street Police Station

for Hillsborough shortly before 9-00 am in a Personnel Carrier with

Serial Number 42 led by PS 2171 Keenan.

We travelled via Halifax Road and I indicated to Officers in the vehicle

that section which was to be patrolled by Serial Number 42.       We arrived

at the ground at 9*30 am for a 10.00 am briefing.      The briefing took place

at 10.00 am and after having a packed lunch, at 11.00 am I walked from the

ground to Halifax Road with Serials 4l to 43.

There was no change to those duties allocated in the operational briefing

notes.   About 11.20 am together with PS Keenan I approached the White

Horse Public House in Halifax Road with a view to establishing whether

or not the licensee intended opening.     As I did so a male person who

identified himself as the licensee came out of the premises.        He indicated

that the premises would be open until 4.00 pm that day but would close

at that time until all Football supporters had left the area.

He said that both sets of supporters were welcome and that supporters from

both teams were already in the premises.     He said that arrangements had been

made to have doormen control those persons wishing to enter the premises

and he did not anticipate any trouble.

I visited the premises with PS Keenan, there were a small number of persons

inside but no problems.   PS Keenan informed Control that premises were to

remain open until 4.00 pm.

After patrolling Halifax Road to ensure all serials were in position, about

11.45 am I returned to Halifax Road at its junction with Southey Green Road.

In Southey Green Road at this location and across from the White Horse Public

House is a 'Thresher' off-licence.      I noticed that the premises were full

of Liverpool football supporters who were buying packs of beer and lager.

I went into   the premises and saw that there wereonly two female assistants

serving but   there were no problems.    I returned   about mid-day and noticed

that the number of persons entering the off-licence were being controlled

and limited   to about six persons at any one time.    One   shop assistant was

manning and   locking the entrance door whilst the    other was serving

customers.     A queue of about fifteen to twenty supporters was formed

up on the pavement outside and whilst I had the premises under

observation the queue remained fairly constant at that sort of number.

(The premises later closed about 2.00 pm apparently having sold out of

packs of lager and beer, although I cannot confirm the reason for closing).

It was around twelve mid-day when I also noticed that the White Horse Public

House doors were closed due to the premises being full.

There were approximately one hundred Liverpool fans packed outside on the

terracing and beer garden at the front of the premises.      They were all

drinking from cans and bottles apparently purchased from the Thresher Off-

licence.     Around that time Pc Osborne   mentioned to me that a youth had

gone into a ladies hairdressers shop situated above the shopping precinct

near to the Thresher off-licence and had to be ejected after requesting

the staff to do his    hair. He was under the influence of drink.

Large numbers of Liverpool Supporters were arriving in private cars and

vans and parking on the estate roads off Halifax Road.     As the supporters

walked along Halifax Road I noticed that many of them were drinking from

cans or bottles.     Although some were drinking soft drinks I distinctly

recall thinking to myself that I had never in all my experience of working

and attending football matches seen so many people consuming intoxicating

liquor in the street.     Sometime after 12.30 pm I heard a radio message to

the effect that a transit van had driven away from a shop after the

occupants had been shop-lifting.     I then heard that the vehicle had

been seen travelling along Foxhill Road which forms     a junction with Halifax

Road at the Wadsley Bridge Railway Station.

A few minutes later the Transit van was driven on to the car park of the

White Horse Public House followed by a Police transit van containing

Inspector Robinson and other officers.

The occupants who were Liverpool supporters were detained and placed

in the Police Transit van.     I noticed that the supporters van contained a

mattress in the rear which was surrounded by empty beer/lager cans.

A short time later whilst I was speaking to PS Keenan outside the

White Horse Public House a group of approximately twenty youths led

by one youth in particular started to sing an obscene song.     I went to

the leader with PS Keenan and the group immediately stopped singing.

I warned the youth about his future behaviour and there were no further

problems outside these premises despite many of the youths present being

quite obviously affected by intoxicants.

About 1.30 pm I saw PS Dixon who was in charge of Serial Number 41 in

Halifax Road at its junction with Kilner Way.

PS Dixon told me that his serial were keeping a watching eye over Liverpool

supporters who were buying large quantities of intoxicating liquor from

the off-licence Department of the Gateway Supermarket.     These premises

subsequently sold out of packs and bottles of beer and lager.

About 2.30 pm I returned to Halifax Road near to its junction with Southey

Green Road where I saw Chief Inspector Purdy.    Liverpool Supporters
                                                                               1
coaches were now parked in Halifax Road down as far as the Pelican crossing

just below this junction.   The Fire Brigade were called to a coach at this

junction which was leaking diesel fuel.    I recall Chief Inspector Purdy

saying his radio was not working very well but my radio was working

efficiently although reception was sometimes difficult due to traffic and

general noise.   There were largenumbers of Liverpool supporters walking

down Halifax Road towards Hillsborough, many of them were under the

influence of drink although there was no trouble.   It was noticeable that

all those heading towards Hillsborough appeared to be in no particular hurry

despite the ground being a ten minutes walk away.

I also saw a group of forty to fifty supporters walking in the opposite

direction away from the ground.   On speaking to them one of their number

indicated that their coach driver had allowed them to alight near to the

ground but had driven off taking the match tickets with him.    They were

all walking back to th,e coach to collect their tickets.

At 2.45 pm there were still large numbers of supporters walking towards
the ground.     Customers at the White Horse Public House were leaving in

small pockets and I noticed those Liverpool supporters who I had spoken

to earlier regarding the singing of an obscene song making their way down

Halifax Road.     They appeared to be well intoxicated but were not causing

any problems.

About that time I noticed a group of approximately forty or fifty

Liverpool Supporters walking down the side of the parked coaches towards

the ground.     They appeared to be well intoxicated but again were not

causing any problems.     I recall mentioning the group to Chief Inspector

Purdy and wondered where they had been drinking.     We concluded that they

must have been drinking at the Wadsley Bridge Working Mens Club which is

situated in Halifax Road near to its junction with Doe Royd Lane or

perhaps one of the public houses on the adjoining housing estates.

Throughout the day leading up to kick-off     time it was particularly

noticeable that large numbers of supporters were drinking from cans or bottles

and many were intoxicated.     In fairness, however, with those exceptions

mentioned I will say that the fans were well behaved although in many cases

boisterous.

I was surprised that those supporters heading for the ground after 2.30 pm

appeared to be in no particular huriy to get to the ground even up to

2.50 pm.   Traffic in Halifax Road whilst busy from around 11.30 am onwards

was never allowed to build up and cause serious congestion and never

appeared any worse than that on a normal Sheffield Wednesday home fixture.

At 3-00 pm I met PS Dixon and his serial Number 4l in Halifax Road with

the intention of implementing Phase 2 which involved that serial joining the

South Yorkshire Police Coach outside the ground in Penistone Road North.

The remaining two serials 42 and 43 were due to take their meal break at

that time at Claywheels Lane Traffic Department.    We set off to walk to

the ground and by this time there was only the occasional football supporter

heading for the ground.

Traffic was very light and of a local nature.     En-route to the ground I saw

a number of Officers near to the Gate Inn PUblic house in Penistone Road
                                  - 6-                                        ^-2.72-

North speaking to a group of about six men who were obviously intoxicated.

Those supporters made their way along Leppings Lane watched initially by

officers in my company.    We then continued along Penistone Road towards the

ground.

As we did so I heard a radio message from a voice I did not recognise asking

for the gates to be opened.    Although I was unaware of what was happening

the caller sounded quite panicky and I remarked to PS Dixon to that effect.

As we approached Gate '0' to the ground I heard a radio message directing

all Officers at Claywheels Lane to attend at the ground immediately.

At 3-15 pm we entered the ground and went immediately to the opening between

the North Stand and the Spion Kop where I saw Superintendent Greenwood.

I saw that there were large number of people on the pitch at the Leppings

Lane end of the ground and I assumed that Liverpool supporters had invaded

the pitch. I had no idea at that time that the game had been under way or

the extent of the problem.

I asked Superintendent Greenwood where he wished me to deploy my men and

he indicated the playing area perimeter track facing the Notts. Forest

Supporters on the Spion Kop.

At that time there was only a handful of Police Officers on the track

and the Notts. Forest supporters were chanting and taunting the Liverpool

supporters.

Several supporters were half-heartedly attempting to climb the perimeter

fence.    I instructed Officers to spread out across the perimeter track facing

the Spion Kop .

Several Notts Forest supporters were screaming at me to clear the pitch and

it was evident    that they too assumed there had been a pitch invasion by

Liverpool supporters.

I had been in position for a few minutes when a youth ran across the pitch

from the opposite end shouting abuse towards the Spion Kop.    I deputed one

officer to remove him but the youth ran off back towards the Leppings1 Lane

stand where I saw he was detained by other Police Officers.    About five

minutes elapsed before I realised that the situation was more serious than
                                   - 7 -

I had first envisaged and I noticed that there were injured persons

lying on the pitch at the Leppings Lane side of the ground.     I attempted to

calm the shouting Notts. Forest Supporters by pointing out that there were

injured people on the pitch and that it could not simply be cleared.

The taunts by the Notts. Forest supporters continued then suddenly a large

number of Liverpool supporters who were on the pitch clearly incensed by

the taunts ran towards the Spion Kop in response.   I feared a large clash when

the Liverpool supporters reached the Spion Kop but Officers in front of

the Spion Kip successfully ushered the Liverpool supporters back across the

pitch to the Leppings Lane side and a large cordon of Police Officers formed

across the width of the pitch to prevent further problems of that nature.

Whilst all this was taking place I did not hear any radio messages from the

Police control, although had any been made I doubt that I would have heard

what was being said due to the level of noise from the crowd.     I did hear

Kenny Dalglish make an announcement over the ground public address system

and whilst I could not make out what he said his message seemed to have a

calming effect on the Notts. Forest supporters.

Liverpool supporters were dismantling the advertising hoardings to use as

stretchers and it was then that the seriousness of the situation became known

to the Notts. Forest supporters and myself for that matter when several

bodies were brought from the Leppings Lane stand direction towards the Spion

Kop.

About 4.25 pm an announcement was made that the match was to be abandoned.

In the absence of any other instructions I caused Serial Number 4l to remain

in position until the bulk of the Notts. Forest Supporters had left the

Spion Kop.   Following that I anticipated that there would be Public Order

problems outside the ground so took the decision to revert to Plase 3

and took the serial from the ground on foot along Penistone Road North

towards Halifax Road.    On that journey although I was subject to numerous

comments about the Police causing the deaths of supporters by opening the

gates I saw no signs of trouble.    At 6.30 pm I went to Claywheels Lanewith

Serial Number 4l and subsequently returned to Main Street Police Station by
Police Coach going off duty at 7.30 pm.

In respect of radio communications, although my radio was working

throughout the day I did not have the benefit of an extension speaker and

in situations where there was noise from traffic or supporters I had

difficulty deciphering what was said.     I did not hear any messages at all

once inside the football ground but did pick up transmissions outside

the ground when the match had been abandoned.

I did feel largely in the dark once the situation developed in the ground

but I did, eventually, appreciate from my position at the Spion Kop that a

serious situated had developed and realised it was inappropriate to attempt

to use my radio to establish exactly what was taking place.

REPORT
                     MICHAEL BROOMHEAD   -   POLICE INSPECTOR

                      'C' DIVISION, MAIN STREET, ROTHERHAM
                                                                            72 4
On Saturday 9th April 1988 I was on duty at the FA Cop

semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at

Hillsborough.

My duties concerned the supervision of serials responsible for the

Policing of the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground

designated for the Liverpool supporters.     I attended at both briefings

in respect of the match and received no specific instructions on

chanelling fans into the turnstiles and cannot recollect any instructions

being given regarding fans arriving without tickets.

I took up a position after the pre-match briefing on the forecourt area

outside the turnstiles in Leppings Lane.      I believe there were two Police

Officers manning each turnstile.    From the outset those officers were

searching fans arriving for the match and in particular were removing

any banners or sticks which could be construed as dangerous and cans of

drink.    Initially the arrival of fans was slow and there were no problems for

the officers on the turnstiles.

Other officers were on duty on that forecourt area on general public

order duties but there was no chanelling of fans into the turnstiles or

cordons either by Policemen or barriers to filter the fans in Leppings

Lane.    The turnstiles were individually marked and on arrival fans were

making their own way through the gates to the turnstiles although where

possible I assisted, as did other officers, by directing fans to the

appropriate turnstile queues.

I was unaware of any specific arrangements in hand to question or search

fans arriving without tickets but any fans who appeared to be ticketless or

loitering on the forecourt area were questioned as to whether or not they

had tickets.    Those that were not in possession of a ticket were told to

leave the area and those who were standing around with tickets were

encouraged to enter the ground.

Whilst that was an easy task'in the early part of the afternoon it

became more difficult as the numbers of supporters arriving increased

progressively towards the kick-off time.

I noticed that large numbers of fans smelled of intoxicants and I

recollect two or three occasions turning away fans who were so intoxicated

that they were being supported by friends.     One officer arrested a youth

for drunkenness.

During the last half hour or so before kick off time up to 3-00 pm the

forecourt area became considerably more congested although it was still

possible for me to stand and direct fans towards the appropriate turnstiles.

In particular I recollect a large queue gathering at one set of turnstiles

whilst a much smaller queue was gathered nearby at another set of turnstiles

giving access to the same area of the ground beyond the turnstile entrances.

I was able to direct fans from one queue to another without any fears of

injury either to myself or the fans.    I have seen television shots of

the scene outside the   turnstiles in Leppings Lane   this year and I can

say that the situation in 1988 bore no comparison     to what I saw on the

television.   Although queues at the turnstiles in    1988 were heavy and there

was a lot of shoving,pushing and eagerness to get into the     ground I did

not see any real signs of danger to anyone in the queues.

By 3.00 £>hi most of the Liverpool supporters had entered the ground,

only those persons arriving after that time were outside at kick off

time.

I actually went into the seating area of the West Stand at kick-off time

and noted that all the seats in that stand were occupied.

I remained in that general area throughout the game and returned to the

Leppings Lane area after the match until all the fans had dispersed.

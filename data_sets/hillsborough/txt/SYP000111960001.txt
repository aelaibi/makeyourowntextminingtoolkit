could           not    be    far    off     and      there       was       still     a lot              of       space     on t h e

terrace           under       the       Police       Control.




It     occurred             that    some' L i v e r p o o l         supporters               were           leaving        it    late       but

people           often       enter       after       the      start        at     many       games.



About           this    time        1 can      see     people            climbing            o ve r     the w al l        and        p o in t

 play was            at     the    Penistone            Road         end.



 I became            aware        of a        perimeter          track          g at e   being       opened and               people

 and      pointed           in    the     direction             of    the       part     where       there was               s till    plenty

 The     movement             seemed          orderly          but    the       numbers         were        building          up,.




 Fans      were        going       onto        the     track          s t a r t i n g to m o v e        in the           d i r e c t i o n as

 A policewoman                   was     in    control         of     the       gate     into     the a r e a           where        there

 was     space         but       did     not    open       it,




 I thought             she       probably         didn't         have       a    radio     or     hadn't           sensed          t hat     she

 I began          to       sense       youths         would      run o n t o        the    playing           area        so    ran     out        of

The     linesman             ran    straight        p as t    Superintendent                Hurray.

stop     the       game.




I then        see       Superintendent              Greenwood            running        tbwards         the    referee.

      CHIEF INSPECTOR MCROBBIE                                                                                      R125




      I transferred to 'F' Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

      (Admin).

      The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

      included on the order.

      As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

      to be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

      As   a preliminary     to the event I received an overview of the planning and

      rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1989-

      I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday                   April 1989.

      On Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

      9.45 a.m.      I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

      order to watch, listen and learn.

       I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

       in front of the Special Constables.

       It appeared       to me that attention to detail was evident in the way serials

       were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.
                                                                                                                                                        .       ■ '

       This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

       I was     again    impressed   with the       standard of briefing,                again .

excellence;        if we         are   required to         impliment         evacuation today,           it must be

excellent."

This     briefing          was    followed     by     an    up     to       date    intelligence        report      from

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Finally,      Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios, issue and

mealing arrangements.

It was      stressed            that   all   officers must             be    on their      respective points            by


 11.15 a.m.

After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

 later    into      the     operation        so I left           the    stadium       to return to my private

 vehicle.       I was approached on three separate occasions in Penistone Road and

 asked if I        had any tickets                 to sell.

 There were        a lot of people                 around first sitting on walls ingroups.

 I went      to    my vehicle           and drove     to Hairanerton               Road    Police Station where            I

 carried out some outstanding clerical work.

 I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

 Station,         when      a    police      car    offered       me    a     lift    to    the    ground.        This       I

 accepted.

 I saw Policewoman                 Smith and another officer outside Threshers                              near Holme

  Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what w a s expected of them.

  I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as                                      I   wanted    to observe

  officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

  I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

  and not in uniform.

  All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

  at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

  By H il ls b o r o u g h Park I saw a group o f p e o p l e                      sittin g   around,       th ere .a s        a

  w h it e p l a s t i c    c a r r i e r bag w ith them and            t h e o u t l i n e o f c a n s c o u l d be s e e n .     -V
The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were six men and they were joking about having                               todrink    thelot     as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By Leppings      Lane    gates    were    few supporters,         road clear,          plenty of Police

officers evident.

I went      to   the   barrier    at     Leppings    Lane/Vere         Road    where    I spoke   to     'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                             A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I    then   walked     past   Leppings     Lane     gates   and    came       to   barriers   and Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                              There were no

other people near this area.                  I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell         the necessity         to provide a sterile area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I continued along the road being the South Stand past the T.V.                                 unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

 I produced my warrant card,              but I was known to one officer who I did not

know.

 I went down and along Penistone Road which was busy.

 I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the flow ofpeople,                                   it was

 very busy.

 I   stopped     and    spoke    to   Police    Constable      Vallance        from    ’A ’ Division     and

 Police Constable         Haltman      from    ’A ’ Division      at    separate points blit d«e

 enquiries and sheer numbers of persons it was p r u d e n t to move on, as they

 needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

 I returned to rear of South Stand.

 About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

 There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
                                            _4-




awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.                             The procedure was

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this area and returned        to Penistone Road as I intended to use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.       At that time about one hour to kick off.

 I knew there was      a Liverpool train due at Wadsley Bridge around 2.05 p.m.

 but decided to go into the ground.

 I went to the main sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a special

 card issued to me      by Superintendent Murray.                  Both were          fully checked and

 examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

 I was assured no unauthorised person would gain entry at that gate
                                                                                                         ■              ; - a •.         - '. ■ ■■

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at   the    front      and    Police          Constable           Bichard    at     the             rear       by       the       camera

operating controls.

I was      informed by Police            Sergeant          Goddard         that    Superintendent                       Murray had

gone     to speak to the referee so I sat on his                                  seat arid was offered a hot

drink.      It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant      Chief     Constable            (Operations)           Mr.    Jackson             came        to      the       control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw   through      the    control            room    window      Superintendent                     Murray             and        Chief

S uperi n te nd e nt   Duckenfield,            in uniform, walking along the track.                                         They came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the Motts
                                                                        /:v-.
 Forest parts I could see on the South Stand and the Spion Kop were quite

 full.

 I recall Chief Superintendent Duckenfield commenting about there being no

 entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

 I remember when             I was   a child             there     always being a band pi ay itig by the

 facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

 I was    aware the area in Leppings Lane                           behind the goal was         filling up but

 this was to be expected.

 I was    then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a. pre-match warm

 up.     As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

 looked onto the playing area.

 I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

 as I didn't think he would be playing.                             The Liverpool fans were shouting his

 name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                                All was good humoured.

 The    area behind the goal at Leppings Lane was getting full but there was

  space at the front.                People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

  wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

  Approx 2.30 p.m.

  I    looked   on   the       left    monitor          and was      aware    there    seemed      a       build      up of

| supporters.        (     *    ?

  I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

  necessary     segregation of fans,                    access      to the North Stand,            which had been

  allocated     to       Liverpool         supporters,         could       only   be   done   by       Leppings           Lane

  which would normally be u s e d were unavailable.

  This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

  I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

  fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

  People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

 I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

 I was.

 I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the closure of Leppings Lane

 to traffic.

\ I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

 be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                           It was not

 extraordinary.        I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

 through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

 was possible.

 The situation remained like this, poor reception, the ground slowly filling

  up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                         The

  crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

  Approx 2.45 p.m.

  The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

  on the screen.          Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

  team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

  Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

  to assist officers outside.

  Around    this   time a radio message was          relayed r e q u e s t i n g   the   gates   to be

  opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

  I remember thinking, you can’t open the gates or you lose control ovei^ who

  is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

  and   may   create      a difficult   public   order    situation       for Police inside        the

  ground.

  The     gates    were    not   authorised   to     be   opened     by    Chief     Sueprintendent

   Duckenfield at this time.

   I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

   kg far off and there was still a lot of space on the tsrrace under the

Police Control.

It occurred that some Liverpool supporters were leving it late but people

often enter after the start of many games.

About this time X can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to the controllers.       I then saw the gates displayed on the camera which I

 b
 elieve   are   the   concertina gates on       the service    road   to the rear of the

South Stand open and a surge of people rush into the ground.                I said,   The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.      It seemed control was regained with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the gate .

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent Marshall again requests            the gates to be opened.      This is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

 I can see by the players tunnel a semi circle of photographers awaiting the

 arrival of the two teams.

 It seems the Superintendent will have to try and prevent the start of; the

 game as the fans will not all get in but I thought there is no ^ay anyone

 can get to the referee or team managers to do this at this late stage.               As I

 was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                I've no idea which

 team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

 I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

 At this point Superintendent Marshall requested the gates to be opened as

 there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in the crush

 if they were not opened.

 There was still room on tt

Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was evident there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect - If there's likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent Murray gave the general     instruction over the radio to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.                                       The play was

 at the Penistone Road end.

 I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

 onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

 direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

 The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.                                                             ■

I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I    could     see   people   pushed   up   against   the    fence   but   not   aware        of   any

particular problems or' injuries as there is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms" and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run to control          but by the uncovered seats          I meet Superintendent Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.               We    run     together      to alinesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards t h e referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

Terrace.

 I think it is a public order situation.

As they are Liverpool supporters, I run onto the playing                     area   and protect

 Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

 When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

    people spilling onto the playing area.            There is quite clearly in my mind a

    major public order        situation which will need a large uniform pr

    return to the Police Control point.

    En route    I am passed          by    uniformed          reinforcements   as    I    pass   through         the

    uncovered seating.

    On   re-entering      control       room    I     learn    that persons    are    suspected of being

    injured.

    An   ambulance       is    called     for   and    quickly     arrives   behind      the Leppings       Lane

    goal.

    A message      is    relayed     to Police control that many people                   are    injured.         »s

    they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides to call

    out Casualty Bureau staff.

    I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson, to call for Chief

    Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

     I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

     I've   no accurate         assessment      of time, but this call should be recorded on

     tape   in Force      Control.         Coins      or other items are          being    thrown at Police

     Control   in large numbers.                In view of the situation unfolding,                     Operation

     All available personnel are deployed in area.

     I   suggest     I    go    to   Hammerton        Road     Police   Station   and     receive       Operation

     Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground Control.

     I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

     I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

     in a marked Police car.               He conveys me to Haramerton Road Police Station.

     I change into uniform and act at this location as

     Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to

     makeshift serials.                                                                             ,    , ...

HUXSBCROUGH

I have been informed by the BBC that their programme
about the Hillsborough Inquiry will be transmitted at
8.15pm on Wednesday, 11 April on BBC2.

As you know, the BBC (as well as ITV) spent a
considerable time filming in the HSE laboratories and I
have been told by the Editor that the sequences filmed
will "figure very strongly" in the finished programme.

I trust you will find the programme of interest.

I have informed Professor Maunder and Mr Sweet of the
above.

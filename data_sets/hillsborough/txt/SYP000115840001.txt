that        supporters                 were          a t t e m p t i n g - to    enter          the    ground          without             tickets,

but     there           was       no       evidence           of    this        on    our       arrival          at    the       turnstile.

A t '1. 5 0 pm          (1350)             that        date,       I assisted              another          o f f i c e r -in         ejecting                 a

man     who        was       believed                to    have     entered           the       ground       without             a    ticket.

Apart        from           the    enquiries                 from       fans     asking             where    particular                terraces

or    stands            were,          they          were     not       directed           to       any=one       terrace.

Near        to     these          turnstiles,                 were       two     sets       of       toilets          and       on    numerous

occasions               my       officers              and    I Had       to     move        countless            fans          on,    who       were

stood        outside              the       toilets,              urinating           a g a i n s t ' t h e ".wall-              This

continued               up       until          kick       off     time,        when       the       rear    of       the- t e r r a c e s          and

stands           cleared.

This        particular                 problem             again        reared        i t vs        ugly    nead       at       naif       time,

when        n ot    only          were          the       fans     uri'nating          outside             the    toilet             wails,         b ut

were; s t o o d             on    the        upper         terraces,            urinating             into       the       area       directly

knocked            over          and       literally              trampled           over       a    newspaper             seller          and

From   Police Sergeant 1576 Boulton          Section    Cudworth
To     Chief Superintendent Mole             Date       26.5.89.




I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police, presently stationed

at Cudworth Section.

On Saturday 9 April 1988, I was detailed to perform duty at the F.A. Cup

Semi Final, to be played at Hillsborough Football Ground, between Liverpool

F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C.

I was in charge of a Serial at this event and my duties were to cover the

turnstiles numbered 9-16 at the Leppings Lane side of the ground, on the

inside of the ground.

At 11am, that date, following briefing and refreshments, my Serial and I,

took up duties on the inside of the ground, at turnstiles 9-16.    To the best

of my recollection, one or two of these turnstiles, were for ticket holders

for the seated area and to prevent other ticket holders for the Terraces from

entering into the seated stand area, there were two metal barriers placed

between the turnstile wall and a dividing fence.

This side of the ground was designated for the Liverpool supporters and as

they entered the ground, the officers on my Serial and I, made random searches

for illegal articles etc.

On several occasions, we were informed by the turnstile operators, that

supporters were attempting to enter the ground without tickets, but there

was no evidence of this on our arrival at the turnstile.

At 1.50pm, that date, I assisted another officer in ejecting a man who was

believed to have entered the ground without a ticket.

Apart from the enquiries from fans asking where particular terraces or stands

were, they were not directed to any one terrace.

Near to these turnstiles, were two sets of toilets and on numerous occasions

my officers and I had to move countless fans on, who were stood outside the

toilets, urinating against the wall.   This continued up until kick-off time,

when the rear of the terraces and stands cleared.
                                   2



This particular problem again reared it's ugly head at half time, when not

only were the fans urinating outside the toilet walls, but were stood on the

upper terraces, urinating into the area directly behind the stands.

At 3.55pm, that date, officers of my serial and myself went up into the seated

area above the terraces, where fans from the lower terracing were being helped

up into the West Stand seating area.   There was a number of fans that had

already dispersed amongst the crowd, but 15 to 20 persons were ejected from

the ground for their actions.

At it.05pm, that date, my serial was directed to the Sion Kop, where there was

a report of fighting between rival fans.   By the time we arrived at this

location, there was no fighting taking place.

It was shortly after this, that I took refreshments.   My serial and I then

resumed and at full time, cleared the Liverpool supporters from the ground.

During their egress from the ground, the supporters knocked over and literally

trampled over a newspaper seller and another officer and myself had to force

our way into the crowd and assist him firstly to his feet and then out of the

crowd.

We then accompanied the fans as far as Halifax Road, where other Serials then

took over.

At 6.^5pm, that date, my Serial and I were stood down from the operation.

               Further           to    my    report              of    the          26   May    1 9 8 9 <2 6 0 5 8 9 ) ,   concerning              the

               policing           of    the            FA       Cup    Semi Final              at   Hi I 1 sbo r o u g h    on    the      9th April

               1988        (0904885,,            I wish           to       add      the    followings--

                ! have       been       handed              a    map       of    the      Sheffield            Wednesday         F,C,     Hillsborough

                around       and       from            this       map,          I can      confirm that          my    serial       was      detailed

               to     perform          duty        at           the    r e a r of        the    West Stand         between        points           ’A*, a n d

               *B *,       which        have       beenshown                   on    the    map     by    myself.           With        r e f e r e n c e to

               my     mention           of       two    metal              barriers         being        used, these         were       at    point       *C ’

               as     indicated             by    me,           between          the      turnstiles            and   a    dividing          fence.

               These        were        placed          to p r e v e n t            supporters           from     t he W e s t   Stand       entering

               into        North        Stand          and                 visa-versa.

               I     can    say       that       there          was        a    steady      flow         of    supporters         into       the    ground

To     Chief Superintendent Hole            Date      2.6*89.



Further to ray report of the 26 May 1989, concerning the policing of the

F.A. Cup Semi Final at Hillsborough on the 9 April 1988, I wish to add

the following :-


I have been handed a map of the Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Hillsborough Ground

and from this map, I can confirm that my serial was detailed to perform duty

at the rear of the West Stand between points 'A1 and 'B*, which have been

shown on the map by myself.   With reference to my mention of two metal barriers

being used, these were at point 'C* as indicated by me, between the turnstiles

and a dividing fence.   These were placed to prevent supporters from the West

Stand, entering into North Stand and visa-versa.

I can say that there was a steady flow of supporters into the ground up until

approximately 30 minutes prior to kick-off and that from then on, there was a

marked increase of supporters entering the ground.    This continued until after

kick-off time.

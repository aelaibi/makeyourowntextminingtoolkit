          stre e t s    pointing       out    the    route       to the        ground.        We saw no disorder                 in

          the    streets,       neither       did we                  y drun k e n fans.

          congested,         we started getting                crushed.          I could hardly             see a n y t h i n g

          1 remember          seeing    one    pol i c e m a n    on h o r seback           trying    to control           the

          in the       crush.      My arms were          forced        down by my hips.                My    chest        star t e d

          I thought       to myself          I ’d better         get out        of this       so   I managed        to

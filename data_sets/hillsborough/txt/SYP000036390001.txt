Dear Mr Jones

h U jLSBqrough inquiry   - SUBMISSIONS   on   BEHALF OF ER EASTWOOD

My comments on the above document are as follows:

Paragraphs l(i). 8 and 9: This submission contains no mention of corrosion, or
its Assessment, which should have formed part of the inspection procedure.
Dr E&stwood agreed in his evidence (day 26 pi09) that barriers which contained
corzMed holes would have been condemned. The collapsed barrier contained
corroded holes (HSE Report para 3.4) which would have been visible at the 1988
inspection.

Paragraph 10: Since deflections were not measured on each span (day 26 pll3
Collins/Eastwood) how can it be said that both spans passed?

Paragraph 11: Dr Eastwood stated (day 26 pll3) that "there has been an error
in testing" and hence this paragraph is confusing.

Paragraph 12: It was accepted eventually by Dr Eastwood that deflections could
get larger with successive load applications (day 26 pll7) and hence it is by
no means certain that the span requiring a re-test would have passed.

Paragraph 13: It has not been proved that barriers 128 and 137 were deformed
on or before 15/4/89. The test results supplied to HSE by Dr Eastwood
(covering letter Eastwood/James dated 1/6/89) state that for barrier 128 the
"first load application, up to 1.4 tonnes resulted in a 75% recovery after
release of load" which suggests that, for this barrier, plastic deformation
occurred at less than 1.2 times the design load for a new barrier (5kN/m).
Eastwood's data require explanation.

Recent HSE results (not available when the report was issued) indicate that the
crcwd density was similar in pens 3 and 4 and hence "crush pressure" would also
have been similar in the two pens.

Paragraph 14: The Green Guide does not quantify "crowd pressure" and hence
this statement could be challenged.

Paragraph 16: A definition of "significantly" is required here. Certainly
barriers which were as much as 18% below the minimum recommended height were
not replaced (eg barrier 136 pen 3).

                                                1


                                                                                             2
       Paragraph 18: Most barriers at the lappings Lane End had been positioned so as
       to prevent spectators standing chi the same step as the barrier. The examples
       chosen by Dr Eastwood were not typical (day 27 p61).

       Paragraph 20: Seme spectators have stated that they were pressed over the
       barriers, thus compressing those chi the lower side. The height of the barriers
       is therefore very relevant.

       Paragraph 22: The alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers is
       specified in the Green Guide. This does not appear to have been considered by
       Dr Eastwood. Seme of the gaps in the lines of barriers were well in excess of
       the Guide recommendations. For example, the gap between barriers 136 and 136A,
       immediately above the collapsed spans of 124A, was 57% larger than the Guide
       maximum.

       Paragraph 33: I do not agree with this statement. In the absence of radial
       fences, spectators would have spread more uniformly along the Leppings Lane
       Terrace, thus reducing crcwd density in the central area.

       Paragraph 42: In Pen 3, a configuration of barriers complying with the Green
       Guide would have led to a reduction in pressure chi specific barriers
        (particularly 124A) and hence barrier collapse may have been averted. Crushing
       injuries may still have occurred but the death toll would, in ray opinion, have
       been reduced substantially. The situation in Pen 4, where the barrier
       configuration was better, and the crcwd density was similar, supports this
       view.

       Paragraphs 45. 47. 48 and 50: The capacity of Pens 3 and 4 is not given,
       although that of Spion Kop is! It is not credible that "a loss in capacity”
       (para 47) or "the effect chi capacity" (para 48) could be quantified or
       discussed unless the original capacities had been calculated already. Likewise
       the only sensible way of allocating spectators to a particular pen would be on
       the basis of a known and agreed capacity. The term "visibly full" (para 50) is
       meaningless in this context.


       Do not hesitate to contact me if you require clarification of any of the above
       points. I expect to attend the Inquiry tomorrow (14th) from 9.30am onwards.

       Yours sincerely

Today we are removing the refining toy of the broken crush barrier No 124A
from the Leppings lane Terrace. We are also removing barrier 125 from Pen 3
and terrier 129 front Pen 6, and these will be subjected to further examination
and testing in our laboratory. This is in accordance with your letter to
Mr Mackrell of 6 July 1989.

To date our examinations have concentrated on Pens 3 and 4, but in attempting
to locate a barrier similar to 124A in dimensions, structure and condition, we
examined barriers in other Pens at the Leppings l a m end and also at the Spion
Kbp end. We were attempting to locate barriers which showed evidence of
corrosion under the straps at the supports and, if possible, to identify an
isolated case where corrosion had created actual holes in the horizontal tube.
In a brief examination we identified holes in various barriers within Pens 1/2,
3, 4 and 6 at the leppings Lane end and also holes in 32 of the older style
barriers at the Spion Kop end. Seme of these Spion Kbp barriers showed severe
corrosion, with large holes of up to <^50mm being found. It most be stressed
that our examination was in no way exhaustive and in our opinion a thorough
examination by an independent structural engineer is require!.

It should   be noted that in his evidence to the Court of Inquiry, Dr Eastwood
was shown   a photograph of a hole in barrier 125 and declared that such severe
corrosion   would result in the barrier being "condemned". In view of this, I
recommend   that re-examination be carried out forthwith.

With the removal of the 3 barriers previously referred to, this completes the
HSE's study at the ground and, as far as we are concerned, the embargo placed
on Leppings lane end can be lifted. However, for the reasons stated above,
this in no way implies HSE's acceptance of tie state of the ground, this must
be dealt with by the appropriate authorities.

Yours sincerely

                                                                     t\jCL®

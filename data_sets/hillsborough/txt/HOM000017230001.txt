                                             H I L L S B R O U G H ENQUIRY

        I am sure that you will be aware of                           the    role   played by St.
    John Am bu la nc e at football matches.

        We had 26 adults and 9 cadets together with 2 a mbulances on
    duty at H i l l s b r o u g h last Saturday, and you will u n de rs ta nd my
    admiration, tempered with concern at the way these men and women,
    some of them teenagers, set about helping those un fo rt un at e
    victims of the horror that so suddenly e nveloped them.

           We are concerned that our r ec om m e n d a t i o n s to the P opplewell
    Enquiry carried so little weight, and for this reason I am taking
    the libe rty of w r i t i n g to you, to say that, if you should be
    i nviting others to join you in your Enquiry, St. John would be
    pleased to provide a suitable person;            but in any case I m ust ask
    that we be allowed to appear before you with some urgent
    r e c om me nd at io ns on First Aid requirements, for I fear that we are
    mov in g into an era when disasters, of one kind or another, are
    taking on 'mega' proportions, and are sadly, more than likely to
    be repeated.

         Should you so invite us, I would recommend that, to give
    evidence, a Senior Brigade Officer, together with one of our
    Consu lt an t Surgeons, and a Senior Nurse e xp er ie nc ed in these
    m atters should appear before you.

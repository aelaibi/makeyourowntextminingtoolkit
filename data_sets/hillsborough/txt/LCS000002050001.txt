SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT -
EFFECTS OF m U*580BQUGB FOOTBALL DISASTER

Introduction

The Emergency Sub Committee meeting on the 2nd May 1989 briefly discussed
the workload effects of th© Hillsborough disaster on the Social Services
Department and agreed that the matter should be addressed by this Committee:|
                                                                            J6-
Recommenda tions

The Committee is recommended to consider financing additional social work
and support costs that the Social Services Department expects to have to
deploy during the next two to three years.

%cfcgFound

i,, a result cf the Hillsborough football disaster the Social Services
Department has set up a Special Team of six. Social Workers with a.
Co-ordiaat.'jr withdrawn from their normal duties in the Areas with support
staff and facilities.    This Team, was fully operational from the 17th April
1989*    The Workload for the Team has from this date been very heavy and the'
Areas have had to cover all other existing work.     It is anticipated that tl
effects of the disaster on bereaved families and others will last from two
':.o three yeajp out the position will bs kept under review.

It will be necessary to continue with the role of a Co-ordinator to head
activities connected with the disaster, with this Officer's main tasks beiH
to ensure consistent handling of oases referred to Social Workers, and to •
link with Voluntary Organisations in the Borough together with other
agencies* to ensure that support to people affected by the disaster is well.;
organised and effective.   It is anticipated that the current establishment;’!
   ®ix Level III Social Workers^jia.1 be needed together with two Clerical
Offjcer-s in support.

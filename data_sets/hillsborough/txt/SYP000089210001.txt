for him and couldn't find him. By the time I got back the crowds had

cleared and     it just took me a     couple of minutes to   get in, as    I say at

about 3pm (1500)      I went for a    programme first and then by the time I

actually got to my seat         I saw that the players were just going off the

pitch.     This would have been between 3.05pm        (1505) and 3.10pm    (1510).



I looked towards the Leppi ngs Ln terraces and I realised straight away

that there was some sort of problem I didn't realise what was

happening exactly at fi rs t .       My first reaction was that people were

messing a b o u t .



I could see     people trying to climb over the fences       and being pushed

back by the     police.

After a short time a friend of mine                      j“came up to us in the

seats 1 was with another         lad called              at the time.

         was obviously very s h o c k e d A n d said that he had been carried

along by the crowd through the A u m n e l , and into the pens.      He said

that he had been pushed right/ to the front and that somehow he had

managed to get out.        He sai/ that there were people dead on the

terraces    in the pens.



Other friends of ours started appearing on the pitch and were shouting

for us to come down on the pitch to he 1p .        I realised then that

something was very w r o n g .



At this stage we, that         is the three of us, then stepped over a little

wail onto the pitch.          We joined up with our other mates,    making a

group of about eight of us altogether.          The others   I can remember were

for this man so we went behind the Forest- goal to pull down the

hoardings so that we could get back up the other end to help.                                    Even

I definitely know that one l^fi who was wearing a leather jacket                                   lived.

taking hoardings down from above the terracing.



While all this was going on,                  I got split up from the mates that                   i was

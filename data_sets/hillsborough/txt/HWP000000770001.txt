 al/cttee/hillsborou/finalmin/A100795
  The Working Party was informed:-

  (A)   by M s . S. Coleman, the Disaster Research Consultant,
        that due to illness she had not been able to undertake
        the consultation with families involved in the
        Judicial Review process that had been intended to form

        been agreed at the previous meeting to include in the
        final version of the Report;

  (B)   by Dr. P. Scraton of Edgehill College that in

        meeting of the Working Party, 200 copies of the Report
        without the above analysis but with other amendments
        which had been submitted, had been printed and bound
        ready for the proposed launch this week. He explained
        that if the launch did not take place this week then
        not only would there by a cost implication but due to
        academic and holiday commitments at the College it
        would not be able to take place until September. He

        written again on behalf of the Council to the Chief

        Statement made by Dr. Scraton at this meeting that
        copyright is vested in the City Council he did
        consider that the Chief Executive should provide
        formal written clarification that this is the position
        of the College.




  Resolved that -

  (A)   in order for a full analysis of the Judicial Review
        process, to be submitted by the Disaster Research
        Consultant, to be included in the Report, the launch
        be postponed until September;

  (B)   the Research Consultant make arrangements for the
        submission of the above analysis to Dr. Scraton as a
        matter of urgency; and

  (C)   any cost implications of the decision not to proceed
        with the launch of the Report this week, and the
        method and cost of the reprinting and binding of the
        amended Report, be considered by the Policy and
        Resources Committee.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER STATEMENT

I have been requested to write to you by the Hillsborough Disaster
Working Party of the City Council concerning the Statement which
was recently issued by the Chairman of your Club and Liverpool
Football Club in conjunction with the Leaders of Nottingham and
Liverpool City Councils regarding the factors which caused the
Hillsborough Disaster.

As you will be aware the intention of the Statement has been to
counteract the high profile, but unsubstantiated allegations made
by certain people blaming Liverpool Supporters for causing the
Disaster and in order to publicise the Statement Liverpool
Football Club generously consented to publish it in its Match Day
Programme on April 17th - two days in fact after the sixth
Anniversary of the Disaster. Liverpool City Council is therefore
now asking if Nottingham Forest Football Club would also consider
publishing the Statement in a Match Day Programme in the near
future in order that it is accorded similar prominence in the area
from where some of the false and deeply distressing allegations of
recent months originated.

I enclose copies of the Statement in its original format and as it
appeared in the Liverpool Programme and I look forward to
receiving your response to the Council's request in due course.

Yours faithfully


A.K Corns
Head of Committee and Member Services^

  (C)   by the Assistant Head of Legal Services that he had
        written again on behalf of the Council to the Chief
        Executive of the College with regard to the issue of
        copyright and that although he was re-assured by the
        Statement made by Dr. Scraton at this meeting that
        copyright is vested in the City Council he did
        consider that the Chief Executive should provide
        formal written clarification that this is the position
        of the College.




  Resolved that -

  (A)   in order for a full analysis of the Judicial Review
        process, to be submitted by the Disaster Research
        Consultant, to be included in the Report, the launch
        be postponed until September;

  (B)   the Research Consultant make arrangements for the
        submission of the above analysis to Dr. Scraton as a
        matter of urgency; and

  (C)   any cost implications of the decision not to proceed
        with the launch of the Report this week, and the
        method and cost of the reprinting and binding of the
        amended Report, be considered by the Policy and
        Resources Committee.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER STATEMENT

I have been requested to write to you by the Hillsborough Disaster
Working Party of the City Council concerning the Statement which
was recently issued by the Chairman of your Club and Liverpool
Football Club in conjunction with the Leaders of Nottingham and
Liverpool City Councils regarding the factors which caused the
Hillsborough Disaster.

As you will be aware the intention of the Statement has been to
counteract the high profile, but unsubstantiated allegations made
by certain people blaming Liverpool Supporters for causing the
Disaster and in order to publicise the Statement Liverpool
Football Club generously consented to publish it in its Match Day
Programme on April 17th - two days in fact after the sixth
Anniversary of the Disaster. Liverpool City Council is therefore
now asking if Nottingham Forest Football Club would also consider
publishing the Statement in a Match Day Programme in the near
future in order that it is accorded similar prominence in the area
from where some of the false and deeply distressing allegations of
recent months originated.

I enclose copies of the Statement in its original format and as it
appeared in the Liverpool Programme and I look forward to
receiving your response to the Council's request in due course.


Yours faithfully


A.K Corns
Head of Committee and Member Services,^

Dear Mr White

RE:   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER STATEMENT
Further to your letter of 2 8 July responding to my letter
concerning the possible publication of the above Statement in the
Forest Match Programme, I would be grateful if you could inform me
as I am expected to report back to the Disaster Working Party in
the near future, if the Chairman has yet been in a position to
make a decision on the matter.

Yours sincerely

You have asked me from time to time about the transcript of a business meeting which was
held by Dr Popper on 6 March 1990. You wanted to know whether the transcript is among
the scrutiny documents. We have looked, and it is not.



I wrote to Mr Dorries about this. He has asked me to tell you that he will have a further
search made for the transcript in the Coroner’s archives and will write to Ms Adlington if
anything is found.


I hope this is helpful.

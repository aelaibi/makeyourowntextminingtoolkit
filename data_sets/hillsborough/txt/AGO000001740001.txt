Dear
HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER

Sir Peter Taylor who has been asked by the Secretary of State to hold an inquiry
into the above disaster seeks the nomination of Leading and Junior Counsel. He
aims to have a preliminary hearing on the 28th April in Sheffield and to start the
substantive hearings there on the 15th May.      These dates are very tentative.
I understand that the Attorney suggested that Hugh Carlisle QC might be suitable.
The difficulty is that Sir Peter says that he does not know Hugh Carlisle. He is
anxious to have the services of Andrew Collins QC. He appears to have two reasons.
The first being that he thinks highly of him and the second is that he was Counsel
to the Popplewell Inquiry into the Bradford Football Club fire and therefore has
experience in this field.
As an alternative Sir Peter suggested consideration be given to retaining a Silk
with chambers in Liverpool. He has taken soundings from fellow Judges who suggest
John Kay QC.
So far as Junior Counsel is concerned Sir Peter would like to have Alan Goldsack,
Michael Murphy or Bernard Phillips, in that order of preference. I gather they are
all at 2 Campo Lane, Sheffield.
Sir Peter would like to be able to know the position with regard to Counsel today.
He has arranged to telephone me at lunchtime in case it is possible to arrange
anything by then.
I shall be grateful if you will seek nominations and let me know the position as
soon as possible.
Yours sincerely

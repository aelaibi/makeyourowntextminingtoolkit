                                   WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS


I      was       born on the 2nd March 1960.                                .    I      have
been         a     Sheffield Wednesday steward for the last 13 years                     but
for        the 1988/1989 season I have been the chief steward for“ the
Kop.             For    the three previous seasons I was the              deputy       chief
steward            for the North stand, and prior to that I was a steward
on the North stand.


Stewards               are    trained      or introduced to their    duties        by    the
following means

-]_.              £     new steward is normally placed with          an     experienced
steward               so th^i he is gradually introduced to his duties.                  The
chief            steward          would   normally inform the new steward          of    the
evacuation               procedures        and make reference to the       instructions
for        match         day       staff contained in the back      of    the    stewards
booklet of tickets;

2>                At the annual meeting of the stewards,                 representatives
    from      the Police, Fire Brigade and Ambulance service attend and
provide talks on emergency procedures and other safety matters.
The          head       of security from the club, Doug Lock              also   attends.
    The          emergency procedures are explained and the code.                  A    fire
    officer           gives       guidance on how to use the various types of fire
    extinguisher              around the ground.       Reference is also made to any
    alterations              to    the    ground.   The stewards   also     receive       the
    document entitled "Instructions for match day Staff";


    3.Before most major games                       the Police provide a briefing to
    the           stewards on the day, but this does not normally occur                    in
    relation to league games where large crowds are not expected or
    crowd trouble is not expected.                   Such a briefing has always been
    given in relation to FA Cup semi finals.                   The briefing is given

     As     chief           steward for the Kop, I was responsible for                          all     the
     stewards on the Kop terrace together with one security steward,
                                  ktfho is in direct contact with Doug Lock by radio.
     I also have a radio.                                           ^ontrols the back of the Kop
     terrace            and behind          the    turnstiles,             and   watches        out     for
     "jumpers"              ie,     people who jump over the turnstiles.                         Normally
     during            a match I          position myself on the North stand as I can
     see        the     Kop        very    clearly from             this    point.      ______________
     normally           stands        during the match on the ramp between the                          Kop
     and the North stand.


     In     addition              to the stewards on the terrace, I am                     responsible
     for:

      (a)             The four         gatemen       on     0 gate which is          an    access        way
                  leading           onto    Penistone Road.                (These are     large       gates
                  which lead to the North stand and to the ramp).


      (b)         Four        stewards deployed              to the North stand carpark.


      (c)         Four gatemen for A gate.


      Normally          two        gatemen     are     deployed on A gate and               2     on     the
      railings          which         divide the turnstiles 1-16.                 This     railing        is
      designed          to segregate supporters from the North stand and West
      stand.

      There           is a gateto this railing and the two gatemen stand                                by
'v    this       gate        to ensure that fans for either stand do                        not        cross
      over.           This gateway also allows Police to gain access form the
      North           tothe West stand or vice versa.                        Normally, Police           take
      fans        arrested            in    the West stand through this                   gate     to    the
      North stand and to the Police room located in that stand.


      There           are     normally            1i        stewards         deployed      on     the    Kop
terrace.


I     now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on
the 15th April 1989.                I arrived at the ground at 10.30 to 10.45
am.      The stewards had to arrive by 11.00 am and I had told the
stewards as much at the previous league game.                        At the previous
league       game,     I     attended a briefing by Doug Lock               and
         was     also present.            No Police Officer was present.                Doug
Lock     explained           thedifferent coloured tickets            for        different
parts     of     the       ground and which set of fans would               be     allowed
into     certain        parts        of    the ground.   We       also discussed         the
allocation of extra stewards.


I     decided with my father who is the chief steward of the North
stand        that we should agree on the number of extra stewards and
then     divide this number between ourselveson the day.                          On     the
semi     final        day     I     had 9 extra stewards.         Doug Lock        was     in
agreement with this allocation.


                       arranged for Sheffield United stewards to                       attend
the     game     and        to take part in the      stewarding.      iZ&        Sheffield
United         stewards were allocated to both my father and I and we
agreed        that     I should take            9 Sheffield United stewards                to
be     deployed        on     the    Kop terrace                       is        the     head
steward        over all the chief stewards and he works closely                          with
Doug     Lock.         I do not know how many Sheffield United                    stewards
were used for this occasion.


I     must     mention        that stewards, although         a    relatively           small
number,        have     always been deployed on the terrace to the                       Kop.
No     stewards        have been deployed on the gates to the                    perimeter
fence.         Norma'lly Police Officers are deployed by each gate                         to
the perimeter fence.


It     is part of my duty to hand out steward's jackets in                             return
for     the tickets.which the stewards provide from their booklets
and     which        is used as a means of payment.               I duly carried          out
this     function.           The turnstiles opened just before mid-day.                    My
                                                -   4   -



stewards received a briefing on the Kop by Inspector Calvert at
about     11.15 am.            This briefing lasted about 15 minutes.                             Just
before       the briefing, I sent one of my stewards:off to 0 and                                    A
gates     to       ensure       that     at    least        one       gateman    attended          the
briefing.          This was done.


Inspector Calvert said that there would be Liverpool supporters
coming        on    to the Kop and that if we recognised any                           Liverpool
supporters          or    were approached by one, we should                         direct        them
over     to         the corner of the Kop near the North stand                              and just
above     the ramp.            He also asked everyone                  whether they knew the
evacuation          code and everyone said that they did.                           The 9      extra
Sheffield United stewards were not there at that time.


Just         after       the     briefing      finished           I    saw    the     first       four
supporters come onto the terrace.                           Two of those supporters were
Liverpool          fans        who    came    over and told             us    that     they       were
Liverpool          fans.         We    directed         them      to    the     corner       as    per
Inspector          Calvert's instructions.                   Inspector Calvert said that
he     was         expecting quite a few Liverpool supporters to turn                                up
on     the         terrace.          If there were not too many, it was his plan
to escort them round the pitch to the West stand.


After        the     briefing I sent all my stewards back to                           my     office
under        the     North       stand and collected the other 9                      extras.         I
signed the temporary tickets for the Sheffield United stewards.
I     reiterated          what -the Inspector had said.                      I also    told        them
that     if there was any crowd trouble they must not get involved
but      fetch        a Police Officer.             Police are               normally deployedon
the      entrances to the terrace but not on "the terrace itself. If
there        is any crowd violence the Police from these access                                    ways
and the perimeter gates would enter the terrace to sort out any
problems.


The     supporters on the terrace normally stand where they                                       want.
The          job     of the stewards is to keep the                          aisles    and        gangways
clear.         The        gangways run all the way up                        the terrace          andthe
aisles        across.          Provided       these aisles and gangways                  are       kept
clear,       the standing area is in essence a series of squares but
it     is    virtually             impossible to keep them clear.                I       told      the
United .stewards their duties in keeping these areas clear, and
left        them       to    pair off with Wesnesday stewards.                    The         United
stewards           wore red jackets and of course the Wednesday stewards
wear        yellow jackets.               I made it clear that I did not expect to
see     more than one red jacketed steward standing with a                                    yellow
jacketed steward and vice versa.


The     Wednesday                stewards are not normally deployed in                    a     fixed
position           on       the terrace.          Their job is to patrol the                  terrace
and         to        try to keep the aisles and gangways clear,                          although
as I have said this is almost an impossible task.


With        regard          to     the gatemen, the gates          are     always         unlocked
before           the gatemen arrive in the morning.                      After       instructing
the     stewards             to take positions on the terrace, I went off                            to
the     ticket office to collect the money to pay tie gatemen                                       and
                                 I normally collect the money for the                    remaining
stewards              just before the match ends.                I duly paid the              gatemen
and


From .about 12.00 onwards I spent most of my time in and about 0
gate.            The gatemen were suffering alot of abuse from Liverpool
fans who were trying to get in through this gate.                                 I told these
fans        that        they       had to walk around the ground.                Most         of    the
abuse        came        from men in the 35-50 year old bracket,                         and       most
were        wearing a jacket and tie.                  The younger ones were used                    to
being        herded about, and simply accepted that they had to                                    walk
around           the     ground.          I did not go down 'to A gate save that                     at
about        2.15 pm I was on the pathway leading to A gate and could
see     it clearly.-               I saw the two gatemen           in position,
and                         I took        a quick look and couldsee that everything
was alright and then went back to 0 gate.


Normally,              there is no reason why A gate should ever be                            opened
before           the    match           starts.     The police     normally       gain         access
through           0     gate       to     get     to the north stand       but       A    gate       is
                                              -   6 -



important as a means of egress from the north stand.


I     went        back     to 0 gate which |s the more important             gate     and
where        any trouble could be expected.             Again, 0 gate is an exit
gate for the north stand in the same way as A gate.                          Liverpool
fans were troublesome in that some had tickets for the Leppings
Lane        end     but wanted to get into the North stand.              There      were
others       who offered bribes who did not have tickets.                     I refused
those        bribes.            At this juncture I stood outside the gate                and
the     gate        was        shut.   There were no police     behind       the    gate.
There        were a couple of police constables outside 0 gate or                         in
the vicinity.


0     gate        was only opened to allow any police officers entry                      or
vehicles               such as ambulances.        I stayed in this    positionuntil
2.55 pm.               I then walked up and down the ramp by          the sideof the
pitch.             I     saw two of my stewards from the Kop          terrace and          I
chatted tc them.                 I wanted to know what     they were doing down by
the    ramp.           They told me that things were getting bad on the Kop
and    people were pushing and shoving.                 The Kop looked full.


X     had     noticed lots of Nottingham Forest supporters                    outside 0
gate        only        minutes earlier.      I told them to contact the            other
stewards           and tell them to get off the terrace and to stand                      by
the    ramp.             There     was nothing they could do and there was                no
point        in putting themselves at risk.              There were also a lot of
Liverpool supporters- on the corner.


1 then remember the match kicking off.                    I looked at the Kop and
the     north           stand     to see any empty spaces.      I then    looked          up
towards           the     west     end of the ground     and   noticed       supporters
climbing over the perimeter fence. ' I also saw supporters being
pulled       up         into     the seated area to the west end.        I    did        not
think        it    was         a pitch invasion as there was no reason             for     a
pitch invasion.                 I did not know what to think.


I     saw    more         and more people on the pitch         and   realised       that
something          was wrong.          I stood on the pitch at the corner            near

the ramp.            I saw a policeman run onto the pitch to the referee.
The referee then called off the players.


 There        was a Police Inspector or a senior officer at least                                  who
 was         about two yards behind me.                   I could see at the top of                the
 ramp         that    there were four or five police officers on                             horses.
 The         Inspector said to me that if I saw more horses collect                                 at
 this         point     I    should remove the                 advertising      boards.        These
 advertising            boards       go right round the corner of the pitch                         at
 the         North     stand/Kop       end.          I got my stewards           to     assist      in
  lifting        the        sand    bags which are weights for the                     boards.       I
  then        moved the boards to create a space for the horses just in
  case        they came onto the pitch.                   I then noticed that the horses
  were        gone     and       saw an ambulance at the top of the                     ramp.       At
  this        point     there were quite a large number of Police                            on    the
  ramp.        The     ambulance        started           to .move down      the      ramp    and    I
  realised           that the ambulance would not be able to get on to the
  running track by the pitch perimeter.


  We      moved       the        advertising hoards to create a                 space        for    the
      ambulance.           The     hoardings were moved very quickly.                     I do      not
      believe     the       ambulance      was       delayed by the          position         of    the
      hoardings       as     these     were quickly removed.               If      anything,        the
      ambulance       was delayed by the Police Officers being present                               on
      the ramp.

      When    we moved the advertising hoardings and also the sand bags
      I   noticed       spikes       in the ground which we used to                    anchor       the
      boards.        The same senior Police Officer asked me to remove the
      spikes which I did with my stewards.


      I next    remember"        seeing a young lad with a badly broken arm.                         At
      about     this time alot of Police Officers came down the ramp and
      went     across       the middle of the pitch to form a human                          barrier.
      This     was    because        the   fans       on the        Kop   were        taunting      the
      Liverpool        supporters.         There          were more       and    more     Liverpool
      supporters on the pitch.

I     saw    my        father in front of the Kop.           I gave      my       father      my
radio        and went down to the Leppings Lane end to try and                             help.
I     showed my pass to one of the Police Officers and went to the
penalty          area.         There were several bodies lying about.                  I    was
trained in first aid in 1984 whilst employed by the Gas Board.


I    did attempt mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage
on     a number of people.                  I did manage to obtain a slight                pulse
on     one       person         and    helped to take this       person away          on     an
advertising             hoarding.       I went some of the way along the., pitch
but     then       turned back and tried to help other people lying                           on
the     pitch.            I     realised      that in most cases it       was         no     use
applying the techniques I had learnt.


I     noticed three or four bodies lying in front of the Kop and I
did     attempt mouth to mouth resuscitation again on one                             person.
At     this       point I could see fireman on the pitch.                     A    Liverpool
supporter              came    up     to me and told me that he        was        a   meaical
student.               I took him to the Leppings Lane end and I remembered
that        he    was         attending to a young boy.         I then    went        off     to
attend           to a number of people who were still conscious and were
winded           and     distressed.          I noticed girls    bringing         water       to
people           on the pitch.          I also helped to give water to people on
the pitch.


I     then        wandered          about    and heard Kenny     Dalglish         over       the
tannoy            system.       I cannot remember the time.           The Police            also
made        announcements over the tannoy                 system to the effect              that
supporters              should keep their tickets.           One Police Officerwent
round        to each section of the ground with a loud hailer to                             say
that        the        supporters should keep their tickets and                   leave      the
ground.            The pitch was virtually empty when I left although                             I
cannot remember the time.


This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

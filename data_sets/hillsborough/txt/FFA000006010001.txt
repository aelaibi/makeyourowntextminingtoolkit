FA/HILLSBOROUGH

I spoke to           in connection with!
fax.

1.   The FSA petition of 7 September 1987 in connection with
the FA Cup Final between Everton and Liverpool at Wembley on
10 May 1986 still required some research. Did the FA do
anything about the problems specified in those letters?
Apparently                wanted to know what the FA had
done. We had a note on the file that a copy was sent to the
Chief Superintendent of the Wembley Police at his request on
7 May and a chasing letter was sent to the FA on
7 September. Ij   said she did not think anything was done
about it. She would leave instructions with              to
chase it up but I think the answer was that the FA did
nothing about it.

2.   With regard to the cancelled entertainment<^3a^S|P had
faxed me some documents put in by the Club in relation to
the 1988 semi-final relating to pre-match entertainment by
Superskills.  She said she was awaiting a report but as far
as she was concerned the FA had not thought the thing was
going ahead since January 1989 but it was wrongly included
in the blue booklet.  I said the heat was probably out of
this at the moment. However a response would be useful.

CHESTER CITY


1.       There has been some publicity lately about Chester City's
difficulties in finding a ground for next season.          The Club has
sold its Sealand Road ground for development.          Part of the deal
is that the developers build a new stadium for the club on a
different     site.   A planning application for the new ground on
which a decision is awaited has been submitted to Chester City
Council.      In the meantime (€he Islub^and until the new stadium is^
ready^is endeavouring to reach agreement with the Football League
on   a    ground   sharing   arrangement   with   Macclesfie^   Ir~

            REVISION OF THE GREEN GUIDE

            Thank you for agreeing to see Brian Stickley and                        myself on
            Friday 13th,  If you agree I should also like to                        bring
            Alan Brown who is working on the re-draft of the                        Home
            Office/Scottish Office Guide to Safety at Sports                        Grounds.

            I enclose for your reference two copies of the latest re­
            draft of the Guide currently being reviewed by a working
            group.  Our next meeting is on 18th July and, as X said when
            we spoke, you and Les Turner would be most welcome to attend.

            The Guide is, as you knox^, intended for application to
            existing sports grounds rather tk^n a new design brief,           Even
            so, re-development of sports stadia (football in particular)
            often invokes the requirements of Building Regulations w h i c h .
            if substantially different to. our Guide, can lead to
            diff ic ult y - as exasipled perhaps by Bristol Rugby Gr o u n d . Foi
            that reason and because of the stags 2 Review which you are
            carrying out we have a few items which we would like- if
            possible to clarify with you when we meet.      I enclose a
            "shopping list” which might usefully forra the basis of
            disc ussion      although there may be other points/issues whi
            y o u wo ul d wish to raise as well.

             Look forward to seeing you on Friday,

                                                                                    f]   '   '!

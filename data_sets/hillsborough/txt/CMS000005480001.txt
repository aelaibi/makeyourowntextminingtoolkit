               enterprise zones and it may be helpful^if I say something
               about the enterprise zone scheme.

               The scheme was introduced in 1980 on an experimental basis,
               with a view to seeing how far industrial and commercial

               activity could be encouraged in areas of physical and
               economic decay. The aim was to reduce or remove certain
               tax burdens and relax or speed up the application of

               certain statutory or administrative controls. Each zone

               lasts for 10 years and the main tax incentive is a special

               100% initial allowance for capital expenditure on industrial
               and commercial buildings.

               However, the early zones are now coming to the end of their

               10 year lives and you may be interested to know that in

               December 1987 the Government announced that a general
 extension of the enterprise zone scheme was not desirable.

 As a result, no new zones or extensions of existing zones
 will be created, except in exceptional circumstances.

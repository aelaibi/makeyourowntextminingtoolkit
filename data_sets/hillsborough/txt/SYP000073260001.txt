               Over       the       past    two     to    three     football        seasons           I h a v e n ’t e x p e r i e n c e d    any

               proximity             of    the     house    to    the    ground.

               On Saturday,                15th April        1989       ( 1 50 4 89 )    th e    day     of   t h e F .A.     Cup     Semi-

               Final       between Liverpool                 and     No ttingham Forest,                   I was     at    home



               From       12.00pm          (1200)        onwards     I became           aware       of a n    increasingly            large

               number        of L i v e r p o o l        football       fans    making          their     way along
                                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                                          SI 7 5 2

down    towards          the     ground.            They were            in g r o u p s      of   10— 15 e a c h a n d         the

overall       approximate             number             would     have        been   in the        hundreds.

I decided          to    s t a n d at      the       front       of     t he    house     by t h e n as         I was    afraid

my                                                                                                              might    get

d a m a g e d as    it w a s       parked           outside        the     house      on th e       road.

At   this     point        most     of     th e      fans were           in g o o d     humour       and    singing,           but

amongst       th e s e ,    a    few w ere           being       generally abusive                  and    swearing.

At a b ou t       2.30pm        (1330)        I saw a y oun g              supporter          with a white             t-shirt

jump    on    the       front      offside           bonnet        of    my                   car    out    front.        He

jumped       up a n d      down     on     th e      bonnet        for     a few      seconds,        shouting          and

gesticulating              at a     group           of    hi s   friends         on   the     other       side    of    th e    road.

I then watc hed             him     jump* off             t he    car a n d      follow       his    mates       down    the

road.        On    inspection,             no       damage       was     actually         caused      to    the    car.

Amongst       the       streams       of      f an s      coming        down                               quite       a majority

about     70% were          drunk        or     showed           signs     of    having       been    drinking.            A    lot
                                                                                 /
of   these        groups        we re h o l d i n g        beer       cans/7 w i n e      bottles         and    even

spirit       bottles.

I was     s h o c k e d at       the a m o u n t          of     drunkeness           from    these       fans,    even

considering             that     it w a s       a    large match.

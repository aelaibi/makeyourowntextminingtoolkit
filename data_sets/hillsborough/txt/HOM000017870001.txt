   THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


    AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY



submitted on behalf of Millwall FC


         January 1989
Introduction


This paper attempts to provide a viable solution to the
problem of football hooliganism.

It presents a modified version of the proposals contained
in the Government's Football Spectators Bill.

Its principal recommendation is the formation of a
National Away Supporters7 Club, of which membership would
be compulsory for football supporters wishing to visit the
"away" enclosure of Football League clubs.

This, it is suggested, would dispense with the need for an
identity scheme for all supporters (as proposed by the
Government) since it would directly address the root of
football hooliganism: confrontation between home and away
factions.

Adoption of the scheme would satisfy the Government's
objectives, and it could be implemented by the clubs
promptly and simply.

A detailed exposition of the workings of the National Away
Supporters7 Club is preceded by an analysis of the
background to the current situation and the correction of
some misapprehensions.
The Government's view


The Report of the Minister of Sport's Working Party, set
up to examine the viability of a national membership
scheme, summarised the Government's attitude as follows:

"The Government recognises that there has been
considerable progress on the anti-hooligan measures agreed
between Government and the football authorities.   The
Government cannot, however, accept that the level of
disorder within grounds is tolerable.  The Government and
the police remain concerned that at many grounds, football
matches continue to provide a focus for aggressive
behaviour and gestures.  These in turn may produce a
hostile environment and create the risk of disorder.   The
consequences are high levels of policing and increasingly
elaborate physical structures for crowd control and
segregation.

 The Government believes that a national membership scheme,
together with CCTV and other measures, can succeed in
removing the hooligan element from football.  The
Government sees the national membership scheme as an
essential element in a package of measures which the
Government is developing, alongside those already taken
with the football authorities, to deal with hooliganism
associated with football".

While this recognises the efforts made by the football
authorities and the clubs themselves to reduce hooliganism
within grounds, it does not take sufficient account of the
impact they have had.
Football's own initiatives to date


Over £7 0m has been invested by the pools companies since
1970 (via the Football Trust and the Football Grounds
Improvement Trust) on safety and crowd control measures.
Of that, the Sports Council estimates, some £50m has been
spent on perimeter fencing, family enclosures, police
control rooms, Football in the Community and club
membership schemes (now at 9 0 out of 92 League Clubs).

Segregation of rival fans and the introduction of
family enclosures have led to improved safety and crowd
control.

All these areas were covered by the League's own
Anti-Hooligan Committee, which provided the Government
with a 20-point action plan in November 1986 detailing
current and future initiatives to combat hooliganism.

Closed circuit television (CCTV) now in use at the vast
majority of League grounds, is recognised by the Minister
for Sport as "the single most effective anti-hooliganism
measure yet devised... the most important measure football
can take is to have a full and effective CCTV system in
place" (address to Conference on Football into the 1990s).

In January 1985, BBC's Sportsniqht broadcast CCTV footage
showing detection to arrest for bottle-throwing in a mere
2 minutes 40 seconds, during a match at Wimbledon's
Plough Lane.  All 27 English defendants of the Heysel
trial were captured on CCTV.

Extensive co-operation between clubs, police and local
authorities, as well as the exchange of information
between police forces, police 'spotters' and detector
vans, and transport manned by the British Transport
Police have all led to greater detection of offenders.
Detection, arrests and attendances


A rise in the number of arrests for football-related
offences is universally regarded by police as proof of
improved detection, not worsening behaviour.

CCTV, in particular, has given police unprecedented power
to identify non-violent offences, thus boosting the
figures.  The Guardian (10.11.88) noted "a correlation
between CCTV deployment and a rise in arrests and
ejections for racist, obscene and other chanting".

First half-season figures for '87/88 show an annual
percentage increase for arrests of 13.5%, whilst
expulsions (a direct measure of police control inside
grounds) are up even more, by 31.5%.

Of the arrests that do take place, Jack Crawford, the
League's Crowd Control Adviser, estimates that probably
only two-thirds would result in actual prosecution.   It is
also important to note that these arrest figures included
non-violent crimes, many of them crowd-related offences
such as pocket-picking and breaking into cars, as well as
drunkenness and minor disorders.

Against a total attendance figure per season of some 18
million, even the full 6147 arrests equates to 0.03% of
attendances in 87/88. And even over the last three seasons
combined, the percentage of arrests to attendances is
still 0.3%.

Arrest figures are not broken down nationally between
those occurring inside and outside grounds.  Given that
the proposed national membership scheme can only be
expected to regulate behaviour inside grounds or at
turnstiles, it is highly misleading to use the total
number of arrests as an argument in its favour.

Some police forces do break down their own arrest figures,
and this indicates only a minority of arrestable offences
inside grounds.  (Arrests at turnstiles, such as drunkenness
or carrying offensive weapons, are included as 'inside'
arrests, so swelling the figures, although they do not
actually relate to conduct inside the ground).

The cost of policing is also biased outside grounds.
Around £3.7m was paid by clubs in 1987 for policing inside
grounds, compared with a total police bill of £10m, £30m
or £4 0m (depending on the figures u s e d ) .
Violence outside League grounds (itself outside the
practical remit of the Bill) is not simply a question of
clashes between home and away fans attending the same
match.  Many incidents are the results of rival fans
meeting en route to or from entirely separate matches - in
the Underground or at motorway service areas, for example.
This is particularly true of conurbations with two or more
clubs, such as London and Merseyside.

"Crowd problems are no longer found in the grounds like
they were a few years ago.  Plastic cards won't help
because they are not magic wands that stop the thugs
outside" (Supt. Bob Edwards, at Q P R ) . Merseyside's
Inspector Jim Clow, in charge of policing at Everton and
Liverpool, also told the Mail on Sunday (20.11.88) that so
far there had only been three arrests out of 16 matches
staged so far that season. "These arrests were outside the
grounds. Inside, we have the greatest rapport with the
supporters".

This quality of policing is in turn reflected in the
declining number of FA official enquiries into
spectator disorder, of which there were only nine over the
past three seasons combined (out of a total of 7,000 League
and Cup games).

The same    three years have also seen a rise in attendance
figures    (the first sustained rise in post-war history)
with the    last two seasons' gates up 9.1% overall since the
all-time    low of 1985/86 (the shadow of Hey s el ) .

Clearly, the comprehensive measures taken by clubs, in
close consultation with police, are beginning to restore
the image of the game among the football-going public. The
clubs are also aware of their broader social
responsibility towards the communities they serve -
witness the success of 'Football in the Community' at 34
League Clubs, officially co-ordinated by the League and
the Professional Footballers' Association, with the
mission of "giving the game back to the fans". Other clubs
also operate similar community schemes of their own.
Objectives of the Bill


The principal rationale for domestic I-D cards is as a
means of exclusion for convicted offenders.  Exclusion is
also the rationale for the "restriction orders" proposed in
Part II of the Bill for matches abroad.

Football's wholehearted backing for Part II of the Bill is
illustrated by the Football League's recent letter to
MPs, which states: "We welcome this (the Minister for
Sport's) reference to the powers the Home Secretary will
seek to stop convicted hooligans from travelling abroad".

Restriction orders are nothing new in practice, given
the already widely used provisions under the Public
Order Act for "exclusion orders" banning offenders from
matches (of which 1089 were served in 1987).

(This similarity is implicitly acknowledged in the Bill
itself, which advocates that offenders already on
exclusion orders should automatically be denied membership
of the I-D scheme).

The Bill envisages that   offenders placed under
restriction orders will   be obliged to present themselves
at "reporting agencies"   (unspecified) on the day that
matches are due to take   place.

Again, this proposal is only a minor departure from existing
arrangements at attendance centres for the under 21s and
probation day centres, as well as on Community Service
(for imprisonable offences).
Practical difficulties of the Bill


One of the main dangers of the I.D scheme is the potential
delay at turnstiles caused by card processing, depending
on the chosen technology.  This may be particularly acute
at mid-week games, where in Division 1 between 3 0% and 50%
of the gate regularly arrive in the last 2 0 minutes before
kick-off.^ (League estimate). This is not something which
rescheduling can necessarily overcome.

Malfunction due to damaged cards, casual or systematic
sabotage (eg. sealing card slots with chewing gum) and
computer failure can all compound delay - as can
the altercations provoked by rightful (or especially
wrongful) computer rejection.

In the view   of both police and football authorities, delay
creates the   risk of 'flashpoints7, particularly between
rival fans,   whose effective segregation outside grounds
depends not   least on swift traffic through the turnstiles.

While the Minister's remedy for computer failure is simply
to "open the gates and let them all in",  the notion of
mass entry (even were it physically possible) is
unacceptable since it flouts policing guidelines.

At many League grounds (Liverpool and Everton, for
example) turnstiles are sited directly on public highways,
where even the threat of crowd build-up beyond known
levels is unacceptable to police.

"In short, I envisage a pretty horrendous situation facing
police at big games" (Jack Crawford).
The financial threat to clubs


Financially, the Football Spectators Bill has
far-reaching implications.  The cost of the new technology
is potentially crippling for smaller clubs (even with the
prospect of payback within the medium-term). Whichever
form of technology is ultimately chosen, it will certainly
entail hidden costs regardless of computer firms7
offers to install hardware free of charge (if anything,
the free offer is proof positive of th i s ) . The pools
companies have already gone on record as saying that the
technology cannot be funded via the Football Trur*;s.

Secondly, clubs anticipate substantial loss of gate
revenue (Arthur Young estimate 2 0%), both from regular
supporters reluctant to be tagged on a potentially
incriminating database or deterred by the cost (however
low) of subscription, and critically from casual
supporters, who account for an estimated 2 0-25% of League
attendances.  The recently-announced exemptions do not
tackle these large problems.

Luton provides an interesting model for the cost
implication of additional policing and club staffing
levels (eg. stewards) required to administer a
membership scheme - even without the considerable
resources needed to segregate rival fans.

Following the introduction of their scheme for 1986/87,
Luton's police bill was the second highest in the League,
with a per capita cost of just under twice the national
average.  Even worse, Luton's attendances fell by 2 7% in
'87/88 in what was the club's most successful year ever -
while arrests outside Luton's ground exceeded both the
national average and the average for Bedfordshire as a
whole.

"The bureaucracy appears to be disproportionate to the
objectives sought" (Alan Eastward, of the Police
Federation).
Identifying common ground


The accumulation of practical objections to the Football
Spectators Bill has conditioned the response of the football
clubs to outright rejection, in spite of football's inherent
sympathy with the Bill's basic objectives - the
elimination of hooliganism from grounds and more effective
penalties for offenders.  The truth is that the
Government's desire to put football's house in order has
long been a crucial concern for the football authorities
and clubs alike.
Football hooliganism, or plain hooliganism?


"Hooliganism" itself deserves scrutiny.  As one
sociologist wrote, "much of the behaviour we commonly
describe as hooliganism is ritualistic and non-violent"
(ritual is deeply rooted in football's heritage).
Additionally, sociologists, police and the Minister for
Sport are united in the view that football itself has only
been the focus, not the cause, of a wider problem of
hooliganism in society.

"We are probably now at the limit of what can be done to
stop football violence.  The people who did the damage in
football have already moved on.  Football was only a
vehicle. There never was such a thing as a football
hooligan.  They were violent people who found their
easiest outlet in football" (John Stalker, quoted in The
Sunday Times, 16.10.88).

"There's no such thing as a monocausal analysis or
solution.  It doesn't lie in alcohol, or in unemployment
or in affluence or in permisiveness. And to ask the
football authorities to do something about the age-old
problem of hooliganism is nonsensical".   (Sociologist
Patrick Murphy, quoted in the FT, 18.6.88).

Hooliganism has also spread to other sports, arguably as a
result of its continuing displacement from football (eg.
to boxing, rugby, cricket, bike racing, and even horse-
racing) .

Ironically, in 1985, the Association of Chief Police
Officers (ACPO) changed the name of its "Sub-Commitee on
Football Hooliganism" to "Sub-Commitee on Hooliganism in
Sport".
How good were the good old days?


The vision of a "five-year return to peace" on the
terraces, fostered by press articles remembering the "good
old days" of English soccer, is misleading.

Since the League's inception in the late nineteenth century,
violence has been a continual component of the game.   100
people were injured in clashes between rival fans at the
Scottish FA Cup Final in 1909.  In the 20 years from 1895
to 1914, no fewer than nine League clubs suffered closure by
the FA for failure to control hooliganism.  In 1947 a
linesman was shot in the chest with an airgun pellet at a
match between Preston North End and Burnley, yet The Times
made no mention of the incident the following Monday.
Hooliganism become a media issue only in the 1950s and
has snowballed since then.  Media weight, however, is
never a fair measure of substance (at the last European
Championships and World Cups, reporters were dispatched
with specific briefs to concentrate on crowd activity,
rather than attend games).
A workable alternative

A means of satisfying the spirit and objectives of the
Bill, via an alternative strategy designed to be
acceptable to all parties concerned with the game, is set
out below.

The essence would be as follows:

1. The creation of a new voluntary membership scheme for
   domestic away match attendance only, designed and regulated
   along similar lines to the proposed national I-D
   scheme.

2. Restriction of movement for those convicted of
   football-related offences in relation to matches
   both home and abroad.

3. The broader use of existing punishment schemes, such as
   attendance day centres for younger offenders and
   Community Service.

Preliminary soundings from both the police and the
probation service endorse the basic feasibility of this
proposal.
The National Away Supporters' Club - Basic Principles


* Instead of a compulsory national I-D scheme for all
  supporters, this would be a voluntary membership scheme
  regulating away match attendance only.

* Only members of the away membership scheme could attend
  any match as away supporters.

* Matches would be ticket-only for away fans, purchasable
  only at their home clubs on production of a valid
  membership card.

* Admission to the away ground would take place only on
  production of both the ticket and the membership card.

* Similar technology to that envisaged by the Football
  Spectators Bill would be installed at grounds as
  necessary in order to validate admission.

* Misbehaviour would result in the withdrawal of the
  offender's membership card, thus denying him the chance of
  buying away tickets or of gaining entrance to away
  grounds.

* Misbehaviour by home supporters who were also members of
  the away membership scheme (a significant proportion)
  would result in withdrawal of their membership.

* The away membership scheme could be given a 'club'
  identity, possibly providing cheaper travel and
  discounts on catering services (ie. 'a package deal'
  which could make away match attendance a more enjoyable
  experience).

* This scheme could feed into a national database on known
  troublemakers (a measure long advocated by the League).
Why an away scheme?


The rationale for focusing on away supporters in terms of
both control and resources is nothing new.

In fact, a strategic focus on away supporters has always
(in John Stalker's words) been the "keystone of policing".

Thanks to such measures as closed-circuit television,
segregation, membership schemes and sophisticated police
intelligence, both the home enclosure and the home fans
themselves are known entities.  Troublespots and
troublemakers are already familiar to clubs and police.

The away fans represent an unkown entity, which, under the
terms of this proposal, can now be better identified and
monitored.

Unlike the full national membership scheme proposed in the
Bill (which creates the risk of potential delays and
troublespots at any turnstile), the away scheme minimises
these risks by focusing control on a much smaller area.
This in turn minimises the logistical and financial
threats to clubs posed by the universal distribution of
computer-controlled entry.  The average away attendance in
Division 1 is only about 10% of the total gate.    (9.8% in
1986, according to League figures).

From the police's perspective, the away scheme allows them
sufficient flexibility to allocate resources and manpower
according to the needs of individual grounds, instead of
being dictated to by the requirements of the national
scheme (which is widely expected to require a substantial
increase in police manpower inside grounds).

The extent to which different police forces vary their
strategies between different grounds is quite
considerable.  So much so, in fact, that - in John
Stalker's words - "subjective policing is the only form of
policing".

"Subjective policing" is also discretionary policing.   The
Football Spectators Bill seeks to codify statutory
penalties for offences where police previously have had
the freedom to exercise judgment between arrest, ejection
or a caution.  And because the proposed Football
Membership Authority will have the right to impose its own
"justice” on offenders regardless of the outside process
of law, the police will to an extent be in the service of
the FMA.  The loss of police personnel from active duty to
monitor minor infringements will create new risks of
under-manning at places where they may be most needed,
such as turnstiles.

Under the away membership scheme, police would both retain
their freedom of discretion and be allowed to maintain
their current strategic focus on away supporters.
Circumventing the scheme

While the away scheme does not prevent away fans from
entering the home section if debarred from the away
enclosure, the available space in the home section for
all-comers is limited, since at most clubs between 50-7 0%
of the home section is strictly controlled by clubs' own
membership schemes.   (As early as 1986 the Division 1
average controlled area was 56.3%).

The remaining space can be policed with extra viligance if
need be.  Secondly, no rival supporter is likely to
infiltrate the home section with the intention of causing
trouble.  "That would simply be a short-cut to the
hospital" (John Stalker).

Standard liaison between police forces (with or without a
common national database) would also help minimise the
risk of infiltration by known troublemakers, perhaps with
the aid of shared photos or video film.
Restriction of Movement

The provisions of the Football Spectators Bill to place
restriction orders on convicted offenders to prevent
them travelling to games abroad have every place in this
proposal, although existing
provisions for "exclusion orders" relating to
domestic games under the Public Order Act do not appear
to be materially different, and might easily be extended
cover match attendance abroad.
Punishment in the Community


"The League propose that Government takes urgent steps to
bring to the attention of courts and magistrates the need
for firm and consistent sentencing of offenders" (League's
Report to the Minister of Sport, November 86).

"Punishment   in the community would encourage offenders to
grow out of   crime and to develop into responsible and
law-abiding   citizens" ("Punishment, custody and the
Community",   Government Green Paper, July 88).

"The Probation Committee have been told that priority will
be given to those new day centre projects which target
young adults" (Green Paper).

"The scope for cautioning more young adults needs to be
reviewed by police forces and the probation service should
consider whether more use should be made of Community
Service, and whether special arrangements are needed for
young adult offenders in day centres, particularly to
ensure that they face up to their offending behaviour".
(Green Paper).

The "reporting agencies" mentioned in the Football
Spectators Bill are not specified - probably because ample
arrangements already exist within the community to restrict
the movement of convicted offenders.

Attendance day centres were initiated, and are still run
by police for younger offenders ("juveniles" up to 16,
"seniors" 17-21).  Attendees frequently have bans on
soccer match attendance specified as a condition of their
probation order.

Probation day centres cater for older more serious offenders
with cumulative attendance of up to 60 days, usually at the
rate of 3 days per week.  This is a harsher regine which
can guarantee exclusion from matches.

Finally, Community Service - for anyone 16 and upwards -
has for nearly 15 years been a standard alternative to
prison for minor imprisonable offences.   The Court of
Appeal has equated 19 0 hours of community service with
9-12 months' imprisonment.

The maximum cumulative attendance is 24 0 hours, to be
completed within 12 months (12 0 hours for 16 year-olds).
The current lower limit is 4 0 hours and there is broad
consensus that this could be lowered further - "A lower
minimum would result in the order being used for less
serious offences (Green Paper).

Community Service is the most widely used of all the above
provisions.  Currently, according to the Green Paper,
31,000 offenders are sentenced to Community Service each
year, compared with a total of 69,000 sentenced to immediate
custody.

Football's stance on harsher sentencing and more
imaginative use of these existing schemes is well
documented.
Forging a link - A call for dialogue


Primarily this paper presents an opportunity for
meaningful dialogue between Government and football in
place of the disturbing (and ultimately destructive)
confrontation that exists at present.

The proposed alternative scheme provides a logical
extension of measures already undertaken by clubs, and
meets the same objectives as those set by the Bill.  By
siezing the initiative and arguing the case for a total
alternative strategy (as apposed to piecemeal rejection
of the Bill), football would allay both public and
Governmental anxiety about its desire - and competence -
to put its house in order.

   THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


     AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY



submitted on behalf of Millwall FC


         January 1989
Introduction


This paper attempts to provide a viable solution to the
problem of football hooliganism.

It presents a modified version of the proposals contained
in the Government's Football Spectators Bill.

Its principal recommendation is the formation of a
National Away Supporters' Club, of which membership would
be compulsory for football supporters wishing to visit the
"away" enclosure of Football League clubs.

This, it is suggested, would dispense with the need for an
identity scheme for all supporters (as proposed by the
Government) since it would directly address the root of
football hooliganism: confrontation between home and away
factions.

Adoption of the scheme would satisfy the Government's
objectives, and it could be implemented by the clubs
promptly and simply.

A detailed exposition of the workings of the National Away
Supporters' Club is preceded by an analysis of the
background to the current situation and the correction of
some misapprehensions.
 The Government's view


The Report of the Minister of Sport's Working Party, set
up to examine the viability of a national membership
scheme, summarised the Government's attitude as follows:

 "The Government recognises that there has been
considerable progress on the anti-hooligan measures agreed
between Government and the football authorities.   The
Government cannot, however, accept that the level of
disorder within grounds is tolerable.   The Government and
the police remain concerned that at many grounds, football
matches continue to provide a focus for aggressive
behaviour and gestures.   These in turn may produce a
hostile environment and create the risk of disorder.   The
consequences are high levels of policing and increasingly
elaborate physical structures for crowd control and
segregation.

 The Government believes that a national membership scheme,
together with CCTV and other measures, can succeed in
removing the hooligan element from football.  The
Government sees the national membership scheme as an
essential element in a package of measures which the
Government is developing, alongside those already taken
with the football authorities, to deal with hooliganism
associated with football".

While this recognises the efforts made by the football
authorities and the clubs themselves to reduce hooliganism
within grounds, it does not take sufficient account of the
impact they have had.
Football's own initiatives to date


Over £70m has been invested by the pools companies since
1970 (via the Football Trust and the Football Grounds
Improvement Trust) on safety and crowd control measures.
Of that, the Sports Council estimates, some £50m has been
spent on perimeter fencing, family enclosures, police
control rooms, Football in the Community and club
membership schemes (now at 9 0 out of 92 League C l u b s ) .

Segregation of rival fans and the introduction of
family enclosures have led to improved safety and crowd
control.

All these areas were covered by the League's own
Anti-Hooligan Committee, which provided the Government
with a 20-point action plan in November 1986 detailing
current and future initiatives to combat hooliganism.

Closed circuit television (CCTV) now in use at the vast
majority of League grounds, is recognised by the Minister
for Sport as "the single most effective anti-hooliganism
measure yet devised... the most important measure football
can take is to have a full and effective CCTV system in
place" (address to Conference on Football into the 1990s).

In January 1985, BBC's Sportsniqht broadcast CCTV footage
showing detection to arrest for bottle-throwing in a mere
2 minutes 4 0 seconds, during a match at Wimbledon's
Plough Lane.   All 27 English defendants of the Heysel
trial were captured on CCTV.

Extensive co-operation between clubs, police and local
authorities, as well as the exchange of information
between police forces, police 'spotters' and detector
vans, and transport manned by the British Transport
Police have all led to greater detection of offenders.
Violence outside League grounds (itself outside the
practical remit of the Bill) is not simply a question of
clashes between home and away fans attending the same
match.  Many incidents are the results of rival fans
meeting en route to or from entirely separate matches - in
the Underground or at motorway service areas, for example.
This is particularly true of conurbations with two or more
clubs, such as London and Merseyside.

"Crowd problems are no longer found in the grounds like
they were a few years ago.  Plastic cards won't help
because they are not magic wands that stop the thugs
outside" (Supt. Bob Edwards, at QPR). Merseyside's
Inspector Jim Clow, in charge of policing at Everton and
Liverpool, also told the Mail on Sunday (20.11.88) that so
far there had only been three arrests out of 16 matches
staged so far that season. "These arrests were outside the
grounds. Inside, we have the greatest rapport with the
supporters".

This quality of policing is in turn reflected in the
declining number of FA official enquiries into
spectator disorder, of which there were only nine over the
past three seasons combined (out of a total of 7,000 League
and Cup games).

The same    three years have also seen a rise in attendance
figures    (the first sustained rise in post-war history)
with the    last two seasons' gates up 9.1% overall since the
all-time    low of 1985/86 (the shadow of Heysel).

Clearly, the comprehensive measures taken by clubs, in
close consultation with police, are beginning to restore
the image of the game among the football-going public. The
clubs are also aware of their broader social
responsibility towards the communities they serve -
witness the success of 'Football in the Community' at 34
League Clubs, officially co-ordinated by the League and
the Professional Footballers' Association, with the
mission of "giving the game back to the fans". Other clubs
also operate similar community schemes of their own.
Objectives of the Bill


The principal rationale for domestic I-D cards is as a
means of exclusion for convicted offenders.  Exclusion is
also the rationale for the "restriction orders" proposed in
Part II of the Bill for matches abroad.

Football's wholehearted backing for Part II of the Bill is
illustrated by the Football League's recent letter to
MPs, which states: "We welcome this (the Minister for
Sport's) reference to the powers the Home Secretary will
seek to stop convicted hooligans from travelling abroad".

Restriction orders are nothing new in practice, given
the already widely used provisions under the Public
Order Act for "exclusion orders" banning offenders from
matches (of which 1089 were served in 1987) .

(This similarity is implicitly acknowledged in the Bill
itself, which advocates that offenders already on
exclusion orders should automatically be denied membership
of the I-D scheme).

The Bill envisages that offenders placed under
restriction orders will be obliged to present themselves
at "reporting agencies" (unspecified) on the day that
matches are due to take place.

Again, this proposal is only a minor departure from existing
arrangements at attendance centres for the under 21s and
probation day centres, as well as on Community Service
(for imprisonable offences).
Practical difficulties of the Bill


One of the main dangers of the I.D scheme is the potential
delay at turnstiles caused by card processing, depending
on the chosen technology.  This may be particularly acute
at mid-week games, where in Division 1 between 30% and 50%
of the gate regularly arrive in the last 20 minutes before
kick-off.  (League estimate). This is not something which
rescheduling can necessarily overcome.

Malfunction due to damaged cards, casual or systematic
sabotage (eg. sealing card slots with chewing gum) and
computer failure can all compound delay - as can
the altercations provoked by rightful (or especially
wrongful) computer rejection.

In the view   of both police and football authorities, delay
creates the   risk of 'flashpoints', particularly between
rival fans,   whose effective segregation outside grounds
depends not   least on swift traffic through the turnstiles.

While the Minister's remedy for computer failure is simply
to "open the gates and let them all in",  the notion of
mass entry (even were it physically possible) is
unacceptable since it flouts policing guidelines.

At many League grounds (Liverpool and Everton, for
example) turnstiles are sited directly on public highways,
where even the threat of crowd build-up beyond known
levels is unacceptable to police.

"In short, I envisage a pretty horrendous situation facing
police at big games" (Jack Crawford).
The financial threat to clubs


Financially, the Football Spectators Bill has
far-reaching implications.  The cost of the new technology
is potentially crippling for smaller clubs (even with the
prospect of payback within the medium-term). Whichever
form of technology is ultimately chosen, it will certainly
entail hidden costs regardless of computer firms'
offers to install hardware free of charge (if anything,
the free offer is proof positive of thi s ). The pools
companies have already gone on record as saying that the
technology cannot be funded via the Football Trusts.

Secondly, clubs anticipate substantial loss of gate
revenue (Arthur Young estimate 2 0%), both from regular
supporters reluctant to be tagged on a potentially
incriminating database or deterred by the cost (however
low) of subscription, and critically from casual
supporters, who account for an estimated 20-25% of League
attendances.  The recently-announced exemptions do not
tackle these large problems.

Luton provides an interesting model for the cost
implication of additional policing and club staffing
levels (eg. stewards) required to administer a
membership scheme - even without the considerable
resources needed to segregate rival fans.

Following the introduction of their scheme for 1986/87,
Luton's police bill was the second highest in the League,
with a per capita cost of just under twice the national
average.  Even worse, Luton's attendances fell by 27% in
'87/88 in what was the club's most successful year ever -
while arrests outside Luton's ground exceeded both the
national average and the average for Bedfordshire as a
whole.

"The bureaucracy appears to be disproportionate to the
objectives sought" (Alan Eastward, of the Police
Federation).
Identifying common ground


The accumulation of practical objections to the Football
Spectators Bill has conditioned the response of the football
clubs to outright rejection, in spite of football's inherent
sympathy with the Bill's basic objectives - the
elimination of hooliganism from grounds and more effective
penalties for offenders.  The truth is that the
Government's desire to put football's house in order has
long been a crucial concern for the football authorities
and clubs alike.
Football hooliganism, or plain hooliganism?


"Hooliganism" itself deserves scrutiny.  As one
sociologist wrote, "much of the behaviour we commonly
describe as hooliganism is ritualistic and non-violent"
(ritual is deeply rooted in football's heritage).
Additionally, sociologists, police and the Minister for
Sport are united in the view that football itself has only
been the focus, not the cause, of a wider problem of
hooliganism in society.

"We are probably now at the limit of what can be done to
stop football violence.  The people who did the damage in
football have already moved on.  Football was only a
vehicle. There never was such a thing as a football
hooligan.  They were violent people who found their
easiest outlet in football" (John Stalker, quoted in The
Sunday Times, 16.10.88).

"There's no such thing as a monocausal analysis or
solution.  It doesn't lie in alcohol, or in unemployment
or in affluence or in permisiveness. And to ask the
football authorities to do something about the age-old
problem of hooliganism is nonsensical".   (Sociologist
Patrick Murphy, quoted in the FT, 18.6.88).

Hooliganism has also spread to other sports, arguably as a
result of its continuing displacement from football (eg.
to boxing, rugby, cricket, bike racing, and even horse-
racing) .

Ironically, in 1985, the Association of Chief Police
Officers (ACPO) changed the name of its "Sub-Commitee on
Football Hooliganism" to "Sub-Commitee on Hooliganism in
Sport".
Hov good were the good old days?


The vision of a "five-year return to peace" on the
terraces, fostered by press articles remembering the "good
old days" of English soccer, is misleading.

Since the League's inception in the late nineteenth century,
violence has been a continual component of the game.   100
people were injured in clashes between rival fans at the
Scottish FA Cup Final in 1909.  In the 20 years from 1895
to 1914, no fewer than nine League clubs suffered closure by
the FA for failure to control hooliganism.  In 1947 a
linesman was shot in the chest with an airgun pellet at a
match between Preston North End and Burnley, yet The Times
made no mention of the incident the following Monday.
Hooliganism become a media issue only in the 1950s and
has snowballed since then.  Media weight, however, is
never a fair measure of substance (at the last European
Championships and World Cups, reporters were dispatched
with specific briefs to concentrate on crowd activity,
rather than attend games).
A workable alternative

A means of satisfying the spirit and objectives of the
Bill, via an alternative strategy designed to be
acceptable to all parties concerned with the game, is set
out below.

The essence would be as follows:

1. The creation of a new voluntary membership scheme for
   domestic away match attendance only, designed and regulated
   along similar lines to the proposed national I-D
   scheme.

2. Restriction of movement for those convicted of
   football-related offences in relation to matches
   both home and abroad.

3. The broader use of existing punishment schemes, such as
   attendance day centres for younger offenders and
   Community Service.

Preliminary soundings from both the police and the
probation service endorse the basic feasibility of this
proposal.
The National Away Supporters' Club - Basic Principles


* Instead of a compulsory national I-D scheme for all
  supporters, this would be a voluntary membership scheme
  regulating away match attendance only.

* Only members of the away membership scheme could attend
  any match as away supporters.

* Matches would be ticket-only for away fans, purchasable
  only at their home clubs on production of a valid
  membership card.

* Admission to the away ground would take place only on
  production of both the ticket and the membership card.

* Similar technology to that envisaged by the Football
  Spectators Bill would be installed at grounds as
  necessary in order to validate admission.

* Misbehaviour would result in the withdrawal of the
  offender's membership card, thus denying him the chance o
  buying away tickets or of gaining entrance to away
  grounds.

* Misbehaviour by home supporters who were also members of
  the away membership scheme (a significant proportion)
  would result in withdrawal of their membership.

* The away membership scheme could be given a 'club'
  identity, possibly providing cheaper travel and
  discounts on catering services (ie. 'a package deal'
  which could make away match attendance a more enjoyable
  experience).

* This scheme could feed into a national database on known
  troublemakers (a measure long advocated by the League).
Why an away scheme?


The rationale for focusing on avay supporters in terms of
both control and resources is nothing new.

In fact, a strategic focus on away supporters has always
(in John Stalker's words) been the "keystone of policing".

Thanks to such measures as closed-circuit television,
segregation, membership schemes and sophisticated police
intelligence, both the home enclosure and the home fans
themselves are known entities.  Troublespots and
troublemakers are already familiar to clubs and police.

The away fans represent an unkown entity, which, under the
terms of this proposal, can now be better identified and
monitored.

Unlike the full national membership scheme proposed in the
Bill (which creates the risk of potential delays and
troublespots at any turnstile), the away scheme minimises
these risks by focusing control on a much smaller area.
This in turn minimises the logistical and financial
threats to clubs posed by the universal distribution of
computer-controlled entry.  The average away attendance in
Division 1 is only about 10% of the total gate.    (9.8% in
1986, according to League figures).

From the police's perspective, the away scheme allows them
sufficient flexibility to allocate resources and manpower
according to the needs of individual grounds, instead of
being dictated to by the requirements of the national
scheme (which is widely expected to require a substantial
increase in police manpower inside grounds).

The extent to which different police forces vary their
strategies between different grounds is quite
considerable.  So much so, in fact, that - in John
Stalker's words - "subjective policing is the only form of
policing".

"Subjective policing" is also discretionary policing.   The
Football Spectators Bill seeks to codify statutory
penalties for offences where police previously have had
the freedom to exercise judgment between arrest, ejection
or a caution.  And because the proposed Football
Membership Authority will have the right to impose its own
"justice" on offenders regardless of the outside process
of law, the police will to an extent be in the service of
the FMA.  The loss of police personnel from active duty to
monitor minor infringements will create new risks of
under-manning at places where they may be most needed,
such as turnstiles.

Under the away membership scheme, police would both retain
their freedom of discretion and be allowed to maintain
their current strategic focus on away supporters.
Circumventing the scheme

While the away scheme does not prevent away fans from
entering the home section if debarred from the away
enclosure, the available space in the home section for
all-comers is limited, since at most clubs between 50-70%
of the home section is strictly controlled by clubs' own
membership schemes.   (As early as 1986 the Division 1
average controlled area was 56.3%).

The remaining space can be policed with extra viligance if
need be.  Secondly, no rival supporter is likely to
infiltrate the home section with the intention of causing
trouble.  "That would simply be a short-cut to the
hospital" (John Stalker).

Standard liaison between police forces (with or without a
common national database) would also help minimise the
risk of infiltration by known troublemakers, perhaps with
the aid of shared photos or video film.
Restriction of Movement

The provisions of the Football Spectators Bill to place
restriction orders on convicted offenders to prevent
them travelling to games abroad have every place in this
proposal, although existing
provisions for "exclusion orders" relating to
domestic games under the Public Order Act do not appear
to be materially different, and might easily be extended
cover match attendance abroad.
Punishment in the Community


"The League propose that Government takes urgent steps to
bring to the attention of courts and magistrates the need
for firm and consistent sentencing of offenders" (League's
Report to the Minister of Sport, November 86).

"Punishment   in the community would encourage offenders to
grow out of   crime and to develop into responsible and
law-abiding   citizens" ("Punishment, custody and the
Community",   Government Green Paper, July 88).

"The Probation Committee have been told that priority will
be given to those new day centre projects which target
young adults" (Green Paper).

"The scope for cautioning more young adults needs to be
reviewed by police forces and the probation service should
consider whether more use should be made of Community
Service, and whether special arrangements are needed for
young adult offenders in day centres, particularly to
ensure that they face up to their offending behaviour".
(Green Paper) .

The "reporting agencies" mentioned in the Football
Spectators Bill are not specified - probably because ample
arrangements already exist within the community to restrict
the movement of convicted offenders.

Attendance day centres were initiated, and are still run
by police for younger offenders ("juveniles" up to 16,
"seniors" 17-21).  Attendees frequently have bans on
soccer match attendance specified as a condition of their
probation order.

Probation day centres cater for older more serious offenders
with cumulative attendance of up to 60 days, usually at the
rate of 3 days per week.  This is a harsher regine which
can guarantee exclusion from matches.

Finally, Community Service - for anyone 16 and upwards -
has for nearly 15 years been a standard alternative to
prison for minor imprisonable offences.  The Court of
Appeal has equated 190 hours of community service with
9-12 months' imprisonment.

The maximum cumulative attendance is 24 0 hours, to be
completed within 12 months (12 0 hours for 16 year-olds).
The current lower limit is 4 0 hours and there is broad
consensus that this could be lowered further - "A lower
minimum would result in the order being used for less
serious offences (Green Paper).

Community Service is the most widely used of all the above
provisions.  Currently, according to the Green Paper,
31,000 offenders are sentenced to Community Service each
year, compared with a total of 69,000 sentenced to immediate
custody.

Football's stance on harsher sentencing and more
imaginative use of these existing schemes is well
documented.
Forging a link - A call for dialogue


Primarily this paper presents an opportunity for
meaningful dialogue between Government and football in
place of the disturbing (and ultimately destructive)
confrontation that exists at present.

The proposed alternative scheme provides a logical
extension of measures already undertaken by clubs, and
meets the same objectives as those set by the Bill.  By
siezing the initiative and arguing the case for a total
alternative strategy (as apposed to piecemeal rejection
of the Bill), football would allay both public and
Governmental anxiety about its desire - and competence -
to put its house in order.

   THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


    AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY



submitted on behalf of Millwall FC


         January 1989
Introduction


This paper attempts to provide a viable solution to the
problem of football hooliganism.

It presents a modified version of the proposals contained
in the Government's Football Spectators Bill.

Its principal recommendation is the formation of a
National Away Supporters' Club, of which membership would
be compulsory for football supporters wishing to visit the
"away" enclosure of Football League clubs.

This, it is suggested, would dispense with the need for an
identity scheme for all supporters (as proposed by the
Government) since it would directly address the root of
football hooliganism: confrontation between home and away
factions.

Adoption of the scheme would satisfy the Government's
objectives, and it could be implemented by the clubs
promptly and simply.

A detailed exposition of the workings of the National Away
Supporters' Club is preceded by an analysis of  the
background to the current situation and the correction of
some misapprehensions.
The Government's view


The Report of the Minister of Sport's Working Party, set
up to examine the viability of a national membership
scheme, summarised the Government's attitude as follows:

"The Government recognises that there has been
considerable progress on the anti—hooligan measures agreed
between Government and the football authorities.   The
Government_cannot, however, accept that the level of
disorder within grounds is tolerable.  The Government and
the police remain concerned that at many grounds, football
matches continue to provide a focus for aggressive
behaviour and gestures.  These in turn may produce a
hostile environment and create the risk of disorder.   The
consequences are high levels of policing and increasingly
elaborate physical structures for crowd control and
segregation.

"The Government believes that a national membership scheme,
together with CCTV and other measures, can succeed in
removing the hooligan element from football.  The
Government sees the national membership scheme as an
essential element in a package of measures which the
Government is developing, alongside those already taken
with the football authorities, to deal with hooliganism
associated with football".

While this recognises the efforts made by the football
authorities and the clubs themselves to reduce hooliganism
within grounds, it does not take sufficient account of the
impact they have had.
Football's own initiatives to date


Over £7 0m has been invested by the pools companies since
197 0 (via the Football Trust and the Football Grounds
Improvement Trust) on safety and crowd control measures.
Of that, the Sports Council estimates, some £50m has been
spent on perimeter fencing, family enclosures, police
control rooms, Football in the Community and club
membership schemes (now at 9 0 out of 92 League Cl ub s ) .

Segregation of rival fans and the introduction of
family enclosures have led to improved safety and crowd
control.

All these areas were covered by the League's own
Anti-Hooligan Committee, which provided the Government
with a 20-point action plan in November 1986 detailing
current and future initiatives to combat hooliganism.

Closed circuit television (CCTV) now in use at the vast
majority of League grounds, is recognised by the Minister
for Sport as "the single most effective anti-hooliganism
measure yet devised... the most important measure football
can take is to have a full and effective CCTV system in
place" (address to Conference on Football into the 1990s).

In January 1985, BBC's Sportsniqht broadcast CCTV footage
showing detection to arrest for bottle-throwing in a mere
2 minutes 40 seconds, during a match at Wimbledon's
Plough Lane.  All 2 7 English defendants of the Heysel
trial were captured on CCTV.

Extensive co-operation between clubs, police and local
authorities, as well as the exchange of information
between police forces, police 'spotters' and detector
vans, and transport manned by the British Transport
Police have all led to greater detection of offenders.
Detection, arrests and attendances


A rise in the number of arrests for football-related
offences is universally regarded by police as proof of
improved detection, not worsening behaviour.

CCTV, in particular, has given police unprecedented power
to identify non-violent offences, thus boosting the
figures.  The Guardian (10.11.88) noted "a correlation
between CCTV deployment and a rise in arrests and
ejections for racist, obscene and other chanting".

First half-season figures for '87/88 show an annual
percentage increase for arrests of 13.5%, whilst
expulsions (a direct measure of police control inside
grounds) are up even more, by 31.5%.

Of the arrests that do take place, Jack Crawford, the
League's Crowd Control Adviser, estimates that probably
only two-thirds would result in actual prosecution.   It is
also important to note that these arrest figures included
non-violent crimes, many of them crowd-related offences
such as pocket-picking and breaking into cars, as well as
drunkenness and minor disorders.

Against a total attendance figure per season of some 18
million, even the full 6147 arrests equates to 0.03% of
attendances in 87/88. And even over the last three seasons
combined, the percentage of arrests to attendances is
still 0.3%.

Arrest figures are not broken down nationally between
those occurring inside and outside grounds.  Given that
the proposed national membership scheme can only be
expected to regulate behaviour inside grounds or at
turnstiles, it is highly misleading to use the total
number of arrests as an argument in its favour.

Some police forces do break down their own arrest figures,
and this indicates only a minority of arrestable offences
inside grounds.  (Arrests at turnstiles, such as drunkenness
or carrying offensive weapons, are included as 'inside'
arrests, so swelling the figures, although they do not
actually relate to conduct inside the ground).

The cost of policing is also biased outside grounds.
Around £3.7m was paid by clubs in 1987 for policing inside
grounds, compared with a total police bill of £10m, £3 0m
or £40m (depending on the figures u s e d ) .
Violence outside League grounds (itself outside the
practical remit of the Bill) is not simply a question of
clashes between home and away fans attending the same
match.  Many incidents are the results of rival fans
meeting en route to or from entirely separate matches - in
the Underground or at motorway service areas, for example.
This is particularly true of conurbations with two or more
clubs, such as London and Merseyside.

"Crowd problems are no longer found in the grounds like
they were a few years ago.  Plastic cards won't help
because they are not magic wands that stop the thugs
outside" (Supt. Bob Edwards, at QPR). Merseyside's
Inspector Jim Clow, in charge of policing at Everton and
Liverpool, also told the Mail on Sunday (2 0.11.88) that so
far there had only been three arrests out of 16 matches
staged so far that season. "These arrests were outside the
grounds. Inside, we have the greatest rapport with the
supporters".

This quality of policing is in turn reflected in the
declining number of FA official enquiries into
spectator disorder, of which there were only nine over the
past three seasons combined (out of a total of 7,000 League
and Cup games).

The same    three years have also seen a rise in attendance
figures    (the first sustained rise in post-war history)
with the    last two seasons' gates up 9.1% overall since the
all-time    low of 1985/86 (the shadow of Heysel).

Clearly, the comprehensive measures taken by clubs, in
close consultation with police, are beginning to restore
the image of the game among the football-going public. The
clubs are also aware of their broader social
responsibility towards the communities they serve -
witness the success of 'Football in the Community' at 34
League Clubs, officially co-ordinated by the League and
the Professional Footballers' Association, with the
mission of "giving the game back to the fans". Other clubs
also operate similar community schemes of their own.
Objectives of the Bill


The principal rationale for domestic I-D cards is as a
means of exclusion for convicted offenders.  Exclusion is
also the rationale for the "restriction orders" proposed in
Part II of the Bill for matches abroad.

Football's wholehearted backing for Part II of the Bill is
illustrated by the Football League's recent letter to
MPs, which states: "We welcome this (the Minister for
Sport's) reference to the powers the Home Secretary will
seek to stop convicted hooligans from travelling abroad".

Restriction orders are nothing new in practice, given
the already widely used provisions under the Public
Order Act for "exclusion orders" banning offenders from
matches (of which 1089 were served in 1987).

(This similarity is implicitly acknowledged in the Bill
itself, which advocates that offenders already on
exclusion orders should automatically be denied membership
of the I-D scheme).

The Bill envisages that   offenders placed under
restriction orders will   be obliged to present themselves
at "reporting agencies"   (unspecified) on the day that
matches are due to take   place.

Again, this proposal is only a minor departure from existing
arrangements at attendance centres for the under 21s and
probation day centres, as well as on Community Service
(for imprisonable offences).
Practical difficulties of the Bill


One of the main dangers of the I.D scheme is the potential
delay at turnstiles caused by card processing, depending
on the chosen technology.  This may be particularly acute
at mid-week games, where in Division 1 between 3 0% and 50%
of the gate regularly arrive in the last 2 0 minutes before
kick-off.  (League estimate). This is not something which
rescheduling can necessarily overcome.

Malfunction due to damaged cards, casual or systematic
sabotage (eg. sealing card slots with chewing gum) and
computer failure can all compound delay - as can
the altercations provoked by rightful (or especially
wrongful) computer rejection.

In the view   of both police and football authorities, delay
creates the   risk of 'flashpoints', particularly between
rival fans,   whose effective segregation outside grounds
depends not   least on swift traffic through the turnstiles.

While the Minister's remedy for computer failure is simply
to "open the gates and let them all in",  the notion of
mass entry (even were it physically possible) is
unacceptable since it flouts policing guidelines.

At many League grounds (Liverpool and Everton, for
example) turnstiles are sited directly on public highways,
where even the threat of crowd build-up beyond known
levels is unacceptable to police.

"In short, I envisage a pretty horrendous situation facing
police at big games" (Jack Crawford).
The financial threat to clubs


Financially, the Football Spectators Bill has
far-reaching implications.  The cost of the new technology
is potentially crippling for smaller clubs (even with the
prospect of payback within the medium-term). Whichever
form of technology is ultimately chosen, it will certainly
entail hidden costs regardless of computer firms'
offers to install hardware free of charge (if anything,
the free offer is proof positive of this). The pools
companies have already gone on record as saying that the
technology cannot be funded via the Football Trusts.

Secondly, clubs anticipate substantial loss of gate
revenue (Arthur Young estimate 2 0%), both from regular
supporters reluctant to be tagged on a potentially
incriminating database or deterred by the cost (however
low) of subscription, and critically from casual
supporters, who account for an estimated 2 0-2 5% of League
attendances.  The recently-announced exemptions do not
tackle these large problems.

Luton provides an interesting model for the cost
implication of additional policing and club staffing
levels (eg. stewards) required to administer a
membership scheme - even without the considerable
resources needed to segregate rival fans.

Following the introduction of their scheme for 1986/87,
Luton's police bill was the second highest in the League,
with a per capita cost of just under twice the national
average.  Even worse, Luton's attendances fell by 27% in
'87/88 in what was the club's most successful year ever -
while arrests outside Luton's ground exceeded both the
national average and the average for Bedfordshire as a
whole.

"The bureaucracy appears to be disproportionate to the
objectives sought" (Alan Eastward, of the Police
Federation).
Identifying common ground


The accumulation of practical objections to the Football
Spectators Bill has conditioned the response of the football
clubs to outright rejection, in spite of football's inherent
sympathy with the Bill's basic objectives - the
elimination of hooliganism from grounds and more effective
penalties for offenders.  The truth is that the
Government's desire to put football's house in order has
long been a crucial concern for the football authorities
and clubs alike.
Football hooliganism, or plain hooliganism?


"Hooliganism" itself deserves scrutiny.  As one
sociologist wrote, "much of the behaviour we commonly
describe as hooliganism is ritualistic and non-violent"
(ritual is deeply rooted in football's heritage).
Additionally, sociologists, police and the Minister for
Sport are united in the view that football itself has only
been the focus, not the cause, of a wider problem of
hooliganism in society.

"We are probably now at the limit of what can be done to
stop football violence.  The people who did the damage in
football have already moved on.  Football was only a
vehicle. There never was such a thing as a football
hooligan.  They were violent people who found their
easiest outlet in football" (John Stalker, quoted in The
Sunday Times, 16.10.88).

"There's no such thing as a monocausal analysis or
solution.  It doesn't lie in alcohol, or in unemployment
or in affluence or in permisiveness.  And to ask the
football authorities to do something about the age-old
problem of hooliganism is nonsensical".   (Sociologist
Patrick Murphy, quoted in the FT, 18.6.88).

Hooliganism has also spread to other sports, arguably as a
result of its continuing displacement from football (eg.
to boxing, rugby, cricket, bike racing, and even horse-
racing) .

Ironically, in 1985, the Association of Chief Police
Officers (ACPO) changed the name of its "Sub-Commitee on
Football Hooliganism" to "Sub-Commitee on Hooliganism in
Sport".
Hov good were the good old days?


The vision of a "five-year return to peace" on the
terraces, fostered by press articles remembering the "good
old days" of English soccer, is misleading.

Since the League's inception in the late nineteenth century,
violence has been a continual component of the game.   100
people were injured in clashes between rival fans at the
Scottish FA Cup Final in 1909.  In the 20 years from 1895
to 1914, no fewer than nine League clubs suffered closure by
the FA for failure to control hooliganism.  In 1947 a
linesman was shot in the chest with an airgun pellet at a
match between Preston North End and Burnley, yet The Times
made no mention of the incident the following Monday.
Hooliganism become a media issue only in the 1950s and
has snowballed since then.  Media weight, however, is
never a fair measure of substance (at the last European
Championships and World Cups, reporters were dispatched
with specific briefs to concentrate on crowd activity,
rather than attend games).
A workable alternative

A means of satisfying the spirit and objectives of the
Bill, via an alternative strategy designed to be
acceptable to all parties concerned with the game, is set
out below.

The essence would be as follows:

1. The creation of a new voluntary membership scheme for
   domestic away match attendance only, designed and regulated
   along similar lines to the proposed national I-D
   scheme.

2. Restriction of movement for those convicted of
   football-related offences in relation to matches
   both home and abroad.

3. The broader use of existing punishment schemes, such as
   attendance day centres for younger offenders and
   Community Service.

Preliminary soundings from both the police and the
probation service endorse the basic feasibility of this
proposal.
The National Away Supporters' Club - Basic Principles


* Instead of a compulsory national I-D scheme for all
  supporters, this would be a voluntary membership scheme
  regulating away match attendance only.

* Only members of the away membership scheme could attend
  any match as away supporters.

* Matches would be ticket-only for away fans, purchasable
  only at their home clubs on production of a valid
  membership card.

* Admission to the away ground would take place only on
  production of both the ticket and the membership card.

* Similar technology to that envisaged by the Football
  Spectators Bill would be installed at grounds as
  necessary in order to validate admission.

* Misbehaviour would result in the withdrawal of the
  offender's membership card, thus denying him the chance of
  buying away tickets or of gaining entrance to away
  grounds.

* Misbehaviour by home supporters who were also members of
  the away membership scheme (a significant proportion)
  would result in withdrawal of their membership.

* The away membership scheme could be given a 'club'
  identity, possibly providing cheaper travel and
  discounts on catering services (ie. 'a package deal'
  which could make away match attendance a more enjoyable
  experience).

* This scheme could feed into a national database on known
  troublemakers (a measure long advocated by the League).
Why an away scheme?


The rationale for focusing on away supporters in terms of
both control and resources is nothing new.

In fact, a strategic focus on away supporters has always
(in John Stalker's words) been the "keystone of policing".

Thanks to such measures as closed-circuit television,
segregation, membership schemes and sophisticated police
intelligence, both the home enclosure and the home fans
themselves are known entities.  Troublespots and
troublemakers are already familiar to clubs and police.

The away fans represent an unkown entity, which, under the
terms of this proposal, can now be better identified and
monitored.

Unlike the full national membership scheme proposed in the
Bill (which creates the risk of potential delays and
troublespots at any turnstile), the away scheme minimises
these risks by focusing control on a much smaller area.
This in turn minimises the logistical and financial
threats to clubs posed by the universal distribution of
computer-controlled entry.  The average away attendance in
Division 1 is only about 10% of the total gate.    (9.8% in
1986, according to League figures).

From the police's perspective, the away scheme allows them
sufficient flexibility to allocate resources and manpower
according to the needs of individual grounds, instead of
being dictated to by the requirements of the national
scheme (which is widely expected to require a substantial
increase in police manpower inside grounds).

The extent to which different police forces vary their
strategies between different grounds is quite
considerable.  So much so, in fact, that - in John
Stalker's words - "subjective policing is the only form of
policing".

"Subjective policing" is also discretionary policing.   The
Football Spectators Bill seeks to codify statutory
penalties for offences where police previously have had
the freedom to exercise judgment between arrest, ejection
or a caution.  And because the proposed Football
Membership Authority will have the right to impose its own
"justice" on offenders regardless of the outside process
of law, the police will to an extent be in the service of
the FMA.  The loss of police personnel from active duty to
monitor minor infringements will create new risks of
under-manning at places where they may be most needed,
such as turnstiles.

Under the away membership scheme, police would both retain
their freedom of discretion and be allowed to maintain
their current strategic focus on away supporters.
Circumventing the scheme

While the away scheme does not prevent away fans from
entering the home section if debarred from the away
enclosure, the available space in the home section for
all-comers is limited, since at most clubs between 50-7 0%
of the home section is strictly controlled by clubs' own
membership schemes.   (As early as 1986 the Division 1
average controlled area was 56.3%).

The remaining space can be policed with extra viligance if
need be.  Secondly, no rival supporter is likely to
infiltrate the home section with the intention of causing
trouble.  "That would simply be a short-cut to the
hospital" (John Stalker).

Standard liaison between police forces (with or without a
common national database) would also help minimise the
risk of infiltration by known troublemakers, perhaps with
the aid of shared photos or video film.
Restriction of Movement

The provisions of the Football Spectators Bill to place
restriction orders on convicted offenders to prevent
them travelling to games abroad have every place in this
proposal, although existing
provisions for "exclusion orders" relating to
domestic games under the Public Order Act do not appear
to be materially different, and might easily be extended
cover match attendance abroad.
Punishment in the Community


"The League propose that Government takes urgent steps to
bring to the attention of courts and magistrates the need
for firm and consistent sentencing of offenders" (League's
Report to the Minister of Sport, November 86).

"Punishment   in the community would encourage offenders to
grow out of   crime and to develop into responsible and
law-abiding   citizens" ("Punishment, custody and the
Community",   Government Green Paper, July 88).

"The Probation Committee have been told that priority will
be given to those new day centre projects which target
young adults" (Green Paper).

"The scope for cautioning more young adults needs to be
reviewed by police forces and the probation service should
consider whether more use should be made of Community
Service, and whether special arrangements are needed for
young adult offenders in day centres, particularly to
ensure that they face up to their offending behaviour".
(Green Paper).

The "reporting agencies" mentioned in the Football
Spectators Bill are not specified - probably because ample
arrangements already exist within the community to restrict
the movement of convicted offenders.

Attendance day centres were initiated, and are still run
by police for younger offenders ("juveniles" up to 16,
"seniors" 17-21).  Attendees frequently have bans on
soccer match attendance specified as a condition of their
probation order.

Probation day centres cater for older more serious offenders
with cumulative attendance of up to 60 days, usually at the
rate of 3 days per week.  This is a harsher regine which
can guarantee exclusion from matches.

Finally, Community Service - for anyone 16 and upwards -
has for nearly 15 years been a standard alternative to
prison for minor imprisonable offences.  The Court of
Appeal has equated 190 hours of community service with
9-12 months' imprisonment.

The maximum cumulative attendance is 240 hours, to be
completed within 12 months (120 hours for 16 year-olds).
The current lower limit is 4 0 hours and there is broad
consensus that this could be lowered further - "A lower
minimum would result in the order being used for less
serious offences (Green Paper).

Community Service is the most widely used of all the above
provisions.  Currently, according to the Green Paper,
31,000 offenders are sentenced to Community Service each
year, compared with a total of 69,000 sentenced to immediate
custody.

Football's stance on harsher sentencing and more
imaginative use of these existing schemes is well
documented.
Forging a link - A call for dialogue


Primarily this paper presents an opportunity for
meaningful dialogue between Government and football in
place of the disturbing (and ultimately destructive)
confrontation that exists at present.

The proposed alternative scheme provides a logical
extension of measures already undertaken by clubs, and
meets the same objectives as those set by the Bill.  By
siezing the initiative and arguing the case for a total
alternative strategy (as apposed to piecemeal rejection
of the Bill), football would allay both public and
Governmental anxiety about its desire - and competence -
to put its house in order.

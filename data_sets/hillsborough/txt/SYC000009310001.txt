   NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.

     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
    of the following forms be adopted:

     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form. >

       Dear Sirs,

       Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
       on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the C or on er s’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
       under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       -witnesses who wish to give evidence.     I am at present engaged in considering
 )     this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

       Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
       to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
       appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
       consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
       attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
       to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

       I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       heard from you by the end of SeptenjJ>eT I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       Yours faithfully,

    Dear Dr Popper

    RE:   HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS

    As promised I list                     below           the        names           of      those           deceased               whose           next            of   kin
    have instructed me.

    You may have previously had correspondence with at least two other practices
    within this city in respect of some of the names shown in this list
    but I can assure    you that  as at the time of writing I have definitive
    instructions from   the next  of kin in respect of those named.     In those
    cases in which I have "taken over- from previous Solicitors         I either
    have the papers from those     practices or am in the process of obtaining
    them.

    If I can be          of any               further help in respect of any of the                                                                    names shown

     There  is some confusion over representation for      the family      of Gordon
     Horne  but for the purposes of this    list you should    n o t regard   me  as
     acting, if I am able to clarify the position over this young man's family
     I will get back to you.

     During the course of the next couple of days I will let you have a Steering
     Committee List of the 95 names with details of Solicitors (where known)
     for checking against your own list, I think it would be useful if we
     both had an up to date list of avoid any confusion on either side in
     ■the coming weeks.

Dear           Sirs,

Re: GORDON a 10EH (deceased) Bo.§9.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990*

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,

 Dear Sirs,

 Re :         Gordon Rodney Horn (deogaaed).
 Thank you for your letter of the 8th of August.

 I enclose a letter Reference SLP/JT/H/PM/001 which deals
 with the question of the release of the post mortem
 reports to you. On that basis, I enclose the post
 mortem report. If you cannot accept it on these terms,
 please return it unused.

  I am not clear whether you represent your clients in
  connection with the Inquest proceedings.

 As I am anxious to sort out the legal representation
 in order that I may know who to communicate with, I
 would be grateful if you could please let me know as
 soon as possible whether or not you are instructed
 in connection with the Inquest.

  If you are so instructed, I would be grateful if you
  could please let me know who precisely you represent.

  Finally, I would be grateful if you could please let
  me know whether you intend to associate yourself with
  the Hillsborough Steering Committee group of solicitors.
  This is of course a matter entirely for you, The purpose
  of my inquiry is to try and sort out which firms are
  within the groups and which will need separate communications.

  I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

  Please quote our reference.

  Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

You .will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports -until the resumption of the Inquest, when they axe
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

       a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
               subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
               they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

       b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
               conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper

Dear Sirs,

R e 8 GORDON HORN (deceased)


Thank you for your letter of 6th September.  In the circumstances
which you mention it seems thatit would be both appropriate and a
kindness to allow Mr. Horn's sister to have a sight of the P.M.
report and I enclose a further copy.  It is of course sent to you
under the usual terms and conditions which I don't think I need to
repeat.

Dear Dr Popper

RE:   GORDON HORN DECEASED

I have been consulted by Mr Horn's sister Denise Hough.




Mrs Hough would very much like to see a copy of the Post-Mortem Report
and although I appreciate you are only generally issuing these to next
of kin Mrs Hough would be most grateful if you would agree to release
a copy of the Report to me on this occasion.

I confirm that we are quite happy to pay your usual fee if you are prepared
to release a copy of the Report.

Yours sincerely

         Mrs. E.M. Doyle,




         Dear M r s . D o y l e ,

         Thank you for your letter.

         I am so sorry that you are obviously still very distressed about the sad loss
         of Gordon.

         Please do not think that Gordon would be forgotten just because you were not
         able to come to the hearings.  The hearings will go on for a long time and it
         will be very difficult for quite a lot of families to attend all or even some
         of the time, so do not worry about that.

         I am glad that you are going to the support group meetings and I hope that in
         some way at least, they will help you to come to terms with your loss.
         Nothing can replace Gordon for you, but I hope that as you think of him you
         will have some peace, as you remember the good times which he had enjoyed.



         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent

following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

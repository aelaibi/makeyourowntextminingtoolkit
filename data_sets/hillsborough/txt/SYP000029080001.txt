Dear Sir

I enclose a copy of a letter I have wri tt en to Mr John Smith, C h a ir ma n of
Liverpool Football Cl ub in regard to the tragedy at Hillsborough.

I also enclose a copy of a letter dated 20th March 1956 which I received
from the Chief Co ns ta bl e of Sh effield co n ce r n i n g a complaint I had mad e
regarding serious c rushing I had expe ri en ce d at the W e d n e sd ay Ground on the
17th March during a Cup -t ie (Sunderland v Birmingham).

The fact that this corres p on de nc e refers to so me th in g that happenned
thirtythree years ago might be of interest to you in your current enquiry.

Yours   faithfully

Dear Mr Smith

First, may I express my sincere sympathy with all those who lost loved
o n e s , relatives, anu irienos m xne traqeoy ax bneTTieiu,

We know that what happenned at Hi ll sborough was not a ssociated with the
type of violence seen in recent times,

My own experie nce at this qround on an occasion thirtythree years ago might
be of some interest and reiavsnce when consider m g the reforms neeoeo co
p rotec t s pe c t a to r s ,

On 17 th March 1956 I went with a friend to the Sh eff ie ld Wednesday (around
to see S u nde rl an d v B ir mi ng ham in a C up tie, We had terrace tickets,

Within seconds of the m a t c h commencing the forward crush became so great
that my friend was trapped behind one of the crash barriers,         Ms he had had
a lung resection    operation and I saw       the blood     drain from   his face 1 feared
f o r his life, I   managed to free his       lag w h i c h was   caught round an upright;
and we both managed to      get back to the rear of the terrace,   i. had observed
a number of abdominal injuries,      and the  situation was frightening,     we left
'the qround and set off on our return journey,

I was so incensed over this happanning, and c onc erned that the outcome
could have been tvvaqicaliy more serious that i. wrote to the Chief Consxaoie
of Sh ef field p r ote st ing that the numbers allowed onto the terraces must
have exceeded this safety figu!Nre laid down by him,

A coov of His        reply is enclosed,

The point I wish   to make is that the    answer is   not   necessarily         to have
seats on the the terraces, but simply to strictly control and limit the
numbers allowed into the various terrace sections,

If current thinking is   inclined towards  having all seats, then by so doing
they will be acc epting  the idea of less  people anyway, and that same number
(or even more  wouio oe no c;roPiem it xney were aii owe o wj

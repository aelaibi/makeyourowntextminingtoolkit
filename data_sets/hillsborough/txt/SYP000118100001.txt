              T he s e        turnstiles              are    numbersu            T-8..          The       r e m a i n d e r . of   Serial           11    were

              deployed              to    the     Upper       Concourse               of     the      North        Stand      to    pay        attention

              to        r e f r e s h m e n t .bars         etc.




              At        IE    noon       the     turnstiles             were         opened          by    Club      Stewards.             A    gats

              inside            the      ground        adjacent             to   turnstile                S was      opened        by    stewards               and

              a        temporary          barrier           placed          in   a    similar             position        adjacent             to

turnstile          12.       The' e x p l a na t i o n - g i v e n    far    this was        that    signs     for the

N o r t h S t a n d had        fae-en wron g l y      -fiKed in place on the. outside wall .

This     effectively               increased the          turnstile          capacity for           the Niprth Stand

by            and       reduced          the West S t a n d turnstile                capacity       by four.

During       the    first nour             together .with PC La r k i n                I assisted P^Kargati

5F * D i v i s i o n and two              officers      on his        serial       outside ..the turnstiles                 to

escort       two     'Ticket T o u t s ’; to', the Po l i c e Room,,                    These     two men had

several        hundred         pounds        in cash and a large                  quantity      of tickets          in

P olice       room myself            and PC La r k i n       resumed to our original                     position.

During        the first            hour    relatively        few fans entered the                   ground.         i.

o ve r h e a r d one         of the       turnstile       operators,             a young man        (possibly

turnstile          3)       call    to the operator            in the adjoining                turnstile       that 7 4

•fans had entered                  his    turnstile       in. the         first     hours.      This man       had

wo r k e d    out t he rate          per      mi nuts    that        fans would         nave to enter         ma i

turnstile           over the        next      two    hours    in order, to            reach -snr quota,

D uring       the next         hour       (1pm       2 pm)     the        rate    of fans      entering       the

ground        did not increase                significantly,.               All    entering       the   ground        were

directions,             requests          and s e a r c h e s 'e t c .

From about 2 pm the                      rate of fans        entering the              ground     began to
                        '


increase           steadily.             A number      of fans also              began a t t e m p t i n g   Co enter

the ground without                   tickets and were                prevented         from doing        so by

Police,        S t e wards         and    turnstile       operators working                 together.

At 2„25        pm I a s s i s t e d DC Friend with                    the d e tention of

without a ticket.                    He was       taken to       Che Police Room,               where wo

completed an '’E j e c t i o n               slip'    and    ejected                   from the ground           into

P en i s t o h e   Road,       at    the d i r ection        of the Police Room                 staff.

H a v i n g done        this myself and DC F r i e n d                    returned       to our     original

positions.              On our' return          it was a p p a r e n t      that there were           problems

outside          the    turnstiles'-, .with' iarg#               numbers     of    people       pushing    to enter

the      turnstiles.            The     o r d e r lyness    that    had existed prior              to our     going

to the Police R oom had di s a p p e a r e d and                        it seemed that           further

officers may             be    required outside             the    ground       in Lappings        Lane.      Before

we       could    pass any        radio message            to that       effect       (PC L a r k i n having       the

only       radio),,       Inspector Dela n e y a t t e n d e d at               our    location with a

number of Officers.                     I informed         him that       his     contingent were          required

outside,         hot     inside       the., turnstiles,           but    they were        unable    to    leave       the

ground by any             of the        exit    gates      due    to the     volume       of    people    pushing

against          them from the outside.

The       problems       outside        were    rapidly becoming worse.                    The weight       of the

threes,          with    each move         of the      turnstile,,          People 'c o m i n g .through the

turnstiles             were    s c reaming at us that we were -needed outside and                                not

in s i a s .

M any      fans entering           the     ground at this           stage were showing              signs     of

drink and a large                number        of empty beer            cans ana bottles           began    to

gather       on the floor             inside     the    turnstiles,,

At    this       stage    it seemed more            important           to assist       fans     to get    through

the turnstiles                as quic k l y as      possinle        rather        than search       them for

drink       etc,,, and         it was      necessary        to    puli a number           of    people

physically             through     the     turnstiles.

A number          of fans were           climbing       over      the walls        in an attempt          to enter

the ground and                escape     the    crush outside,,             1 wit n e s s e d    two police

0 f f i oe i-s whose          de tai 1 s I do not know             but we r e pr esuma.b 1y par t of

the ground by the                sheer weight and                force    of the       crowd.

1 then took             one    fan who      had entered           the    turnstile with o u t a ticket

and escorted him to Gate B on the a t t a c h e d                            plan      in order     to eject

him.     Gats A at       this     stage was        closed       the    steward being            unable        to

open    it because       of the       volume     of the        crowd out-side. • Gate B was ai so

closed     but an O f fi ce r at           that Gate       i nformed me           that    the     next Gate,

Gate C on the a t t a c h e d         plan was      open,        I took        this fan to that Gate,

It was    open and       people were          entering         the    ground q uickly.but            orderly.

There was       no ticket        check     being made and a c c o r d i n g l y ' 1 let             the fan           I

had escorted        to that Gate           enter    trie ground,

1 returned to           the turnstiles        where     I had been             orig i n a l l y d e p l o y e d and

shortly after           saw the Gate A opened and                    large     numbers     of fans        rushed

the gates and e n t e r e d          the g rouna      into      the North Stand,,               I was unable

to see    if this       gate was        opened     by Police Officers' or                   Stewards. I

then    turned    to see       that Gate 8 had been opened also. A g a i n                        1" -did not

see who    opened       it.                                                                                    .

I then heard tne           command       'STOP THE GAME'              over PC Lark i ns           radio»

Together with the             other     officers      at   our       location       I we n't, to the          pitch

via the    rear     of the Police           Control        post and          the u n covered       section of

the South Stand.              On doing      so -I saw that            there were a large            number           of

people    on 'the       pitch.        1 also noticed        tnat       the     elevated      section of the

Leppings Lane        terrace was           rela t i v e l y empty,,          My    immediate       reacti on

was    that a pitch        invasion had take.n place.                    However         it q u i c k Iy be came

apparent    that     the      problem was        even more           serious.        I could see

s pectators      in the West Stand              lifting        people        from the     terracing           below

into -the seated area.                Other    people were            being       lifted over       the

perimeter       fence    by Pol ice Officers.                  Ins i de the fencing             i could see

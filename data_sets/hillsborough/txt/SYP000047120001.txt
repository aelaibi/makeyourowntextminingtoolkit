Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH BARRIER 124A

Thank you for your letter dated 15 June 1990.  The video recording
is being carried out by SGS on equipment loaned by Elrond
Engineering Ltd.  The video will not be a complete record of the
whole programme of testing but will illustrate the parts of the
barrier as received, the areas of the barrier selected for testing,
the methods of removing test pieces from the barrier and further
preparation prior to testing and the types of test carried out with
the procedure and equipment used.  We enclose a copy of the final
test schedule.

Yours faithfully




  Weaver

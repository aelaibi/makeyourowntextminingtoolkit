 051.     DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 WE LEFT ON OUR OWN ACCORD JUST BEFORE IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE            MATCH WAS

 ABANDONED.


Q18

 Q52 .    DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO

 Q53.     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 J      THE MEDICAL SERVICES COULD HAVE BEEN QUICKER         ITWAS ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES

 BEFORE THE FIRST AMBULANCE ARRIVED,

 2)     THERE WAS NO BREATHING EQUIPMENT THAT I COULD SEE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WERE

 ST JOHN’S AMBULANCEMEN ABOUT IT WAS A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY REAL HELP

 ARRIVED

 Q54.     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THAT THE MIDDLE TWO PENS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOCKED OFF WHEN THEY WERE

 FULL BECAUSE IN      THE SIDE PENS THERE WAS QUITE A BIT OF ROOM.




 55)     LOOKING AT   LAST Y E M s GAME AND HOW IT WAS ORGANISED, HOW DID THIS YEAR ’S

 ORGANISATION OF THE GAME COMN^RE.          (            T

 LAST YEAR THERE      WAS A BIGGER POLICE PRESENCE AND IT WAS BETTER ORGANISED.

 LAST YEAR THERE      WAS STILL LARGE NUt^BERS IN THE CENTRE TWO PENS BEHIND THE          GOAL

 AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END AND PEOPLE W^E) CLIMBING UP INTO THE STANDS TO

 ESCAPE THE CRUSH BUT THERE SEEMED TO BE MORE SPREAD TO THE SIDES LAST YEAR.

 ALSO THERE ORGANISATION SEEMED TO BE BETTER, THERE WAS MORE POLICE THERE AS

 WELL

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE AND STEWARDS WERE SLOW TO REACT,    IT WAS THE SUPPORTERS WHO WERE

 DRAGGING THE INJURED AND DYING OUT.     I THINK IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED

 OVER THE TANNOY EARLIER.

 G54,     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

        FENCES DIVIDING THE TERRACES INTO PENS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN THERE, THIS

 WOULD HAVE ENABLED THE PEOPLE TO SPREAD OUT EVENLY ACROSS THE WHOLE OF THE

 TERRACE.     THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN STEWARDS ON THE GATES AT THE BACK OF THE

 TERRACES TO DIRECT FANS INTO THE SIDE PENS.      MORE POLICE SHOULD HAVE USED TO

 HELP THE INJURED AND DYING, THERE WAS A LINE OF POLICE ACROSS THE PITCH, WHO

SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED IN HELPING THE INJURED.      THE GAME WAS HELD AT THE WRONG

 GROUND,    IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AT OLD TRAFFORD.

 CORDON OF POLICE ACROSS THE FIELD, WHICH SHOULD           HAVE AND       COULD HAVE BEEN

 HELPING.     THIS MAY BE DUE TO LACK OF COMMUNICATION,         I D O N ’T KNOW,   BUT THE FIRE

 SERVICE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS          HAPPENING WHEN THEY ARRIVED AND WENT

 STRAIGHT TO THE FENCE

 DOWN AND GOT THROUGH THE GATE ONTO THE PITCH.

 PENS WERE ABSOLUTELY FULL - OVER FULL - PEOPLE WERE ALSO CLIMBING UP INTO THE

 STANDS.

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,   IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 NOT INSIDE THE GROUND NO, BUT OUTSIDE BY THE TURNSTILES I WAS, THIS WAS

 BETWEEN 1435 AND 1433, THIS WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO QUEUEING AND LACK OF

 ORGANISATION.

                  > — i f\T^                (j3cr>fbc/)        .

 THEY WERE CARRYING A WOMAN OUT OF THE TUNNEL,     THEY' WERE TENDING HER.             WE

 COVERED HER UP AS SHE HAD LOST THE TOP HALF OF HER CL®THING.                SHE WAS HAVING

 DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING.     I WALKED AWAY AFTER A BIT AND WHEN I GOT BACK SHE

 HAD BEEN TAKEN AWAY.

 4b    YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 NO, JUST THE CRUSH REALLY.

 GSQ

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 1530 HRS, WE WALKED DOWN THE ROAD AND SAT ON A WALL.

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

  JN ACCORD SO I COULD CONTACT HOME.


G18

 G52

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 BEEN DONE.    THE POLICE SEEMED TO STANDING AROUND BY THE TURNSTILES, THEY

 DIDN’T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO.


G19

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES.       I THINK THE

 GATE HAD TO BE OPENED BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH TO SAVE LIVES BUT IT SHOULD NEVER

 HAVE GOT TO THAT STAGE.      LIVERPOOL SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE LEPPINGS LANE

 END BECAUSE WE HAVE THE BIGGER SUPPORT.      BETTER ORGANISATION INSIDE THE

 GROUND IN REGARD TO DIRECTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO GO.

 DOING NOTHING.             SOME POLICE OFFICERS WERE HELPING BUT THE LINE OF POLICE WERE

 JUST STANDING THERE.

 2.     I HEARD A TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT AT ONE STAGE BUT COULD NOT HEAR IT.                                                                                              THERE

 ^ p U L D HAVE BEEN A BETTER P.A. SYSTEM AND IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO DIRECT

 POLICE OFFICER BUT NOT THIS YEAR.                                                ALSO LAST YEAR THE POLICE WERE TELLING

 PEOPLE WHERE THEIR TICKETS WERE FOR.                                                                    _

        I SAW 2 MOUNTED POLICE OFFICERS PUSHING/lNTO THE CROWD AND IT SEEMED TO

 MAKE THE CROWD WORSE BY CAUSING THEM TO P ^ I C
 ^ ---------------------------------------
 37     I SAW 2 STEWARDS ON NO. 2 STAND WEST STAND, WHO DIDN’T APPEAR TO BE

 DIRECTING ANYONE.                THEY WERE JUST TALKING AND I STOOD NEARBY IN CASE THEY WERE

 GOING TO DIRECT ME BUT AS THEY CARRIED ON TALKING I HAD TO ASK THEM WHERE MY

 SEAT WAS.             THE STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE ORGANISED.                                                        LAST YEAR THEY WERE

 VERY ORGANISED BUT THIS YEAR THEY SEEMED HAPPY TO STAND AROUND TALKING TO

 RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP PEOPLE.

                                                                            PAGE

 IS TfclERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE INSIDE THE GROUND

 AND OUTSIDE. THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN THE OUTSIDE OF THE

 GROUND AND THE INSIDE. THERE WAS TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION OR ORGANISATION

 OUTSIDE.

 ALSO THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS WAS WRONG.      I BELIEVE THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN MORE POLICE AT THE LEPPINGS LN ENTRANCE.

 WE STOPPED FOR A DRINK 8 MILES FROM SHEFFIELD AND THERE APPEARED TO BE A

 LOT OF POLICE THERE AND NONE OUTSIDE AT LEPPINGS LN.

 COMMUNICATIONS WERE BAD AND NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.       THE

 POLICE WERE TELLING THE FANS WHO WERE HELPING THE PEOPLE TO GET OFF THE

       ^CH.

 RELATION TO STOPPING PITCH INVASIONS.

 OF THAT CENTRE SECTION.     IN A SENSE THE DECISION TO OPEN THE GATE WAS CORRECT

 BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH OUTSIDE, BUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF     COMMUNICATION AND

SO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE POLICE WERE VERY SLOW TO REACT, SUPPORTERS WERE CLIMBING THE FRONT

FENCING, THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY DISTRESSED, THE POLICE OFFICERS, JUST TRIED

TO PUSH THEM BACK.      I SAW THAT THE SUPPORTERS WHO HAD CLIMBED OVER WERE

CLIMBING BACK ONTO THE FENCING TO HELP OTHERS OUT OF THE CRUSH.             /H E   POLICE
                                                                          /
JUST STOOD THERE NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO.       THE POLICE STOOD BY /HE GOAL,

STOPPING THE SUPPORTERS FROM GOING ONTO THE PITCH.       ALL T H I y C A U S E D

WAS CHAOS IN THE RESCUE AREA.

054

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO,

S s   JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

AT ABOUT -144QHRS THERE WAS A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT ASKING/THE FANS IN THE

CENTRE PENS TO MOVE TO THE WINGS AS OTHERS WERE WAITING TOyGET IN.                 FROM

MY POSITION I COULD SEE THAT THE PEN WAS PACKED.      THE PE^/ l E IN THE PEN

COULDN’T MOVE SIDEWAYS BECAUSE OF THE LATERAL FENCING AND COULD NOT MOVE

BACKWARDS BECAUSE OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE TERRACES VIA THE TUNNEL.             BY

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IT      WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE GROUND WAS AWARE THAT THE CENTRE

PENS WERE OVERCROWDED.       THEY SHOULD AT THIS TIME HAVE CLOSED THE TUNNEL

ENTRANCE.      THE POLICE CONTROL BOX OVERLOOKED THE LEPPINGS LN TERRACE.

F ^ M MY POSITION I COULD SEE INTO THE CONTROL BOX AND COULD SEE POLICE

OFFICERS WATCHING THE CROWD AND LOOKING IN MY DIRECTION AND OBVIOUSLY INTO

THE TWO CENTRE PENS.       ABOVE ME AND SLIGHTLY BEHIND ME THERE WAS A CLOSED

CIRCUIT CAMERA MOUNTED ON THE SIDE OF THE STAND.      THIS CAMERA NEVER MOVED AND

APPEARED TO BE FOCUSED ONTO THE TWO CENTRE PENS. BECAUSE IT NEVER MOVED I

BELIEVED THE CAMERA WAS BROKEN. ABOUT 200 POLICE OFFICERS FORMED A LINE ACROSS

THE HALFWAY LINE,    I BELIEVE THAT THESE OFFICERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELPING THE

LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WHO WERE DOING ALL THE WORK.      I GOT THE IMPRESSION THAT

THESE OFFICERS DIDN’T HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE OF THE GROUND THIS DID NOT HELP IN

THE TRAGEDY.

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

AS WHAT THE EMERGENCY SERVICES WERE USING TO COME IN.

QS4

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

H     ICIAL INQUIRY?

1. TICKET ALLOCATION

2. TRAVEL ARRANGEMENT (IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PUBLICISED THAT THERE WERE ROAD

WORKS;) AS THIS CAUSED DELAYS AND MORE PEOPLE ALL ARRIVING AT ONCE.

3. INADEQUATE PARKING FACILITIES     INADEQUATE DIRECTIONS TO THE GROUND.

4. POOR ORGANISATION AND POLICING OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND ALSO STEWARDS.

5. INSIDE THE GROUND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARER SIGNS AND ALSO DIRECTIONS

SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN FROM POLICE OFFICERS AND STEWARDS, THAT THERE WAS

FURTHER TERRACES TO THE SIDES RATHER THAN ONLY KNOWING THAT THERE WAS A

T^vlEL LEADING TO THE PENS.

6. VERY POOR PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM, IT WAS HARDLY AUDIBLE.

7. ALL FENCING SHOULD BE REMOVED, AS IT IS A CAGE NOT ALLOWING EXIT.

8. INSUFFICIENT MEDICAL FACILITY TO COPE WITH A DISASTER OF THIS SCALE.

9. THE FANS SHOULD ALSO OF BEEN AWARE THAT THE PEN WAS FULL AND THEY SHOULD

OF GONE OUT OF THE PENS IN THE CENTRE TO THE SIDES.

•10. THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED SO THAT THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE COULD OF

GOT IN, IN TIME WITHOUT HAVING TO RUSH IN.

11. I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT THE PUBLICITY THAT WAS GIVEN TO THIS DISASTER WAS

APPAULING AND UNSENSITIVE.
                                                                         PAGE   9

 •12. I THINK THAT PERHAPS POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE THE PENS WOULD BE AN

 IMPROVEMENT.

 13. THE PROBLEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED UP EARLIER * BY BOTH CAMERAS IN THE

 GROUND AND POLICE OFFICERS THAT WERE WALKING AROUND THE GROUND, ALSO STEWARDS

 THAT THE PENS BEHIND THE GROUND WERE TOO FULL.

Thank you for your letter of 23 October to Mr Bone. There are a number of matters on which I
need your help and I am grateful to you for agreeing to meet me.


Video evidence

2.      Two videotape recordings from the police monitors were exhibited to the Taylor
Inquiry, with the West Midlands police reference TB1 and TB2 (Documents 109 & 110). The
Taylor Inquiry also had as an exhibit a schedule of their contents. TB1 ran from 11.59 to 15.04
and TB2 from 11.59 to 15.34.

3.     Myunderstanding is that all the exhibits which had been prepared for the Taylor Inquiry
were^fmde available to the legal representatives at the Inquest. The material required for each
day was placed in a side room at the hearinga^^The rest of it was kept at the local police station, m ^
where any legal representative who required access"EJroH4iaveit__        »- >          j i              *'

4. • Much of this Taylor material was not used at the Inquests, including the two videotapes
TB1 and TB2. The Inquest jury saw (inquest reference C278) a ‘compilation’ which the West
Midlands police had put together for the Taylor Inquiry from footage made available by the
police, the media, and Sheffield Wednesday. The ‘compilation’ included little of TB1 or TB2
as there was much more striking video coverage of events from the other sources./WMet)!' the                              ^
footage from TB2 after 15.04 was shown on it.                                   Q t cCD i)

5.      During the inquest hearing on 13 March 1991, you said that the Jury had twice asked
about the video evidence of the terraces. You said that the videos had been looked at and there                           j


was actually next to nothing on them because not everything had been recorded - there was a                               ;

few minutes. You said it had been clipped and would be shown to the Jury but did not think it
would help much.

6.    This material became known as exhibit C539 and was shown to the Jury on 15 March 5,
1991. It was produced by Sergeant Killoch, who said that he had taken a short sequence from |

             one of the South Yorkshire police videos showing scenes of the Leppings Lane pens. The
             sequence, most of which was in time-lapse, began at 15.02. Sergeant Killoch said that the
             extract came from tape TB1 (but in fact it came from TB2). Nobody at the Inquest made any
             comment about the quality of this footage,                                    ^

             7.       I would be grateful if you can confirm or correct my understanding about all this.

             8.      TB2 also contained shots taken by camera 5 (the one mounted on the scoreboard, near
             the police control box) between 14.18 and 14.23; this showed spectators in pen 2 possibly
             following some misbehaviour. The camera zooms and pans. It shows very little of pen 3.
             These shots were not shownwn to

              9.      I understand that the Jury visited the ground and the various cameras were demonstrated
    in       to them. Would the jury have been able to see for themselves the capability of cameras 5 and 2
a     . i§   (the one on the South Stand in colour)? There does not appear to have been any suggestion
/            that camera 5 had undergone any change or repair between 15 April 1989 and the Jury’s view.
              Is this correct?                                       c A sC y J J*-* d - tb t />         /•©          £

             10.    Mr Houldsworth’s original statement dated 16 May 1989 was available to the Taylor ^
             Inquiry. I assume therefore this evidence was also available to you when you decided which '1 *
             witnesses should be called to give evidence. I enclose a copy of it for your benefit. Can you ©"*«-***“ f *^
             now recall why it was decided not to call him as a witness?                                    S/» '(*1P

                                                                                                                          »/
             The3.15 ‘cutoffpoint’

             11.    Criticisms continue to be made of your decision on this issue, even though this was
             supported by the Divisional Court. I have of course read the reasons which you gave for it. It is
             now suggested that the Jury were unaware:

                      (a) that some of those who died did so after 3.15; and ^                sJ\                  v / T)
                                                                                                    A '-fC p. 3)
                      (b) that some of those who suffered severe crushing injuries, and were unconscious,
                          recovered.      ^                                     ^

             12.     I find both these suggestions surprising since it seems clear that the Jury knew that Lee
             Nicol and Adam Spearritt died after 3.15, to mention only two. Furthermore Edward Spearritt
             gave evidence of his injuries, unconsciousness and recovery in hospital, and Mr Wardrope gave
             evidence of 17 cases being taken to intensive care, only 9 of whom died. However, I would be
             grateful for your comments on this. Would I be right in thinking that the legal representatives
             were not' under any such misapprehension, so far as you know?


              Meeting

              13.    I have told the Home Secretary that I plan to make my report to him by the end of the
              year and it is important that I should have the chance to meet you during November if at all

14.     I will not be available on Monday November 10. That leaves November 3,17 and
24 as possible dates for our meeting. I would like to see you as soon as possible and I should
be obliged if you could discuss the date with Mr Bone.

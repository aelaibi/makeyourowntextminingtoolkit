Mr R M Whalley
Secretary
Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
50 Queen Anne's Gate
London
SW1H 9AT


Dear Mr Whalley

Thank you for your letter of 19th September and I am sorry that it has been
necessary for you to send me a reminder that I had not acted on your earlier
letter.

I am now able to enclose plans supplied by our Surveyors, Messrs Knight Frank &
Rutley, of the standing areas on the Centre Court, together with the other
relevant areas.      Unfortunately, they do not have a plan indicating the
locations of the crash barriers.   I hope, nevertheless, that this drawing will
be of help to Lord justice Taylor.

Yours sincerely




Chief Executive




                  Chairman R E H Hadingham c b e   mc td   ChiefExecutive C J Gorringe

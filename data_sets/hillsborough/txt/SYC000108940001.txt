                      TUESDAY. 12th FEBRUARY 1991

                      CHARLES WILLIAM HUTT Sworn

    Q.   I think you came to the 1989 Semi Final match with
         several of your friends, is that right? - A. Yes,
         that is right.

    Q.   That is the Semi Final on the 15th April 1989? - A.

    Q.   Do you remember what time you left approximately? -

         nine and ten.

    Q. Going down you met Christopher Devonside and his dad,
       is that right? - A. We did not meet him going down.
       We went down to the Railway pub, first of all, and
B      then we were supposed to meet them there.

    Q. You were supposed to meet them? - A. Yes, I had
       arranged to meet Christopher Devonside there the day
       before and when we got there they were not there and
       so we went back to the Gateway supermarket and then
       Barry Devonside and Christopher Devonside came along
       later.

    Q. We have already heard this from Mr. Devonside and so
       I more or less knew it.  In fact, not only was
       Christopher Devonside and his dad there but you also
       met with Jason Kenworthy? - A. Yes, that is right.

    Q. At some point or other you picked up another group,
       is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q. Gary Church, Anthony Owen and somebody else called
D      Doric Street, is that right? - A. Yes, it was Gary
       Church and Doric Street.

    Q. So there were quite a lot of you. Were you all at
       the Gateway at that point or did you pick these
       people up   on the way down? - A. No, at the Gateway
       there was   me, James, Phil, Barry, Chris and Jason.

    Q. We know from Mr. Devonside and James Kenworthy that
       some people went in and bough a couple of pints of
       lager or something? - A. Yes, a few of us bought a
       couple of cans.

    Q. Did you go in or did you just drink what other people
       gave you? - A. No, I went into the Gateway.

    Q. How many    did you buy? - A. Two cans.

    Q. Two cans?   - A. Two cans of lager, yes.

    Q. For yourself? - A. For myself.

    Q. After a while you all set off and you went down to
       the ground, is that correct? - A. Yes.

    Q. You got there and at what time would you say you got
       down to the ground? - A. About half two.

    Q. What was it like when you got there? - A. It was
       crowded.




H
Did you get. through a turnstile in the end or not,
can you remember? - A. Eventually we got through a
turnstile, yes.

You did not go through any big gates or anything like
that? - A. We went through the perimeter gates.

Apart from those? - A. No.

I think all you saw was a couple of mounted Police
Officers, is that right? - A. Yes, that is correct.

You did not see any foot Officers in that immediate
vicinity? - A. No.

I take it from that that you were not searched, not
on the outside or anything like that? - A. No.

Did you experience any difficulty getting to the
turnstiles? - A. When we first got to the perimeter
gates it was crowded. We joined the wrong queues.   I
think we joined the queues for the stand or
something. We had to ask directions and then when we
got there we joined the back of the queue for the
turnstiles into the terraces just by the perimeter
gates.   It was crowded.  The crowd moved slowly
forward.   It was packed but it was not excessive.
Not in my personal experience anyway.

You were not in fear of your life or anything? - A.
No, not outside the ground.

I am talking about outside the ground now? - A. No, I
was not.

I take it from what you have said you did not see
anybody else and you thought, "My goodness me, this
chap is imminent danger"? - A. No, I didn't.

You said you were in the wrong queue initially and
you had to ask directions. Who did you ask, can you
remember? - A. I think we asked a Policeman.

Horse or foot? - A. Foot.

So there was somebody somewhere because you have just
told me you did not see any foot Officers at all? -
A. Not directly in front of the turnstiles when we
got to the right queue, no.

So where did you see them, near the perimeter
gates? - A. Yes.

                                                  C. W. HUTT


Q. Can you recollect about how many you saw near the
   perimeter gates? - A. No, I cannot recollect that.

Q. There must have been at least one because you asked
   for directions? - A. Yes.

Q. As you were slowly moving towards these turnstiles;
   perhaps I ought to just ask you this, the perimeter
   gates, were those open or shut? - A. They were open.

Q. Just so that we can get it right, Mr. Devonside
   senior had left you because he. was going somewhere
   else? - A. He had left us further back down the road.

Q. So there was really just the youngsters who were
   together if I may describe you in that term? - A.
   Yes, it w a s .

Q. In fact, you saw another friend called Simon Bell? -
   A. Yes, he joined us about four metres from the
   turnstiles.

Q. Did you say that the perimeter gates were open when
   you got there? I cannot remember if you said? - A.
   Yes, they were.

Q. You eventually got through the turnstiles? - A. Yes,
   eventually.

Q. Your friends got through as well.  I think you went
   through separate turnstiles.  You did not all go
   through the same turnstile, did you? - A. No, I think
   we went through about two different ones.

Q. As one would expect, whoever got through first waited
   on the inside until everybody joined up again, is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Would that be fair? - A. Yes.




                         /Q. I think you said that you.
                                                           5.




                                        C.W. HUTT


Q. I think you said that you entered at about 2.42 or
   thereabouts? - A. Yes.

Q. Now how do you know it so accurately it being 2.42.
   That is a pretty sharp time, if I can put it like that.
   Did you look at your watch? - A. I may have done.   I
   can't remember whether I did do.  It was roughly about
   20-to-3.

Q. You would stick with that? - A. Yes, I would, yes.

Q. And all these other lads, they may have been a minute
   or two either way, but around that time? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you the first one through, do you know, or not?
   - A. I can't remember.

Q. Okay, it does not matter that much. You got inside;
   you purchased a programme or somebody did, in the
   group a programme was bought? - A. Yes.

Q. One or two of you may well have gone to the toilet.
   I think you met a few more friends. That is right,
   isn’t it? - A. Yes.

Q. And you then decided to go on to the terracing? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And I think you went down the tunnel.     Is that correct?
   - A. Yes.

Q. You had been to the ground before.     Is that right?
   - A. Yes in 1988.

Q. That was the only other time you had been? - A. Yes.

Q. How did you enter the ground in 1988? - A. In 1988 we
   came through the same turnstiles, when we got to the
   forecourt the blue gates that lead down the tunnel were
   closed. We then followed Barry Devonside because he
   had been there before and he knew to go down to the
   right which I think leads in to Pen 2 is it?

Q. Yes. - A. We went down that way into Pen 2 and moved
   across.

Q. Do you remember in 1988 approximately what time you
   came through the turnstiles? - A. No, I could not
   remember.

Q. You can't remember that? - A. No.

Q. But you are quite satisfied in your mind that the
   gates were shut at the tunnel? - A. Yes.
                                                            6.



                                      C.W. HUTT



Q. Can you remember - we might as well dispose of that now
   - were they completely shut or only partially shut?
   - A. Completely shut.

Q. Both leaves? - A. Yes.

Q.   You know what I mean by "leaves"? - A. From what I
     can remember they were completely    shut.

Q. And do you remember whether there were any other
   Officers or Steward on this side, on the concourse
   side of those gates or not? - A. I can't remember
   seeing any, no.

Q. You don't remember seeing any? - A. No.

Q. There may have been on the other side, we don't know,
   but you would not have seen those? - A. No.

Q. What I am trying to find out is could you remember any
   on the concourse side? - A. No, I couldn't.

Q. It follows from that that you realise there was more
   than one way on to the terracing. That is right,
   isn’t it? - A. In 1988?

Q. In 1988.    Well you went in 1988 round the side? - A. Yes.

Q. So you knew you could get on to the terracing round the
   side, that would be right, wouldn't it? - A. Well when
   I went there in 1989 I had forgotten that you could
   move round to the side.

Q. I am not blaming you for that.  So what you are saying
   is when you got there in 1989 you had forgotten that
   you had gone that way .... A. Yes, the way down the
   tunnel seemed the only way.

Q. That was the only way that was obvious to you in 1989?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And all of you went down together, all this group of
   friends? - A. Yes.

Q. At about, what time would you say? - A. That we entered
   in to the tunnel?

Q. Yes? - A. About    quarter-to-3.

Q. Would I be right in saying that you had reasonably free
   passage down the tunnel? - A. Down the tunnel, yes.

Q. I don't mean that there was not another soul in it, but
   that you weren't being jostled or pushed or anything,
   you were able to walk normally? - A. Yes.
                                                           7.



                                       C.W. HUTT



Q.    When you got to the other end of the tunnel was the
     exit from the tunnel clear or was it blocked? - A. It
     was not clear no, it was blocked.   There was a whole
     line of people standing from the terraces.

Q.   How deep into the tunnel did that  line extend? - A. It
     seemed, as far as I can remember probably the last line
     of people were just inside the tunnel.

Q.   So it did not extend deep into the tunnel? - A. No it
     didn’t.

Q. How did you in fact get on to the terracing in the end?
   - A. We made our way through the crowd.

Q. Were you able to  - use your own words because I have got
   my own jargon, I don't want to use yours _ how did you
   get through that line of people at the end of the tunnel?
   - A. Well when we got there, I would say something like
   "Scuse mate" and they will move.

Q. And people moved    out of the way for you? - A. Yes.

Q. So you were able to get through? - A.    Yes.

Q. And in fact I think it is not unusual to find thatthe
   back row tends to be a little bit blocked.  Is that
   right? - A. Yes, that is normal.

Q. Having got through did you turn right or left, can you
   remember? - A. To the right.

Q. What happened then? - A. We made our way through the
   crowd.  It was quite packed but we still managed to
   make our way through and down to the right using the
   same method.

Q. Would it be fair to say then although there were a lot
   of people there you were able to in fact make your
   way? - A. Yes, there was a lot of people. You could
   not just walk normally but you could make your way
   through.

Q. You weren't being carried, that is what I am asking you
   really? - A. No.

Q. And if nothing more had happened - we know an awful lot
   did happen - but if nothing more had happened that day
   would you have been content to have stayed on that terrace
   and watched? - A. Do you mean if no more people had come
   in?   If it stayed as it was when I got in there?

Q. Yes? - A. Yes, I would have been quite content.

                                       C.W. HUTT



Q. Do you remember whether at that point a beach ball was
   being knocked about? - A. I can't remember at all.

Q.   Do you remember the beach ball at all? -   A. I don't
     remember.

Q. Do you recollect in relation to you entering the teams
   being announced? - A. At the back of my mind I seem to
   remember but I don't think I could swear on it.

Q. You can't place it, you have just got a feeling you
   did hear? - A. Yes.

Q.   Okay, fair enough. You told me that you made your way
     and in fact you took up a position? - A. Yes.

Q. And it would be right at that position were you singing
   and enjoying yourself initially? - A. Yes.

Q. I don't know, I can't remember, were you near a barrier?
   - A. No, Barry and his friend had tickets in the Stand.

Q. No, I meant barrier? - A. Was I near a barrier?

Q. Yes? - A. I was not on a barrier no so I did not actually
   see one in front of me, no.

Q. That is what I was trying to find out. Describe for
   me then, you were in this position, there were a lot
   of people there. You would have I think put up with
   it at that stage.  You were singing.  Then what
   happened? - A. Well when I was in there I noticed to
   begin with when we first got in there that there was a
   slight space at the front of the terracing but then
   I was aware that it was becoming fuller and fuller all
   the time.  It was becoming a lot more packed and the
   space at the front seemed to disappear. Being fairly
   tall I could see over. As I say it got a lot more
   crowded, more uncomfortable as the minutes went by
   as the people entered.  Obviously people were coming in
   and it was getting more and more crowded.

Q. Are you saying that right in the front, you know near
   the fencing .... A. We weren't actually near the
   fencing but I could see down over people.  I could
   see that there was a space.

Q. Further ahead of you in other words? - A. Yes.

Q. There appeared to be a bit more space than where you
   were? - A. Yes.

Q. But it was filling up? - A. Yes.

                   Q. Can you remember the teams coming out pre-match? - A. Yes
                      I can because I can remember clapping when the teams came
                      on.

               B   Q. And were you still in this position which you have described
                      to me, you know where you had taken up? - A. Roughly in the
                      same vicinity, yes.

                   Q. At that point you said you were clapping.  Does it follow
                      at that point you would still have found it acceptable,
                      I am not saying at the height of comfort, but acceptable?
                      - A. It did not seem any different at that stage to any
                      normal big game that I have been to when I have stood up.

                   Q. When did it change? - A. When I really became aware of it
                      do you mean?

                   Q. Yes? - A. Probably about five minutes or so before kick-off,
                      five or ten minutes before kick-off, I can't remember
                      exactly.

Try not to give me times.  I will tell you why in a
minute. What I want you to try and do is relate it to
events on the field, as far as you are able. - A. I
would say when I first really became aware of it, the
teams were about to kick off.

The reason why I said this, so that you might
understand, we know what time the teams came onto the
pitch, pre-warm up. That was about 5-minutes-to-3, and
kick-off was at just before 3 o'clock actually, so if
you give me a time, unless you actually looked at your
watch or looked at the clocks - if you did that, that
is a different matter, of course. What you are saying
is that it was sometime between the players coming out
pre-kick-off and kick-off .... - And kick-off, yes.

When you really became aware that things were .... - A.
Yes, because I had already been --- I was being pushed
forward by that time. There was surges coming as it
got near to kick-off, as more people rushed in I
started to move.

In fact, I think you were pushed forward to another
position, is that right? - A. Yes, I was.

That was what I would call your resting position where
you remained until things got sorted out, as far as you
were concerned? - A. That is right.

Was that the position that you arrived at, at kick-off
time or just after, can you remember? - A. Yes, it was.

You have told us that you were with quite a lot of
young men, some of whom we know unfortunately lost
their lives, and that included Christopher, of course,
and Simon and .... - A. Gary Church.

Yes, Gary Church, that is right. When was the last
time that you were with those youngsters? - A. When we
had first entered into the ground.  We were all
together initially for about the first few, I don't
know, first minute or whatever, when we got in there


Few minutes, or moments, let's say. - A. And then when
the surges happened I moved to the second position.

Does it follow that you were still together when you
were clapping when the teams came out? - A. Yes, I
should think we were.

You mentioned, you have used the word surge now and
that leads me onto the next point, which is how come
that you moved from position 1 to position 2, if we can
                                                C . W. HUTT


call it that? - A. Because there was a lot of influx    of
people from the back which    had caused the surge.

What I want to find out - you may be right about that -
what I want you to tell me is not the reason but what
you experience, do you understand? - A. Yes.

So tell me what experience moved you, if I can use the
word, or you might have moved yourself, I don't know,
from position 1 to position 2? - A. From the position I
was standing in I felt a pressure, quite strong
pressure coming from behind which propelled me forward
to the second position.

Did you feel this pressure as a steady pressure or was
it, you used the word surge, a surge I would call a
pulsed pressure - do you know what I mean by that? - A.
Yes.

Was it like that or what was it like?   - A.    It    wasquite
strong and quite fast.

In fact, when you got to position 2 you had lost sight
of your friends, the ones who unfortunately lost their
lives, is that right? - A. Yes.

You yourself were, I think, quite badly crushed at that
stage? - A. Yes.

Certainly not happy, I think that would be an
understatement probably? - A. Yes.

Did you see a little gate in front of you on the
perimeter fence? - A. Yes, I did.  It was to my right.

Can you remember what the position with regard to that
gate was? - A. My position in relation to the gate?

No, what was happening at the gate? This was just
around kick-off time, as I understand it, yes? - A.
Yes.

What was happening at the gate, as far as you can
remember? Never mind what other people have said, what
we can see on the video, it doesn t matter, just what
you remember. - A. The gate was shut, that is what I
can remember about it.

You remember it being shut? - A. Yes.

Do you recollect it being opened?  I don't mean open,
but do you actually remember somebody opening it? - A.
Yes.
                                              C . W. HUTT


You do remember that? - A. Yes.

Tell me what you remember about that? - A. When there
was all the pressure going on and I could feel myself
being crushed, somebody was shouting for the gate to be
opened.  A Policeman came along and he didn't want to
open the gate, you could tell, and then he came, he
walked away for a moment and then he came back and he
opened it and he let about three or four people out,
the nearest people to the fence, then he shut it again
and walked off.

And then? - A. Then he walked along and he spoke to a
Policewoman and then came back and opened the gate.

Did you see whether he had a radio? - A. I didn't see,
no.

You didn't see him speak into one? - A. No, I didn't.

Had you seen that Police Officer earlier, or are you
unable to say? - A. No, it was just a Policeman.

Not a Sergeant or anything like that? - A. No, I can't
remember.

Plain, common or garden Policeman if I can use that
term? - A. He could have been a Sergeant, I wasn't
really taking much notice, no.

What made you say he didn't want to open the gate?
What was it about him? - A. It was just his actions.   I
couldn't actually hear him speaking but I could see him
shaking his head as people were asking him to open the
gate.

And what you say is he did open it, as far as you could
see? - A. Yes, just for a moment and let about the
nearest few people out.

Did you see anybody being pushed back in through the
gate? - A. No, I didn't.

You didn't see that? - A. No.

Then he shut it. What was the time interval, as far as
you are concerned - this time I am going to ask you to
estimate it - between the opening the first time and
the opening the second time? - A. In relation to the
game?

Well, it is very difficult to say in relation to the
game because you probably weren't watching the game at
that time. - A. No.

                                                   C. W. HUTT


Q. Can you give any estimate? Was it a long interval or a
   short interval or a short interval, that is really what
   I am asking? - A. I couldn't say.  I couldn't say what
   the interval was, no.

Q. I think you managed to get out through that little
   gate, didn't you? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. Can you recollect whether the game was still in
   progress when you got out? - A. No, I think it had been
   stopped.

Q. You are sure about that? The reason why I ask is
   because in your statement you thought that perhaps the
   game was still in progress.  You weren't entirely sure
   but I just want to know .... - A. No, I wasn't entirely
   sure in my statement and I am not entirely sure now.
   Like I say, I wasn't really taking much notice of
   whether the game was going on or not.

Q. Actually, I think that having got out you were sat
   down, weren't you, by a Police Officer? - A. Yes, I
   was.

Q. You sat on the advertising hoardings for a little
   while? - A. Yes.

Q. Then having got your breath back you stood up? - A.
   Yes.

Q.    I think you looked around and you saw your two friends,
     James Thomas and Philip? - A. Well, that was after.   I
     had been told to go back into pen 2 by a Policeman.

Q.    Tell me about that then. - A. When I came out, after I
     had caught my breath back I stood up and a Policeman
     said to me to go into pen 2, so I went into pen 2. I
     went inthere, it was   totally empty, I mean there was
     only a couple of lines of people in there as far as I
     can remember. There wasn't a big crowd.    I went in
     there for a bit, sat on the steps in there for a couple
     of seconds catching my breath again. Then I stood up
     and I looked out and I could see James Thomas and
     Philip Bickley on the pitch.

Q. Did you see the match in play at that point? - A. Yes,
   I did.

Q.   You did, you are sure about that? - A. I think so, yes.

Q.    That is what you have said actually. That would mean
     that you would have to have been out before the match
     ended, wouldn't it? - A. Yes.

             Cross-Examined by MR, PAYNE:

Just open the black folder in front of you at 277,   Run
your eye down the column and you will come to kick-off at
14.59.30. - A. Yes.

Mr. Griffiths, would you put up the acetate that Mr. Hutt
has just marked?     Is it your evidence that atthat time,
at kick-off, you   were at position 2? - A. Yes.

Just run your eye down the column to nearly the bottom,
"15.05.24 Superintendent Greenwood on pitch and match
stopped." - A. Yes.

By that time you   were in pen 2? -A. Yes.

Between half a minute to three and half a minute after
five past three you went from position  2, through gate 3
and along to pen 2? - A. Yes.

             Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

Mr. Hutt, in 1988 where were you intending to go on the
terrace? - A. Near the middle, pen 3.

Is that where you usually stand when you go to the
football, behind the goal? - A. Yes.

In 1988, you tell us, you didn't go through the tunnel.
The gates were shut and you went with Mr. Devonside to
the side? - A. Yes.

You told us, therefore, you went into pen 2 and moved
across? - A. Yes, through the little gates in the radial
fences.   They weren't open in 1989.

I think we will find that they were open, but I am more
concerned with 1988.   You actually went through those
gates at that time? - A. Yes.

How did you find them? - A. How did I find...?

The gates in 1988, at the back? - A. The radial ones?

Yes. - A. They were open.   They weren't crowded.     You
could move freely through them.

Could you just have a look at what we have got on the
screen at the moment?   The gates you are talking about
are the ones Sergeant Griffiths is just going to point
to, those at the back.   That is the one you went through
in 1988? - A. Yes.
                                                            16

                                                    C . W. HUTT


Q.    You say in 1988, when you went into pen 2, that you could
     get through from pen 2 into pen 3? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you try and do that in 1989? - A. No.

Q. That is not because you didn't know there were radial
   gates there, but you had actually got to where you wanted
   to be? - A. Yes, that was where I wanted to be, but even
   if I had wanted to move back through them you couldn t
   have moved through the crowd anyway to get to them if I
   had wanted to go into pen 2.

Q. Well, that can't be right, can it?   You have told us in
   1989 you and a group of your friends coming in at about
   quarter to three actually moved from the tunnel to
   position 1?   You were able to go there? - A. We came
   through the tunnel. We would not have needed to move
   through the radial gates.

Q.   I appreciate that and that was the question I asked you a
     couple of moments ago.   The reason you are telling us
     you didn't go through the radial gate in 1989 was that
     you came through the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. And got to where you wanted to be, which was behind the
   goal? - A. Yes.

Q. However, had you wanted to go into pen 2, you could have
   gone through the radial gate? - A. As I was aware, I
   didn't want to go through them.   I wouldn't have needed
   to go through them.

Q. I know, but if you had wanted to, you could have done? -
   A. I can't say because I didn't see they were open.

Q. But you knew they were there? - A. I knew they were
   there, yes, but I couldn't make my way to them.

Q. You didn't try and make your way to them is what you are
   telling us because... - A. I wouldn't have been able to
   have made my way to them.

Q. Why wouldn't you be able to make your way to them?
   After all, you were able to make your way with a group of
   other people from the tunnel to point 1? - A. Because by
   the time I wanted to get out I was nowhere near them and
   it was impossible to get to them.

Q. I am not talking now about when you wanted to get out.
   I am talking about if you came down the tunnel, as you
   did, and had wanted to go to pen 2, you could have done
   so? - A. When we first got in there?
                                                 C. W. HUTT


Yes. - A. Maybe so, but I don't know whether - they were
shut.

You could have done... - A. When I first got in there,
but I didn't want to.

You could have made your way over to where you knew they
were? - A. Yes, I could have.

When you came down the tunnel to get to the point you
have marked at 1, how many were there in your group?
Not exactly, but were there... - A. Six, seven, eight.

You all moved through the pen to- where you have marked? -
A. Yes.

You would have been surprised, would   you not, if, at
quarter to three, in the area behind   the goal you would
have been able to walk there without   asking people to
move out of the way - "Excuse me"? -   A. I would have been
surprised, yes.

That is all you had to do to get to that particular
position?    Excuse me, mate", I think you have told us?
- A. Yes.

And you all eased your way through the crowd? - A. Yes.

             Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Can you help us on the reality of what it was like on
that day in the light of the questions Mr. Isaacs has put
to you.   First of all, when you entered the terrace to
get to the first position, were you going downwards or
upwards? - A. Downwards in a diagonal direction.

From your experience, if you have to make your way
through a crowd, which is easier, downwards or upwards? -
A. To go downwards.

Your description, even when you entered at quarter to,
was that although it was in a position which you were
prepared to accept, you described it nonetheless as quite
packed, is that right? - A. Yes.

You gave this answer to the learned Coroner's very proper
question, which was put in the terms of, "If nothing more
had happened would you have been content?"   You put your
answer in this way, "If no more people had come in I
would have been content."   That is right, isn't it? - A.
Yes.
                                                C. W. HUTT


Do I take it, therefore, that at quarter to three, so
long as no more people were going to come in you were
happy? - A. Yes.

But if more people were going to come in you were
unhappy? - A. Yes.

Dealing with this gate which Mr. Isaacs suggests you
could make your way to, first of all whether it be right
or wrong, why did you have the impression in 1989 that
the radial gates weren't open?   What was it you could
see or not see which gave you that impression? - A. Well,
there wasn't any impression at the time because I never
thought about it at the time.   It was in retrospect
after the event.

So be it. At a time when you might have said to
yourself, "If I could get through the radial gates to
escape, I would do so", what was the state of the crowd
around you through which you would have had to go upwards
to try and get to the gate? - A. It was packed.

Was it a realistic or feasible option open to you? " A .
No, because I thought about moving over there to begin
with when we first got in there.   I said to the others
when it started to get crowded, "Shall we move over
towards the right?"   They said, "We'll never get
through."

You yourself referred to, when answering Mr. Isaacs, that
it might have been all right if it weren't blocked or if
it was freely accessible, which in effect is what you
were saying.   You are a person who goes to many football
matches, aren't you? - A. Yes.

At some grounds is it right that means of access from one
section to another are kept open and unblocked?   In
other words, are there grounds where you can see someone
at a gate identifying it to you, directing you to it? -
A. Not directing but you can often see them, like at
Manchester United you can move freely from behind the
pens, from pen to pen.

It may be an obvious point but in view of Mr. Isaacs'
questions I want to put it to you. Was there anybody you
could see in 1989 - by which I mean somebody in
authority, be it a steward or a Police Officer - at any
position which you could see which might be at the
position of a gate showing how to get from one pen to
another? - A. No, I didn't.

I just want to make sure that your experience in 1988 is
one which is in your mind.   I wonder if I could show you
the photograph of the tunnel entrance, C.263.   Have a
                                               C . W. HUTT


look at that photograph.   That is a photograph of the
tunnel entrance at the Leppings Lane end.   Do you see on
the photograph you can see blue gates on either side,
which are open on the photograph? - A. Yes.

Just so we can see it more clearly, have a look at C.265.
Tell us using the photograph, in your own words what you
saw in 1988. - A. In 1988 when we came through it was not
as close to the gates as the photograph, but those two
blue gates were firmly shut.   There was no space at all.
It was impossible to enter.

           Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Mr. Hutt, are you sure it was the tunnel gates you saw
closed in 1988? - A. Yes, I am positive.

It couldn't possibly have been the concertina gate that
was opened in 1989? - A. No.

What time did you see those gates closed? - A. In 1988?

Yes. - A. I can't remember the times in 1988, but it
would have been after half past two, which is when we
entered the ground.   I can t remember the exact time.

After half past two.   You went around the side.  Did you
wonder why you had to go round the side?   Did it occur
to you? - A. No, it didn't occur to me because I had
never been there before so I didn't know that was an
entrance on to the terraces.   I never took that much
notice.




       Q. Did you know that
                                                              20

                                                     C. W. HUTT


Q. Did you know that area went behind the goal when you
   took up your position at the   side then? Did you
   realise the tunnel was... - A. Well, we left that
   way. We left through the tunnel in 1988.

Q. What I mean is that when you went to the side was
   that Pen 1 or Pen 2? - A. Pen 2.

Q. Did you realise then that the tunnel would have led
   you to the centre behind the goal had you gone down
   the tunnel? - A. I cannot remember thinking about it,
   no.

Q. You did make your way to the centre? - A. Yes but we
   never got on line with that because Pen 3 is there
   and we stood near to the radial fence, between Pen 2
   and Pen 3, just inside Pen 3and so with the amount
   of people I probably didn't.    I did not turn round to
   look to see the tunnel.

Q. So you did not see the tunnel wit h—    - A. So it did
   not occur to me, no.

Q. You did not see it when you took up your position in
   the centre? - A. I might have seen it but it did not
   occur to me that it was an entrance.  I did not think
   of it in those terms.

Q. You did not see it was still closed when you took up
   your position? - A. No, because I would not have been
   able to see round it.

                 Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL

Q.    In 1988 you told us that you made your way from Pen 2
     into Pen 3 via the little gate at the back? - A. Yes.

Q.   Which was open? - A. Yes.

Q.    As I understand your evidence, you were not shown
     where that gate was? - A. In 1988?

Q. In 1988? - A. No, I was not.

Q.   You found or saw that for yourself? - A. Yes.

Q.   Can I just clear up one thing arising from my learned
     friend, Mr. King's questions? Did I get this note of
     your evidence down correctly when you were asking
     questions by the learned Coroner? When the teams
     came out it was no different from a normal big
     game? - A. No.

Q. You said that? - A. Yes.
                                                               21

                                                       C. W. HUTT



Q.   That is right? - A. Yes, that is what   I said.

Q.    You have identified  position 2on the plan which is
     the position from which you left Pen 3, is that
     right? - A. Yes.

Q. At the point when the gate was opened for the second
   time and during which opening you left the pen, at
   the point of opening approximately how many people
   were between you and that gate? - A. I was probably
   about six feet away from it and so I could not say
   how many people, how many rows of people, or the
   exact number.

Q. The people between you and the gate were quite
   densely packed, were they not? - A. Yes, they were.

Q.   Of course, not only were there people in a direct
     line between you and the gate but there were people
     between the gate and the position in an arc six feet
     away from the gate all round the gate, were there
     not? - A. Yes.

Q. You happily had your health and strength and were
   able to make your way to the gate and get out? - A.
   Yes.

Q. To get to the gate did you wait your turn until the
   people in front of you had waited for the people in
   front of them who had waited for the people in front
   of them to get out, or did you go over the top? - A.
   I did not go over the top of them, no. When the gate
   first opened a few people spilled out on to the pitch
   and it created like a moment, a couple of inches of
   space, in front of me and I pushed my way through
   using my arms and my elbows.

Q. You were able to get out and were directed to Pen
   2? - A. Yes.

Q. You were not alone in going from Pen 3 to Pen 2, were
   you? - A. How do you mean? Do you mean that other
   people were directing?

Q. Other people were going from... - A. There was a few,
   yes.

Q. I wonder if you could open the file that is in front
   of you at C.360? - A. Yes.

Q. To give you an opportunity to illustrate your
   evidence what we can see there on the extreme left of
   the photograph, have you got it? - A. Yes, I have.

Q. On the extreme left is an open perimeter gate at
   which there is a Constable standing, do you see
   him? - A. Yes, I do.

Q. That is the entrance to Pen 2. There is a line of
   people walking towards that Constable? - A. Yes.

Q. Those people are coming from Gate 3? - A. Yes.

Q. You are not in the people shown in that line, are
   you? - A. I cannot see myself, no.

Q. You went the same way that those people are going? -
   A. Yes, I did.

Q. Finally you say you thought that the gate to Pens 2
   and 3 was shut in 1989? - A. Yes.

Q. If you follow the ridge of people where the pattern
   of the crowd changes diagonally from bottom right up
   towards the back of the pen? - A. Yes.

Q. You can see the gate there that you went through in
   1988, can you not? - A. Yes, I can.

Q. That is open and there is a person in front of it,
   Mr. Twidale, who gave evidence here last week.  Can
   you see a gentleman there in the Liverpool away strip
   with a moustache? - A. Yes, I can.

     MR. PAYNE: Sir, would you think it helpful to follow
up what M r . Hutt knows about the layout at Manchester
United, about the access from one pen to another? He
touched on that briefly when Mr. King was asking questions
but it did not go any further.

     THE CORONER:   I do not think it would be terribly
helpful unless one does it in the very briefest of details.

     MR. PAYNE: The relevance of it is, on the    question of
find your own level, Mr. King has several times   drawn
attention to the fact that at Anfield there are   no radial
fences.  There is a distinction between Anfield   and this.

            Further Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE

Q. Mr. Hutt, what is the position at Manchester United?
   Just explain that? - A. At Manchester United there is
   radial fences just as there is at Hillsborough with
   bigger gates in them allowing access between pens.   I
   am not even sure whether there are gates there but
   there is access between the pens.

    Q.        THE CORONER:   The gaps, whether it is a gate or
         a gap, are they at the back? - A. Yes, it is.
B   Q. Similar to this? - A. To the pens at Hillsborough,
       yes.

    Q. Arising from that, Mr. Hutt, at Manchester United are
       those gates manned by Police Officers? - A. When
       Liverpool are playing Manchester United they normally
       are, yes.

                         Further bv THE CORONER:

    Q. They are what? - A. When I have been there when
       Liverpool have played Manchester United they are,
       yes.

    Q. They are? - A. Yes.
D   Q.        THE CORONER:   Mr. Hutt, thank you very much. -
         A. Can I just say one more thing about 1988 please?
         That when we went there in 1988 before the perimeter
         gates there was smaller fencing where we had our
         tickets checked before entering into the space in
         front of the turnstiles.  There is like a row of
         small metal fences that when you walked up they were
         just outside the perimeter gates that were manned by
         Policemen that you had to show your ticket to before
         going in. Then they let you through the small fences
         and then you could make your way freely to the
         turnstiles.

    Q. In 1988 were the perimeter gates open? - A. Pardon?

    Q. What you are saying is that there were three rows? -
       A. The perimeter gates were still open but there was
       a row of small metal fencing.

    Q.   You    had   a ticket I take it in 1988? - A. Yes, I did.

    Q.    Did   you seeanybody who did not have a ticket in
         1988? - A. Not that I can recall, no.

    Q. So you do not actually know what happened to people
       who might or might not have had tickets? - A. No, I
       do not. Obviously I cannot assume, can I?

    Q. No, but you do not know. Can you just turn round to
       the model?   Can you see that sort of lighter coloured
       area on the map? Where are you saying those fences
       were that you are talking about? In that sort of
       position? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. On that part. What did we call it? We did not call
   it the concourse but we called it something else.
   Let us call it the dipped area.  It was one of the
   mounted Officers who gave it a name but I cannot
   quite remember it.  It was in that sort of area do
   you say? - A. Yes.  I cannot remember exactly but in
   that sort of area, yes.

Q. That is the area where it sounds as if this year you
   were asking directions, is that right? - A. Yes.

          MR. PAYNE: Sir, I notice you look at me. We
     have got the video, of course, in 1988 so that we can
     see exactly what the situation was.   I just wonder
     whether Mr. Hutt wants to amplify by saying what time
     this was.

Q. What time was this when you say these railings were
   there? - A. I cannot remember the exact time when I
   went into the ground but it would have been, like I
   said before, half two, round about that time onwards.
   I cannot remember exactly.

          THE CORONER:   He is not sure of his timings in
     1988 which is not surprising.

          MR. PAYNE:     We can see the film.

          MR. RUSSELL: Sir, I do not know whether the
     witness would be assisted by a photograph outside the
     perimeter gates in 1988 which, of course, we have in
     the bundle.

Q.        THE CORONER:   They are photographs taken from
     videos.  Have a look at whether you can see? - A.
     Yes.

          THE CORONER: Are you asking whether he can see
     on those photographs the thing that he is describing?

           MR. RUSSELL:  He has described the perimeter
     fencing outside the perimeter gates on the series in
     1988.   I think that is the only close up.

          THE CORONER:     Which time is it?

          MR. RUSSELL:     I am sorry, sir, it is 14.10.   It
     is the second one      inthe book.

          THE CORONER:  I do    not want us to get too deeply
     embroiled in this.

              MR. KING: Sir, there might be a very easy
         solution to it. Could I just ask a question of the
         witness?
B
             THE CORONER:      Yes, if Mr. Russell will allow.

                  Further Cross-Examined bv MR. KING

    Q. Your recollection in 1988 was that the perimeter
       gates were opened, is it not? - A. Yes.

    Q. But there was something---

             MR. PAYNE:      Not 'something', no.   Railings.

              THE CORONER: Let Mr. King ask the question.    He
         said something and I am quite happy with something.

              MR. KING: Sir, I wonder if the Jury might
         retire for a moment please?
D             THE CORONER:     Mr. King, ask the question.

              MR. KING: Sir, this is not the first time which
         has been repeated this morning.

              THE CORONER:     Mr. King, please ask the question.

              MR. KING: So be it, sir.   It is very
         disconcerting to have this happening.  In fact, I am
         not trying to put words into the witness' mouth.

    Q.         MR. KING: Mr. Hutt, you say that something
          hindered progress before you got to what you
          regarded as the open perimeter gate? - A. Yes.

    Q. The something you regarded as railings? - A. Yes,
       small metal ones.

    Q. If I were to tell you that the perimeter gates were
       shut in 1988, when you thought they were open, might
       it be that what you believed to be the something were
       railings were, in fact, the shut perimeter gates? -
       A. I cannot recall.   I cannot remember that.  I
       cannot answer that, sorry.

    Q. It was something that was filtering through and
       tickets were being asked for? - A. Yes, there was
       definitely a filtering system.

    Q. You can be shown the photographs which the learned
       Coroner has which clearly shows that in 1988, in
       contrast with 1989, the perimeter gates were shut
       much earlier on. - A. Yes.

     MR. KING:  I do not   know if he can be   shown the
photographs which show that very clearly?

     THE CORONER:  I may be mistaken but looking at
the photographs I would have thought at 14.10, for
instance, the gates leading into the roadway appear
shut but the gate leading into the turnstile area
appears to me to be open.  I may be wrong but I think
the same applies again on the 14.20.  I have not
studied the rest.

     MR. KING: Certainly at least two of the gates
appear shut.  I think my   learned friend, Mr.
Catchpole, points out to  me that two gates    were shut
all the way through the sequence.

     THE CORONER: Yes, that is the way I see the
photographs. Mr. Russell, we interrupted you.

           MR. RUSSELL: Sir, I don't think it is necessary
     to ask any questions.  The jury have got these
     photographs.  They can see which gates are open and
     which gates are shut all the way from 2 o'clock to
     3 o'clock and what the position was outside the
     perimeter gates.

           THE CORONER:  I think, my feeling is they will
     put the evidence in the light of what is available and
     make an appropriate assessment in due course.

               Mr. Hutt, thank you very much indeed for helping
     us.
           Ladies and gentlemen, we will pause for a few
     minutes and then we will listen to Mr. Latham.

                             Bv THE CORONER:


Q. Is it Roger Latham? - A. Yes.

q   . of                                 r Liverpool? - A. That is
      right.

Q.    You       came by car? - A. Yes.

Q.    You came via the Snake Pass I believe.          Is thatright?
      - A. Yes.

Q. Do you by chance remember what time you left? - A. Left
   home?

Q. Yes? - A. Approximately quarter-past-10, half-past-10.

Q. What time did you arrive in Sheffield? - A. I arrived
   in Sheffield about half-past-2.

Q.    But you had actually stopped somewhere         for a pub    lunch
      I think in the Snake Pass? - A. Yes.

Q. What time did you stop there? - A. I stopped approximately
   20-to-l but it was not open.

Q. It was not open? - A. No, it was not open.  I don't
   remember the name of the pub but I remember it was
   1 o'clock.

Q. So you mean to say it was totally unsuccessful? - A. No,
   we stopped.  It opened at 1 o'clock so we waited outside.

Q.   I see.   So you had to wait? - A. Yes.

Q.   And then you did manage to get a meal? - A. Yes.

Q.   Having had your meal you then set off and came into
     Sheffield? - A. No, we stayed. We had a couple of pints
     and I had my guitar and I gave them all a song.

Q. I didn't hear you? - A. I said I always take my guitar
   with me.  I took the guitar and give them a few songs
   and we had a couple of pints and we carried on till
   half-past-2.

Q. I see, so you provided free entertainment for the pub?
   - A. Yes, I do that regular, it is good fun.

Q. It's very nice.  I almost said perhaps you could do it
   for us now but that would not be quite appropriate.
   What time did you leave the pub would you say? - A.
   2 o'clock.

Q. Then you said you arrived in Sheffield about 2.30.        That
   is right? - A. Yes.

Q. And you parked, I take it, and you made your way to
   the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. What time would you say you got to the ground? - A. I
   got to the ground approximately 20-to-3.

Q. So it only took you a few minutes to park and walk? -
   A. Yes.

Q. You weren't very far? - A. Yes, we parked up about half-past
   and then we sort of made our way but we could not quite
   find how to get into Hillsborough, you know, the ground
   itself, so what it was we walked up, we asked this lady
   and she showed us how to get there, so we basically got
   to Leppings Lane if you like approximately quarter-to-3,
   20-to, quarter-to-3.

Q. It does not matter to the minute anyway, but that sort
   of order you say? - A. Yes.

Q. We know from other people that there were an awful lot
   of people there and you would agree with that, wouldn't
   you? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you just tell me this: either when you got there
   or during the time when you were still outside the
                                                        29



                                       R . LATHAM



     turnstile did you see a Land Rover at all? - A. I would
     not like to say I did, no.  I would not like to say I
     had actually seen a Land Rover.

Q. You didn't and you didn't hear any announcements over
   loud speakers or Tannoys? - A. No.

Q. That is right, is it? - A. I never heard no Tannoy system
   or anything.

Q. But you did see one Policeman in the crowd, I think? -
   A. I saw a Policeman on a horse, a brown horse.

Q. Now we don't need to spend too much time as to how you
   got to it because we have heard from dozens of people
   about getting through the crowd, but in the end I think
   you got towards a large concertina gate.  Is that right?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know which one it was? - A. No.    I must admit
   it was too crowded.

Q.    On the model do you think you could find it? - A. I don't
     think I could.   To be quite honest I don't think I would
     be able to say that was the one.

Q.   Let me ask you this:  when you got through the concertina
     gate, I will ask you a few things about it in a moment,
     could you see a tunnel straight ahead of you? - A. Yes,
     as you sort of turned left it was there, it was just
     there.

Q. So you could see it.  In that case it was probably Gate C
   because that is the only one you can see that tunnel
   clearly. As you got to the gate it was wide open.    Is
   that right? - A. No, it was sort of being opened.

Q. I think you actually saw a a Policeman at that gate? -
   A. Yes, when I say "a Policeman" he had a coat on, but
   you know to be quite honest I would not like to say
   yea or nay.  It is not fair. He looked a big lad.

Q. He looked as if he was somebody official? - A. Yes, an
   official, yes.

Q. And he actually said something to you, didn't he? - A.
   Yes. He said:   "I would not advise you coming in here".
   I said:  "Pardon" and he went and said it again and when
   he was saying it a second time we had gone in and I
   thought I was getting arrested then.  I thought:  "I
   have got a ticket".
                                   R . LATHAM



In other words you interpreted that as     meaning:"This
is not the correct entry point"? - A.      Yes.

He said it twice but by then you had already gone past
him? - A. It was already on the move.

Were you having free passage through that gate or were
you being moved by the crowd? - A. You were basically
being moved by the crowd.  The crowd was so enormous,
if you like.  It was not unruly.  It was not pushing.
They didn't push the gate down.

I am not suggesting that. What I am trying to find out
is whether you walked past this chap thinking to yourself:
"Well I don't care what you are saying I have got a
ticket" or whether you were saying that you .... A. No,
I didn't.  I said:  "Pardon".  I actually said "Pardon"
and as I said "Pardon" he did say again and we had gone
then.

I think you got into the concourse area? - A. Yes.

You actually saw a couple of Police Officers in that
area, didn't you? - A. I definitely saw one talking to
a number of supporters.

One of the supporters? - A. Well I think there might
have been two or three around him, may be asking him ....

You of course still had your full ticket didn't you?
- A. Yes.

And you   and your friend were together?   - A. Yes.

I think you then made a comment as you were going towards
the tunnel, you spoke to your friend, you said something
about having the ticket. Can you tell me what you said?
- A. I said, well he said to me:   "Hey Bobby it is another
Watford".  I said:   "What do you mean?" He said:   "Well
the same thing happened there." The gates opened there.
We did not push them down. They opened at Watford when
we played at Watford.

Tell me about that? - A. Well we got to Watford.  It was
unfortunate the train was a bit late or whatever. When
we got there we walked up towards it and the next thing
we are in the ground, no turnstiles, we are in the ground,
but the difference between Watford and Hillsborough, when
you all got in behind the goal, if you like, it was
straight through like here, whereas in Hillsborough as
we know now we had got sections.

Q. Stick to the gate for a minute. When was that, this
   Watford thing? - A. I must admit I would not like to
   say.  It was 1988 or 1986.  I mean if you check back ....

Q. Who was playing? - A. Liverpool were playing Watford.
   It was actually on the 17th of March, so if anyone wants
   to check the fixtures.

Q. That is okay, but are you saying that on that occasion
   a big gate was opened? - A. Yes, it was just an ordinary
   gate, a big barn door gate open and you all walked in.

Q. Do you remember whether there were a lot of people outside
   on that occasion? - A. No, because we were just sort of
   walking through at leisure.  You actually weren't just
   pushing, you weren't like Hillsborough, you were actually
   walking at leisure into the ground.

Q. So you have had previous experience of walking through
   a big gate? - A. Yes.

Q. Not at Hillsborough but at Watford? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that very close to kick-off as well, can you remember?
   - A. No, it was well I would say about quarter-of-an-hour
   before kick-off.  It was a night match, it was a replay
   actually.

Q. You don't know the reason why that gate might have been
   open? - A. No, I don't.

Q. But you say it was different in the sense that in Watford
   you were walking through freely whereas in Hillsborough
   you were saying something about being carried .... A. When
   you got into the forecourt I was looking for my turnstile
   which is 'B', so I was looking for 'B' and when I was
   looking for its  "Well that one is not mine because it
   is 'A'" and then of course everyone is milling around
   and it is all sort of congregated together and we all
   started walking together and I was still looking for my
   turnstile and the next thing this chap says:   "I would
   not advise you to go in there" and I went "Pardon" and
   it was too late I was in but I did not realise I was in.

Q.   Until you had gone past him? -       A. Yes.

Q.    Anyway, having got through you saw a big tunnel in
     front of you. Right? - A. Yes, I have been through that
     tunnel before, by the way, in a league match.

Q. So you have been to Hillsborough before? - A. Yes, in
   1986.

Q. So you knew about the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q.    Did you know about the radial fences, the fences which
     divide? - A. They weren't there in 1986. There was
     only the front fence, the big fence in the front.    It
     was not boxed off.

Q. Just think very carefully because they were there in
   1986.  I tell you that. That does not necessarily mean
   that you noticed them, but are you sure it was in 1986
   that you were in Hillsborough? - A. Yes. The reason
   I know it was 1986 because when we did the double.

Q.   But you have no recollection of   the radial fences in
     1986? - A. No.

Q. So did you go down the tunnel in 1986 as well? - A. Yes.

Q. And that is where you went in 1989, we are concentrating
   on 1989 now? - A. Yes.

Q. Having got into the tunnel could you see the pitch as you
   entered the tunnel? - A. When you were actually entering
   the tunnel you could actually see the players on there
   but when you got through the tunnel, obviously with me
   being a small chap I came up against a bigger chap if
   you like and then I could not see the pitch.

Q. It sounds to me as if what you are saying is when you
   entered the tunnel the players were already on the field,
   you could see them? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that right? - A. Yes, kicking about.

Q. You know, warming up presumably? - A. Yes.

Q. As you say you are not as tall as some of the other lads?
   - A. No.

Q. But going down the tunnel were you able to walk freely?
   - A. Yes, oh yes.

Q. You weren't being pushed? - A. No, no.

Q. In fact I think you saw a number of people standing against
   the wall whilst you were there? - A. Having a wee, yes.

Q. I am not too worried about that, we knew that from some­
   body else, but what I am trying to find out they were there
   at the time when you were going down? - A. Yes.

Q. Does it mean in fact there was sufficient space in the
   tunnel for you to get down for them to stand? - A. Oh yes,
   yes.  It was not a queue or anything like that, just
   individuals.

When you got to the end of the tunnel were you able to
make your exit on to the terrace easily or did you have
to negotiate a crowd of people? - A. It is hard to
explain because sometimes you can go to some matches
and you can just walk in and like I did in 1986 we
sort of, there was a load of crowd there so obviously I
am going to have difficulty seeing.  I was with my son
so all I did was veer to the left that time and I watched
the full game in quite comfort to the left, but this
time of course I found it a bit difficult.  I could
not get to the left, I could not get to the right so
I sort of got up and different people push you. You
usually have one person usually walks and you basically
follow them if you like and you got on to the thing and
then I was basically looking at goals then in there
but it was very uncomfortable and it was getting more
uncomfortable.

What you are saying is you followed somebody else who
was making a passage through? - A. Yes.

And you were going towards the right.  Is that right?
- A. Well actually I was just basically getting in.

But did you enter the right-hand side or the left? - A.
Eventually yes but it was at kick-off I tried to get to
the right because it was too uncomfortable.  I could
not see. My glasses were coming down my nose like that
and my hat unfortunately was falling down here so I
took it off and stuck it in my ....

Were the players on the field at that   point? - A. Yes.

Definitely? - A. Yes.

They weren't being just announced? It is highly unlikely
if you came in through the gate but I just want to be
sure. Did you hear them being announced? - A. Well I
think I heard them as I was coming through the tunnel
heard the team being announced and then when we got on
there, of course when they announce them they are
already on the field and they shout the names, don't
they, and all the lunatics say:  "Yes" or something like
that.

But there is no doubt whatever in your mind that they
were on the field when you exited on to the tunnel,
on to the terrace? - A. On to the terrace, yes.

People were coming in behind you, weren't they? - A. Yes.

And I think people in the front were making comments
about the entry.  Is that right? - A. "They are being
crushed. We are crushed here.   Don't anyone else
                                  R . LATHAM



come any further down" or whatever.  I can't say the
actual words but they were sayings  "We are all getting
crushed down here, push back". Well we could not push
back because they were still coming in and they were
still getting people coming on top of you, if you like,
not on top of you on your head, on top from behind.

Did you see the kick-off? - A. I did not see the ball
being kicked off, no, but I basically knew it was
kicked off.

Was it because there was a big roar or a whistle or what?
- A. Well when Liverpool play you know when it is
going to kick off because they have lined up and of course
as soon as the referee blows the whistle Liverpool have
an almighty roar to sort of set their team off on to
attack.

Now as soon as that happened what happened to you? - A.
Well I was still in the middle of the goals, I was not
to the right, I was still in the middle of goals and
I must admit I was getting more uncomfortable and more
uncomfortable and more people were screaming, if you like,
so I obviously thought:  "As soon as this all cools down
or there is a corner or there is a shot at goals, different
things happen, they all fall forward".  I don't know why
so then you can sort of get yourself out of the way if
it goes to the right or the left.  I chose to start going
to the right to get out of the middle.

People were still calling out about not pushing and
screaming I think you said at this stage? - A. Well they
were and they weren't, if you understand my meaning.
They weren't really screaming and continually screaming,
screaming, screaming.   It was every now and again you
would get someone shout or you know:   "Don't push any
more" and if someone is shouting, if you think about it,
they are all right.   It is when they don't shout they are
in trouble.




                    Q. In fact
                                                R . LATHAM


In fact, your friend called to you - what is his name,
Preston John, is it? - A. Preston John, he says, "You
all right, Robbie?".  I couldn't see him now, because
he is a bit bigger than me and he was to my left. That
was before the actual bit of a surge, and he did say,
"Are you all right, Robbie?", and I said, "Yes, I'm all
right .

Was this before the kick-off or after the kick-off? -
A. This was after the kick-off.

You said what? - A. I said, "Yes, I'm all right, John,
are you?", and he said, "Yes", and he said that again
about a minute later, something like that.  I wouldn't
like to say how much time.

I think you decided at that point that you were going
to go over to the wings? - A. Yes.

But you are saying you didn't know about the fencing,
is that right? - A. I didn't know that we were going to
come to a brick wall, if you like,or a fence, no.   I
didn't realise that.

Just briefly tell me what happened after that? - A. So
I was into the game now, of course, and I did see the
shot hit the bar.  I didn't know who hit it but I know
I seen a shot hit a bar, and then once again, because
that was when I was over on the right, when I was over
there on the right and I seen it hit the bar, I thought
I would get a bit further, and then I said, "Can't
anyone push that way, rather than that way?" and this
fella said, "There's a big fence here", so I was
flabbergasted then, I was stuck, so I just stood still
then, just stood still and waited, and it kept on
getting more congested and the cries then started
coming thick and fast then, "We're getting crushed
here; we're getting crushed here".

So your recollection is that things got really bad
after that crossbar was hit? - A. Yes.

Would that be right? - A. Yes.

As far as, I am not saying that it was a picnic before
then .... - A. I hope poor old Beardsley doesn't take
the blame for this.

Pardon? - A. I hope Beardsley doesn't   take the blame
for this.

No, I don't think we will blame him for this.  Did you
see the game stop? - A. I will just go through it if
you like because I am better doing it that way, and I
                                               R . LATHAM


will sort it out then. When the ball hit the bar and I
saw that, I thought, "I can't go no further, I'll
stand", and then the wailing started really bad. A
fella was passed down the front, off the top, and we
put him on the fence, on the perimeter fence.  The
idea, if you get them there, they can usually get
dropped off and they're into safety.  If they flake out
we do that, you know - it doesn't happen often but if
anyone flakes out, send them down, put them on the
ground.  When he was on there he stayed there for about
a couple of seconds, and then someone came along and I
don't know whether they were trying to drag him over,
couldn't get him over, because there was like six inch
nails as well, you see, so they couldn't drag him over,
so they pushed him back in and he dropped - well, I
didn't actually see him drop, if you like, but I just
saw him sort of come down.

Then there was another person, same sort of situation,
and then we realised we had got to get some way of
getting, so we can get through the fences onto the
pitch, not to invade the pitch but people must have
thought we were trying to. The idea was that was the
only place of safety. As they found out in Bradford,
the only place of safety was the pitch.  If there
hadn't been fences at Bradford, I am telling you now,
everyone knows that ....

Let's not go into Bradford.    We have enough problems
with Hillsborough.    Carry on. - A. If them fences
hadn't been there we could have spilled on the pitch
and no one, well there might not have been as many die.
That was it, there were the fences, and I remember a
little lady, Police lady, saying,    Get back, get back".
We were basically saying, "Well open the gate and let
us get through, let people get through because we can't
get back", because we couldn't get back.    It was full,
we couldn t go anywhere, we were stuck.    So there was
the wailing, and eventually this fella says to me, in
front, "We 11 have to push back", and I said, "Well,
we'll have to have a go". He said, "Because there is
people definitely hurt there" - he could see, he was
bigger than me and he could see. He wasn't a friend of
mine.    I said, "All right".  He said, "I'll keep my
hands here, if you just sort of push up on me like
that, I'll go 'One', and you push and we'll go back,
w e '11 push them back if we can".  So he pushed them
back and I got one step, and then the people at the
back were saying, "Don t push", and all that, so we got
it from the back and the front.

A Policeman and a Police lady appeared again and said,
"Push back".  I said, "We can't push back. We can't
push back, we can't get any further back".  I turned
                                                            37

                                                     R . LATHAM


     round and I could see the people getting dragged up
     into the stands, so I thought, "That's about it, that's
     the only way out".  I just stood still then and this
     fella that was pushing on my hands, well I don't know
     whether you have ever seen a fella sweat, but I'd say
     this fella was just like a tap coming out of his head,
     and I'm sorry to say that's it, I can't -- well, I
     seen the fence being opened, or I seen the little door,
     what, 5 foot by 3, that's all, and they were getting
     filtered through in ones.

Q. Are you saying that all this happened after the match
   had finished? - A. I don't know,  I lost track of that.

Q. Are you saying it happened after Beardsley hit the
   crossbar? - A. Yes.  I didn't know he hit the crossbar
   - people tell you that.

Q. Put it this way, the kick which hit the crossbar, did
   you see that? - A. I saw the ball hit the bar, yes.

Q. You did see that. Never mind about who did it, but you
   definitely saw it? - A. I did see it, yes.

Q. You are saying what you    have recounted now happened
   after that? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see the little gate at the front? - A. I didn't
   notice it as such after the kick-off and for the first
   three or four -- even before Beardsley, you know. All
   I saw, I just saw the fence and I wondered, "How do you
   get out?", thinking,  probably you are thinking now in
   hindsight, "How do you get out?

Q. So you don't know what was going on at the gate until
   fairly late in the event? - A. No. Until it was open,
   until I realised it was open because I didn't know if
   it was locked, it might have been locked.

Q. Don't tell us what it was, only tell us what you saw
   because we have heard from a lot of people and we have
   also got photographs.  What I am trying to find out is
   when did you first notice the gate? Never mind whether
   it was open or shut, when did you first notice it? - A.
   After the ball hit the crossbar.

Q.   Did you notice whether at that time it was open or
     shut? - A. Shut.

Q. You are quite certain about that? - A. Yes.

Q.    If you were shown a photograph which shows the gate   to
     be open several minutes before that, would that
     surprise you? - A. No.

                                                 R . LATHAM


Q. It wouldn't surprise me? - A. No, it wouldn't surprise
   me, the reason being because you can't keep track of
   time.

Q. In other words, you are saying that your timings may be
   wrong? - A. Could be wrong, but having said that, that
   gate might have been opened and shut, I don't know, I
   never seen that.

Q. Exactly. We are going to get you to put a little cross
   on a plan.  Put a cross on where you were when the
   match kicked off, and where were you when the crossbar
   was hit? - A. It would help knowing where the goal is.

Q. We will put up another plan. We will let you do it on
   another plan because you may find it easier.
   (The Witness marked Exhibit C456) I thought you said
   that you had come up against the dividing fences but
   you have not indicated that, have you? - A. I didn't
   come up against them.  It filtered through that there
   was fences there so that is when I decided to stop.

Q. I see, I misunderstood you.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q. When you got through the big concertina gate you had to
   cross the concourse, as we call it, to get to the
   tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. I take it you weren't alone, you were with a number of
   other people as you did that? - A. Yes, there was a
   number of people, well there was hundreds, if you like,
   that had gone through.

Q. Yes, but you describe the crowd, and I am interested in
   your description of it, as "not unruly".  That was your
   description? - A. Yes.

Q. You yourself saw the tunnel and wanted to go down it? -
   A. Yes.

Q. If the tunnel had been shut off in some way and you had
   been deviated in another way .... - A. Fair comment,
   yes.

Q. Would you have objected to going a different way? - A.
   No.

Q. Did you see anything in the crowd you were in which
   gave you the impression that crowd could not have been
   deviated another way, if it had been shut off, the
   tunnel? - A. No. Well, I would have thought what way
                                                         39

                                                  R . LATHAM


  it was, because that's the only way I knew in, mainly
  because of my last time I was there.

Q. Surely, but I was interested in your description of the
   behaviour of the people who were coming through? - A.
   There was no one huffing and puffing and saying, "I've
   got to go through there .

Q. We have a video so we can compare your evidence with
   that video.  Can I just ask you another question? You
   say you have been to league game in 1986? - A. Yes.

Q. And you weren't conscious that there were radial
   fences.  In 1989, at the semi-final, we know some
   24.000 people came for the semi-final, from Liverpool.
   N0w, for a league game, how many people would travel
   for the league game, as opposed to a semi-final? - A.
   Well, it was over the Christmas type holiday or
   whatever, but it would not be as many as that. I would
   say certainly a quarter of that.

Q. So you would have thought only about a quarter of the
   24.000 would come for the league game? -A. Yes.

Q. Something like, it follows, £6,000, something like
   that? - A. Yes, approximately, away. There is your
   regular lads but you do get odd   ones that because
   someone is home on holiday they   go - like I did that
   particular time.  It was a fluke actually.

                  Further by THE CORONER

Q. Mr. Latham, I am most grateful to you for coming.
   Thank you very much indeed. - A. Can I just say
   something, please, to Sheffield?

Q. No, I don't think the Inquest is the right place to
   make a statement. - A. It is not a speech.  It is just
   saying thank you to the people who let me 'phone my
   wife up.

Q. In that case I suppose I ought   to let you say that. Go
   on then, if that is the subject   matter go ahead and say
   it. - A. A lot of people made a lot of statements about
   the people of Sheffield, they done this, but I wouldn't
   be sitting here today, only for them people, especially
   after the match, after the whole thing. There was a
   lady there who took us into her house and basically let
   us do everything - and I don't mean everything mad, but
   I mean cry, and dare I say it, I even played my guitar,
   and when you know when you laugh, that s my emotion, my
   guitar.

Q. That is very kind of you, thank you.   I did want to ask
   you one other question, I am sorry, it is putting it
   out of sequence. How did you get out, as a matter of
   interest? - A. I just stood still.   I just stood still
   and then there was chaps at the back and I know them.
   That was big Fred, the fella you actually see him
   dragging them out, and his mate, and he said, "Get out,
   Robbie, get out", and I said, "Fred, can we get out?",
   because I had been told again that you can't get down
   the tunnel, so he said, "You've got to get out".   I
   said, "I'll just stand here and wait", and I just
   waited and waited for a long time, and then when I got
   to the tunnel eventually there wasn't very many people
   there and I was out then.

Q. All right, thank you, Mr. Latham.

                  ANDREW DUNCAN Sworn

                    By THE CORONER:

You are Andrew Duncan? - A. Yes.

Is it still                           - A. Yes.

You too   are   a Liverpool supporter? - A. Yes.

I think you    came to    the match with several of your
friends including Kevin Williams? - A. Yes.

You came by train, is that right? - A. Yes.

Did youcome to the main station in Sheffield or did you
come on the    special   train? - A. The main train.

What time did you get to Sheffield? - A. About half past
ten.

When you got off the train were you steered towards
coaches? - A. Yes.

Were you wearing regalia?    Could they tell you were a
football supporter? - A. No.

Just ordinary clothing? - A. Yes.

How come you were steered towards the coaches to take you
to the ground?   Did you ask or did they just say, "Young
man, are you going to the match?"   What happened?   - A.
There were people getting off the train who obviously
weren't going to the match.   If you were like a lad they
asked, they said, "Are you going to the match?"    If you
said, "Yes , they said, "Go that way."

Did they check your tickets or anything at all that you
can remember? - A. No. The train tickets?

No, the match ticket? - A. Oh, no.

So you then got on to the coach? - A. Yes.

That brought you to Hillsborough? - A. Yes.

You got to the ground at about 11.30? - A. Yes.

Did you go straight in or did you do a bit of shopping? -
A. Well, the ground wasn't open so we walked round for a
bit.   We went to the shops and just walked round until
about half past one.

That was you and Kevin? - A. Yes.
                                                    A.   DUNCAN


Both of you had tickets, I take it? - A.     Yes.

I think you entered about half past one? - A. Yes.

Were you searched when you went in? - A. Yes.

And on the other side of the turnstiles as well? - A.
Yes.

You had no difficulty getting through, I take it? - A.
No.

Then I think you went and bought yourself a cup of coffee
inside? - A. Yes.

You saw the   tunnel and you went down it?   - A. Yes.

Had you been to the ground before? - A. No.

Were there people going down the tunnel at that time
already or... - A. There were a few, but there wasn't
many people.

It wasn't too bad anyway? - A. No.

You came out of the tunnel and you entered the terracing?
- A. Yes.

Did you go left or right, can you remember? - A. At first
we went left and then we decided to go to the right.

You just thought that would be better? - A. Yes.

There wasn't any other reason for changing at that point?
- A. No.

Do you know what time it was when you got into the right
hand pen? - A. Probably about twenty-five to two/twenty
to two.

How would you describe it at that time? - A. Well, it was
pretty empty because we actually sat down on the
terracing.

With the passage of time of course it started filling up?
- A. Yes.

You were standing fairly near to the perimeter fence, is
that right? - A. Yes.

Fairly near to the front?   In line with the goal, or a
bit further? - A. Just right of the goal.
                                                 A.   DUNCAN


You were just talking and waiting for the match to start?
- A. Yes.

At that stage I take it nothing concerned you, apart from
the fact that Liverpool shouldn't lose? - A. Yes.

It happened that you actually saw two of your friends,
Stuart Thompson and Tony Grier, is that right? - A. Yes.

I know what time you said in your statement, but do you
remember about what time you saw them? -A. Well, it was
pretty full then so we didn't speak to them, we just saw
them.   They were further up.

They were behind you, were they? - A. Yes.

When you saw them can you remember Tony climbing up on to
a barrier? - A. No.

You don't remember that? - A. No.

It doesn't matter, you may not have been watching him at
that particular moment.   Do you remember a beach ball
being knocked about? - A. Yes.

Was that at about the same time as you saw Tony or was it
earlier or later? - A. I can't remember.

Can you remember the players coming on to the pitch,
pre kick-off? - A. Yes.

Were you still in the same position? - A. Yes.

At that point, what was it like? - A. Just like a normal
game, really.   A bit of pushing and that but not bad.

Nothing that concerned you at that stage? - A. No.

You of course were excited, the match was going to begin
soon, you hoped.  Did you see the kick-off? - A. They
were about to kick-off - I didn't actually see it because
of people pushing about.    You were sort of moving round
everywhere.

So when the players came out pre kick-off, it was still
like a normal match as far as you were concerned? - A.
Y e s.

Just before kick-off something had happened.   Tell me
what had happened in that period between the players
coming out and kick-off? - A. Well, there was a bit of
pushing and moving round and that, then I don't know.   I
just don't remember actually seeing any of the game, so I
obviously can't remember seeing the kick-off.
                                                              44

                                                      A.   DUNCAN


Q. You say you don't remember the game at all? - A. Not
   really.

Q. When the players came out, which you do remember, was
   Kevin still with you? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened to Kevin?   When did you last catch a
   glimpse of him? - A. Well, there was a big push forward
   and he went off to the right a bit. He said something,
   "It's a bit packed, isn't it?" Then I didn't see him
   after that.

Q. Are you saying you felt a big push then? - A. Yes.

Q. Where did that push take you?   Did it leave you in the
   position that you were in, but more squashed, or did it
   move you? - A. It moved you forward and you were
   squashed, but normally what would happen is it would go
   back.   You know, people would push back.

Q. That's what   didn't happen? - A. No.

Q. We have tended to use the word "surge", but you can use
   "push", it doesn't matter.   How many of these pushes did
   you feel, just the one or more than one? - A. Well, there
   was the first one and then it didn't move back andthen
   another one came, a bigger one.

Q. There was a bigger one after the first one.   Did the
   first one move back or not? - A. It did slightly.  It
   eased off slightly.

Q. Not as much as you would expect? - A. No.

Q. Then the second one was much stronger? - A. Yes.

Q. But you don't know what was happening with the game? - A.
   No.

Q. You were fairly near the front. Had you seen   the gate
   which is in the fence? - A. Yes.

Q. You had seen that.   Could you see what happened to that
   gate? - A. Well, there were people shouting for the
   Police or stewards or whatever on the other side of the
   fence, for them to open it because they were getting
   crushed.   No-one opened it and then I think some of the
   crowd who were in front of it started pushing on it to
   get it open and it came open.   Then a few Policemen ran
   over and shut it again and were leaning on it. After
   about five minutes or so - I think they got it locked
   again, and then after about five minutes or so one of
   them opened it.
                                                                   45

                                                         A. DUNCAN

    Q. So you were saying this happened.    Did this happen
       after kick-off or just at kick-off or before kick-
       off? - A. It was after the kick-off.
B
    Q.   You think it was after? - A. Yes.

    Q. You are saying it was opened by some fans who pushed
       it open? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you see any of them run on to the field? - A. A
       few ran out and then when the Police had seen them
       run out they ran over and shut it, leaned against it.

    Q.   Did they get them back in, can you remember? - A.
         They tried to.  I am not sure whether they ran off   in
         another direction, I am not sure.

    Q.    I cannot hear you? - A. I am not sure whether they
         ran off in a different direction or the Police could
         not get them.

D   Q. We have heard from several young men who were
       standing at the gate and who ran out into the field.
       What I am trying to find out is what you remember.
       You remember this happening.  You remember the gate
       being shut? - A. Yes.

    Q. How confident are you about your timings? - A. I
       could not really tell you.  I am not too certain.

    Q. Do you know how long the match played from beginning
       to end? - A. I did not know at the time.  I have
       heard since.

    Q. Pardon? - A. I have heard since but I didn't know at
       the time.

    Q. What I am trying to find out is whether you are
       saying the gate was shut for the whole of the
       duration of the match because the match only played
       for five minutes? - A. I do not think so.

    Q. Did you see a Police Officer open the gate or was it
       the fans that opened it the second time that you
       noticed? - A. I could not really be certain.  It was
       either a Policeman or an ambulanceman, I think.  One
       of the St. John Ambulance or what have you.

    Q. You were standing in the crowd and there was a man in
       front of you who was not very well, is that right? -
       A. Yes.

    Q. Somebody shouted to you and said, "Try and revive
       him", is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember whether the match was still in
   progress at that point? - A. No, I couldn't see on to
   the pitch.

Q. In fact, this man told you to bite his ear, did he
   not? - A. Yes. His friend was standing outside the
   fencing and told me to bite him.

Q. He told you to do that? - A. Yes.

Q. How did you get out? - A. I was there for a bit and
   eventually I suppose I got on to my side.

Q. I am sorry? - A. I got sort of sidewards on a bit so
   that I could get a bit of air and then someone pulled
   me over the fencing.

Q. Somebody pulled you over the fence? - A. Yes.

Q. Eventually another friend told you that Stuart was
   missing, did he not? - A. Yes.

Q. Unfortunately your friend Kevin also lost his life? -
   A. Yes.

Q. I want you to show us on a plan where you were? - A.
   Yes.  (witness marked the pla n)

       MR. BEECHEY:   C.457, sir.

Q.        THE CORONER:   Did you notice the barrier at all
     behind you? You have put your cross from near the
     barrier.  Do you remember that barrier at all? - A.
     No.

Q. You do not remember anything about it? - A. Not while
   the crush was on I didn't.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE

Q. Have you followed the team to other grounds? - A.
   Yes.

Q. How long have you been doing that? - A. Actually that
   was the first away game I went to and since then I
   have been going now and again.

Q. This was the first time you had been to an away
   match? - A. Yes.

Q. At this particular Semi Final? - A. Yes.

Q. Andrew, you told the Coroner that you recall the
   players coming out and at that point it was just like
   a normal game? - A. Yes.

Q. There was pushing but it was not that bad? - A. Yes.

Q. You get pushing behind the goal in a normal game? -
   A. Yes.

Q. And surging, as you have told us, with people coming
   down and people going back up again? - A. Yes.

Q. You said that you started to feel, and I am
   paraphrasing now I think the impression you gave and
   tell me if I am wrong about this or if I am right.
   It started to get bad when this first big surge came
   just when they were about to kick off? - A. Yes.

Q. I wanted to ask you about that because you were asked
   by the Coroner whether you actually saw the kick-off
   and you said you had not. By that you meant you did
   not actually see someone kicking the ball? You did
   not see Rush kicking the ball? - A. No.

Q. When you say they were just about to kick off, do you
   mean they were standing in the centre circle ready to
   kick off? - A. Yes.

Q. In the centre circle ready to kick off? - A. Yes.

Q. They were getting into position to kick off, were
   they? - A. Yes.

        THE CORONER: Mr. Manning, shall we adjourn now?
   Did you say, yes or no, Mr. Manning?

        MR. MANNING:  I think we can finish this
   witness.  Shall we try?

        THE CORONER:  It is easier for him but I do not
   want anybody to feel rushed.

       MR. MANNING:    I actually think it would be
  better.

        THE CORONER:   Go head, Mr. Manning.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING

Q. I just want to go further in time just a little bit
   further than the gentleman next to me had done.
   After that first push came, of course, that was when
                                                            48

  you and Kevin talked, when he had been pushed off to
  the right and that is when he said or you said, I am
  not sure, "It is a bit packed, isn't it?"? - A. Yes,
  he said it.

Q. It was him who said it and you agreed with him at
   that time? - A. Yes.

Q. The first time you had the push it eased back a bit.
   The second time it did not ease back at all? - A.
   Yes.

       MR. KING: Do I understand the evidence of
  Andrew correctly that he lost two friends?

       THE CORONER:  Two. He went with Kevin Williams
  whom he lost and he knew Stuart Thompson.

       MR. KING:  I do not think it will serve any
  purpose to question him.

        THE CORONER:     Yes.

       MR. KING:  I just want to say to Andrew, thank
  you for coming, because I suspect it is difficult for
  you to relive it.

                       DAVID BULLAS Sworn

                         Bv THE CORONER:

Q. Good afternoon.  Inspector David Bullas.    Is that right?
   - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q.   Now thank you for being here.   I don't know where we raked
     you up from but I know that you weren't expecting to be
     here and I appreciate you coming. - A. Right sir.

Q. In fact I think you have been here once or twice before
   when we never got to yo u . I d o n 't know how many times.
   - A. I will not say how many times sir.

Q.   Perhaps you had better not. Anyway, you are here now.
     Now Inspector Bullas, you were positioned up on the
     West Stand I believe.  Is that right? - A. That is correct
     sir, yes.

Q. With a Sergeant and some Constables? - A. Yes.

Q. What I am primarily interested in from you is your obser­
   vations of the terracing and what was going on in the
   centre.

           I think I am right in saying that you were fairly
     near the front of the Stand at about between 2.30 and
     3 o'clock.  Is that right? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q. And of course you weren't sitting so you were standing.
   Is that right? - A. I was standing.

Q. And from that position you could of course look up
   towards the Stands and the seated people? - A. Yes.

Q. Which I presume was your primary responsibility was it,
   the seated people or not? - A. Yes, that was our primary
   responsibility that day sir, the people in the Stand.

Q. But you were also of course able to look down on to the
   terracing? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you were in fact located in the Stand in the
   position which was above what we know as Pen 4. Is that
   right? - A. That is right.

Q. You know what I mean by "Pen 4", I think you call it
   Centre North is another term.  I am right about that?
   - A. You are sir, yes.

Q. When you were looking down at about quarter-to-3 or
   thereabouts, I am not too concerned about the minutes
   but around quarter-to-3, do you recollect anything in
                                                   50



                                     D . BULLAS



   particular about those two centre pens? - A. The two
   central pens obviously had more people in than the wing
   pens but I did not see any problems at that stage.

Q. Can you remember by chance whether you saw the beach ball
   being knocked around? - A. I did sir yes.   It sticks in
   my mind it was more or less directly below where I was
   standing and I also remember a large green/yellow inflatable
   type thing in front of me as well in the crowd.

Q. At that time were you concerned about what you were seeing
   below? - A. Not at all. The crowd seemed to be in good
   humour. They were knocking the beach ball about.   It was.
   just like a normal type of crowd. There were no problems
   that I could see.

Q. I think your attention was then distracted, if that is
   the right word, to various events within the Stand.  I
   think there was some problem with seats? - A. Yes there
   was some people seated in so many seats and there were
   people coming in saying that they were their seats and
   there was an argument about who actually was seated there.

Q. So you dealt with that? - A. I did sir, yes.

Q. In whichever way it was appropriate.  I am not concerned
   about that. Then you came back I think to your position.
   Is that right? - A. Yes, I returned to the front.

Q. Do you remember whether when you returned to your position
   whether the players were on the pitch or not? - A. I would
   say the players were on the pitch, yes.

Q. Are you in a position to say whether they were playing or
   whether they were preparing to play? - A. I don't think
   they had kicked off.  In my own mind I don't think they had,
   no.

Q. And you then had occasion to look down again.   Is that
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. Now from that point describe to me what if anything you
   saw? - A. I remember returning to the front and glancing
   down at the crowd.  I must say my mind was still partially
   on the people that I had dealt with.   One of them was
   causing a bit of trouble who was in the seats.   I was still
   looking back at him, glancing back and I remember looking
   down at the crowd and seeing a movement in the crowd
   that drew my attention to it.   It was to my right.  It
   seemed to come from the direction of the tunnel which was
   slightly to my right. The thing that sticks in my mind
   all afternoon I had been watching the crowd swaying forward
   and swaying back. The crowd was in good humour. There
                                                       51


                                       D . BULLAS



     were no problems as far as I could see. A gap had opened
     when the crowd went down the terracing, usual type of
     thing you see on the television with football crowds and
     then they come back.  It was part of a game.  It seemed
     to be. There were people stood on each other's shoulders,
     this type of thing, but this movement was different.  It
     seemed to move forward but there was no gap opened up
     behind it. It just went down the terracing and it was
     just like a solid wedge of people, a river of people.
     As I say there was no movement backwards and that is what
     drew my attention to it.

Q. Can you remember in what pattern this wedge went. Was
   it straight down the centre, diagonally across, did it
   have a curve in it, did it look like a '5' or an 'S' or
   a '4' or can you put a little bit of description if you
   like on what you saw? — A. It was like a large wide line
   of people that went down.  It seemed to spread out as
   it went down the terracing. My attention was drawn,
   thinking about it now, to the centre, to the rear towards
   the tunnel rather than the front. That is where my
   attention was drawn to the movement.

Q. You described it in your statement in very graphic terms.
   Can you remember how you described it there? *■ A. Yes
   I compared it with the nature programmes that you see on
   the television and the molten lava that flows down the
   mountainside if it is a volcano.   It was that type of
   movement down the terracing.

Q.    And   the other thing that was so distinctive as    faras
     you were concerned or that distinguished it from normal
     movements that it went forward but there was no reverse?
     - A. That is right.  It was just a solid movement forward
     but nothing came back.

q   . Presumably what you are saying is that the normal movement
     on a terrace which you said you had seen earlier is more
     like a wave when the seashore comes in and then goes back.
     That is right? - A. Yes, there is a gap opens and the
     people come back.

Q.    But    this did not happen on this occasion? -   A.   No.

Q.    You    saw that? - A. I saw that, yes.

Q. Of course you were standing above it and slightly behind
   it and to the side. That is right, isn't it? - A. That
   is right sir.

Q. Having seen it what else if anything did you observe?
   - A. Well the people, my attention was drawn to the
   centre of it back towards the tunnel.  I could see the
   people that I looked at from the centre to the rear of
   the movement they were getting pushed together and
   obviously they were in some discomfort. That is the
   thing I observed.

                                    D. BULLAS


Q. And what did you do? - A. As I say in my own mind I
   did not really immediately realise what had happened.
   It is kind of in slow motion looking back at it and
   I can't honestly say what my reactions were immediately
   but I remember looking and thinking in my own mind that
   there was something wrong.  I looked at the crowd, the
   state of the crowd, these people in this movement. As
   I say I can't give a time period but after I realised
   that there was something wrong I remember trying to
   contact Police Control Room by radio to inform them that
   there was something wrong on the terracing. In fact
   X tried three times on the radio. I could not get through.
   I don't know if it was due to other messages being passed
   or the noise of the crowd.

   I remember looking down at the crowd and I could not get
   through on the radio.   I looked towards the playing area.
   There were two Officers stood near to the goal, the
   Leppings Lane goal.   I know one of the Officers was stood
   by the goal and I waved to him and pointed down at the
   crowd and I think it took him a short time either to see
   me due to the crowd that I was amongst in the Stand or
   to realise that I was waving to him but eventually he
   obviously realised I was signalling to him and he walked
   from the side of the goal towards the side of the perimeter
   fence.  I kept pointing down towards the crowd, the problem
   I had seen and he looked into the crowd.   I don't know
   if he knew at that stage what I meant.   I presume he
   didn't.




                              Q. Do you know
                                                            53

                                                   D.   BULLAS


Q. Do you know whether this Officer was opposite pen 4 or
   opposite pen 3? - A. As I was looking at the back of
   the goal, the Leppings Lane goal, with the netting
   towards me, he would be to the right of the goal.

Q. So that would be more towards pen 3 rather than pen 4,
   wouldn't it? - A. That is right, sir, yes.

Q. If you cannot answer this question, don't guess, but if
   you can it would be helpful.   At that point do you
   recollect what was happening on the field? - A. I
   honestly don't know.  I have no idea.   I am sorry, I
   just can't recall that at all.

Q.   You say he walked towards the railing fences? - A. Yes.

Q.    The perimeter fence, and looked in. Did you see him do
     anything else? - A. Yes, he was looking at the crowd,
     and as I say, I don't know if he understood at that
     time what was happening, or he could see what was
     happening from his position.    The last I saw of the
     Officer, and I honestly can't tell you who the Officer
     was, I just can't remember - I probably didn't know him
     - the last time I saw him he was stood still looking
     into the crowd.    That is what I recall.

Q. Did you see the other Officer who was on the other side
   of the goal at all? - A. I can't honestly say, sir.  I
   remember just that one on the right hand side.

Q.   Do you by any chance remember Officers coming round,   in
     particular a very bald headed Sergeant? - A. I am
     sorry?

Q. Did you see a very bald headed Sergeant? - A. I am
   sorry.

Q. Did you see a Sergeant who has not got a hair on his
   head, at any point? - A. I am sorry, sir?

Q. Did you see a Sergeant, a Police Sergeant, whose
   distinguishing feature is that he hasn't got a single
   hair on his head? Did you see him? - A. I know the
   Officer you are talking about but I can't recall.

Q. I am not criticising him for that, I am just trying      to
   distinguish him and find out whether you have any
   recollection of him? - A. I don't, sir.

Q. Your next move, I think, was to try and get out of the
   stand and down to ground level? - A. That is right,
   sir.  I can't give a time period but it sticks in my
   mind that I went up the back steps of the stand. There
   were on or two people still coming into the ground.   I
                                                            54

                                                  D.   BULLAS


   got to the rear exits of the stand, and I remember
   looking back towards the pitch and it is in my mind
   that I remember seeing one of the gates, the perimeter
   gates, open.  Then I made my way down the steps at the
   rear onto the concourse.

Q. Do you recollect by any chance whether, and to what
   extent, there were already people on the pitch when you
   were looking, when you turned round, saw the perimeter
   gate open and just before you went down the steps,
   because I take it once you went down those steps you
   never saw anything more of the pitch until later on? -
   A. That is right, sir.

Q. That would be right, wouldn't it? - A. It is, sir, yes.

Q. Can you recollect, by   any chance, what the pitch looked
   like? - A. I remember   the gates,   and Iremember either
   one or two people on top of the fence.    I think from
   that position the actual fencing is obscured, in my own
   mind after all this time. When I reached the exit I
   could just see the people, a couple of people on top of
   the fence.  I remember just the gate open ....

Q. But you didn't see people spreading onto the playing
   surface, as far as you remember? - A. No.

Q. You went downstairs into the concourse area? - A. That
   is right.

Q. Is it right when you got into the concourse there were
   already people coming   out of the   tunnel? Would that be
   right? - A. Yes, sir.There was    a bit of confusion in
   the tunnel.  As far as I remember it there were people
   still going forward and some people coming out of the
   tunnel.

Q. Did you make your way into the tunnel? - A. I did, yes.

Q. Do you know Sergeant Morgan? - A. I do, sir.

Q. Did you see him within the tunnel? - A. I didn't.    I
   cannot remember.

Q. Did you see Inspector Sykes there? Perhaps you don't
   know him. - A. I know him.  I didn't see him either,
   sir.

Q. Did you see a couple of lady Police Officers? - A. I
   did, yes.

Q. You did? - A. Yes.

Q.    Where were they when you saw them? - A. When I first
     saw them I went into the tunnel about three-quarters of
     the way down, near to the mouth that leads onto the
     terracing.  I remember the crowd in front of me kind of
     opened; there was someone brought out and they were
     being carried, there was a Policewoman on either side
     and a spectator helping to carry this chap out.

Q.    Say this again. You say the Policewoman was   helping to
     carry the man out? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. Two Police ladies? - A. I remember definitely there was
   one Policewoman helping to carry him out. I think
   there were two Policewomen there but there was a male
   there as well.

Q. So in other words, when you saw them, wherever they
   were, they were coming out from the terracing with
   somebody? - A. Yes.

Q. You didn't see them going towards the terracing? - A.
   No.

Q. Your glimpse of them, if that is the right word, was of
   them exiting? - A. That is right.

Q. And you didn't see which side they came out of, left or
   right, I don't suppose? - A. I would say it was
   slightly to my left as I went down the tunnel.

Q. All I am trying to do is establish as near as we can
   what sort of time it might have been, because I don't
   suppose you looked at your watch? - A. No, sir.

Q. Do you recollect, apart from this person, who these
   Police ladies or lady with the spectator were bringing
   out, had you noticed whether there were any other
   injured people in the concourse area? - A. As far as I
   know there was no one else.  I think the one I have
   mentioned, the chap that was brought out, was the first
   one, in my own mind, that went out backwards through
   the tunnel.

Q. You don't recollect what I might describe as a circle
   of Police Officers standing around somebody who was
   being resuscitated or being worked on in the concourse
   area? - A. Not at that stage, no, sir.

Q. You saw that later on, did you? - A. Yes.

Q. Having got to the bottom of the tunnel yourself did
   you, in fact, enter the terracing, or did you go back
   or what did you do? - A. I remember then there were
   other Police Officers in the tunnel and I shouted to

     them to get themselves into the crowd, and then I
     remember there were another two or three people brought
     out, after the first man.  I think it was the fourth
     person that was brought out was a young lad of about
     14. He had a Police Officer with him and he was having
     trouble carrying him, so I went back with the other
     Police Officer and we carried the young lad onto the
     concourse.

Q. At that point was the tunnel still clear? Was egress
   via the tunnel, in fact, possible at that point? - A.
   Yes. There were people in the tunnel.

Q. Stationary or lying on the floor? - A. There was no one
   laid on the floor.

Q.   Nobody lying on the floor? - A. No.

Q.   So it wasn't obstructed by injured people? - A. No.

Q.   Did you stay in that area for any length oftime or   did
     you eventually leave? - A. I went back with the injured
     lad.  I can't give you a time limit again. We
     attempted resuscitation.   We were joined sometime later
     by an ambulanceman who told us that the lad had died.

Q. That was in the concourse area? - A. That was on the
   concourse area, yes. Obviously my attention was
   concentrating on him all the time during that period,
   and I remember looking round then and there were quite
   a number of people on the concourse being attended to
   by Police Officers and supporters.

Q. Did you yourself get onto the terracing at all? - A. I
   did sometime later, sir.

Q. So your effort was directed at sending Officers in and
   then helping to carry people out? - A. That is right.




                /Q. Did you
                                                             57

                                                     D.   BULLAS


Q. Did you identify the youngster whom you helped? - A. I
   didn t, sir.

Q. I didn't think you had, but I couldn't quite remember.
   I think we will get you to mark our plan and show us
   where you were when you looked down and saw this wedge of
   people.   That is the point I want you to mark.  (The
   witness marked the plan)

          MRS. PERKINS:   That will be C.458.

Q.        THE CORONER:   I have just got two more questions.
     It sounded as if you were looking at this wedge of people
     coming down - I think you used the word "wedge"? - A. I
     did, sir.

Q. That your attention was directed towards the rear of the
   terrace rather than the front? - A. Yes.   As I remember
   it was from the centre to the rear.

Q. Were you, from the position you were in, able to see the
   condition of the people - not the people who were
   climbing over the fencing or anything, but the people who
   were right at the front of the terracing? - A. I can t
   honestly remember that at all, sir.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Q. Inspector Bullas, I wonder if you would be kind enough
   first of all just to look at a chronology of events we
   have, just to fit your evidence in to the sequence of
   events.   In the black folder it is C.277.   If you just
   run your eye down this column of figures - times - under
   the Internal Column", if you start about half way down
   the page you can see 14.51.07 - Liverpool team
   announced." - A. Yes, sir.

Q. The next one is "14.51 - Nottingham Forest team
   announced."   Then "14.54 - Liverpool team on to the
   pitch.   Right hand perimeter gate seen open." "14.55 -
   Nottingham Forest team on to the pitch."   "14.55.59 -
   Strong surge from tunnel into enclosure 3 and 4". - A.
   Yes.

Q. "14.59 gate 5 open."   Then "14.59.20 gate 3 open."
   "14.59 - kick-off." - A. Yes.

Q. The times you have given in evidence, you started dealing
   with the sequences of events at about quarter to three
   when you were above pen 4.   You saw the beach ball, a
   yellow inflatable object and then your attention was
   drawn to some problem in the stand? - A. That is correct,
   sir.
                                                             58

                                                     D.   BULLAS


Q.   By the time you had dealt with that and returned to the
     front of the stand the players were on the pitch? - A.
     Yes.

Q.   But had not kicked off? - A. I didn't say that. As far
     as I remember they hadn't kicked off.   I am not sure.

Q.   I beg your pardon.     Just fitting that on to this
     sequence of events, the time at which you were dealing
     with the problem in the stand is some time shortly before
     six minutes to three, is it? - A. It seems now that the
     problem was around tne time just shortly before I saw the
     problems in the crowd.    The problem in the stand with
     the people in the seating seems immediately just before I
     looked down and saw the problem in the stand.

Q. Can we just tie it up as far as we can, before I ask you
   questions about it, into the timetable?   We know the
   teams came out at six minutes to? - A. Yes.

Q. Liverpool first and then Nottingham Forest at five to,
   near enough? - A. Yes.

Q. You didn't actually see them come out? - A. I don't
   remember them coming out, no.

Q. Your attention came back to the pens just after that,
   just after five to three? - A. I don't know.   I am sorry
   to be so vague but I can't give you a time.   It seems
   the teams were on the pitch.   I dealt with a problem and
   then I looked down.   I don't know whether the teams had
   kicked off, or just before kick-off, I can't tell you.

Q. Just looking at this timetable, when is the last time - I
   am not asking you to be exact, this goes down to seconds
   here so I am certainly not asking you for that - it would
   be helpful for the jury to know where is the last time
   before you had to deal with your problem in the stand
   that you saw the usual sort of thing that you have
   described?   I will remind you of what you said:

          "I had been watching the crowds swaying forwards and
          back.   The usual type of thing.   People stood on
          each other's shoulders.   The usual type of thing."

     Whereabouts are we on the timetable that you saw that
     before things went wrong? - A. All I can recall is that
     the teams were definitely on the pitch.   I honestly
     can't tell you in what sequence.   I am sorry to be so
     vague but I can't tell you out of my own mind what
     sequence the problems on the stand fit into that list you
     have got before you.
                                                              59

                                                      D.   BULLAS


Q. Well, the laver flow, is that the event which triggered
   in your mind that something was wrong? ^ Is that what you
   are saying? - A. I am saying that yes, it was the laver
   flow that triggered the reaction in my mind, but you have
   got a time there.   I can't say if that is precisely the
   time that I saw the motion.

Q. You are looking at "14.55.49 - strong surge from tunnel"?
   - A. That's right.

Q. You are saying that might not necessarily be the same as
   your laver flow? - A. Well, obviously we are talking
   about similar things, or the same thing, but as far as
   the times are concerned...

Q. Well, it might not be.   Nobody is holding you to that.
   It might not be the same thing.   The only thing we have
   definitely got from you is the time at which the players
   came out on to the pitch, because we know when you
   returned to the front they were on the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. I want to try and take this as far as we can without
   being artificial.   Is it up until the laver flow,
   whenever it was - and don't fix yourself on 14.55.49 -
   whenever the laver flow happened up to that tiihe it is
   what you call the usual type of thing? Is that your
   evidence? - A. I didn't see any problems in the crowd
   before the movement in the crowd that I have described to
   the court.

Q. Now that is one end of the bracket.     Now I want to come
   to the other end of the timetable.     Whereabouts is it
   you first saw the Police down on the pitch responding to
   your signal and appearing to try to do something about
   it?   Whereabout do we find that in this timetable,
   approximately?     It is not written in but where can we
   fit it in?     You see. we have got the kick-off at
   14.59.30. - A. I don t know which gate it was that
   opened.    I can't say, I'm sorry.

Q. You saw a gate open? - A. I saw a gate open, yes.

Q.   One of gate 3 or gate 4? - A. Yes.

Q.    I hope that is enough just to try andfocus your  evidence
     because I want to ask you questions against that context,
     about the period it took for anyone to recognise that a
     disaster in fact was occurring.    Do you understand? - A.
     yes.

Q. The lapse of time we are looking at is somewhere about
   five to three until about three o'clock, is that right? -
   A. Yes, according to these figures.
                                                               60

                                                      D . BULLAS


Q.   Just help the Jury with your experience of attending
     as a Policeman at football matches please?   How long
     have you been doing this? - A . I have been on the
     Police 23 years, all of that service.

Q. Where abouts have you attended? Which football
   grounds? - A. All of the grounds within South
   Yorkshire.

Q.   Regularly at Hillsborough? - A. Yes.

Q.   Have you been regularly in that station   on the stand?
     - A. I have worked the stand before.

Q.   The West Stand? - A.   Yes.

Q.    Where else have you worked in the ground? - A. I have
     worked the North Stand, the perimeter, and several
     duties connected with the outside policing of the
     ground which result in the Police Officers, those
     serials, having to come into the ground after kick-
     off at different locations.

Q. What you describe as the usual type of thing in Pens
   3 and 4, you have described as swaying and people
   climbing on barriers? - A. Yes.

Q. We in this Court have seen the video tape of what was
   happening in the pens during the period from say
   about half past two up until three o'clock.     At
   intervals there are   snapshots of video.   I want to
   ask you questions about the conditions which have
   come to be accepted.

          THE CORONER: Mr. Payne, I do not want us to go
     down that road with this witness. I was interested
     in this witness because I wanted him to tell us what
     he saw with regard to the terracing.  I do not think
     I want to go into the questions of what has been
     acceptable or to take his evidence as an expert in
     that field.

          MR. PAYNE: Sir, what I have in mind is that the
     Jury might be interested in the question of what is
     an obvious risk and whether a risk is obvious or not,
     my submission is that it depends upon the experience
     which has been gained over the years of the behaviour
     of football crowds because what we can see on the
     video may seem to people who are inexperienced as
     very alarming behaviour.  This is before the disaster
     occurred when it is described by many witnesses as
     normal.
                                                  D . BULLAS


     THE CORONER:  I think, Mr. Payne, I would accept
a question or perhaps two questions on the basis of
asking him to describe the behaviour which he saw on
15th April prior to this lava flow, just for
shorthand, and then if you like follow it up by
saying is what he had seen before, but I do not want
us to go into anything further than that with this
witness.

    MR. PAYNE:  Can you deal then with that question
from the Coroner?

     THE CORONER:   You have got what we are
discussing? - A. Yes.  On the 15th April I saw a
movement in the crowd that I have never seen before.

     MR. PAYNE:  Yes, that movement but what the
Coroner was asking was before, up to that time, to
compare the behaviour of the crowd with what you had
seen on other occasions? - A. The behaviour of the
crowd was no different in my own mind.

             Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS

Inspector Bullas, I represent Mr. Duckenfield and I
want to ask you about a number of matters you have
given evidence about? - A. Yes.

     THE CORONER:    I could not hear you, I am sorry.

     MR. ISAACS:     I merely told the Officer who I
represent so that   he is aware of it.

     THE CORONER:   I am sorry I am having difficulty
with my hearing today.   Please forgive me.

          MR. ISAACS:   Inspector, as I understand
your evidence you have told the Coroner there came a
time after you had seen this wedge move down the
terrace, you felt it was appropriate to notify
Control as to what you had seen and your concerns? -
A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Do I take it from that, Inspector, that had there
been anything else you had seen on that terrace which
you believed that the Control Room should know about
you would have told them? - A. Yes.

Would it be fair to say that Control would be
entitled to expect you to do exactly that? - A. Yes.

You were responsible we know for Serial 13? - A. Yes.

Being a Sergeant and 12 Police Constables? - A. Yes.
                                                   D . BULLAS



I understand this to be the case, and' you perhaps
will confirm it, that you did not direct that
Sergeant or those Constables to consider, as they
were doing their duty, in particular any signs of
distress on the terrace?   In other words, you did not
say to them, "Look out to see if there are any signs
of distress on the terrace"? - A. No, I did not
specifically say that, no.

Is this right; you would not need to say that to any
Sergeant or Police Constable who on looking into that
area if he saw distress on the terraces, you would
not need to say to them, "Tell me about it" or
anything like that because you would expect them to
do that? - A. That is correct.  I had positioned
several of the Officers in positions that were more
or less to do with safety ie exits and this type of
thing.  Their duties were connected with that, yes.

If they had seen being in those positions anybody in
the crowd in distress you would not expect them to
ignore it merely because you had not specifically
drawn it to their attention? - A. No, not at all, no.

When you had the opportunity of looking down on that
terrace, you took the view that it was quite
normal? - A. Yes.

In your experience? - A. In my experience, yes.

We understand that experience to be extensive? - A.
Yes.

What you saw up to the time when the wedge came was
crowds swaying backwards and forwards? - A. Yes.

Or people within the crowd swaying backwards and
forwards.  You saw the beach ball being batted
around? - A. Yes.

You saw the large inflatable.  Was that just being
held by somebody? - A. Yes, I think it was.

But being waved around? - A. Yes.

I think you saw people standing on barriers and
waving and cheer leading? - A. Yes, I remember them
shouting down a couple of times telling people to get
off another person's shoulders and this type of
thing.
                                                            63

                                                     D. BULLAS


Q. Would this be fair;  that you considered, looking at
   the terrace as a whole, there was plenty of room? -
   A. Looking at the terrace as a whole, yes.

Q. Were you aware of the system that had been adopted of
   - we have used a shorthand phrase for this - the
   self-levelling of the terrace?

        THE CORONER:  No, that is exactly the same point
   that I said to Mr. Payne.  If you want to go into all
   those questions we could do but I do not think it is
   necessary.

       MR. ISAACS:  Sir, with respect, I only asked him
  whether he was aware of the system and it goes to his
  personal knowledge of whether there was a system or
  not and not as to whether the system is a good one or
  not.  I would not seek to trespass upon that aspect
  of the evidence.

       THE CORONER:  No, I appreciate that but I do not
  think we need to explore that question with this
  witness.

        MR. ISAACS:  I would   like the opportunity of
   addressing you upon that,   if I may.

        THE CORONER:   You want me to ask the Jury to
   leave?

        MR. ISAACS:  Yes, certainly.   That is
   effectively what I am saying.

        THE CORONER: Members of the Jury and Inspector
   Bullas, just leave us for a few minutes.

        (Tn the absence of the Jury and the Witness)

        MR. ISAACS:  Sir, I do not, as I said earlier,
   wish to explore with this witness whether the system
   of self-levelling is a good one or not, and I can
   understand exactly what you are saying about that.
   That is not a matter for him.  Sir, what I would wish
   to explore is this;  he says "I took the view that
   looking at the terrace as a whole there was
   sufficient room" or "there was plenty of room", never
   mind sufficient room, plenty of room.

        I hope he will say, because I have seen a
   statement wherein he says this, that he saw people
   passing through from one pen to another through the
   radial gates at the back.  I wish to ask him whether
   he was aware of the system that had been adopted of
   the self-levelling of the pens so that I may say to
                                                D . BULLAS


him whether in those circumstances he had ever
considered that there was a risk of overcrowding on
those terraces;   not whether there was a risk or
whether other people might have thought there was a
risk but whether he in those circumstances thought
there was a risk.   That is all I seek to do.

      THE CORONER:  Yes, I have got no objection to
you asking him about the people passing through the
gates at the back because that is clearly an
observation on the day.   I have not explored it but
that is neither here nor there.   I do not object to
that.   I accept that point.  The next question, of
course, is more difficult because you are actually
asking him to express an opinion, are you not, on the
method?

     MR. ISAACS:  Sir, no, with respect.  I am not
asking him to express an opinion as to whether it is
a good method or a bad method.  I am asking him to
say whether he, as a matter of fact, ever considered
against the background of the system of self­
levelling ....

     THE CORONER: Very well, I will allow that
question in that form. Mr. King, did you want to
rise on that at all? I was not sure.

     MR. KING:  I wanted to take the opportunity
whilst the Jury were out to make sure that I know the
parameters correctly.  So far as my learned friend is
concerned, sir, I do not object so long as I know
what it entitles me to investigate.

     THE CORONER:   I think that the answer is if Mr.
Isaacs answers that question then you must be allowed
to ask a series, a limited series, of questions on
that issue.  I think the two things follow.   What I
do not want to happen is that we have this witness
here for a day and a half, or however long it will
take, while we explore every conceivable aspect of
obviousness.   I am not saying this in any critical
way and I am not looking at you but saying it as a
general point.   I think I have always taken the view
that this witness has got some interesting evidence
because he was there and he could see something from
the top which not everybody could see.   I wanted to
hear that and I wanted the Jury to hear that but I do
not think we want to get into an endless discussion
as to whether or not the system was safe, whether or
not it was the best or worst or alternatives could
arise.
                                                D . BULLAS


     MR. ISAACS:  Sir, just to make sure we all
understand exactly the parameters, I do not propose -
and as I understand it you would not wish me - first
of all to ask him what he considered to be obvious or
not obvious.   I do not propose to do that because
that, as I understand it, would offend against the
ruling you have given.

     THE CORONER:   Yes.

     MR. ISAACS:  Similarly, I am not going to ask
him to consider what other people may have thought in
the situation he was in or in the situations that
they were in.  I do not propose to do that at all.

     THE CORONER:  I think you can ask him that and I
think that that is the way to tackle it so far as
this witness is concerned.  Yes, Mr. King.

     MR. KING:  Sir, I was only responding to my
learned friend.  I want to raise whether I can ask
certain matters which may be related but not exactly
the point and I would rather ask it now.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. King, I have never wanted to
trammel anyone but, on the other hand, I do feel that
we have to keep this witness anyway within bounds.
Because he is an Inspector we could spend as long
with him as we did on Superintendent Marshall if we
wanted to with him.

     MR. ISAACS: Again, sir, I do not propose to
ask, for example, had you known that a number of
people had been let through Gate C, would it not have
been obvious to you that X, Y and Z would have
resulted because I understand that is not the sort of
question you want us to be asking this witness.

     THE CORONER:   No, that is right.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I would want specifically to ask
him about the nature of any express instructions he
had as to monitoring the crowd in view of the fact
that he has given evidence as to his duties as to
what he saw and did not see and the nature of what
was expected of him, because he has already been
asked questions about what was expected of him by
senior Officers.   I would want to show him, if you
will allow me, sir, what was written in the
Operational Order so far as the duties for Serial 13
go, and I would want to elicit, if it be the same as
he said on previous occasions, that in fact he had no
express instructions to monitor the crowd beneath for
overcrowding.
                                                 D . BULLAS



     THE CORONER:  I have got no objection to the
first two of the questions, namely, did you or did
you not have any express instructions? You are
obviously going to ask him with regard to safety?

    MR. KING:   Indeed, yes, sir.

     THE CORONER:  I do not object to that because he
can tell you what he was told.  Whether it is
necessary to go through the Operational Order I am
more doubtful.

     MR. KING:  Sir, the only point I would want to
raise - and I say it openly so that everybody knows
the purpose of it - is that the Operational Order on
the face of it concerns matters which go to law and
order.  On the face of it, that is very clear and it
is not as if everything has been left to his own
initiative, as has been suggested in questions to him
that he could be expected to do things without being
asked about them or told about them.  Specifically
law and order is drawn to his attention in the
Operational Order.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, but we know that, do we not,
Mr. King?

     MR. KING:  I do not know whether in the context
of Serial 13 we know that, sir, because certainly
this is the first Inspector we have had dealing with
Serial 13.

     THE CORONER:  Yes, I realise that but what I am
saying is that we know from the bits of the
Operational Order which we have already quoted that
that is so, is it not?

     MR. KING:  If I can just pursue it slightly,
sir, one of the specific matters in the Operational
Order which they are there to prevent are persons
climbing from the terraces to the stand.  Sir, it may
well be, of course, in the context of what was
happening at Hillsborough on the day that people were
climbing up not in order of misbehaviour but by
reason of their being crushed and one of the problems
clearly here is that the mind of the Officer, if he
is working on the Operational Order as written down,
is directed to issues of law and order in that
context.  It is a fair response, in my submission, to
elicit that and to the evidence that those who have
already asked questions are very keen to elicit and
to impress the Jury with, namely because this Officer
did not see anything wrong with the crowd, therefore,
                                                 D . BULLAS


there was nothing to be seen wrong with the crowd.
It does depend on what your mind is concentrating on
when you are looking into a crowd.  I want to look
into the question - and I may be wrong and he may not
agree - of the mind of the Officer so far as express
instructions go would be to law and order purposes
and there were no express instructions to checking
whether or not there was overcrowding, signs of
distress, and so forth.  I regard that as an
important issue.  You may not, sir.   If you rule
against me then I will abide by it.

     THE CORONER:  I can see the point that you are
making.  I think you can do it in the way that you
have put it to me now and I think that that would be
satisfactory, I would accept that.

     MR. KING:   Without needing to show him that?

     THE CORONER:   Yes.

     MR. KING:  I want to ask him a specific question
with your leave, if you will allow me, sir.  Could I
just direct your attention to Mr. Hytner's cross-
examination at page 103?

     THE CORONER:   Yes, I have got page 103.

     MR. KING:  The specific question and answer,
sir, - and I will not direct him to the passage but
would ask him the question myself - that he was aware
himself that the two centre pens had a specific
capacity and he knew it on the day as opposed to
something learned later. As you may recall, sir, the
point has been made to the Jury that it was not
within the knowledge of those who apparently had the
responsibility for the crowd on the terraces that
those pens had a specific capacity.  This Officer
apparently, and a relatively senior Officer in the
sense he is in charge of the serial, knew it and that
is a question of fact.

                                         D . BULLAS




        I am mindful of your own parameters and I don't
  want to take it any further than that.  I just want to
  elicit that he knew the capacity.

        THE CORONER:      We will see what he says.

        MR. KING:    He    may not agree.     I may have to put
  it to him.

        THE CORONER:      Indeed.

        MR. KING:    Thank you sir.

        THE CORONER:       Very well.   Can we get the jury back.

                  (The    jury return into Court)


        THE    CORONER:    Yes, Mr. Isaacs.

        MR.    ISAACS:    Thank you very much sir.

Q. Inspector, you have shown us on the plan where you were
   standing when you were overlooking the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. You would have from that position as good a view, indeed
   may I suggest to you a better view than anybody else as
   to the conditions within that terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. You  would be able to see, for example, the rear radial
   gates which we know to be in the radial fences? - A. Yes,
   you could see from that position by leaning over the
   front wall, you could see the gates, yes.

Q. Did you    see people using those gates? - A. I did, yes.

Q. One or two or a larger number? - A. There was a larger
   number.  I had seen all afternoon people walking across
   beneath me from left and right from Pen 4 particularly
   into Pen 5. I remember that quite distinctly.

Q. And did this continue throughout the period that you
   had the  opportunity of looking into those centre pens
   and the  terraces in general? - A. Yes.

Q. So not just for example at 2 o'clock or quarter-past-2,
   right up to 3 o'clock whilst you were looking? - A. Even
   when the central pens were getting fuller there were
   people still moving across and going into, as I say I
   remember into Pen 5 in particular.

Q. Of course you were closer to Pens 4 and 5 than you were
   to Pens 3 and 2? - A. That is right, yes.

              THE CORONER: Mr. Isaacs, can you just check that
        he means Pen 5 and not Pen 6. Pen 5 is the corridor.

q   .         MR. ISAACS:  Pen 5 we know to be the very thin
        corridor which is the sterile area. We can see it on the
        plan. Do you mean Pen 5 or do you mean in fact Pen 6?
        - A. Sorry, I mean Pen 6.

Q. You mean the area that was being used adjacent to Pen 4
   for fans to stand and watch in? — A. That is correct,
   yes.

Q. What to your knowledge were those radial gates at the
   rear open for? - A. For fans to move from one pen to
   another, wherever they wished to stand.

Q. Were you aware of the system that had been adopted of
   fans finding their own level on that terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. You have told us, Inspector, that in your view there
   was plenty of room looking at the terrace as a whole?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Having regard to the fact that there were these gates
   open at the rear; having regard to the fact that you saw
   them being used throughout the course of the afternoon,
   during the material time during the afternoon; having
   regard to the purpose for which they were being used and
   your knowledge of the system of self-filling or finding
   one's own level, did you ever consider that there was a
   risk of overcrowding on the Leppings Lane terrace? - A.
   I didn't, no.

Q. Can I move on to one final matter, an entirely different
   subject, the wedge. When we talk about a sway in the
   crowd we see, do we not, people within the crowd moving
   down and then moving back up again? - A. Yes^

Q. And sometimes in a sway the people don't actually move
   that far, it may only be a foot or two, but the impression
   that is created of moving a foot or two is of a movement
   within the crowd as if it was a towel that was being
   waved in that sort of fashion? - A. Yes.

Q. Your description is rather different from that, as I
   understand it.  It is as it were a body of people not
   just moving a foot or two and creating the impression of
   a sway, but a number of people actually moving as if it
   was a wedge right down the terrace from the top to the
   bottom? - A. As I say I can't honestly remember the front
   of the wedge, but I remember from the centre to the back,
   yes, that was a definite movement.

    Q. And people were going a considerable distance? - A. Yes,
       they were just going forward.
                                  D.   BULLAS



As if - I don't want to draw the military analogy perhaps
unnecessarily - as if it was a phalanx of soldiers moving
through those already on the terrace? - A. Yes, it was
that kind of movement, yes.

It wasn't, from what you are telling us, as if somebody
at the top had pushed the person who was next to him
who then pushed the person next to him and so on so there
was this slight movement and therefore the creation of
the impression of a sway but the actual movement of a body
of people through the crowd? — A. That is correct.   I didn't
see any gap or anything to the rear of the wedge. That is
what sticks in my mind as the difference between that and
the normal type of sway there was no gap, just solid.

Now when that happened, as I understand your evidence and
I appreciate you were a little uncertain about this, the
players had already been on the pitch for a number of
minutes? - A. Yes.

And just so that the jury are aware of this, that was
something that you said as short a time as I think 11 days
after the event? - A. Yes.

So it would have been a matter no more than a minute or
two before the kick-off if as long as that? - A. Yes.

      MR. ISAACS:   Thank you very much indeed.


             Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

Inspector, I want to look at the same thing but another
way round. You have talked to my learned friend about not
having a feeling that anything was a problem on the
terrace until you saw this lava flow.  I want to look at
other things and say does it not give you a positive
feeling of all is well, for example that a beach ball
was being pinged around the crowd. Did that give you
the feeling that all was well there that people had the
room and were able to reach up and play with the ball?
- A. Yes, I saw that.  The people were knocking the ball
about.  There did not seem to be any problems.

That someone had this large inflatable there, again a
feeling that that was something perfectly natural, the
normal and gave you a feeling of good? - A. Yes.

And then the swaying of the crowd and the singing of the
crowd; people standing on barriers in the crowd, all
things which you had seen time after time after time in
your experience at matches? - A. Yes.
                                                                71

                                       D . BULLAS



Q. Climbing on other people's shoulders, again not something
   which was a peculiar incident so far as you were concerned?
   - A. No, it was just horseplay, that is all it was.

Q. In a good natured and good humoured crowd as you have
   described it? - A. Yes.

Q. I appreciate Inspector that your duties obviously were
   not solely to lean over the front of the Stand above and
   gaze down on to the crowd below? - A. No, as I have already
   said my prime duty was concerned with the Stand.

Q. But equally with the eye of the experience of the numbers
   of years that you have got, it did not take more than a
   moment to spot, when you did spot it, that there was some­
   thing the matter when you saw this lava flow of people?
   - A. That is right.

Q. And up to that moment in time never at any stage had you
   had a  moment's disquiet about what was occurring inthe
   crowd   on the terrace below? - A. I had not.

          MR. MANNING:   Thank you   very much indeed.


                   Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. Inspector, you were you the Inspector in charge of
   Serial 13, weren't you? - A. Yes sir.

Q. And you had a number of Officers under your control, some
   of whom had duties to be located at the front of the West
   Stand? - A. Yes.

Q.   You were aware there was a written Operational Order
     for this game in 1989 weren't you? - A. Yes.

Q.   You also went to a briefing, didn't you? - A. I     did.

Q.   A briefing at    which you were addressed by Chief
     Superintendent Duckenfield? - A. Yes.

Q. And another briefing perhaps when you were briefed by
   Chief Superintendent Greenwood? - A. Superintendent
   Greenwood, yes.

Q. Can I just take first the Operational Order and then the
   briefings in turn.

           As far as the Operational Order goes expressly
     dealing with Serial 13 and the duties of Serial 13, it is
     right, isn't it, that there is no mention at all as to
     a duty to monitor the crowd, the terrace crowd for signs
     of overcrowding.  That is right, isn't it? - A. It is not
     written down, no.
                                  D . BULLAS



It is right, isn't it, that in fact and if necessary you
can look at it if you wish, there is no express
instruction dealing with a matter of safety as such,
is there for Serial 13? - A. There is the general
instruction at the beginning of the Order.

The very beginning of the Order about safety as a word,
but specific instructions for Serial 13 there is not a
word written down about safety as such, is there? - A.
As I say other than the beginning of the Order, if you
are isolating the instructions of Serial 13 no there
isn't.

And as regards the Officers who,were to be located at
the front of the Stand their express instructions were
preventative, weren't they? I tell you what I mean, they
were preventative in the sense they had to prevent missiles
being thrown; Stand tickets being dropped to the terraces
below; persons climbing from the terrace to the Stand; to
maintain order.   Those were the written instructions,
weren't they? - A. Yes, also the instructions regarding
the exits from the Stand.

As regards the purpose of the Officers at the front of
the Stand those were their specific duties at the front,
weren't they? - A. Yes, plus the instructions I gave them
regarding the exits.

I will come to that, I promise you. You would agree with
me that those written instructions are all preventative,
that is what you must prevent happening, and are to do
with matters of law and order? - A. Correct.

Coming now to the briefing you received from Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield.  Did you receive any briefing
specifically directed to a duty either upon yourself or
upon any Officers underneath you, to monitor the terrace
for whether or not it looked as though it was getting
overcrowded, in other words directing your attention to
matters of safety? - A. We were instructed to monitor all
the ground regarding safety.

You are saying you received a specific instruction that
you had to monitor the terrace for safety purposes? - A.
No, I am not saying I receivedspecific instruction
regarding the terracing. We were given specific
instructions regarding all the ground.

Did you get any specific instruction as regards monitoring
the crowd on the terraces for overcrowding, yes or no?
- A. I didn't get any instruction to monitor the Kop or
the North Stand but I was told along with everyone else
to monitor the ground regarding safety.
                                  D.   BULLAS



I have heard the answer, Inspector, and I am not trying
to be hurtful. Could I just have a direct answer to the
question? - A. You are correct.

You didn't, did you? - A. No.

When you told us that you yourself on the occasions you
looked over to the terrace below you saw no signs for
concern, can I suggest to you that your mind along with
other Officers who had been briefed either with written
instructions or by oral instructions, your mind would be
concentrating on matters of law and order? - A. No, I
disagree with you there.

Did you know that the two centre pens had a specific
capacity, safe capacity? - A. No.

I am sorry? - A. No, I didn't.

So you can understand what I am talking about, I am asking
you whether you were aware that there was a limit on the
numbers who could safely be within the centre pens. You
weren't aware of that? - A. Obviously there is a limit
but I was not aware of the figures.  Is that what you are
saying?

First of all were you aware that a limit had been set down
never mind what it was for the moment?

      MR. CATCHPOLE:  Sir, it might be appropriate just
to have a brief discussion in the absence of the jury on
the basis of the question being put by my learned friend.
I don't think it is factually correct and perhaps those
of us who were at another place could explain why?

      THE CORONER:   I was wondering about that.

      We just need to sort the question out so leave us
again. We won't be long, and you leave us as well.
Don't settle down. That is a very unwise thing for me
to say.

              (The jury retire from Court)


      THE CORONER:  I think I know what you are going to
say, Mr. Catchpole.

      MR. CATCHPOLE:  I obviously understand the point
of the question because I have seen the transcript and
I don't seek to say anything my learned friend is putting
to the witness is improper but we do now know that the
figures that came out of the Public Inquiry came out
rather by accident and weren't necessarily for general
                                                    74

                                  D.   BULLAS



circulation so it is not proper to put the question:
"Did you know there was a specific limit?" because to
all intents and purposes there wasn't.  There were figures
that Eastwoods bandied around for their own private
purposes.

      THE CORONER:  I think that is right, that the
Safety Certificate did not actually, there is nothing in
the Safety Certificate to put the limit on those.

      MR. KING: That is right sir, that is correct, but
as I understand the evidence which this witness gave
at Taylor, he may give different evidence today, he was
aware that whoever had imposed-it, it matters not for the •
purpose of this question, that he was aware that a limit
had been imposed on the capacity of Pens 3 and 4 for
safety reasons. Could I just ....

      THE CORONER:   It is page 103, you drew it to my
attention.

      MR. ISAACS:  Is not then the question, to take
up Mr. Catchpole's point, a misleading question, not
deliberately of course, because it gives the jury the
impression that there was a limit when there was not.

      I could with some trepidation suggest to my learned
friend that perhaps his question should be: "Did you believe
there to be?" which of course would then not be misleading
for the jury as to whether there was a limit or not.

      THE CORONER: Yes, Mr. King, did you want to say
something? The point that I am concerned about is this:
we do not want to give the impression to the jury that
there was a limit set for those pens in the Safety
Certificate and I don't suppose for a minute you would
want to do that because as soon as you do it I would have
to tell them that that is wrong.

      MR. KING: And one of the problems undoubtedly was
that there wasn't and of course that is right.

      THE CORONER: What you are trying to find out is
whether in his mind he thought there was a safe capacity
and that it had been fixed by someone or other?

      MR. KING: That is right and you could have a
capacity fixed sir for safety reasons, whether it be
the "correct number" is another matter but somebody had
worked out in advance a number.

      THE CORONER: Why don't you preface your remark, if
I may say so Mr. King and please come back if you don't
agree, why don't you preface your remark by saying that
                                                  75


                                   D.   BULLAS



the Safety Certificate had fixed an overall limit for the
terrace but was he aware that in fact other work had been
done which might have suggested there were specific
limits for individual pens.  That way I think you are
absolutely right and we can get an answer out of this
witness as to what he says now and no doubt you will then
want to show him page 103 and seewhat he says about that.
Do you agree? Are you happy with that?

     MR. KING:   I will do my best sir.

      THE CORONER:  This is not intended to cause you
any problems, simply ...

      MR. CATCHPOLE:  I am sure my friend did not take
it in that way.  I did not intend to interrupt.

      THE CORONER:  I don't think for     a minute he did
and I didn't take it, but I could see    what you were
driving at.  It is a matter of phraseology.

             (The jury return into Court)




                  Q.   MR. KING:   Inspector
                                               D . BULLAS


     MR. KING:   Inspector, were you aware first of all
that there was an overall capacity   for the whole of the
terrace, laid down in the Safety Certificate? - A. I
was, sir, yes.

You can take it from me it was just over 10,000.  I
think it was 10,100, something like that. - A. Yes.

And take it from me, that is all the Safety Certificate
- w e all know this - says, but I want to ask you a
different matter, which is this: were you aware that,
in fact, as far as the centre pens went, some work had
been done on arriving at a figure for each of the two
centre pens, before 1989, that figure being the number
which could be safely accommodated    in each of the two
pens? - A. No, I wasn't.

Can I just show you, in the light of that, questions
and answers which you gave to the Inquiry of Lord
Justice Taylor when that was being undertaken.  Could
you look at page 103 of the transcript?  Inspector,
just remind yourself of what it says in the transcript
between letters E-G. - A. Yes.

Do you agree that those were the questions which were
asked of you before Lord Justice Taylor? - A. Yes.

Do you agree that those were the answers you gave? - A.
Yes.

Do you wish to depart from those answers today? - A.
No.

Can I take you through the questions?  If I give you
the question and you perhaps give the answer, then we
can investigate it a little more.  The first question
was:

     "Mr. Bullas, in all the briefings that you had did
     anybody tell you that there was a limit on the
     capacity of pens 3 and 4 imposed for safety
     reasons?"

and what answer did you give? - A. I said:

     "I don't think anyone had directly told me, sir,
     but I had worked the ground before and I was
     aware, the department that I am in I am aware of
     the capacities of those pens."

The next question was:

     "You were aware that one was 1,000 and the other
     was 1,200?"
                                                           77

                                                   D . BULLAS


     and you gave the answer? - A. "Something like that,
     yes".

Q. You have told us already today that you stand by those
   answers.  First of all, is it right therefore that you
   were aware of the capacity for pens 3 and 4, as
   separate pens? - A. As I stated there, I wasn't aware
   of the exact figures.  I have just said that.

Q. That is a different matter all together.  I wasn't
   trying to test your mind as to the exact figures, what
   I wanted to know was whether or not you were aware that
   there was a capacity which had been worked out, not for
   the terrace as a whole but for the individual pens 3
   and 4, and this is something which had been worked out
   before 1989, and it looks as if the answer to that is
   you were aware of that in 1989? - A. I was.  I thought
   you were asking me if I knew the figures.

Q.   So you were aware .... - A. Yes.

Q.    In 1989 that there was a capacity forsafety reasons
     which had been worked out for pens 3 and 4? - A. Yes.

Q. When it was suggested to you at Lord Justice Taylor's
   Inquiry that one was 1,000 and the other was 1,200 you
   were able to say, "Something like that"? - A.
   "Something like that", yes.

Q. In the light of that you would agree with me, wouldn't
   you, that a safe capacity has a purpose? Would you
   agree with me so far? - A. Yes.

Q.    And that the purpose is to ensure    thatnumbersarenot
     exceeded to such a point that people are endangered? -
     A. Yes.

Q. Obviously if a point has already been reached that
   people are endangered, then the capacity has been
   exceeded? - A. Yes.

Q. Once people are injured or crying in distress, in a
   sense that is too late because the numbers have already
   been exceeded, you agree? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you yourself ....

          THE CORONER:   I don't agree with that, I am
     sorry.  I think that is a non sequitur. It may be that
     is the reason.  It may be that the numbers have been
     exceeded, but it does not follow as night follows day.

          MR. KING:   I will put it another way round, sir:
                                                             78

                                                   D.     BULLAS


Q. If one wanted a yardstick to try and discover whether
   or not there was something wrong with a crowd, in the
   sense of whether a crowd was over-crowded, would you
   agree with me that simply looking for signs of distress
   would not be the way of ensuring that there were still
   safe numbers in the crowd? What I am getting at,
   Officer, is this, that if you simply wait for signs of
   distress before you say something is wrong, then you
   are not ensuring that the numbers have necessarily not
   been exceeded, because whether it be right or wrong,
   they could well have been over-exceeded.  I accept it
   is only a possibility but it could have been over­
   exceeded by the time the signs of distress come.   Do
   you understand what I am saying? - A. Not really, no, I
   don't.

Q. A safe capacity has a purpose, does it not, of ensuring
   that people aren’t endangered? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you regard it as one of your functions, looking
   over the terrace to try to discover or look to see
   whether or not people were being endangered? - A. Yes.

Q. By what yardstick would you try and measure that? What
   would you be looking for? - A. Abnormal behaviour in
   the crowd; people calling up to me and other Officers
   for assistance.  There was none of that.

Q. The point I am trying to put to you, Officer, is that
   if you are waiting until that stage has been reached
   then how can you ever take measures to ensure that
   position is not reached? That is the position we don't
   want to reach, isn't it? We don't want to reach a
   position in a ground where people are calling for
   assistance and are endangered, we want to ensure that
   never happens, don't we? - A. Sir, I don't follow you.
   There was none of that in the crowd until Isaw the
   wedge.  I just don't follow you.

Q. But in order to maintain a safe capacity, in order to
   ensure that numbers are not exceeded, we don't want to
   have to wait, do we, until somebody has been injured? -
   A. That terrace is a one entity. There was none of
   that before I saw the movement of the crowd.  I am
   sorry, I cannot answer the question.

Q. Well I can try just one more way. Were you yourself
   given any specific instructions as to how to look out
   for, to monitor whether or not there was overcrowding
   in the pens? - A. I was not, no.

       MR. KING;    Sir, I can develop   thatwith other
  witnesses:
                                                              79

                                                    D.   BULLAS


Q. Let me deal with the issue though of self-levelling.
   You said you were aware of the system of fans finding
   their own levels on the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. How were you aware of this? - A. I have seen it many
   times over the years.

Q. At what sort of games? - A. Large division, first
   division crowds, and also semi-finals.

Q.    Are you saying that at league matches and atsemi­
     finals, to your knowledge the same system was used? -
     A. The ones I worked, yes.

Q. So be it; I won't take that any further with you. Let
   me deal with your evidence today that in 1989 you saw
   nothing to give you cause for concern that this system
   of self-levelling was not working, because that is your
   evidence, isn't it? - A. That is correct.

Q.   I wonder if you could look at C326A, please?  That,
     Inspector, is a view from the North Stand, on the day
     of the semi-final, looking down onto the terraces, the
     West Stand, and you see the time on the electronic
     scoreboard, top left-hand corner, 14.59.  Do you see
     that? - A. Yes.

Q. So that was    either at or shortly before kick-off.   Do
   you see the    pen which is nearer the camera, that is  pen
   6 which you    have told us about?  - A. Yes.

Q.   When you     looked    down from theWest Stand onto the
     terraces were you able to see a similar picture as is
     there recorded, namely the two centre pens being
     clearly packed with people and there being plenty of
     room in the side pen 6? - A. That is correct.

Q. Are you telling this Inquest and this Jury that looking
   at the scene depicted on C326A, that clearly shows that
   the system of fans finding their own level had worked?
   - A. That is a difficult question.  It depends how many
   more people were to come into the ground.

Q.    Patently people had not made their way in any numbers
     into pen 6, had they? - A. As I say, it depends how
     many more people there were to come in.

Q. Could you answer that question? That is right, isn't
   it? - A. Well, obviously there are not as many in pen
   6, no.

Q. This was an all ticket game, wasn't it? - A. Yes.
                                                           80

                                                   D.   BULLAS


Q. Assuming that everybody had arrived who was expected to
   arrive, you would expect the West Terrace pens to be
   all full, wouldn't you? - A. Presuming they had all
   arrived, yes.

Q. Either, therefore, the explanation for the scene as
   shown on 326A is either they have not all arrived, yes?
   That could be one explanation? - A. Yes.

Q. Or the fans certainly have not found their own level,
   that could be another, couldn't it? - A. I don't know.
   I am surmising probably like you are.

Q. Inspector, the system of fans finding their own level,
   was that designed for convenience, for safety or for
   what? What was the purpose of the system? - A. I have
   no idea.

Q. You don't know?

        THE CORONER:   I think, Mr. King, I did say that
   we were not going to go with this witness into every
   nook and cranny and I want to stick to that.

        MR. KING:    All right.   Sir, perhaps the point has
   been made.

Q. I may have misunderstood your evidence on a relatively
   small point, Officer. When you tried to signal down to
   the Officers on the perimeter track, I understood your
   evidence to say that you got the impression they did
   not understand your message, is that right? - A. I
   don't think they did immediately, no.

Q. What gave you that impression? - A. Well the Officer
   came to the fence and was looking into the crowd.

Q. Yes? Well they might have understood your message if
   .... - A. If you say so. I don't know.

Q. What was it about their behaviour which made you think
   they had not understood your message? - A. I don't
   know.  It was just he was stood there looking into the
   crowd.  I don't know if he knew what I meant.

Q. Why did you infer from the fact that they stood looking
   into the crowd that they had not understood your
   message? - A. It is my opinion that he did not
   understand immediately what I was trying to signal to
   him.

Q. What gave you that impression? - A. Because he was
   stood looking into the crowd.
                                                             81

                                                     D.   BULLAS


Q. And what were you expecting them to do? - A. I don't
   know at that stage.

Q. If they had understood your message, what were you
   expecting them to do? - A. I have no idea what he would
   have done.  That is supposition on my part.  I have no
   idea what his actions would have been.

Q. Inspector, I am not trying again to .... - A. I know
   you are not but I can't say what the Officer would have
   done.

Q. No, but you have told us that you formed the view that
   the Police Officers did not understand your message?
   You volunteered that view? - A. Immediately, yes.

Q. I am just trying to investigate, therefore, how you
   formed that view? It must be that you were expecting
   them to do something if they had understood your
   message, otherwise you would not be in a position to
   say,  I think they didn't understand my message". What
   were you expecting them to do? - A. I just got the
   impression immediately he didn't understand what I was
   pointing at.

Q. What gave you that impression? - A. He was just stood
   looking into the crowd.

Q. Which part of the crowd was he looking into? - A. The
   crowd immediately in front of him.

Q. Right by the perimeter fence? - A. I don't know.  I
   have no idea.  How do I know what part of the crowd he
   was looking into?

         MR. KING:    I have no further questions.

               Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE

Q.    Inspector, Ijust want to ask a few questions arising
     out of thequestions put to you by my    learned friend,
     Mr. King, who is to my right here. He concentrated a
     lot of questions on what you had been specifically told
     and instructed to do.   It is right, and you pointed to
     it, that there are two fundamental tenets of British
     policing, and that is to ensure public safety and law
     and order? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Every Police Officer knows that. Hiswhole policing on
   everyday situations, whether at football matches or on
   the streets, is geared to achieving that? - A. That is
   correct.
                                                              82

                                                      D.   BULLAS


Q. It is much easier drawing on experience to prevent a
   situation arising by anticipating a problem, than it is
   once the situation has broken out, whether it be safety
   or law and order? - A. Yes.

Q. And it is right, to be fair to you, isn't it, that if
   you had seen anything in that crowd on that day or any
   other day policing at Hillsborough, that you
   anticipated would be a problem or give rise to a threat
   to public safety, you would have reacted to it? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You would have expected that of all your Officers
   serving under you? - A. Yes.

Q. And any other Officers serving at the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. And you did not need to be told that in black and
   white? - A. No.

Q. And no doubt that was because you can't anticipate lots
   of different threats to public safety, whether it be
   fainting, somebody breaking their arm, someone
   slipping, it is impossible to cover? -  A. It is, yes.

Q.   What we do see in the Operational Order, it wasread
     out to, the preventative measures, those are the sort
     of things that do actually occur week in, week out at
     football matches? - A. Yes.

Q. So they can be predicted to be occurring and it is
   something that Officers can be told about, because that
   helps them to anticipate problems and prevent them? -
   A. That is right.   It is through experience obviously
   and then you can plan for the events.

          MR. KING:   Sir, there is a specific question I
     have been asked to ask, which is not anything to do
     with the matters I have raised.

          THE CORONER:    Yes, go ahead, Mr. King.

              Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q.    It is a question directed to trying to seek the
     identity by description of the first person you saw
     being taken from the tunnel, Inspector.    You remember
     you said you saw      someone being taken out? -     A.Yes.

          MR. KING:   One of the relatives, sir, is
     concerned:

Q. Could you give a description as to how old that person
   was? - A. I would say between 35 and 45.
                                                            83

                                                    D.   BULLAS


Q.        THE CORONER:   I thought you said he was a
     youngster? - A. The first one that was brought out was
     a man.  The one I dealt with specifically was a
     youngster.

          THE CORONER:  Mr. King, was that the question you
     were asking? Just try again.

          MR. KING:   Sir, I wonder if you could read that
     because you can see the purpose.  (Mr. King passed a
     note to the Coroner).

          THE CORONER:    Yes, I will have a look.  I want to
     be helpful if I can.   I would ask the question again,
     because I think this Officer dealt with two people.
     Shall I do it?

          MR. KING:   I would be very grateful for your
     assistance, sir.

                    Further by THE CORONER

Q. We are just trying to help particular relatives,
   because obviously they are anxious. My understanding
   was that you said that you saw, I think, a couple of
   Police ladies bringing somebody out? - A. That is
   right, sir, yes.

Q. That person I think you described as a youngster, is
   that right? Have I remembered that correctly? - A. No,
   sir. That was a man that was brought out. He was a
   grown male.

Q.   How    old   would yousay he was? - A. Between 35 and 45.

Q.    But you had nothing more to do with him apart from
     seeing him disappear into the distance, so to speak? -
     A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then I think you said there was somebody else brought
   out and they were  having difficulty carrying this
   person? - A. Yes.   There were two or three more people
   brought out and about the fourth one was a youth of
   about 14. That is the one I dealt with.

Q. That is the one I think we are interested in. So the
   first question is you would estimate his age at 14? -
   A. Yes.


             /Q. You helped carry
                                                                  84

                                                         D.    BULLAS


Q. You helped carry him out of the tunnel and put him in the
   concourse.   Can you remember anything else about him? -
   A. He had light hair.   He was wearing a light coloured
   top.   I don t know if it was an anorak or a top, a
   greyish type top.   It was light coloured.   I am not
   sure if he was wearing jeans.   He was only a young lad
   of about fourteen.

Q. You are pretty confident about the age? - A. Yes.

          THE CORONER:   Does that help you, Mr. King?         Yes,
     Mrs. McBrien.

                 Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. You are obviously a very experienced Officer at football
   matches.   Now at that match, your sector was Section
   1(b)? - A. I can't recall, I m sorry.

Q. It was sub-sector 6 and that was Serial 13? - A. Serial
   13, yes.

Q. Now the Officers in Serial 13, some were located at the
   north entrance, some at the south and some in the
   concourse? - A. No, they weren't located in the
   concourse.    They were located on the steps to assist
   with the people coming in by ticket.

Q.   Have you got the Operational Order there?     - A. Yes.

Q. Would you read...

          THE CORONER:   What is it you are after,
     Mrs. McBrien?

          MRS. MCBRIEN:  I am trying to find out exactly where
     the Officers were located in that Serial.

          THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, I have already said
     that I wanted this Officer to tell us what he saw.    We
     are not going to go into explanations as to where
     everybody else was and I am not going, within the limits
     of my ability, to allow myself to be deviated from that.
     What is the purpose of your question?

          MRS. MCBRIEN:   Could I ask the Inspector if he was
     allowed to move from his position to those other areas?

Q.    Were you allowed to go into the concourse   area to make
     sure things were all right there?    You didn't have to
     keep in one spot, did you? - A. I don't know if that is
     the correct phraseology "allowed".     There was nothing
     stopping me going into the concourse area but my main
     duty was in the stand, and the Officers under me, our
                                                             85

                                                     D.   BULLAS


     duties were in the stand so unless we were directed or
     had cause to go into the concourse area, we wouldn't do.

Q. If you felt you needed to go would you use your
   initiative to go there? - A. Yes.

Q. When you were up in the stand you had a very good view of
   what was happening below.   You said how the situation
   appeared normal to you and then you described how it
   became abnormal and to you it appeared like, I think the
   expression was, "molten laver", laver moving very slowly?
   - A. Yes.

0. You said at that stage you felt things were abnormal.
   Now could you have moved from your position then?   That
   is the question. - A. Moved down where?

Q. Where you were, did you realise how people were getting
   into that area below you, when you saw these people
   coming in and gradually there was more pressure coming in
   there?   Did you know how they were getting into that
   area? - A. Uhat do you mean, at the time of the wedge?

Q. The entrance to the terrace. - A. At the time of the
   wedge?

         THE CORONER:    Yes, that is what you are asking.

Q.        MRS. MCBRIEN:   I am asking:  did you know the route
     they were taking on to the terrace from the concourse
     area? - A. Yes.

Q. What was that?    A. I presume they were coming down the
   tunnel and also round the wings.

Q. It was in the centre that you noticed the problems,
   wasn't it? - A. I noticed the wedge.    I didn't notice
   any problems before that in the centre.

Q. We have seen a photograph today where you have said that
   that was the scene you saw, where the side sections were
   quite sparsely populated and the centre was quite
   crowded.   Then you describe how the surges you saw - you
   have been at so many football matches you know what
   surges are like but this time they were different, they
   didn't come back, did they?   You noticed that? - A. You
   are talking in the plural.   I just mentioned one surge.
   There was only one I saw.

Q. You just saw one that didn't come back? - A. That's
   right.

Q. You realised then that something was really wrong, didn't
   you? - A. Yes.
                                                              86

                                                      D.   BULLAS


Q. I know you said you tried to get in touch with Control.
   How long did you take to do that? -A. I just got on the
   radio and said my "India 6".   There was no reply to me.
   I tried three times.

Q. About how long would that take you? - A. It just depends
   on the lapse in between.    I cannot honestly remember the
   time lapse.    Two or three minutes, if that.   Two
   minutes.    I don't know.

Q. As you got no response from Control and you were getting
   no response from the Officer on the pitch, did you go
   down to the concourse yourself?

          THE CORONER:    That is what he told us.

Q.       MRS. MCBRIEN:    You went later? - A. No, I went then.

Q. At that time you saw people being brought out? - A. As I
   entered the tunnel, yes.

Q. When you first saw the scene you described it as being
   just when the players were on the pitch.   You didn't
   think the kick-off had taken place? -A. I don't think
   they kicked off, no.

Q. Do you think you could have gone down there quicker?

          THE CORONER:    I'm sorry, what was the question.

          MRS. MCBRIEN:   I was just wondering, if the Officer
     could have gone down quicker than he did.

          THE CORONER:   No, we are not going to allow that.
     Don't answer the question, Officer.

          MRS. MCBRIEN:    Right, thank you.

          THE CORONER:   Before you rise, Mr. Russell, I think
     I can see what you are driving at about the concourse,
     Mrs. McBrien.   I have looked at the Operational Order
     and I think I know where the confusion lies.   In the
     Operation Order under Phase 1, C, it says:

          "Two PCs will patrol the concourse/bar area to
          maintain order."

     Is that in fact the concourse area behind the West Stand
     or is that the concourse area within the West Stand near
     a bar? - A. That is within the bar, sir, the concourse of
     the bar.

          THE CORONER:   That is what you were thinking about.
     Mrs. McBrien, you know you were asking about the Officers
                                                                87

                                                        D.   BULLAS


     being in the concourse area, and the word "concourse"
     does appear, you are quite right, but in fact what the
     Officer has said is that this concourse is not the
     concourse which we have been talking about.    It is a
     congregating area within the West Stand.    Are you with
     me?   There are thousands of areas where people were
     having a drink upstairs.   Does that help you?

          MRS. MCBRIEN:   Yes, it does.   I have just
     remembered another question:

Q. Inspector, you said you have seen many, many matches, and
   a lot at Hillsborough and the fans were able to find
   their own level satisfactorily.   There was no problem in
   the past? - A. No, not the matches I attended.   On the
   15th of April, 1989, when you saw people coming in and
   not going back in these surges...

          THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, he said "surge", he
     corrected you once - the surge he said, or at least he
     said the wedge.

0.        MRS. MCBRIEN:   Did you think they were coming in in
     a different manner that day, that something different had
     happened?

           THE CORONER:   No. He knows the answer. We all
     know the answer, but it is only a guess, if he answers
     that.    Don't answer that question.  It doesn't help us.
     It doesn't help the jury.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL:

Q. Inspector, can I first of all ask you about the matter of
   capacities and your belief that you expressed to the
   Inquiry that there was a limit to the capacities of pens
   3 and 4? - A. Yes, I would say there was.

Q. Inspector, I anticipate there will be evidence called
   before these Inquests from Dr. Eastwood, the consulting
   engineer, and also Sheffield Wednesday Football Club that
   at the time there were no set capacities for pens 3 and
   4, or, indeed, any of the individual parts of the terrace
   other than the north-west part of the terrace and the
   rest of the terrace which was divided into two.   If that
   is right, would you accept that your belief you expressed
   that there were fixed capacities for pens 3 and 4, was a
   mistaken one? - A. If that is what you are saying, yes.

Q. You have described, and marked on a plan, your position
   when you looked down.   I think I can help you by showing
   you an illustration of it.    If I can ask you to look at
   a photograph which I hope Sergeant Griffiths has prepared
   an acetate of.   It is DB.16, frame 34.    On the extreme
                                                   D.   BULLAS


right hand there is an Inspector.     Is that you? - A. It
is, sir, yes.

There seems to be   some very young legs to yourleft,      at
the extreme right   of the picture? - A.Yes.

As though a child   is sitting on thefront   of the West
Stand? - A. Yes.

That is you looking, at that stage, to the left? - A.
Yes.

We can see your position is just above the first letter
of "Engineering", being the trade of "Presto"? - A. Yes.

The time of that we can see is on the photograph of 2.46,
and so I think the corrected time of that is 2.45.   So
we can immediately put in context where the "E" of
"Engineering" is, you have been asked by my learned
friend Mr. King to look at C.326A, which is in the bundle
in front of you. - A. I have that.

You can see Presto Engineering.  Does that help you show
where, in relation to the entrance to the tunnel from the
terracing, you were standing? - A. Yes.

You were indeed above pen 4 just to the right of the
entrance of the tunnel, looked at from the pitch? - A.
Yes.

That is the position you were in at quarter to three.
You then told us you had to go away from the balcony, if
I can call it that, of the terrace, to deal with an
incident in the crowd.   Then I think you told us you
returned to the balcony of the terrace a little later,
and that was where you saw the river of people? - A. That
is correct.

Am I right in thinking that that is the approximate
position to which you returned? - A. Yes, somewhere
around there.

From your vantage point on the balcony of the West Stand,
what was the effect of the entry of the river of people
into the terracing? - A. Obviously it pushed the people
who were already on the terracing forward.

After you had seen that effect, how long was it before
you started to radio Control? -A. As I have already said,
in my own mind I can't remember or be specific.

Was it a long time or a short time? - A. It was a short
time.

                                                   D.    BULLAS


Q. You have told us that you attempted to radio Control.
   You didn't seek to radio Superintendent Greenwood, but
   the Control Room, is that right? - A. That's correct.

Q. You couldn't get through.  Do you have any explanation
   for that inability to get through? - A. I can only
   presume there was either other traffic on the radio or it
   was the crowd noise.

Q. Was sort of noise was the crowd making at that time? - A.
   It was deafening.

Q. Having attempted to get through on the radio, how long
   was it after you had failed to do that that you tried to
   attract the attention of Officers on the track? - A. It
   seems almost immediately.

Q. When you decided to leave your position on the balcony
   and make your way down, when you left your position on
   the balcony am I right in thinking that at that stage, to
   the best of your recollection, the gates in the perimeter
   fence were still closed? - A. Yes.

Q. You made your way to the exit point from the West Stand,
   at which point you turned and at least one of the gates
   in the perimeter fence was open? - A. That is what I saw,
   yes.

Q. Can we just consider for a moment the point at which you
   would have left the stand?   First of all, did you leave
   the stand by your nearest exit point from your position
   on the balcony? - A. Yes, more or less immediately behind
   me where I was standing.

Q. We can see perhaps where that was by looking at C.252.
   Inspector, that is a view of the West Stand and although
   some of the advertising on the front of the balcony of
   the West Stand has been torn off, one can see the word
   "Engineering", which was part of the advertisement for
   Presto? - A. Yes.

Q. One can see the capital "E" above which you were standing
   when you turned to leave that stand? - A. Yes.

Q. At about ten o'clock from that, using the hands of a
   watch as a direction, there is a point of exit from the
   stand? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that the point of exit to which you would have moved?
   - A. I think it was, yes.

Q. It does not, from this photograph, look a very long
   distance, is that correct? - A. It is not a long
   distance, no.
                                                D.   BULLAS


But for the fact there may have been people arriving in
the stand and taking their places, did you find it a very
difficult journey to make from your position on the
balcony to the point at which you disappeared from
certainly camera view in this photograph, out of the
stand? - A. There were one or two people coming in, as
you say.   I had the steps to climb but otherwise I went
out through that exit.

So in the time that it took for you to cover that short
distance from above the "E" of "Engineering" to a point
which looks about half way to the back of the stand,
almost immediately behind where you had been standing,
during that time the gate having been shut was open when
you turned before leaving the stand?   Is that right? -
A. That is what I recall, yes.

We can see from photograph C.326A from the clock shown on
that photograph that gates 3 and 4 are open at 14.59? -
A. That is correct.




          Q. As I understand your
                                                   D. BULLAS


As I understand your evidence you cannot remember
which one or whether both of those two gates were
open when you turned at the exit point which you have
pointed out in the stand? - A. I cannot.  I know
there was one open but I cannot remember which gate
it was.

Is it your evidence there was only one open or that
you only have a recollection of one being open? You
do appreciate the difference I am asking you about? -
A. Yes.  I can only recollect just one open.

Do you recollect the other being shut? - A. No.     I do
not remember seeing the other.  I just remember
seeing the one gate.

And that was open? - A. Yes.

Did you pause? - A. I did.

Before leaving the stand? - A. Yes.

At the point of exit from the stand? - A. Yes.

How long for? - A. A few seconds.  I just turned,
looked towards the pitch, saw the gate open and I saw
two or three people on top of the fencing.

Having paused for a few seconds where did you go
next? - A. I went down the steps at the rear.

To what destination? - A. To the concourse.

How long did it take you, do you think, to get from
that point having just observed the gates opened or
obviously newly opened to the concourse? - A. A
matter of minutes.

It is not very far, is it? - A. It is two flights of
steps and across the concourse.  I do not know, two
minutes.

Two minutes or so? - A. Approximately, I do not know.

When you arrived at the tunnel you were in a position
to assess the situation as it confronted you, is that
right? - A. Yes.

At that point what did you consider the priority to
be that you could do in the position in which you
were? - A. To relieve the pressure and to try and get
as many people away from the wedge which I had seen
going down the terracing as possible.  Just
physically.

                                                   D. BULLAS



Q. By what means did you consider you could relieve the
   pressure from the position in which you were? - A. In
   the position, just physical means.

Q. You say that you saw Officers in the area and you
   enlisted their support? - A. Yes, there are a couple
   of bobbies in the tunnel.  I told them to get into
   the crowd.

Q. I was just coming to that. What instructions did you
   give them? - A. I said something like, "Get forward
   and get people out of here".

Q. So far as you can recall is that what they did? - A.
   They went forward, yes.

Q. Can I deal with the matter of instruction that you
   were given before this day. You I think have told us
   you were given no specific instructions to monitor
   the terraces for distress, overcrowding or safety but
   was this something that you felt you needed to be
   given specific instructions about? - A. In relation
   to the terracing?

Q. Yes? - A. No.

Q. Was this something you recognised was part of the job
   of yourself and your serial? - A. Yes.

Q. Until you saw the crowd in Pens 3 and 4 absorb the
   river of people that you saw go into the pen, do I
   understand your evidence to be this; the crowds in
   Pens 3 and 4 were exhibiting signs of normality? - A.
   They were displaying no signs of abnormality.  They
   were acting in the normal way that I have seen
   football crowds acting on many occasions.

Q. It appeared a happy crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. A contented crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. A playful crowd? - A. Definitely, yes.

Q. It did not from your vantage point appear to be an
   overcrowded crowd or a distressed crowd? - A. There
   were no signs of that, no.

Q. Finally, the system whereby fans were allowed to find
   their own level on terracing, in your experience is
   it a system that had worked in the past? - A. I have
   seen it work, yes.
                                                  D. BULLAS


On this day had you seen anything which leads you to
think it was not going to work for this Semi Final? -
A. Not at all. So far as I could tell it was
working.

    MRS. PERKINS:    The photograph showing Inspector
Bullas is C.459.

                 Further bv THE CORONER

Just two more things.  The first question is one from
the Jury. When you noticed the wedge - and I am
paraphrasing their question slightly - and you were
trying to radio through to the Control Box, did you
consider sending any of your serial by foot to alert
them? - A. No, sir, not at that stage.  I think I was
stood by myself at that time.  I was not stood with
any other Officer.

You then made your way down presumably still without
your serial. You left them in situ on the stand? -
A. It did flash through my mind, to tell you the
truth, to take some Officers with me but there again
it would have been the incorrect procedure to move
Officers without informing anyone leaving the stand
exposed to problems.  So that was my responsibility.
So I went myself.

I want to just come back once more to this youngster
whom you helped to carry out, the 14 year old.  Do
you by chance know the identity of the Officers or
Officer who you were assisting? - A. I honestly can't
recall, sir, I am sorry.

Inspector Bullas, I am most grateful to you.  Thank
you for your evidence and thank you for being here. -
A . Thank y o u .

     THE CORONER: Ladies and gentlemen, let me not
keep you another second. We see you tomorrow at ten.
Is that okay? We have got quite a lot of witnesses
tomorrow and so we had better get our skates on, if
they all turn up that is. Could you pass this note
back to Mr. King? Mr. King you are satisfied with
the way I dealt with it?

     MR. KING:   Yes, sir, thank you for your
assistance.

     THE CORONER:   Please leave us, ladies and
gentlemen.

                                                D. BULLAS


     MR. PAYNE: Sir, may I hand to you the analysis
of the blood alcohol content of spectators entering
the ground before and after 2.40, the analysis,
together with the sources from which the material has
been extracted?

     THE CORONER:   Yes.

     MR. PAYNE: What I request is, subject to your
discretion and it is entirely the way in which you
propose to deal with it, what I respectfully request
is that it should be shown either to Dr. Nicholson or
to another witness so that he is in a position to
answer questions about it when he gives his evidence.
The reason I mention Dr. Nicholson is because I
understand that he, in fact, has done some
statistical analysis on another aspect of the case,
namely the numbers of people who he estimates came
through Gate C and the turnstiles.  He has done a
counting exercise on that.  I am mentioning him as a
suitable candidate on the basis that he has done some
statistical analysis elsewhere.

      THE CORONER: Either he or his staff have done a
lot of counting to try and work out the rates and the
numbers and so on. What I am doubtful about is
whether he is in a position to make any useful
comment on the alcohol because that is not a topic
that —

     MR. PAYNE: All that is is a counting exercise
of evidence that has already been done. It is
explained by the supporting documents.




                           /THE CORONER.
                                                 95




      THE CORONER:   May I look at it?   (Produced)

      MR. KING: Sir, I assume what has been handed to
you, I object on behalf of those I represent to this
document being used.   It is in fact a statement, a
pejorative statement in fact, of the view formed by those
my learned friend Mr. Payne represents of the evidence
as to alcohol content.

      I say that because in paragraph 4 it says:
"1 in 4 of those entering after 14.40 was over the limit".
Sir it could just as easily have said:    "3 and 4 of
those entering after 14.40 were under the limit".

      Secondly, sir, the limit in my submission should
have no bearing on your assessment and summing-up to the
jury of the evidence.  It is a very misleading term in
the context of those who attend a football match to analyse
whether or not they are "over the limit" when we know that
by the "limit" we mean whether or not they would be capable
in terms of the law, not capable, that is the wrong word,
whether or not in law they would be entitled to drive a
motor car is a totally different criterion for a totally
different purpose than whether or not someone is in a fit
state to attend a football match.

      Sir, it is well known that relatively little alcohol
is required to take one over the limit.

      A second point I make sir is to say blandly 1 in 4
were over the limit makes no concession as to how many
were just over the limit, how many were double over the
limit, whatever the gradations were.

      Sir, you have through Mr. Forrest the detailed
analysis of each individual deceased as regards their
blood alcohol content.

       You will know, sir, that in itself that evidence
has caused a great amount of distress to the bereaved.
However, I have explained, and I don't make that as a
criticism sir of your taking the alcohol content because
it is a fact, but to go further than that and to use as
a yardstick for purposes of how people met their deaths,
which is the question to which this Inquest is directed,
to direct ourselves to whether or not a percentage were
over or under the limit and whether or not those coming
in after a certain hour were under/over the limit is a
false approach in my submission.   It is pejorative because
over the limit carries with it a connotation of wrong-doing
it does, anybody who hears you were over the limit.   It
reflects adversely apparently on those who were over the
limit.
      Sir, it can have no bearing in itself whether you
are in a position, whether or not you are able and
entitled to drive a motor car, but sir my basic point
is I can have no objection, you sir are the Coroner and
I respect any decision you make as to what you say to
the jury and I say that openly and not trying to soft
soap you sir. Flannel, that is the word I am looking
for, not wishing to flannel you sir.

      What I do object to is those representing the
Chief Constable should put forward a document which
seeks to apparently put before you a conclusion to be
drawn from the facts, and it is a conclusion to be
drawn from the facts, and it is in fact addressing you
on the facts in effect, as to how many were over the
limit in the way described.  Not only do I regard
it as misleading and is a false point, but in my sub­
mission it is not proper that it should be done in
this way, it should be totally left to you sir to make
what you wish of the evidence you have heard.

      THE CORONER:  I know that people have been very
upset about me authorising the alcohol levels on the
deceased and I am not going to go over that again. The
more I hear the more justified I feel in having done it.
Apart from saying that I am quite satisfied that at the
time when I took the decision it was right and I am not
going to make any excuses for it.

      Secondly I can tell you now that I will direct
the jury that the alcohol level as such did not kill
anybody. Nobody died from acute alcohol poisoning.
There is no question of that in my mind. We have got
all the pathological evidence. We know why they died
and not a single one does it say contributed by,
induced or in any other way, so there is ho question
about that.

      Three, I agree with you Mr. King that one has to
be very very careful about using the 80 mgs./lOO mis.
of alcohol as an absolute yardstick for saying:  "If
you are over that then, forgive me I will use the word
drunk, and if you are under that you are not" because
I think it is patently obvious to me anyway, that the
80 mgs./lOO mis. does not demarkate somebody whom we
would describe visually necessarily as drunk though there
may be a few people who might in fact exhibit signs of
drunkenness, whatever those signs might be, but the vast
majority of people I don't think would exhibit those
signs and therefore the reason why no doubt the powers
that be selected a figure was for that very purpose because
although it can be demonstrated no doubt that motor
functions are impaired at 80 mgs./lOO mis, otherwise
there would not be any point in having it, you might not
be able to see that by conventional assessment.
                                                 97




      Now the important point about that, Mr. King,
and I go along with you so far, that it does not follow
just because I cannot drive or not allowed to drive a
car that I am therefore precluded from entering a football
ground as a pedestrian or as a spectator or indeed in
any other capacity.

      I am very very conscious, and I have said it before,
that simply because somebody is over the limit, is not
the be-all and end-all of the discussion, and in any case
if you think about it are we going to distinguish between
somebody who has got 79 mgs./lOO mis, 80 mgs., 81, it is
not really practical, but of course if you take it to
its logical conclusion you would say if you progressed
at 1 mg./lOO mis. you would get to the ridiculous situation
where you would say that somebody with 200 mgs. or 300 mgs.
per ml. was still not in any sense inhibited because
when you compare 1 mg. with the next you can't see the
difference, so there is clearly a line and a bit of
commonsense which has to be applied and I intend to try
and make sure that the jury understand that.

      Having said that   I do not think that it follows
as a sine qua non from   what I have just said that the
alcohol levels of some   or all of the people may not have
had an effect on their   behaviour.

      The issue for the jury is going to be whether or
not in the light of all the evidence and in the light
of the statistical analysis, if it is relevant, whether
one can see this did or did not play a part.

      With all the caveats which I have just made about
understanding, simply because somebody is at 80 mgs.
or 81 mgs. does not mean to say he is drunk in the
conventional sense of the word.

      Now if somebody is 180 mgs. you might well take
a slightly different view as to their observable
behaviour, but it is also true and you know it as well
as I do, that at least 50% I think of all the people
who went through either had no alcohol or negligible
amounts which I consider to be equal to zero.  If it
is less than 10 I consider that to be the same as
nothing, rightly or wrongly.




                              The jury will have to
                                                        98




     The Jury will have to think a little bit about that,
but there   has been plenty of evidence of what people
assessed to be the behaviour and the responses of the
crowd, and frankly, if the Jury were to take the view that
the crowd   did not respond - and after all, I don't know
what view   the Jury are going to take - in some respects I
would prefer to think that it was partly, at least, the
fault of an element of alcohol than for them to take that
view that everybody was totally and completely sober - and
if you stop and think about it I am sure that you will
realise that there is some logic in that position.

     Now whether anybody likes that point of view or not I
don't really care. The Jury are not here and I am not
addressing them yet, but I will do and I will do so
without let or hindrance and without any regard as to
whether people jump up and walk out and storm out, or
otherwise, and indeed, Mr. King, I will take this
opportunity how, that if that happens when I am addressing
the Jury I will do two things, the first time I will pause
and adjourn, and the next time I will clear the Court.
Perhaps you would be kind enough to make sure - I am
afraid it is mainly your clients and I don't blame you for
that and I understand it, because they feel very strongly,
but I am not going to allow it to happen.

     MR. KING:   Could I add something too, sir? I would
be very tempted to walk out myself if that happened,
because what people behind me don't realise, it doubles
the difficulties of my task in presenting their case to
you,sir, when that happens.

     THE CORONER:    Can I say something else, that it does
not follow as night follows day that, in fact, it
impresses the Jury, which is a point which people should
think about as well.

     MR. PAYNE:   Sir, it may have been noticed by some of
those who have attended throughout the Inquest that when I
have asked questions on what are undoubtedly contentious
and difficult subjects there has been quite a distinct
rumble of hostility from behind me. Now I have never
responded to this in the presence of the Jury.  I have
quite deliberately not done anything about it at all.   If
it is intended to intimidate Counsel, then one has to
recognise that it does have an uncomfortable effect, and
quite frankly I think it is absolutely disgraceful.   I
have not said anything in front of the Jury and I am not
going to, and I would not have said anything about it at
all unless the subject had not come up very graphically
just at this moment, in answer to something that you were
saying, and it is something very much to be deprecated.
     THE CORONER!   I think, Mr. King, you agree with that
anyway.  In Coroners' Courts I am used to people being
emotional and upset and I make allowances for that, but on
the other hand in Inquests of this nature the one thing we
want is that the Jury should be able to reach a free and
fair decision.  That applies to me as well.  I am going to
do my summing-up in the way I think right.  Whether it is
popular or not is neither here nor there to me.  It may be
popular, it may not be, I don't know, but I am going to do
it and I am going to do it to the best of my ability and I
am going to do it in the way I think is right.

     MR. KING!   Sir, I agree, and while the Jury are not
here, and although on occasion it may feel, sir, that I
over-egg the pudding, and perhaps I do - and we are all
guilty of this - but there can be very similar behaviour,
and I am not blaming any particular person, I include
myself in this, when one Counsel is on his feet one gets
grumbling and noises and responses equally, and that can
have exactly that which my learned friend Mr. Payne refers
to, and we should all perhaps - and I include myself
totally in that - learn from that.

      Sir, having said that, can I agree with you totally
on what you have just said.   Could I stress that I made
two separate points and perhaps I did not make myself
c fe?r ^ ^ Put to y°u whY I felt the criterion over the
limit was not very satisfactory, and put to you why in
your discretion what you make of the figures and the
questions you ask of the statisticians should be very
carefully thought through.   I don't mean that with
disrespect to you.   The quite separate point was I was
objecting and do object - not because it comes from my
learned friend Mr. Payne as such - but for any of us to
put forward their own analysis and purported conclusions
to be drawn from the facts, because that is, in effect,
addressing you on the facts, and I would rather you, sir,
put your figures as you drew them to the statistician, and
certainly not put that document which my learned friend
has put towards you.

     As I say, it is a very selective way of looking at
the facts.

     THE CORONER:   I think, if I may say so, my
understanding has been, because I think you have all from
time to time - not all but some of you from time to time,
or your instructing solicitors - have written to me asking
can we call this witness or can we do that.  I know that
one of the things which has exercised Mr. Payne's mind has
been that he did not want to spring on Dr. Nicholson a
whole series of questions for which he had not been
prepared.  In a sense I am looking at this in that light,
simply so that if --- I don't know whether I will use it
yet.   I have got to look at it properly and decide
whether, in fact, I want to use it, whether it is of any
value.   I have already given the statistician the figures
which I have worked out and I have not drawn the
conclusions.   In fact, it is analysed in more details than
this, if you like, ray columns, and I want to wait and see
what he says and then I will decide whether or not we need
him.

     Whatever the answer of the statistician, be it that
there are differences between groups or that there are
not, both those answers could be interesting, whichever
way the answer goes.  I don't mind, and indeed I told him
expressly that I don't care what the answer is. All I
want him to do is do his sums and if it comes out one way,
fine, if it comes out another way, fine.  If it comes out
inconclusive that is fine as well.  I don't really mind.
It is just a matter of seeing whether there is anything
there, anything that is interesting and worth having as
far as the Inquest is concerned.

     MR. KING!   I am not wishing, again, to flannel you
at all, sir, but I wish to leave it to you to put matters
to the statistician, not for us.  I could sit down and
draw up my table, addressing it in a different way and
seeking to draw certain conclusions from that and put it
to you.  If I am to do that I will sit down and do it, but
I submit that should not be necessary.

     I gave a very simple example: we have percentages of
the numbers over 80 milligrams.  You could have had a
column with numbers under 80 milligrams, and it makes an
awful difference to looking at it.

     THE CORONER:    I can see that point, yes.

      MR. KING:  That is why I say, sir - and you have got
to look carefully at the rules, I don't know how the rules
fit into what my learned friend has just presented to you,
but I do know there is a rule against addressing you on
the facts, as everybody reminds me as much as anybody
else.

     THE CORONER:    I don't know whether I would treat
this as an address on the facts.     Maybe the covering sheet
might just about be, but the alcohols are all taken from
Dr. Forrest's evidence and merely tabulated in a different
order, basically.

     I am not so worried about this as everybody else is,
maybe because it is clear in my mind, or reasonably clear,
what I intend to do.
                                                       101




     MR. ISAACS:   Certainly for my part I am not worried
about it.  One way or the other, I am mindful of the
evidence given by Dr. Forrest that tests have shown that
those with a blood alcohol level of between 20 and 40 are
impaired in their ability to respond to unusual
circumstances, and that, in my submission, is the sort of
evidence that you will be concerned with.  The limit is
the limit and the Jury will make of that as they will.
That is exactly your point.

     THE CORONER:  Indeed, I think this is the important
point to understand.  I don't think there is anything more
to be said on this. Mr. Payne, I am afraid over the
weekend I did not do as much work as I ought to have done
perhaps, so I am not going to tell you my decision with
regard to Mr. Phillips today, but I hope to be able to do
that before the end of this week.

     May I just mention one other point which was raised,
namely the order of address when we come to doing the
legal submissions? I have decided - I hope you accept it-
that unless you come to me with an agreed order, which I
think is highly unlikely, we will take the order in
exactly the same way as we have done up to now. We will
start at that end and we will work our way through to the
other end, and I will then allow one response.  In effect,
I will do what you have said, I will allow a reply, and
that will be it with the one reservation that if I want to
ask an additional question I reserve the right to do so,
and obviously if I ask something then I expect that person
to whom I look to address me on that point of law. We
have done it throughout that way and I think that we will
continue.

     MR. ISAACS:   I think we can take questions on that
particular approach, sir, at some later stage. We are all
very grateful to you for having indicated that.

     THE CORONER:   Yes.  If we try and re-arrange things,
all that will happen that we will be in the most awful
trouble.

     Do you want to know what is happening tomorrow if all
goes well? We are hoping to have Mr. Doyle, the part-
heard gentleman; then there is a Mr. Skarratts; a Mr.
Fearns and a Mr. Atkins, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Tracey, Mr.
Sweeney, and at the tail end there is a Mr. Cooper but we
don't know whether we will be able to get him. We have
lost him at the moment but fortunately he is not one of
our vital people so I am not too worried.

     Can I just say one other thing about names?  I have
studiously avoided drawing to the attention of the Jury
where the names come from.  As far as I am concerned, and
                                                       102




as far as the Jury are concerned, the witnesses are mind
and technically that is correct and always has been, but
it is only right to say that I have called several
witnesses at various people's requests.  Sometimes I have
done it almost against my better judgment but I felt in
the end --- I have not agreed to every request by any
means, but I have agreed to some. You should understand
that some of the witnesses who we have called are because
people have specifically wanted me to hear them.   I felt
it would be wrong to indicate to the Jury which witness
was called on the initiative, if you like, of one of the
interested parties, because they should listen to the
evidence and make their assessments without it being
coloured in any way as to "Oh well, he comes from that
camp''. Some people are obvious but there are many who are
not.

     I mention this because there are one or two in this
list who happen to be in that category and that has just
reminded me.




            /One final point
                                                            103




     One final point, and again we don't need to discuss
this tonight.    I am very concerned about what might
happen when we get to what we have called our principal
witnesses.    If we proceed in the way we did, say, with
Mr. Marshall, then we will be here for at least another
five weeks - two and a half days per witness, there are
about eight of them - that is twenty days, four weeks.

     I do not intend that we should do that.    I intend
that we will not go over ground - ground which needs to
be covered which hasn't been dealt with and which the
witness is in a position to answer and is willing to
answer subject to the rule against incrimination, fair
enough.   However, we are not going to spend the amount
of time which we have spent with some of the witnesses we
have had.   If I were told today that I had to bring
these Inquests to an end tomorrow, we could virtually do
it. We have heard a great deal of evidence and we are
now really icing the cake, apart from one or two little
segments.   We haven't touched the Control Room yet and I
think we do need to hear a little bit about that and we
haven't really done much on the club.   However, apart
from that, we have done virtually everything that has to
be done.

     I am saying this now because I don't want to jump on
you without warning,   so to speak, and say we are not
going down that road.   I also want you to bear it in
mind because it may temper the way you approach your
questioning.

      As I say, anything that is necessary and that we
haven't covered and is appropriate, then by all means
let's do it and let's do it reasonably thoroughly, but we
cannot allow eight witnesses to take four weeks.        If you
think I am wrong, if you look at Dr. Eastwood's evidence,
for instance, before     Lord Justice Taylor,that took four
days.    Well, we are    not going to do that. I am going   to
be as strict as I tried to be with Mr. Bullas, not
entirely successfully I hasten to add, but I did try.         I
am going to try and look and ask what we really need from
Dr. Eastwood    and that is what we are going     tostick to.
That appliesto other people as well.

     MR. CATCHPOLEs    Can I just put a plea in in respect
of the people who were attending the match? We have
noticed over the last two weeks, we have tended to slide
back to the evidence that was all given right at the
beginning of the Inquests, concentrating on what has been
happening outside and nothing really has been new that we
have or have   not heard about tunnel entrances or having
seen a couple of Police Officers.     I have   noticed a
distinct reluctance to ask questions on this side of the
                                                        104




bench.   That goes right the way along.    That is
lengthening the process.

     THE CORONER:    You areright and tomorrow...     There
wasa particular reason why I didn't want to change who I
did go over the early ground today with.     You are
perfectly correct and tomorrow       we are going toskate
through anything that we have already covered.     This is
not because we are wanting to suppress anything, but if
there is nothing more to be added other than confirmation
of another fifteen witnesses who say exactly the same
thing, then we might as well cut that out.     That is why
we are going to get through this list tomorrow, because
otherwise we wouldn't do it.

     Yes, Mr. King?

     MR. KINGs    Sir, I know it is difficult but it would
help me.    Is there any way of knowing, sir, what we are
likely to be doing on Thursday?    Sir, if no-one is
interested I could stay behind and find out.

     MR. MANNING!    Mr. Mackrell is listed to be the last
witness of that day.

     THE CORONER!   I think we      have changed it.    Itis
very difficult, because we had two people, Mr.  Curry and
Mr. Ellis, who were difficult to get hold of.    We lost
them because of the snow!

     MR. KING:   What I really want to know is is it
likely to be a witness where my presence desirable on
behalf of those whom I represent?

     THE CORONER:   I think we have got Mr.   Seamen down
for Thursday, he is a Fire Officer.

     What we want to do if we can is to have Mr. Ellis
and Mr. Curry.   I will tell you who they are.
Mr. Ellis is a photographer who was near gate 4.    Mr.
Curry is a reporter who looked at the scene from a
slightly further distance.   If you like, he is the
equivalent of Mr. Motson, on the press side.   Mr. Seamen
and Mr. Hicks to sort out the point we have got, and
PC Parker if we can fit him in.   He is gate 3, I think.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   I apologise for rising.  Something
my learned friend Mr. Manning has just mentioned worried
me.   He seemed to think Mr. Mackrell might be called
this week.   My understanding was that that wasn't going
to happen.   He seems to have seen a list that certainly
hasn't been forwarded to me.
                                                        105




     THE CORONER:   I was surprised he   said that.
Mr. Mackrell was provisionally...    I   think that we are
not going to get to him.   If for some   reason I am wrong
about that I will tell you first thing   tomorrow morning.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Very good.   It is just that I know
that people in London would like to be present.

     THE CORONER:   Tomorrow is Wednesday, I think it is
highly unlikely that we are going to get to him.   All
right?

     Well, we have got to bring it to a close. We have
given this a pretty good airing and whilst it would not
be fair to rush through the principal characters, we must
do something.

          (The Inquests were adjourned until
          ten o'clock the following morning)

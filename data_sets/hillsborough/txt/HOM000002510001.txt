DATED:   270489                                                                    (SIGNED)



             I am a single man residing at the above address with my parents.               I

             have been unemployed for 3 m t h s .     Before that I did painting &.

             decorating under a Community Programme.         I have been a Liverpool

             supporter for the last 12 years.         I donot belong to the football

             supporters club at Liverpool.       I attend every home game and for the

             last 4 seasons I have attended every away game as well.            I usually

             have a seat at the home games      in the Kelman Rd stand.    At away games

             I always stand up.

             On Saturday 150489 I left home about 0700am.         With me were me mates,

                                my cousin                                 and

                         My cousin           1 iveo

                     lives in                               He lives on the severnth

             floor at             but I don't know the name of the block of flats,

                            lives around the

             house              1 ives                                       They all

             slept at my house on the Friday night.         None of us had tickets but

             left hoping to buy them at the ground.         We caught a bus to Lyme

             Street Station and we all caught the twenty past seven train to
                                                                                      PAGE



^J^ockport.         The train was full, mo stly with Liverpool supporters and

 a couple of Forest supporters.            The train was quite and I only saw

 people drinking soft drinks.            I was drinking nothing at this time.

 When the train arrived at Stockport we all got off.                 There was about

 thirty Liverpool supporters.            I asked one of the station staff how

 long the next train would be.            He told me it would be about 15 mins.

 I stopped on the platform and got myself a soft drink and some

 sweets.      My mates were all with me.          The Sheffield train arrived at

 the other side of the platform that we had come in on.                   We all got on

 the train and managed to get seats.              We all sat down together.             There

 was no fooling about on the train and I saw noone drinking or drunk.

 When we arrived at Sheffield station we got off and went to the

 ticket barrier.          I would like to add that                       and

 stopped at Lyme Street because they had a football supporters train

 ticket which was to leave at half nine.               Myself, ______ and

 h a n d e d our   licketa   in and wo   loll   the u Lai ion and went    into S h e f f i e l d

 City Centre.         At the station I only saw 2 policeman.             As we left the

 station I saw about forty policemen walking towards the station.                            I

 also saw a van load as well.            We walked around and eventually went

  into a cafe near the snooker place.              I even saw Steve Davies outside

  signing autographs.          We stayed in the cafe to about eleven when we

  left and made our way to the bus stop.              We waited about twenty

  minutes and we then caught a normal service bus to the ground.                        We

  arrived at the ground about twelve oclock at the Spion Kop end.                         We

  all then walked around the ground looking for someone to buy a ticket

  off.     At First we couldn't find any body to get a ticket off.                     I left

           and            at the Spion Kop end and I walked back around to the

  Leppings Lane End.          I went back behind the North Stand towards the

  Liverpool        end.   It was behind the stand I brought a ticket for £5
                                                                          PAGE


^ o m    another fan.   The ticket was for the Leppings Lane standing

 area.     The time now was about two oclock and there were a lot of fans

 about.     I walked back towards     the Spion Kop to see my mates.     It was

 not until    I reached the road that I had any trouble getting through

 the crowds.     The only trouble then was getting through the queues

 that had formed.       I did not see many Policemen because there were so

 many supporters around.      I couldn't see my two mates so I decided to

 walk back to the Liverpool end.         I walked back behind the South

 stand.     Some Forest supporters started shouting at me so I ran off

 towards the Leppings Lane End.         When I got there I saw just one mass

 of people    just getting crushed.     They were all trying to get into the

 turnstiles.     I though I'm not waiting in this and I went      to the left

 of the turnstiles and stood back.        There were thousands   there just

 packed together and getting crushed.         There were police on the

 turnstiles as far as I could see.        There were also two mounted

 Policemen in the crowd trying to control        the crowd but they couldn't

 It was all totally out of hand.         I saw some policeman on foot

 also trying toget through the crowd but they c o u l d n ’t.    I cannot

 remember how many Policeman there were.         I saw some fans climbing the

 wall and railings on the left of the turnstiles and I heard someone

 shouting from behind for them to get back over.         The one's climbing

 overtook no notice.      When one got over all the fans started clapping

 them.     I then walked behind this mass of people and went to the

 rightside of the turnstiles.         The time roughley was between two

 thirty and a quarter     to three.     I was standing directly opposite

 these big blue gates which folded back.         Suddenly these gates opened,

 I think I saw a steward open them,       he had an yellow mac on and there

 was a Policeman with him.      I took a fast walk over to these open

 gates.     I can remember other people running past me to get in through
                                                                                    PAGE



      gates.    As I went through the gates no-one asked me for my ticket

at all.     By this time there were loads of people going through the

gate.     I was still walking fast and I could see the t u n n e l 1.            Th e re

were quite a few people running towards the tunnel.                    No one was

giving directions and I did not see any signs showing us where to

go.     I did not see any Policemen or Stewards around at all.                 When I

went through the tunnel there was a crowd of people who went with

me.     There was no pushing just a mad rush to get in the ground.                    I

think I was o n e o f    the fiTst through the tunnel.              As I reached the

pens there was no — one giving any directions              to us.     I went into Pen 3

and made my way        towards the front and I stood about two             foot from the

pitch fence.       I   cannot remember how far I was away from             the deviding

fence between pens 3 and 4.           The crowd was a bit tight but with

pushing I could        get through.     I was not standing anywhere near a

bdrrisr.       I was   just standing on the concrete steps.            X   saw that both

teams were on the pitch warming up.                 Both teams had their track suits

on.     I then noticed that everyone was getting packed tighter

together.       It just got worse all the time.            I was now getting pushed

towards the fence.        There were lots of other people in front of me

and I was having great differculty in breathing.                    I put my left hand

out onto the pitch fence.          I started to push backwards but the

crushing got worse,       it w o u l d n ’t stop.     I could feel people pushing me

in the back of the neck and I was still getting pushed forward.                       As I

was being pushed forward I bit           another mans arm.          I also saw that my

left arm and hand        was swelling up and going purple,            I was still

pushing against the fence.            In front of me there was a man and

woman.     I have now seen this man and woman again on the front page of

 the Daily       Mirror, dated 170489 and the Sunday Echo dated 160489.                   By

now I was       getting crushed from my right hand side and this was

pushing me towards pen 4.          The pushing carried on and I saw a little

lad standing on my right next to me.             He was saying       'Help m e . ’    I

couldn't because        I couldn't move due to the crushing.            The little        lad

was about twelve.        He had blonde hair.       He had a jumper on and I cann'

t remember anything else.          I could feel something on the concrete

around my legs.         I tried to climb up the railings but I c o u l d n ’t

move.     I said to     a man   'We are going to d i e . ’    I c o u l d n ’t breath.      I

was right up against the pitch fence.             I was still getting pushed

between the crowd and the fence.            I was being pushed still towards

Pen 4.      I was almost pushed onto the deviding fence the crush got

less.     I started to walk along the dividing fence back towards the

tunnel.     Before the tunnel I was stopped again because of some more

crushing in front of me.          I looked around and saw bodies of people

lying around mostl y in front of the pitch fence.                 I d o n ’t know if

they were dying they were         just lying there.          I cann't remember how

many there were.       The crush stopped in front of me and I carried on

into the tunnel.       I saw people standing against the walls.                 It was

easy to get through.        I saw no-one lying on the floor.               I was helped

by another Liverpool supporter to get to the first aid room.                      After I

    left the tunnel   I fainted and the next thing I knew I was              in the

Northern General Hospital.           I remember w ak ing up in the ambulance

    just as we left the ground and seeing Liverpool supporters all

    running into a field.

    I went to the same game last year and liverpool supporters were in

    the Leppings Lane End the same as this year.              Last year we were made

    to queue to go through the turnstiles by the Police.                This year there

was none of that.        After we got in there there was no-one to say

    where to go and anyone to give us directions.              It was very poorly

    organised outside and inside.        I saw no-one drunk or anyone drinking

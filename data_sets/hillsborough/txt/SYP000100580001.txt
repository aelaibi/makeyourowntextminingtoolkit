        a    number       of       CID    officers,                who                     were                    to       work              under       the       direct         control              of

        At    9.45am          (0945)          that       same          day                         I attended                                the    Sheffield             Wednesday

        Football          Ground          and       together                        with                          other               officers            I was       briefed            in

        At    11.30am          (1130)          that          same             day,                            I    commenced                       observations                regarding

        the       pickpockets             in       the       Leppings                                    Lane           turnstile                    area       along          with      Det.

        also       operating             in    that          area,                   those                         officers                    being       Det.       Sgt.        Smith,

        At    that       time       our       brief          was       to                   identify                              travelling               pickpockets                  and        if

        Due       to    this       Det.       Con.       Hallam                     was                       in       possession                    of    a    wallet          alarm,             and

        the       remainder          of       the    team          were                            to             be    in a                 position          in    order         to

        On    taking          up    our       positions                 in                  the                   area            of         the    Leppings          Lane         turnstile

        and       paddock          area,       the       area          was                         very                quiet                 and    the    crowd          being         sparse.

Uniform        Officers          were       on       duty       in       that       area,       officers          were           at       each

turnstile           entrance          g a t e , and         officers               were        on    duty    at       a       t a r r 1 cade      on

the     driveway          to    the       rear       of    the       South          stand.

Further        officers          were       on       duty       as       a    coach       reception           party             in    the       area

immediately           in       front       of    the       turnstiles.                    It    appeared          at          that        time    the

number        of    uniformed             Police          officers             was    in       the    region          of       40.

At     this    time       the    crowd          which       had          started          to    gather       was          mixed           with

many     families          being          present.          The          behaviour             of    the    fans          was        good

humoured.

As     the    afternoon          wore       on       the    crowd             steadily          built       up    and          the        mood

became        fairly       hostile,             because             numerous          fans          were    milling              around

without        tickets,          at       this       time       I    lost          count       of    the    number             of     peole       who

approached           me    and       asked       whether             I had          either          tickets       to          sell        or    just

spare.

I    personally           saw    a    number          of    men          selling          tickets          with       large           g r o u p s of

people        stood       around          them,       who       were          obviously              trying       to b u y          tickets

■for    the    game.           Due    to    this          the       area       around          the    corner          shop           which       is

directly           adjacent          to    the       football                stadium       became          particularly

congested.

The     vehicular          traffic          along          Leppings                Lane    itself          appeared              to       grind       to

a    halt,     with       the    odd       vehicle          passing,                although          it    should             be     said       that

numerous           coaches       and       Public          Service             Vehicles             came    along             that        road

under        Police       motorcycle             escort             to       the    reception          area.

The     uniformed          officers             in    that           location         attended              those vehicles                     and     a

search        of    persons          leaving          the       vehicles             was       undertaken.

I    recall        seeing       two       coaches          arrive             at    the    same       time,       two          officers

approached           one       vehicle          and       the       remainder             of    the    serial             6    or     8

officers           approached             the    other          vehicle.              I    recall          thinking              that          there

was     less       officers          in    that       area,          than          there       had    been       in       previous

years.         However          I must          say       that       I had          several          arrests          take           place
                                                                                                                                        PAGE            3
                                                                                                                                        R 180

and    believe          that       this          may     have       drawn       strength             a w a y .from         the    reception

party.

At    this    time       there          were        no      problems           and    no       real       cause    for          concern

involving          public          disorder.

It    should       be     pointed            out       that        Mounted          officers          were       operating             in    the

Leppings          Lane       turnstile              and       paddock          area,       the       number       of       officers

being       two    sergeants,                one       of     those       being       a    South          Yorkshire             Officer,

four    Police          Constables,                 two       of    those       being          male       Merseyside             officers.

The    Merseyside                officers           operating             in    the       area       directly          in       front       of

the    Paddock          and       turnstiles.

At    around       1.15pm          <1315)           together             with       the    other          members          of    the

Pickpocket          Team,          I walked              along          Leppings          Lane,       due    to    reports             of

pickpockets             operating                further           along       the    road,          at    this    time          numerous

people       just       hanging          about,             sat     on    the       pavement          leaning          against          the

walls,       sat    on       the       parapet           of    the       bridges,          many       of    these          people       were

drinking          from       cans       and       bottles           of    assorted             intoxicants.

I    even    recall          seeing          a    very        attractive             young          lady    with       two       friends,

drinking          from       cans       of       lager.            In    the    space          of    approximately                half       an

hour    I    saw    this               one       girl o p e n      and drink          four          cans    of    lager.

At    around       1.30pm          <1330),               together with               Det.Con.          Hallam       and          remainder

of    team,       I walked             down       Leppings              Lane    in    the       direction          of       the

roundabout,             theo b s e r v a t i o n s            went        as    far       as    the        chip shop            situated          at

the    junction          of         Leppings Lane                  and B i c k e r t o n        Road,        at this            location          we

loitered.           The          crowd       at     this       time       was       quite       dense,       still          numerous             fans

approaching             people          including              myself          and    asking          to    buy    tickets,             many

of    the    fans       in       the    area        the       worse       for       drink,          quite    a    lot       of    litter

mainly       beer       cans.

Whilst       walking             back    to        the      original           observation                area    in       front       of    the

Paddock       area,          I    identified                one     particular             fan       as    being       a    ticket          tout,

I approached             him,          enquired             how     much       he    was       selling       the       tickets          at       to
                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                       R 180

which       he    replied          thirty          pounds.           I immediately                approached             Inspector

Sykes       and       informed          him    of       the    situation.                 I believe          that       that       fnan w a s

arrested.

Due    to    the       density          of    the       crowd,       observations                regarding          pickpockets

becamse          centred          around       the       area       immediately             in    front       of    the       metal

fencing          in    front       of    the       Paddock          turnstile             area.        The    observations

team    loitering                around       the       corner       shop       and       the    entrances          to       both       the

North       stand          and    the    Leppings             Lane       end    standing          entrances.

Whilst       at       this       location          I    recall       moving          numerous          bottles          of    both

alcohol          and       soft    drinks          which       had       been    discarded             underneath             the

fencing          and       behind       in    order          that    they       would       be    out    of    harms          way.

The    Merseyside                Mounted       officers             together          with       one    South       Yorkshire

officer          (female)          were       constantly             moving          the    crowd       on    who       were       just

standing          about,          these       people          obviously          had       no    tickets.           This          was

interferring                with    the       operation             to    catch       offenders          so    much          so    that

several          likely          suspects          were       moved       on    by    the       officers.

At    H.HOpm          (1420)       or    thereabouts                the    crowd          became       very    dense,             so    much

so    that       the       observations                team    including             myself       was    forced          to       move     out

from    the       area       adjacent          to       the    metal       fencing          to    an    area       of    relative

calm    beneath             the    signs       on       the    metal       fencing          further          along       towards           the

entrances             to    the    West       stand.

Whilst       at       that       location          repeatedly             asked       for       spare    tickets             or    tickets

for    sale,          those       persons          obviously             now    getting          very    worried             about

seeing       the       football          match,          the       majority          of    those       persons          having

enquired          about          tickets,          moved       into       the    paddock          area       and    towards

turnstiles             which       by    now       had       large       queues.

At    the    present             location          I    liaised          with    Det.       Sgt.       McSloy,          who       reported

seeing       an       Asian       wearing          glasses          and    sheepskin             coat    plus       one       other,

constantly             moving       in       and       out    of    queues       in       the    paddock       area.              It

appeared          that       these       men       were       pickpockets,                the    two    men    had       disappeared

                                                                                                                                          R180

from       view       having          come       out       of    the       paddock       area,          therefore             it    was

suggested             that       the       entire          pickpocket             team       would       split          up    and       search

for    the       two    males.

Det,       Sgt.       McSloy,          DCs       Locking             and    Askew       moved          off    from       the       area       which

we    had       now    taken          up,    which             was    directly          adjacent             to    the       roadway          and

is    on    a    lip    which          affords             a    view       which    is       slightly             elevated          and       looks

down       on    the    heads          on    the       persons             queueing          to    gain       entrance             to    the

football          stadium.

After       a    short          time,       the       entire          observation             team       re-joined             in       the

aforementioned                   area,       the       crowd          at    this    time          now    being          very       dense       and

it    seemed          that       from       the       area       near       to    the    shop          some       considerable

distance          away          right       up    to       the       ground       was    totally             blocked          by    people

moving          towards          the       ground.              By    this       time    vehicular                traffic          had    ceased

and    the       entire          carriageway                   was    blocked       by       people.

Whilst          stood       with       DCs       Hallam          and       Lilley       and       looking          down       into       the

paddock          area       which          was    now          totally       full       with       people          and       still       more

walking          towards             the    ground,             I saw       groups       of       young       men       pushing          into

the    crowd,          the       majority             of       these       being    the       worse          for       drink,       I    saw

several          carrying             and    drinking                from    large       2    litre          bottles          of    both

lager       and       beer.

At    this       time       I    noted       that          the       Police       horses          were       moving          amongst          the

dense       crowd       in       front       of       the       paddock          area    to       alleviate             the    situation.

My    impression                of    the    situation                was    that       the       crowd       was       becoming

desperate             due       to    having          no       tickets       and    with          no    hope       of    getting

tickets,          also          the    fact       that          the    ones       who    had       tickets             would       miss       the

start       of    the       game       due       to    large          amount       of    people          trying          to    gain       entry

to    the       stadium.

I    cannot       recall             the    time,          but       whilst       stood       at       this       location          a    Police

Landrover             came       along       the       Leppings             Lane,       with       blue       light          and    two       tone

horns       operating,                the    vehicle             stopped          near       to    where          we    were       stood.
                                                                                                                                        PAGE         6
                                                                                                                                        R 180

I    looked       JaQ.Vh d o w n     and       up    Leppings             Lane        and       the    area       was       totally

blocked          in    both    directions                with       people           moving          towards       the       football

ground.

I was       now       stood    to    one       side          of    the    Landrover              with       DCs    Hallam          and

Lilley,          and    whilst       there          we       were     joined          by    a    uniform          Inspector,

identity          unknown.

PC    Buxton          the    driver       of    the          vehicle,           alighted             and    stood       on    the       body

of    the       vehicle       and    whilst          doing          so    he     was       using       the    vehicles             PA

system,          repeatedly          stating             ’P l e a s e     stop        pushing          there       are       people       at

the    front          being    c r u s h e d ’.          I noted          several           large          groups       of    young

Liverpool             fans,    who       were       pushing           into       the       crowd       and    making          some

headway          towards       the       turnstiles,                these        fans       pushing          others          out    of    the

way.

I    spoke       to    several       fans       saying             ' D o n ’t    go       forward,          stay    back’.              Many

ignored          this.

At    this       point       I saw       several             people       climbing              on    the    fences          around       t he

paddock          area.        Once       climbing             into       that        position          those       people          were       then

helping          others       up    onto       the       fence        tops.           I then          saw    one    fan       climb       over

into       the    actual       ground,          he       was       then       followed           by    others,          I    then       saw

Inspector             Bennett       appear          on       the    roof        of    the       turnstile          area.           I saw

the    officer          assist       several             fans       to    climb           into       the    ground          area.

It    was       obvious       at    this       stage          that       many        people          were    being          crushed       at

the    turnstiles,             people          were          not    moving           through          the    actual          turnstiles

and    I    recall          thinking       that          I    couldn't           see       any       Police       helmets          at    the

turnstiles.

Both       PC    Buxton       and    the       unknown             uniform           Inspector             were    now       using       the

PA    system,          repeatedly          asking             the     crowd          to    stop       pushing       and       that       there

was    people          being       crushed.              I    recall          one     of    the       officers          stating          that

game       was    going       to    be    delayed.                 The    people           still       approaching             the

ground          and    turnstiles          were          taking          no     notice          whatsoever          and       were
                                                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                                                              R180

continuing             to       push       forward.

The      Mounted           officers             strength           had    been       increased,                   and       saw    that       those

officers          were          attempting             to    get     nearer          the       turnstiles                   to    enable

people       to       gain       entry          to    the     ground.           Still          no    one          taking          any       notice

and      still        more       people          pushing           forward.           At       this          time       there          was    no

other       obvious             Police          manpower           deployed          in    that          area.

I    observed          the       Police          Mounted           Inspector,             obviously                shouting             at    the

crowd,       I noted             that       his       horse        seemed       to    be       going          under          due       to    the

people       pushing             against             it,the        front    of       the       horse          started             to    rise       with

the      rear     end       disappering                from        view,    it       appeared                that       the       officer          was

falling          backwards,                however,          somehow        he       regained                his       footing.

The      mood     of       the       crowd       was       now     very    desperate                and       becoming             more       and

m o re    hostile.

The      anger        of    the       crowd          now    being        directed          at       the       uniformed                officers

present,          I noted             several          people        coming          towards             both          PC   Buxton           and    the

Inspector,             pushing             at    those       officers,           saying             do       something,                stop    the

pushing,          some          of    these          men    were     crying          in    what          I    believe             was

frustration                at    the       situation.

PC    Buxton          who       was    continually                 using    the       PA       system             then       directed          the

Mounted          officers             to    form       a    line     in    front          of    the          Paddock             area,        this

was      partially              successful,                five     Police       horses             completing                   the    line,

however          as    the       crowd          pushed       forward        the       horses             were          pushed          towards

the      ground.

PC    Buxton          still          attempting             'to    reassure          the       crowd          stating             that       they

would       all       get       in    and       to    stop        pushing.

I    recall       seeing             Inspector             Bennett        who    was       still             on    the       roof       of    the

turnstiles             and       was       still       pulling           people       onto          the       roof.

By    now    I    couldn't             actually             see     the    turnstiles                due          to    the       vast       sea    of

people       and       still          no    sign       of    Police        helmets.                 PC       Buxton          still

attempting             to       reassure             the    crowd.

Whilst      s tood at tha t           l o c a t i o n a large         roar     from w i t h i n       the       ground,           it

appeared        to me       that     the       football       teams    had     come      onto       the    pitch,           this

being     around 2.55pm              (1455)        the m ood of the            crowd         being    d e sperate,

more     and more        fans       pushing        forward,       still       many      carrying          b oth      cans and

bottles        of drink.

Together        with     the     other         o f f icers    of the       observation             team    knowing           that

we    c o u ldn't      help    the    situation            I moved     off     down Vere Road.

Whilst      walking         down     that       road another          large       roar       from w i t h i n        the

g r o u n d was     heard.          I n oted       that      football       fans     were      running          up that

r oad    in the        direction          of    the L e p p i n g s   Lane     end,      those       fans       obviously

coming      from L i v e r p o o l .

Having      walked       down       that       road and       into P e n i s t o n e     Road,       I noted          that

t here was        very few          spectators          in that area,             together         with        the    other

officers        I then w ent          into       the    gym.

At    3.05pm      (1505)       or    thereabouts             whilst    in the        gym having            meal,

i n f o r m a t i o n was     received          that    the    crowd was          on the        pitch an d           that        all

available         uniform       p e r sonnel         to a t t e n d   that     area.          Together          with        both

D C ’s L o c k i n g    and A s k e w      left      the     gym and       took    up a       p o s i t i o n near          to

the     entra n c e     to the       pitch,        however,       hav i n g    been      there       only a short

time,     together          with     the       other    o f f icers    I was       instructed             to    return           to

the     gym to await           casualties.

Whilst      in the       gym     I was         i n f o r m e d that   there       had    been deaths              in the

g r o u n d an d was        tol d    to    clear       the    gym by C h i e f       I n s pector         Beal       an d    to

make     it ready        to    rece i v e       corpses.

The     bodies      then      began       to a r r i v e     within    the     gym,      the       first       person

having      been       carr i e d    into that a r e a was             thou g h t       to    be dead h o w e v e r              it

was     found     that      he w a s n ' t      dead an d t h e r e f o r e       was m o v e d      to one          side.

The     area    within        the    gym was         now     ready    to    receive          the    bodies        ana       those

that     were     brought        in were         blue      in the     face,       many       obviously          dead,        some

of w h i c h were        still       being a t t e n d e d       by first         aid    personnel.               I noted
that     several        of    the    bodies       (deceased)       had v o m i t t e d and          so i l e d

themselves           and     I recall       seeing     one w h i c h had blood              coming        from his

head body orifices

All    the     d e c e a s e d w h i c h were      brought       into    the    gym were a c c o m p a n i e d              by

Police       officers,         some       being    carried       in on m a k e s h i f t      stretchers              and

others a c t u a l l y        being       carried.        I recall       seeing       one     female       Police

officer       and some         spectators          struggling        wit h     the    body of a small                     ycung

male,      I went       to her a s s i s t a n c e and took             hold of the           boy and          carriea

him    into        the m ain      hall     and    placed him on the floor along                          with     the

many others,            the    female       officer       then stayed wit h             the    deceased.

Many     of the        bodies       I saw obv i o u s l y had        broken          limbs and m a n y were               in

some     form of        state       of    undress.

Together           w i t h other     offic ers mainly C I D F1               personnel,         I m o v e d amongst

the bodies and P o l i c e                officers,       i nstructing         the    o f f icers        to stay with

the d e c e a s e d and        to make a brief               description        of the        body and           to

search the           body for        both    personal        effects and             identification,                  I

h anded the          officers        plastic       bags and       labels.

Having       c o m pleted      this       task,    a gain t o g ether        with     other FI           CID

personnel,           I searched           several     bodies      placed them           into body          bags,

making       sure      that    the       head was    the first          thing    to be seen once                  the bag

was    opened,         the    bodies       were    then      lined up     in rows        of twelve,              the

at t e n d i n g    o f f icers     were a g a i n    i n structed       to stay w i t h the              deceased.

I cannot           recall     the    time    but     it was     some     considerable           time       later

certainly after               si;-; o'clock        CiSOQ),      I was     instructed           to    convey           the

very dist r a u g h t         rel a t i v e s and friends          of    the    deceased        to H a m m e r t o n

Roa d Po l i c e S t a tion,             I did this       by using a         coach an d t o g e t h e r           with

other      officers,          D.Insp.       Towe 11 and DC Locking,                  on arrival           at

H a m m e r t o n Road P o l i c e       S t a t i o n the    r e l atives     were a s k e d       to    remain           in

the    care        of the social           services who were             by now       in the H i l l s b o r o u g h

Boys Club.

From that time until 8.00pm (2000) on Friday, 21st April, 1989

(210489) I was a member of the Exhibits Team under the direction of

Det. Sgt. McSloy dealing with all the personal effects clothing and

other exhibits, at that time state the entire exhibit side of

disaster was handed over to the West Midlands Police enquiry team.

With regard to the day of the disaster I cannot recall the time of

the turnstile being opened but I recall being told that the gates

would be open at 12 noon in order for spectators to gain entry to the

ground.

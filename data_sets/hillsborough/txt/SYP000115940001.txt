                  presently             stationed             at    Rotherham.

                 On     Saturday,             15 A p r i l         1989    (150489)       I   commenced            duty    at    Sam     (0800)       at

                 Rotherham              for    duties          in    connection          with      the Semi         Final        to be    held       at

                 Hillsborough,                     I was       to    supervise         traffic       routes         from     the s o u t h    via

                  the       M1    to    Sheffield.

                  I    can       say    that       all    Traffic          officers       deployed         on      that    day    on     mobile

■C\ yf/ J \ . f o a t r o l       did    so    in       road       patrol       cars   equipped       with         Burndept       VHF     multi

                  I am       also       able       to    say       that    all    Road    Traffic motor             cyclists         used

                 machines              equipped          with       VHF    radios.

                 All        VHF    radio       c o m m u n i ct i o n s     for    football         traffic         were    directed         on

                 Force           Channel       1 by       the       Force       Operations         Room.

                 sets.            These       sets       could       be    programmed         to    pick      up    Ground       C o n t r o l but

                 normally              are    used       to    relay       VHF    signals       f r o m the     car      when     officers           are

                 away        from       the    vehicle.

                 No     instructions                were       given       to    programme         the rep eater           sets     to   Ground

                 Control           frequency             on    15    April       (150489).

HAROLD CAWTHORNE
ACTING CHIEF INSPECTOR
ROTHERHAM ROAD TRAFFIC DIVISION


I am an Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police Road Traffic
Division presently stationed at Rotherham.
On Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at 8am at Rotherham
for duties in connection with the Semi Final to be held at
Hillsborough.    I was to supervise traffic routes from the
south via the Ml to Sheffield.
I can say that all Traffic officers deployed on that day on
mobile patrol did so in road patrol cars equipped with
Burndept VHF multi channel sets.
I am also able to say that all Road Traffic motor cyclists
used machines equipped with VHF r a d i o s .
All VHF radio communications for football traffic were directed
on Force Channel 1 by the Force Operations Room.
In addition:-..- the majority of Traffic patrol cars had hand
held repeater sets.     These sets could be programmed to pick
up Ground Control but normally are used to relay VHF signals
from the car when officers are away from the vehicle.
No instructions were given to programme the repeater sets to
Ground Control frequency on 15 April.




Acting Chief Inspector Cawthorne

    The  t h i n g t h at i m m e d i a t e l y t ook m y a t t e n t i o n at this t i m e was                                 two

    complaining              of    crushing.              I also       noticed          t hat    the     left    hand         s ide

    terrace       and        the    right       hand       side       terrace        stil l      had what        appeared             to be

    From    ITh   s     time       on,    the       crushing          got     worse       w i t h all     number         of    people

    crying       out,Nfor          help    (ie,       Save       my    son,       s ave    my    girlfriend,             help     us,       get

    us    Q u t f etc,        etc).        The       pressure          got       worse     after        the    game      kicked        off.

    I have       been        to    the    Sheffield Wednesday Football                                ground     on      odd

    occasions           to    do    football          duty and             there     have       been     big    crowds         but     I ’ve

    never       seen     this       sort       of    trouble          before .




    It was        horrific.              The    Liverpool             fans       were     crushing        and    killing          their

    own    supporters.               The       supporters             were       that     tightly        packed         together

    there       was     no w a y     they       c o u l d move,            p a r t i c u l a r l y at    the    front.




    Obviously           the       fences       were       solid and           the    two      gates     at     either         s ide    of

    the    centre        standing          terrace          was       the     only      exits        available          other     than

    possibly           getting       them       o ver      the    top       of    the     fence.




    All'Njur S e r i a l           worked       like       trojans.              What     each       individual          Officer        did

    specifically              I can't          fully       say,       other       than     to    im m e d i a t e l y    get    the     two

                                                                                c J 3l A t
initially          I went          to    the    right1 h a n d      gate        looking        towards           Leppings          Ln

end.        I was       stood       j ust      inside     the      g ate    with       one     leg       on the        steps       and

one    leg    on t h k f e n c e          dividing        the      centre and           right        terraces.               I was

pulling       and       liftrftg         fans     up a n d    over       the     fence        from       the     severe

crushing          at    this       corner                                                            p   zv )     JET




After       a while          and    in the        panic,      I was        pulled       to     the       floor,        a drop       of

about       three       feet,       by a d e s p e r a t e        fan.      I managed           to       get     up a n d     get       out

onto    the       pitch,        having         assisted       the    fan who           had     p u l l e d me         down and

whom    I had fallen                on.        I think       he    h urt    his       back.       I had          by    now    been

replaced          by a n o t h e r       police       Officer       doing        the    same      job.




I then went             to a s s i s t     -at the othe>\ g a t e at the left h a n d s i d e of the
                                           \<0'y-v         \
goal.        In    particular             Sg'fryHOWARD, P Cs xj^ASQN a n a N A K R E D w e r e the re,

possibly          others,          but    they     were      the    ones        I bring        to mind.




At    this    gate       it was          like     "Hysell"         stadium,           bodies      on to p               bodies

believed          dead and/or             injured.           Liverpool           fans     were       climbing           o ver      the

top    of    them.




From    the       level       of    the     top    of the         steps     at     this       poi n t     is a d r o p        to    the

terrace       level          below.         Consequently,            the        t o r s o ’s of      the        bottom       bodies

were    laid       on    the       top    step and        their       legs       hanging         down      to     the    terrace

and    because          of    the       severe     crushing,         the        legs    were      trapped,            making        it

almost       impossible             to    pull     them      out.




Fans    in s h e e r         pan i c m a d e      the   situation almost                     impossible           for    the

Police.           Some       were       obviously       drunk       and     very       abusive.            Some        were

lashing       out       and     hitting         us.     Some       had     to    be    forcibly           d r a g g e d a w ay,

                                                                                                                                                S3331

               whilst       the      good       fans     took       them     off      us    behind         the     goals         and    sorted          them

               out.       These          were    the     f ans      who     were      hindering            us     trying         to    get     f an s    out.




               I remember            thinking           that,,      that     many        bodies       were        pulled         out,    t hat      it

               was    difficult            to    find a Npa tc h            of    green        grass       behind          the    goal, to        lay

               the    bodies         down.           Qt he r \0f isj. cers        there        at    this       point       took       o ver    from       us

, ___ ,ryi . D o i n g    what       I h ave         described         was       d one     until      the       terrace          in    the     centre

               was    relieved            of    pressure,           have     received           help       from      the     emergency

               services.             A    couple        of    the    front        fences        were       open.           How,       I d o n ’t know.




               Some      Liverpool             fan s    were     hysterical              and    difficult,             probably

               understandably                  so,     but    it d i d n ’t h e l p         the      situation.




               Eventually            by the          tim e    most     of    the      bodies        were        either       taken away            or

               being      seen       to    on the        pitch       by o t h e r        Officers          and     volunteers,               we w e r e

               as    a Serial            led a w a y     to    behind        the      stand         near    the      gym.




               We    then      h a d a hot           drink     and     eventually taken                    to C i a y w h e e l s       Ln and

               taken      b a ck     to £31,         going     off     d u t y at        1830       hours       that       day.



               In    conclusion,               I would        like     to    say      that      I have          n e ve r    seen       such     p a ni c

               by f o o t b a l l        supporters           in m y      life.       Some      had    had       beer,       s ome      fought          with

               us a n d     s ome        some    fans        like    other Police               Officers           deserve            a medal

               for    the      way       they    helped        under        such a horrific                 and      distressing

               s ituation.




               The    f an s    behind          the     goal     were       the i r      ow n w o r s e     enemies,             crushing

               forward         so    blatantly           irresponsibly.

             I was    terribly       distressed           at   what      I saw a n d     it hurt       like    blood    hell       to

             see    children,       girls,      boys,      men    and women        dying       in f r ont     of me    without

             being    able    to    do a n y t h i n g    that    would      immediately         relieve       the    situation.




             All    our   Serial     were     very       upset    and     showed    emotion        in t h e i r   o w n ways.

             I physically          broken     down when          I got     home    and   saw my wife a nd             daughter

             and    I ’m not a s h a m e d    of   it.




             The    memory    of w h a t     I had       s e e n w ill    s t a y w i t h me    for    the    rest    of my

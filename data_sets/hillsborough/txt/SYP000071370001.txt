                 the    tunnel.         He was          behaving           n o r m a l l y and d i d n ’t appear aware              of

                 problems at           the    turnstiles.                  We   retained      our       tickets we went            to the

                 tunnel       and     I saw a S te w a r d at the e n t r a n c e                  to    it standing            to one side.,

                 the    pitch above           the heads           of these           infront.           About    half way down there

                 my    head     up to get          fresh air and                I was      occasionally          l ifted/from my

                 feet.        I vivi d l y     remember           seeing a St Johns A m b u l a n c e main standing at

                 the    perimeter         fence         in front           of the     tunnel       s h o uting a t     people       to go

                 back.        This must        have       been about 2 . 5 0 p m             but    I am n o w sure of the time.

           As we     exited from the tunnel                    we went yto the           right     but   I wasn't       really

           in control         of where          I was     going.        i f could influence dir e c t i o n of

           travel         in a very      limited way.             At/ this      point     I saw a friend

                     making        his way from           the f/ont          to the    back      by forcing      his way

           through.         He was       v is ib ly     pa ke /    He    told us to go to the back as                    the

           crush at the front was                   too much.           We    forced     our way back and felt                our

           backs     up a ga i n s t a barrier.                I saw ypeople          be i ng    lifted up to the          stand

h/fef      a b o v e and     1 got a       'leg up"        from               and   someone       else   pulled me

           up.     I i mm ed i a t e l y    looked d o w n / a n d helped                       up as he had         climbed up

           onto    the      side    fence       furthe^sL/from the             tunnel     in pen 3.        We    then

           assisted                  u p. Wh en     I looked back             down to     the terrace       I saw bodiei

           piled on top of each other                      in the middle a n d            to the/right          of    pen 3

           F r o m then on avid others                  in the stand became              very. e/riotijonal shouting

           for    people      to help.            The   extent      of the      problem sank A n .

           On the         perimeter      fence      I saw four          supporters        pulling on the fence                of

f£ N C £   pen 3 from the            pitch        side and some          officers        earner to assist        them.        Some

           of f icers       however      were      just    standing          doing     noth/ng.

           I saw members            of    the     press    standing          taking^ pictures        and making         people

           angry.         T hey should have             been m o v e d       away.

           At    that      point    I just        sat   down      in the      stand.      I couldn't take anymore.

                                         went      back
                                                     L ater

                                                             I and
                                                               the terrace              to find friends              and spoke

           to some.          We a 11 met          up outside and ciiscovered that

           was    missing.         S om e o n e    said he has gone             down     in the     crush and we

           discovered         he was       in one       of the hospitals.

           I am not able           to say how the bodies                     became    piled up on top of each

           other     but think           it may have        been     caused by the              pressure and         something

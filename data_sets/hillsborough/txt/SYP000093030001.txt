We     walked          al-ong         the    main       road     towards             the       ground          where          there       were        a

the     Police          who       complied          with        the       request             of    the      Police           ana       either-

It     took       us    about          ten    minutes           to    walk          to    the       ground          and arrived                in     the

being        pushed          towards           my       right          hand       side,       towards          the       driveway          in

between           the       ground       and        the       river.




There        was       a    lot    of     pushing

movement              of    people        towards             the \ i g h t .            As     I was         being       gradually             moved

to     my    r i ght7 X became                  aware             of    a               concertina             gate       at    th e      side    of

the     turnstile                block.




When        I first          saw    the        concertina                   gate,       it w a s      closed         and       there       were       a

couple        of       stewards          and        a    couple             of    Policemen           standing            outside          it-        I

was     getting             nearer        to    tne          t u r n s t i l e s , but         still          to    the    right          of    the

block;        about          four       to\five              feet       away       from       the     concertina               gate,       when       I

saw     the       gate       b e i ng     opened*

although              I could       not        hear          what       was       being       saidt.          As    soon       as    the       gate

"was    opened?             the    Policeman                 said       to       the    people        outside            the    gate,          words

I did          not    witness           any    unauthorised                   entry       into    the       ground




After          entering        the       ground,           it      was    my       intention          to    go    to    the    left        hand

side       of    the       stand        to    watch        the      match          from    the    left       hand       side       of    the

match          from     that       side       and    was        aware         that       I could       go    around          the    left

hand       side       of     the     stand.           There         w e r e n ’t a n y      signs          actually          indicating

have.           At    the     corresponding                   reiatch l a s t        year?       there       were       stewards

  eeany          this        year.




It       was    very       busy      inside         the       ground          and    the    area       leading          to    the       left

hand       side       of     the     s'Cand w a s          crowded            with       people.           Because       of    this        X

decided          to     use    the       central           tunnel         that       runs       underneath             the    West       Stand-

X thought             that     by       using       th e      tunnel          to    get    to    the       terraces          I would           then

be       able    to m a k e        my    way    along           the      rear       of    the    terraces          to    get       to    the

left       hand       side.




F rom      the       time     that       X entered              the      ground          I did    not       witness          any

           the     surge       was       caused          by    the          rush          of    people          trying       to       get     to      the

           having        no    movement          at       all.              Even          though          I was       crushed          I was          still

           the     crowd       moved,       I had             to    go          with       them.           There       were       times          when          my    feet

           was     doubled          over    the          end       of       a    crush          barrier.              The    l a d w a s n ’t          behind

           horizontal              bar    running             across             his       chest          and    stomach.              He     was      side          on,

           facing        towards          the    North             Stand.                 The       lad    was    screaming                out       and       was

           obviously           in    great       pain.                  I saw             the       right       side    of       the       l a d ’s f a c e          and

           could        have       done    for       that          lad          and       he    had       no    chance       of       getting          away          from

    I would       estimate          that       the       barrier       that     the     lad was             doubled          over          was

    the    one    about       half       way       down    pan    Four        and    roughly           in    the       centre             of    the

    pen.     The       lad    was     doubled            over    the    end     of    the        barrier,          which          is

    may    have    been       that       he    died       or    perhaps        I put        t he    screams            out       of       my    mind

    heca.us e     there       were       so    many       other       people        screaming            all      around          me.

    carrying       me    forwards             down       the    pen.         1 was    moved         away        from      the         lad       and

    The    movement          of    the    crowd          carried       me     nearer        to     the      front       perimeter

*   fence    and       1 did       not    see       that       lad again.            I can         only      estimate             that          I

    saw    that    l a d at, s o m e          time       between       five     to    three          (1455)        and       three

        9clock    (1500).           I do       not       remember       the     game        starting            and     I have             no

    recollections             of    the       game       while    it    was     being        played.




    I    remember       screams          of    “open       the    gate?        open     the        g a t e 11     F rom      people             as

    I got    nearer          the    front          of    the    pen.




    1 eventually             got    to    a    position          towards        the     front          of    pen       four*              ihe

    position       was       about       four       to    five    feet        behind        the     front         perimeter                fence.

The    exit       gate       in    the       front          fence          was          to    my    right,          about        sin       to       seven

feet     away.          I have          marked          this          position                on    the     separate             grid          plan,

using       the    figure          one-




In    position          one       X was       standing                immediately                   behind          a    well        built          lad    and

the    pressure          from          behind          pinned             me    up       against          his       ba c k «         I started

having        problems            with       my    breathing                   as       my    breaths          became           shorter.              The

man    in     front      of       me    was       using             all    his          strength          to    try       and        ease       the

pressure          around          him.        As       he       did       so,       a    small       space          was        created          for       me

and    I was       able       to       draw       some          air.           This          man    constantly                 fought          to    ease

the    pressure          for       a    few       minutes             which             enabled          trie to        carry        on    breathing.

Suddenly          the    man       just       dropped                to    the          ground       and       I could           no       longer          see

him.        I could          then       feel       a    body          by m y            feet       which       may       have        been       that       man

or    possibly          somebody             else*              1    did       not       see       that    man          again        and       presume

                                         ground             below          me.           The       man    was       a    white        male          and

 ijoux      five     feet         ten    inches             in       height-                 He    was    very          well     built          with

broad       shoulders,             not       fat.           1 only             saw       the       man    from          the     r e a r 7 but         he

had    collar        length            light       coloured                hai r , p o s s i b l y             greying *              I think             he

was    bald       around          the    crown,                 I could             only          estimate          his        age    to       be    late

4 0 gs , e a r l y 5 0 9s -             He    wore          a       beige       c o loured           woollen             jumper,           the       Arran

sweater        type.          I don^t             know          if    he       wore          anything          under           the    jumper.,             I

did    not     see      anything             else       of          his    clothing.




fay n e x t    recollection                  is    being             held       by       a man       who       was       saying           to    me

was    holding          me    up       and    either                slapping             or       punching          my    back-            I asked

him    to     stop      because          it       was       hurting             my       back?       but       he       carried           on    saying          "

Shortly          after             this        I saw                                     on    the       track       on     the    other       side       of

then       pulled             me    osjt of            the        pen    through          a    hole       in    the       front        fence    where

the       mesh       had       been          rr&oed           away.           I have          marked       the       second        position          from

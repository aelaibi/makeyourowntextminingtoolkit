COST OF IMPLEMENTING LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
FOOTBALL GROUND IMPROVEMENTS

1.   The Minister will have seen articles in last Friday's press
(Flag A) about the cost of implementing Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations on- football ground improvements, and the League's,
possible approach to the Government to ask for the reduction in
Pool Betting Duty to be extended , from five, to ten yejars (the
proceeds of which ar£ passed to the Football Trust 1990 for grant
aid to the clubs towards ground improvements").   The Minister may
wish to know the fallowing which takes account of Treasury and
Home Office advice.                                     ■

Cost of implementing Taylor                       i                   ^      N

2.   The Minister will know from Mr Vaughan's general background
briefing of 24 July that Lord Justice Taylor's fingl report into
the iHillsborough Stadiumx disaster made     a large number pf
recommendations concerning football ground safety improvements.
The single most important recommendation was that ail-seating
should be introduced at all-“First and Second Division Football
League clubs by the start of the 1994/95 season and at all Thiird
and Fourth Division grounds by the start of the 1999/2000 season

3.   The League have now announced on the basis of a survey of
all clubs that they estimate it would cost:     ^     s'

     (i)      £313,956,000 to seat spectators         under   cover,      with
^             appropriate facilities;                    i

     (i i )   £665,828,000 to do all they would like to do in          order
              to implement Taylor;                                      x

j    (iii) £329,079,000 to implement their plans in the light of
           financial restraints.   , ' \

4.   The plan figure of /£329m is some £15m less than the £344m
required   to seat all spectators   under cover with appropriate
facilities   and     implement   Taylor1s  other   recommendations
(separately costed in the survey at £30m).      The League explain
this b y ‘ saying, that some clubs   will be   closing off   their
terracing, rather than providing new seating.      - >■

5.    Further details of the survey and a divisional breakdown are/
at Flag B.    We have asked for further information, particularly
of wt>at the clubs consider is required to implement Taylor, in
view of the very summary nature of this information the general
nature of t h e ,questions and the probable inconsistencies between
cliibs in how they have estimated these implementation costs. ,
Available finance
6.   The main   sources of finance to meet these; costs according
to the League are as follows:                            v

   <-      -*    £100m over 5 year's from the proceeds of the reduction
                  in Pool Betting Duty (other monifes available to the
                  Football   Trust   1990   from  the   Spotting-the-Ball
                 competition (£10m pa) have been excluded by the League
                 on -jthe grounds that they may be needed for non-Taylor
                   evenue purposes eg. police charges);;

                 unquantified sums from sponsorship deals, TV, income,
                 a possible levy on transfer fees, EC and Government
                 grancs   ana  from- clubs   own '"resources  including
                 increased seat prices and new marketing arrangements.

7.   When the ^League have a clearer idea 6f its own resources and
the Football Trust 1990 has clarified its grant aid policy on
implementing Taylor, Mr Sandford has indicated that he w i l l ,ask
the Government' for:               '       \

        (i)      an extension of the period of reduction in Pool
   ^       /     Betting Duty from 5 to 10 years.     He will argue that
                 the League and the Trust need/ to know whether this is
                 going to happen sooner, rather than, at the end of the
                 5 years, since it will affect how they allocate money
        ■ „ ■•   between the First-and Seqond Division vis a vis the
                 Third and Fourth Division clubs in vp.ew of the
            ~    differing-target dates for“ all-seating?

        (i i ) depending in part on the outcome of (i), putting back
               the timetable for implementing all-seating .

Line to Take              ,   \      V
8.    The £100 million over 5 years from the cut in Pool Betting
Duty is generous, and theChancellor made it clear in his Budget
statement that he would review the position after 5 years. But
Treasury Ministers always recognised that Football would also
have    to find a considerable amount of, cash from its         own
resources.    In this context it is very questionable whether it is
right for the League to exclude all of the proceeds from the
Spotting-the-Ball competition made available to the Truest (some
£10m p.a. Of which £7.5m the Trustees have said will be available
to help football).    Treasury Ministers have understood that some
at least of this money would also go on capital works for ground
improvements.     Any representations" from the League asking for
more, money would, of course, be considered by the Treasury in the
normal way; but it seems premature to be thinking’in these terms.
The Minister may agree that what is needed is for the League and
clubs to look positively over the coming months at ways          of
raising the extra finance they require including in the light of
the recent decision to.fincrease the size of the League.and hence
increase gate revenue.    : v              ^          v
 9.    Similarly the Home Office would need to be convinced r that
the League and Clubs had positively „ explored all sources of
 available finance and would no doubt also require independent
  dvice from the Football Licensing Authority}on its assessment of
what is feasible club by club before considering any , timetable
adjustments.     The League tends to forget /that football has
already been far more generously treated          by government in
assisting it in meeting necessary ground safety requirements than
,any other ^port.   Furthermore, although it might be difficult for
the Chancellor not to agree to extend the Pool Betting Duty
concession at the'; time) of the 5 year review          (given the
Government's commitment to implement, Taylor), to announce this
well in advance could weaken the^ pressure on football both -to
demonstrate that the monfey was ,being spent for the purpose for
which it had been intended and to find the additional resources
needed itself.                               '

the earlier League estimate of
£130 million was far too small.
      Following upon the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Enquiry
      by The Right Honourable Lord Justice Taylor, The Football
      League Limited carried out a survey of clubs with a view
      to obtaining the likely cost and methodology of
      implementing Lord Justice Taylor’s recommendations.


      This survey took the form of a Questionnaire sent to
      all clubs in the four divisions posing questions relevant
      to Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations. •


      The responses to these Questionnaires are the subject of
      this report.

                             X

THE QUESTIONS


1.    QUESTION ONE

      What is the minimum required to be done in order to
      accommodate (4th highest attendance figure 1989/90
      season) spectators in seats under cover with appropriate
      facilities.



      QUESTION TWO


     ■ What realistically would you like to do in order to
      implement the Taylor recommendations?



      QUESTION THREE


      What do you plan to do in the light of financial
      restraints upon you?
     OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS


     What are you required to do to implement the other Taylor
     recommendations (e.g. filling and monitoring terraces,
     crush barriers, stewarding, police facilities,
     communications, first aid, etc.) and what is the likely
     cost?




BASIS OP CALCULATIONS




1.   Where a club has given a range of costs for any
     particular option, the higher figure has been included in
     this report.



2.   Where a club has not provided a cost, an average figure
     from those who did supply costs has been included in
     order to arrive at a total cost for that Division.     One
     club in Division 1 put in a cost of £5 Ota and one club in
     Division 4 put in a cost of £80M, both for Option 1.
     Since these two estimates were so far out of line, they
     have been excluded from the figures which follow and an
     average cost for the Division concerned has been
     substituted for those two clubs.

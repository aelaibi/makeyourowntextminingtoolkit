            I live at the above address with my s istar

            I work as a                   at    the hotel                        whi ch is in

            S h e f f i e l d and have wor k e d there for just over                  two years.

            I am not a regular             football      supporter        but usually see about six

            matches a season at Hillsborough.                      I n or ma ll y go to the u ncovered

            are a of the S outh Stand.

            I was     employed at the hotel                               last year      prior to the semi

            final     match      between Liverpool         and N o t t i n g h a m Forest when the

            N o t t i n g h a m Forest   team came to visit and stay at the hotel.                       One   of

            the   non playing staff,             I think    his name        is                , had some    spare

            s eating         tickets   for the S ou t h Stand and through him I purchased

            a p p r o x i m a t e l y twelve   tickets    from him and di st ri bu te d them to my

  I went       to the match             in a taxi.         I d i d n ’t get          to the H i ll s bo r o u g h

  Football          ground until          about 2.43         pm    (1445).           The     taxi   took me along

  L ep pings Ln at this time and around                            into P en ni st on e Rd.             The taxi     had

  House,       in the Cross Pool             area of Sheffield,                  whi ch was         pre a r r a ng e d and

  met my two friends                                            /and

  I a r r i v e d at the S po r ts m an Publiyc H o u s e at                    '1.40 pm       (1340)    and saw that

  the     pub was      busy.        There were alot               of Liverpool             supportes     in the Tap

  Roo m    (bar)      w hich      is where     I went.            I had w al k ed through the               lounge

  looking       for rnv friends and had noticed that there were just                                        local

  people       in there.           I d i d n ’t see any N o tt i n g h a m bo rest fans                  in the     pub.

  I found my two friends                   in the Tap Room wit h                     he Liverpool        supporters.

  I stayed          in the     pub with my f r i ends until yabout 2.25                             pm (1425).      The

  L iv erpool        supporters,          about    forty in numlfer were singing and                          in high

spirits,        it was      like a carnival         a t mo sp he re    in the    pub but there was             no

violence        or disorder         just a friendly atmosphere.

W hen    I left the         pub with my two friends             there were still about                 thirty

supporters        there.       We then went         to rny friends, ________ Ford Escort and

drove        towards   the ground.           We   parked   in a street about             half a mile

from the football             ground.        I d o n ’t know the        name    of the street          or any

landmark        near   it.     During       the   car journey         1 d o n ’t remember     seeing

anything        untoward and         can't    remember     seeing any supporters making

their way to the ground.

              parked the      car    in the area near to W a ds le y Ln.                 We all    then

w al k e d    through the housing            estate across M i dd l e w o o d Rd,         into Leppings

Ln.

W h e n we started walking                through the estate           it was about 2 .30         pm

(1430).         There were      very few supporters             on this        estate.     I c o u l d n ’t

say whether        the ones we saw were Liverpool                      or N o t ti n gh a m Forest      fans.

W h e n we     left the estate and entered M i d dl e wo o d Road we started to see

large        numbers   of Liverpool          supporters making           their way to the ground.

I saw no one drinking                or    carrying    cans    of beer and g en erally the               crowd

were making        their way qui ckly to the ground.                       I didn't see anyone

p art i c u l a r l y disorderly.          The    traffic was moving            freely along

M i d d l e w o o d Rd at    this time.

We a r r i v e d at the L e p p ings Ln e n t r a n c e to the ground at a b o u t i£.4Q pm

(1440).         We saw that         the a rea     in front of the turnstiles was                  full    up

to where        the small      blue gates         finished.         There was     no orderly queue

but     there was      no pushing and supporters                were     gaining     entry to the

g round       in a reasonable way.

              is a Liverpool         supporter and he w an t ed to stand with the

Liverpool        fans.       So we decided we wouIcy try and gain entry to the

L e p p i n g s Ln end with our S pi on Hop t i c k e t s.               Fro m the    look of the

queue we w ould have            had time to still             get     in the S pi on Hop end of the

                                                                                                   32507

g round     if refused entry to the Leppings Ln end West Stand.                               The walk

thro ug h    that    leads       to the S outh S ta nd and P en ni st on e Rd was             quite       free

of    people and       it w ould have        been easy to walk           through there.

At this     time     there were       two m o un te d    police    officers?       one of them being

near    to the      turnstiles and the other was                 farther       back towards Leppings

Ln.     Both of these            officers were keeping           the fans away from the wall

w hi ch was       on my    left as     I looked towards          the   turnstiles,        I d i d n ’t

see any stewards and               I c a n ’t remember seeing any other Police

Off i ce r s .

I started making my way towards                   the t urnstiles          and the queue         behind

me began         increasing       quite    rapidy.      At first we were moving              auite

easily and then the               pressure    from the back        of the queue        t/egan

increasing.          It got       to such a stage        that    if I had want/d          to I c o u l d n ’t

leave     the queue        because     I was being       pushed from all /sides.              At this

point     the moun te d officers            became aware        of the    prq/61ems    in the queuing

and began         instructing       the    back of the queue           to ease back and to stop

pushing and at first               lead their     horses    into the       crowd to try and              cause

the    crowd to ease         back.        They were     unable    to stop the       pressure       on the

queue and one horse               seemed to get stuck           in the    crowd.      This    being       the

horse     that was        near    to the turnstile.         At this stage          I became      quite

f ri gh te ne d and       I have never       experi en ce d a ny th in g       like this at any

football      m atch      I have a t t e nd e d before.

The    crowd pushed and            I went    towards     the turnstile.           I was    pushed        in

such a way that            I went    to the    left     of the turnstile and           into a dustbin

and wall.         The whole        crowd then swayed to the/right and I came away

from the wall.             I ’m a very tall       person    ( 6 ’4/)     and    I could clearly see

my friends         go through the turnstile.              _________ went       through and then the

crowd surged         pushing myself and                         away    from the turnstile.               When

the    crowd went         back                went through the turnstile and                 I was

pushed away a gain by the                 crowd and then        I m a na ge d to get      through the
                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                     S2507

turnstile as the           crowd went     back again.             Just      before    I went     through         I

saw a small        twelve     or thirteen year            old boy being          lifted and       passed

over     the heads     of the queue.            This    lad was     lifted to safety over                  the

blue     barrier w hich sep ar at ed the turnstile                  from the w a lk wa y to the

S ou t h Stand.       When    I got    through/the         turnstile         entrance     I met my two

friends        in the ground.               /

Whe n    I went    through the        turrystile       I ripped my ticket             off and gave          the

stub to the turnstile            operator.         He d i d n ’t examine           it he just      took      the

ticket and        let me     thro ug h. In the     courtyard the other side of the

turnstiles        the re we re between five and six                 police officers            in a group

observing        people    entering     the ground.

The     time    now was a b o ut 2 .55    pm (1455).           I was about           to walk    towards

the     tunnel    u nd e r ne at h the West S ta nd when I                      pulled me to one            side

and said        “W e ’ll go and stand      in pens         1 and 2,         there will      be more        room

there.         We started to walk        towards        pens    1 and 2.

I turned ar o u n d because           I heard shouting            like a whooping           from behind

me.      I saw that the gate at the               lej/i^ hand side           of the t u r n s t i l e s,    the

blue     concertina gates were           operr/        S up p o r te rs were     teeming     through

these     gates.      It was    like water        coming' from a tap.                I m o ve d towards

the     pens a way from them.           The supporters were                 running and almost all

of them a p p e ar ed to run straight              down the        tunnel       entrance.        I m oved

a way to the       pens.      I only viewed the s upporters                   coming     in for a few

seconds.         I d i d n ’t see the gates        closed.         W he n    I saw the gates         open I

c a n ’t say     I saw anyone      holidng       the open gates             or any    club official          or

policeman near         the    gate,     I d i d n ’t see any supporter                fall when they

came     running     in from the gate-

We then walked ar o u n d to the                                  are a and we stood just              under

the seated area           of the West S tand and vir tu al ly on the end of the

stand.

The     players were warming           up at this         point    on the field.            The Liverpool
                                                                                                       PAGE         6
                                                                                                       S2507

players were warming                up on the West S ta nd side              of the field.

The game          kicked off and          I was aware       of a distur ba nc e       in the mi            e two

sections          of the West Stand.              I looked over and          I saw people       ci         ing

the    perimeter          fence.     One       or two of these          poeple got on to the           field.

I thought          this was       going    to be a pitch          invasion and didn't          realise

that a n y thing was amiss.

T here were         officers and stewards along                   the    track.     People who       got    over

the fence a p p e ar e d to be alright and                      I continued to watch the game.

After a few minutes                I was aware           that there were a lot of            people on        the

track area          aro u n d the Liverpool          goalposts.           At this    point    1' was

w at c h i n g    these s upporters and            I was aware          of the    play being up in the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest       half.     The    ball    came down towards          the    corner of the

West     stand and N or th stand and                I saw a police          officer,       with a peaked

cap run from the             corner       by the    police       control    box on to the       pitch and

speak      to the        referee.        The    players stopped an d watc he d the             police

officer          run onto the       pitch and at this             point    the    club officials        ran

onto     the      pitch and started to get the                   players    off the field.

I then started to w atch what was happening                             behind the goal.          It was at

this     time that         I was    first aware of the two small                   gates    in the

perimeter          fence    leading       to pens 3 and 4 being open.                 A police officer

was    leaning       into the       crowd from the gate wa y              in this    perimeter       fence.

He waved his arms at the                   crowd instructing            them to go back.         The       crowd

didn't      seem to respond.               More    police       officers    then a r ri ve d and the

fans     that had gained access                  to the    pitch a p p ea r ed to be very a n g r y at

them,      shouting at           them pointing at the them and giving                      them general

abuse.

I saw fans          and    police officers         climbing       the    perimter    fence    from     the

pitch side          and    reaching       over to        pull   fans from the       pens over on to           the

pitch.           These    fans    that were       pulled over a p p e ar e d to be reasonably

uninjured.           They were also             people being       pulled out from the          perimeter
                                                                                                   PAGE         7

fence    gates and onto          the    pitch.

About    ten minutes after             the m atch had been stopped there were a lot of

people    on the    pitch.        I saw someone          carrying a small          boy,   no mors        than

e leven years      in his arms.           He    put the boy down by the             corner    flag

which was more       or    less directly          in front    of me.        This    lad had no shoes

on,    white    socks,    dark    coloured trousers.              I d o n ’t know what sort          of

top.

The    person who was       carrying          the boy    placed him on the grass and began

giving    him the kiss       of       life.     A lot of    people at this          point    began

gathering a ro un d him.              Heart massage and the kiss             of    life was    given to

this    boy for    it seemed almost             like ten minutes and then a               cheer went

up and    I thought       I saw this          boys feet move.        But    then a few mi nutes

later they started giving                him the kiss of          life again.

There was       so much going          on that my a t t e n t io n was      drawn away from this

boy.     By now there were a lot of people                   on the    pitch lying down

receiving attention.              It became apparent          to me that a lot of these

people were       s er iously     injured.        There were       people    still    being    lifted

over    the fence on to the             pitch.     A lot of people were being                lifted up

to the West       stand seats          from pens 3 and 4.           Pens 3 and 4 still             seemed

very    crowded with supporters.

There    seemed to be a lot of anger                in the    people at this time.                 One    or

two scuffles where the odd punch was thrown occur re d on the                                pitch

between fans.         I d i d n ’t see anyone           obstruct    or throw punches at any of

the    police    officers    or       people    who were    trying to help the            fans on to

the    pitch,    or who were          giving    first ai d to the fans.

At this    point an amb ul an ce          entered the       pitch from between the N or th

stand and the S pion Kop stand.                   Due    to the    people    layed out on/the

pitch and the number             of    people    present    on the    pitch the amidol an ce must

have    took six or seven minutes                to get to the goa lm ou th a/ea,             as    it had

to keep stopping and then driving a ro un d the                      people.

                                                                                                      S2507

The a m b ul a n c e     stopped by the g oalmouth and several                        people were     put

into     the ambulance.              As soon as these           people were          in the a m bu la nc e     the

amb u l a n c e    began moving         back to the       place       it had origi na ll y en tered the

pitch,        a ga i n taking        some time due to the amount                of people       on the    pitch.

It was at this            point      that    people     started       ripping    the hoardings        from

a r o u n d the     pitch.       I saw some football             supporters          ripping   up hoardings

from the S p i o n Hop end of the                 pitch first an d they then                ran with these

to the        injured and started             putting     the    injured on these

hoardings and started                  carrying them to the area where the a mb ulance

had    left       the   pitch.       Police    officers and first aid                 people as well as

the fans were            involved       in carrying the          injured       in this way.

All    through this time when                 people were on the           pitch there were           very

few    public a n n o u nc e me n ts and         I had d i ff ic ul ty     in hearing these.              One

announcement            that    I did hear was from K en ny D A L G LI S H an d                I think that

I heard this            because,      e ve rybody was quiet when they heard his voice.

He a sk e d eve r yb od y to be calm and for                    people         ^operate        with the

e m e rg e n c y s e r vi c es . The a n no un ce me nt    by K e n n y BflLGLISH was about              4 pm

(1600).For about               the   next fifteen minutes              or so    I saw m uch of the same

sort    of thing.          People were a ssisting               the    injured.        Pens 3 and 4 still

were    occupied but            people      d i d n ’t seem so    packed       in.

At about 4.20            pm (1620)       I „ saw a photographer           st'anding up in the

v ic inity of the goalmouth.’                   I saw, a football         supporter        punch him      in

the    face while he was              trying,     I believe       to take       photographs.

This y ou t h was         then joined by about             six or seven others who                just

s tar t e d    punching and kicking              this    photographer.           They d i d n ’t knock

this     photographer           over.       Police    officers        quickly went to the

photographer and sep a r a t e d the                 people who were trying to assault                    him

a nd then escorted him off the                    pitch.

At 4 .30       prn (1630)       an ann o u n ce me nt    came on to the tannoy stating                   the

m at c h had been postponed.

                   At    this   the    three   of us    left    the ground by gate                ’B      As we       left    the

                   ground       I saw on my     left    beyond the small             blue barrier a t arpa ulin

          Z.       draped over         some tem po ra ry traffic         barriers.                saw to the side            of the

                   t a r pa u l i n a number    of bodies,       Deing only able             to see their            legs.

       ^       I   I have seen a sketch            plan of S h ef fi el d W e d n e s d a y , H i l l s b o ro u gh ground

   ^^lyand                have m ar k ed two     positions        *P 1 * and    'P 2 ' .     PI    is roughly where            I

                   was    standing whe n       I saw gate C open and P2                is where         I stood to view

           p       the m at c h and the subsequent mayhem,                       now       produce      this marked

                   The final       thing    I would     like to say       is that          I a tt en d ed the same match

       £           semi    final      in 1988 and a r ri ve d      roughly about            the same      time as this

                   year.        In 1988 when     I was able to come down L ep pings Ln by taxi

                   w ithout     any o bs tu ct io n    I feel    had I have          come this year          in the same

                   manner,       then the taxi        w ould not have got            through.          This draws me          to

                   the    conclusion that a lot of              people a r ri ve d muc h           later at the ground

                   this year       than    in the same semi           final    the    previous year.

                   I feel       if there had been a cordon of stewards                       or    police    by the tunnel

                   entrance       to the West S ta nd directing               people       to the side of the stand,

                   it w o u l d have      helped matters        because there are             not many signs

                   indicating         the way to      pens    1 and 2 and 6 and 7.

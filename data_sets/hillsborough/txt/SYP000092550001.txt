               I have been a L i v e rpool              s upporter       for some          c on si de r ab l e    time.       I am

               also a s ea so n ticket               holder and o b t a i n e d a ticket                for the Live rp oo l

               I s ec ur ed a ibfi^Leppings Lane                ticket.

               On S a t u r d a y   15 A p r f r K J 989    (150489?        I t r av el le d to S h e f f i e l d w i t h my

               brother                  and a fr^entk                              i n his vehicle.              We   left R u n c o r n

               that morning             but   I have no      r ec o l l e c t i o n of the time.              I took        no notice

               of the jo ur ne y to S h e f f i e l d w hats oe ve r,                             parked the          car    in a

               side    road at Sheffield.                  Again    I have         no    r e co l le c ti o n of the time.

               T here was a police officer                   d i r ec ti n g    traffic and he d i r e c te d us to the

               street to park and we then w a l k e d                    to the ground,              at no time were we

               st op pe d and s e a r ch ed or           checked for tickets.                    I did not w i tn e ss any

               bad b ehaviour            or any disturbance.                Just        prior   to the g r ou n d there were
                                                                                                                   P AG E          2
                                                                                                                   S3681

       some    individuals        being     s toppe d w it h       cans of alcohol.                 T h e y were    not

       allowed       to go a ny further           so most      fans were         hanging          back    to f in is h the

       cans.        We st op pe d on the        river     bridge      near     to the e nt r an c e of L ep p in g s

       Lane.        I think    this m ay well          have    been a bout         13.30      pm    (1330).        We sat

       on the bridge          just    h a v T T r g ^ ^ c a n of b e e r .    I was w a t c h i n g       the    people     in

       the ground.         Here at that time vh^re were                       o rd er ly queues           of people

       going on into the g round about                    two o c m k         (1400)      time      the    crowd began

       to build up some more.                 I think       this must have been due                      to the esco rt s

       either       from the s ta t i o n or the buses.                 We had not made a ny earlier

       a tt em pt    to get    into the ground as my brother h a d n ’t got a ticket.                                     He

       e v e n t u a l l y o b t a in ed a ticket      from a no t he r       fan off a n ot h e r         coach.        Just

       after    two    <1400)     we joined quite a w e d g e N j f              people      but  really gpt
                                                                                                 s o e ~         <jU           o
       t h r o u g h T ^ ^ e ^ c r o w d quite quickly,       I reckon we W«re              i\n by a bo ut 14. 15

       hrs    (1415).

       Again    prior    to goirK^ we were not searched, but there were officers
                                   "x
       present       carrying out t h x V ^ t a s k . Once inside we we re - s to p pe d ^and

       sear checlv^ Aft^r            this we wereS^i t\cted by a Poli ce O f fi c e r towards                             the

       direction                     tunnel,     I did noti ce         that     there were also some

       stewards       betwee'K.      the w here we went          in a nd the tunnel.

       We went down the              tuHpe~K we had free a cc es s and once at the b ot to m we

V#     made    our way to t h e l e f ^ into Pen 4.                   We     i n it ia ll y s tood near to the

       back of the        pen by the wall.              At first        it was      f ai rl y tight y ou were
1^50
       kind of toing and f rchsqq but                  really no tighter              than an o r d i n ar y m a t ch

       game.        I w a n t e d to stop toNthe          back of the          pen but due to the                 crowd we

shortness        of breath.           I kept       trying       to hold him up,            s o me h o w or a no t he r

two men helped me try to pick him up,                             I kept s l ap pi ng         him on the face

to bring       him    round w h i c h he did.              W h e n he o pe ne d his          eyes    he s ta rt ed

him over       to a police           of f i cei'^X*hat was s to od whe re the fenc in g                    had been

don't     think a n y of these              people were          deceased.        I don't know how               long

then     I just w a n t e d to get out of                 tHe    pen.     I got out t hr o ug h the

long     I had been on                  pitch      I've no       idea as     I lost all          r e c o l l ec t io n

is why      I don't       remember m uc h about             it.     We e v en t u a l l y     left    the g round

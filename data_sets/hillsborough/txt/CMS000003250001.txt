LEAD GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT FOR ACCIDENTS IN SPORTS GROUNDS
Just a short note to confirm that Home Office Ministers are
content that we should remain the lead government department in
the case of serious sports ground accidents during the initial
emergency response phase. The expectation is that
responsibility after the 'life saving' stage would transfer to
the Department of National Heritage.
X am copying this letter to Alex Stewart (DNH).

a t League grounds. The St. John Ambulance Brigade had been contacted and
had now made a w ritten submission to th e Trust.

     The tragedy a t Hillsborough, which occurred many months a fte r th e approach
by Lord Aberdare, had served to highlight th e problem a t League grounds.

      The Chairman had spoken to th e S ecretaries of th e Football League and
th e Scottish Football League who had both welcomed any support which F.G.I.T.
could offer.

       Under th e terms of its Trust Deed, F.G.I.T. can only make payments to L e a g u e
C lu b s a n d i t  was th e refo re accepted th a t both Leagues should administer
any scheme and present th e accounts to th e Trust fo r settlem ent to avoid
adm inistrative costs.

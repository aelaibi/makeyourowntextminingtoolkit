         I enclose my application to join the ISA (something I have been meaning
to do for a long time’
                     .).

         I enclose also an account of a recent experience at the Middlesbrough v.
Leeds United Div. 2 match on Dec. 9th., 198Q. This includes press cuttings and a
ground plan to help when reading the text. I trust you will find this of interest
and would welcome any comments you hare in how best to       pursuematters like     this;
further. It seems pointless complaining to the clubs, League, F.A.» safety body,
Police, or whatever, but I think such incidents should not be continued to be
brushed under the carpet.

         I look forward to receiving my membership and any comments on the above
which you may have.                                                       8^5

       I arrived at the ground via Ayresome Street and Ayresome Park Road. I could see no
  sign of any programmes being on sale despite the time being only 2.35. Fortuneately, I
  had bought mine earlier in anticipation of this all too common occurence at football
  grounds.

       This was my seventh visit to Ayresome Park which includes a visit in 1975 between
  Boro and Leeds when the attendance was 33,000. Iwas also there for an F.A.Cup "derby”
  between Boro and Darlington in 1985 when the crowd was 19,084 which included a vast
  away contingent.

       The South-east corner is the area currently reserved for visiting fans and before
  reaching this area there was a line of barriers across the full width of the road behind
  which were dozens of parked Leeds buses. Access into the area behind the barriers,was
  strictly controlled by police and at one point only. Without production of a valid ticke t
  for the away end you could not get past this point. This I did, and proceeded through,
  feeling like some kind of alien with three heads. Very soon were the entrance turnstiles
  for visitors. These consisted of only two entrances, each with two turnstiles. There w ere
  two police stood at each entrance together with Leeds stewards (wha-were checking fans’
— TJ-Club Membership Cards - without one of these entry is refused even if you have a ticle t).-

       At this time (approx 2.40) there was no organised queue - just a general convergence
  from all directions towards the turnstiles. No attempt was being made by any officials_or__
  police to try and create a queue, indeed not a word was spoken by any of them.. Nor were
  there any police horses around this point - however, this would have been difficult as
  the whole road was full of buses right up to the kerb, and the only access as a result
 ■fcs the width of the footpath.

       Despite the unorganised state of the "queue" people were very well behaved and waited
  patiently to get in. It was a bit squeezed as you entered the hole in the wall to actually
  go in but this is not particularly unusual. What I did find strange was that two elderly
_ blokes who had endured the waiting and various check points then found that they had
  arrived at the wrong turnstiles. This I thought odd as this was the only way in for Leeds
  fans as far as I could tell and surely they should have realised where they were
  queuing. However, they were turned back and squeezed back out like peas out of a pod, m d
  shepherded away towards Ayresome Street by a steward.

       My turn came and the first obstacle was over - I was in the ground. It was about ten
  minutes to kick-off. Not bad, I thought, ten minutes to get i$t - can’t complain. Just glad
  to be here - one of the lucky 2,100 who have a ticket for the Leeds enclosure (even if I
  had had to queue at Elland Road for two hours five minutes the previous week - but aich is
  the lot of the average Leeds fan this season).

       I then proceeded immediately up the steps into the Leeds enclosure. At the top of the
  steps were several police who were instructing new arrivers to go all the way down the
  gangway to the front and to then move to the left where there was plenty of room. It was
  very packed in this back area around the gangway and I didn’t fancy my chances of trying
  to squeeze in even though I was on my own, so I heeded the advice and carried straight on
  down the g a n g w a y toward the front. As I did so I can recall a few fans answering back to
  the police such comments as "That's what they said at Hillsborough", and ignoring the
  advice to move down to the front. So quite a few squeezed sideways and into the throng.

       As I descended the gangway there were loudspeaker appeals for Leeds fans to move
  towards the front. It is difficult to say if this appeal did any good - certainly nobody
  on the terraces moved as unless the person in front of you moves this is impossible
  anyway. However, it may have influenced some new arrivers to try their luck at the front,
  thus preventing even further congestion at the back. On descending the gangway the view
  of the pitch was deteriorating rapidly and I was beginning to wonder if I was doing the
  right thing. I went right down to the very front and turned left where there was a lot of
  space - the big problem here being thatI could barely see half the pitch. The view through
  three layers of mesh fencing together with the barbies on top providedalmost a total
  blockage of about a third of the pitch including the Holgate End goal, and the other two
  thirds were viewed through mesh. I hadn’t queued for over two hours for a £5 standing
  ticket, travelled all the way from Sheffield, and put up with the usual risk of being
beaten up in the back streets, just td stand in an area where I couldn’t see: And,
judging by the like comments of those around me, I was not alone in this opinion. So I
made my way about 20 yards back up the terrace and then back to the right again until I
could get a reasonable view over the fences. It was "cosy" here but I managed reasonably
easily to find a slot to stand in.

     At 3,00 the match kicked off and almost straight away stewards and police started
escorting groups of Leeds fans out from the stands to my left. They were arriving in
groups of between about 10 and 20. At first the police didn’t seem to know what to do
with them but soon decided to put them in our pen. I remember thinking this was strange
as surely our pen was full to its safety capacity - certainly all the tickets had been
sold as demand had far exceeded supply. I would aay that about 100 fans were put into
the-enclosure-through the left gate in these 'flfsT 5 or 10 minutes. They were greeted by
cheers from the Leeds enclosure at first (as is the norm in such circumstances), but
towards the latter stages more people began to doubt the wisdom of putting more people
in with us as we were generalljnjuite tight~'wliere I was and-certainly more crowded
towards the back and around the gangway . ~ d r t e v i , ^bfaen more, people "started to-shout at
the police and stewards to stop letting more in. A few chants developed, mildly at first.
It is worth noting that for fans to actually suggest to police not to let more of their
own kind into their own enclosure is particularly strange - especially away from home in
a hostile environment (as Middlesbrough usually isl). It was obviously a post-Hillsborough
phenomenon that the fans have learnt - I" can honestly "say it’s the first time I ’ve ever
experienced it.                                                                    J

^     From this period on, further Leeds fans were then escorted towards the totally
Pacant North-east corner. There were sarcastic cheers from within the pen as we realised
the proverbial penny had dropped. More and more fans were notv brought out both from the
 stands to my left and the East End seated area. I would say about 300 - 500 were
 escorted to the North-east corner. Then, suddenly, a change of tact - they started to
 put the next groups into our enclosure again! There was a serious change of moodin the
crowd in the pen at this stage.

     The crowd in this area had now become very concerned and quite angry. And, quite
frankly, there was an undercurrent of fright. It seemed that the crowd’s original
objections which had been heeded were now being ignored and the policy had been reversed.
There was much shouting at police by many many fans and loud chants were going up. I can
recall particularly:-

     "Hillsborough, Hillsborough, Hillsborough          "

     "We are squashed, we are squashed, we are squashed           ”

     As we were clearly being totally ignored, this rose to:-

     "What the f..., what the f..., what the f... is going on?.... "

     The atmosphere now was very angry and everyone seemed to be shouting at the police
to stop this insane practice. People couldn’t believe it was actually happening at all,
let alone happening around them or to them. The response by the police to these cries
was virtually nil and I likened it to trying to reason with a row of cardboard cut-outs.
I saw one policeman smile and remember wondering, "is that a smile of derision, or is it
simply that we are over-reacting and the police really do know what they’re doing?"

     The next major event was that fans were now being escorted back from the North-east
corner where they had just been put, back to our pen. About 30 were brought down the
first time. As they walked the full width of the pitch behind the goal the fans in my
enclosure threw a constant barrage of appeals and chants to the police in front of us,
but to no avail. As this first group were arriving a second group were now being led
down towards us. It seemed that the clear intention was to bring all the people out of
the North-east corner into our enclosure! Was this really happening? There were several
hundred fans in there!

     I have seen the surge on TV as I did at the time of the incident and this is the
 po.j-nt at which it happened. If you can imagine the mood and fright in the crowd, it is not
 difficult to see that this had been converted into overt anger and panic, immediately,
 young fans were being pulled up and passed over those horrific barbled 8 feet high over­
 hanging fences. At the same time police were still pushing fans into the enclosure via the
 left gate! Nobody could believe their eyes.

      It was only at this stage that further fans were stopped entering the pen as all
 hands set to lifting the youngsters over the fence. I would say about 15 - 20 were lifted
 over, and then many other people were let out of the enclosure via the left gate. For the
 second time, at last, it seemed the proverbial penny had dropped.What seemed so obvious
 and predictable to all in the enclosure had now been officially recognised.

------ As the match was stopped and many people milled onto the pitch and perimeter, Howard
  Wilkinson came over and climbed up on the fence and appealed for calm using hand gestures.
  People did now calm down and there was a feeling of relief. However, it was clear people
— had been Injured at least --maybe much worse, but fortuneately not as was later learned.

      The chanting,‘'however, did not cease completely as the crowd in our pen were joined
 in chants by the Boro fans in the East End seats making no doubt as to where it was felt
 the blame lay:-

;---- •'Will you ever, will youever,   will you ever f. ..ing learn?....." seemed to sum up
  this feeling quite well.                   *

      Before the game was re-started Wilko was handed a megaphone by the police as a m e m s
    communicating with the crowd. Despite being assisted by several police officers in
 attempting to get this object to work it was clear that it did not. So we were treated to
 the spectacle of Wilko appealing by shouting at the top of his voice over the fence - I
 caught about six words and I was a mere 20 yards away!

       It is also wojfth noting that I heard no announcements over the tannoy system through­
  out this period, and it was not until after the match had resumed and we reached half-time
. that it was announced that four people had been taken to hospital. If there were earlier
  announcements they certainly could not be heard.

      The rest of the game passed without major incident other than another Leeds goal.
 The crowd remained calm and well behaved to the end and afterwards. As we turned to make
 our way out (after the obligatory 20 minute stop-back) and ascended the terrace to squeeze
 out of the miniscule exit there were the usual bleeting noises, "Baa, baa, baa...." It
 had never been more appropriate. I was just waiting for the bloke with the stun gun to
 appear - after what I ’d just witnessed it would have been quite credible.


      To summarise, I feel there are several factors which need answering following these
 incredible incidents:

      The Police and Crowd.

   1. Why were police putting additional fans in large numbers into an enclosure which was
      already full?

    2. Even if there was some room at the front (officially or not) why could the police not
       understand this was because jjou couldn’t see the pitch at these points and also that
       this area was populated by families?

    3. Why did tactics change twice concerning what to do with surplus Leeds fans found in
       other areas of the ground?

    4. Why does it still take a near-disaster situation to get the police to believe that
       football fans might actually be wofcth listening to?

    5. Why did the police megaphone not wprk? Were there no spares?
  »6. Why do the police have so little credibility with football fans? suggested answer;-
      Essentially, fans have no confidence in. the police after Hillsborough (tactics and
      cover up, etc.). The police themselves actually have to recognise this fact and
      swallow their pride. It is no good having the "We know best, scum" attitude if fans
      do not trust their judgement - this was a major factor at Ayresome and such mistrust
      has been redoubled following these incidents.

      Ground Design and Licensing.

   7. Why are the fences around much of Boro's ground (and some others) 8 feet high and
      overhanging with vicious barbies on top?

   8. Why does the South-east corner pen have no exit gates at the front in the perimeter
      fence where they are needed?

    9. Why are the exit gates which are provided not marked except for the one on the left
       which says in- ageing peeling paint "Ladies”? Why are they not even marked out in a
______ different colour or something, as they look -Just like the rest of the fence when
       closed (as they usually were)?

  in. why do fan.q still have to put up with such crap facilities (especially away fans)
      where you are lucky to see the pitch, can't safely take the kids, and are lucky to
      find a toilet, etc.?

^^.1. Why were no tannoy announcements made during the whole saga?

  12. How can a funnel-shaped terrace accomodate the same number of fans per square metis
      as a straight terrace? Surely account should be taken of shape, steepness, and layout,
      etc.? The south -east corner is a bottleneck for crushing with no exits at the front.

  13. When are some proper national standards going to be applied to sports grounds which
      are consistent between authorities and ensure safety and decent facilities?

      Match Arrangements.

  14. Why could Boro not provide more accomodation for visitors when a whole full c omer
      of the ground was not being used? Why was there no allocation for Leeds' family
      members in the family stand? The attendance of 19,686 was still 6,000 under capacity'.

      Aftermath.

  15. The police managed to conduct an "enquiry” within 48 hours of this incident. How is
      this possible? Whose evidence has been examined? - certainly not the fans. The
      findings of this "enquiry" stated that everything was satisfactory! So, presumably,
      we can all rest assured that such incidents will be likely to recur and that this is
      not a problem! Despite this, it is worth noting that Boro soon announced that they
      are to remove the barbies from their fences and now plan to make Ayresome park an
      all seater. Presumably, this announcement is merely coincidental.

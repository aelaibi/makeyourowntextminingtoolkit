I refer to your letter of 16 April 1997 together with its enclosure.

The material requested has been forwarded to Mrs Stringer with the exception of Plan PRT/2 which
I am unable to locate from our records. I have requested further information from Mrs Stringer to
assist me. Have you any record of Plan PRT/2?

The normal procedure for copying photographs is by laser copier, which in the normal course of
events has been satisfactory. Negatives are held in respect of some but not all photographic
material in our possession. The processing of material is not charged for at this time.

If I can be of any further assistance in the future please do not hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully

 Dear Chris,

 Thank you for your letter 14th April 1997.

 I would prefer if you replied to Mr. Hammond.

 As I do not have the transcripts or exhibit list I cannot say whether the list set out in
 Mr. Hammond’s letter is complete but I am inclined to think that there are some gaps.
 Obviously, to be sure one would have to check through the exhibits and transcripts
 but I notice for example that on page 82 of the transcript for 19* November 1990
 ( which I do happen to have) I refer to my intention to show three videos on the 20th
 November. I would expect that they all had an exhibit number. I do not have the
 transcript for 20th November so cannot say at this point what was actually shown. The
 point is not strictly relevant to Mr. Hammond’s enquiry but I wished to draw it to your
 attention in case you felt that it might become an issue at some time. No doubt you
 can have a quick look at the transcript if you think it necessary.

 With regard to the specific question I would not wish to speak from memory as to
 what the Jury took with them into the jury room but from page 52 of the transcript of
 on 26th March (which again I happen to have) I say “Now the next thing we need to
 do is to give you the exhibits. These are the complete set of the exhibits... ” I go
 on to say “The other thing we need to do is to show you how to use the video
 equipment.” Page 53 contains a note to the effect that the jury were shown how to
 operate the video.

 I hope the above will help you to answer Mr. Hammond’s question.



 Yours sincerely,




^ L . Popffer.

Dear Mr Hammond
Hillsborough Inquest
I have received a reply from Doctor Popper to your enquiry and he has asked me to pass this on to
you.
Doctor Popper sets out that;
       *As I do not have the transcripts or exhibit list I cannot say whether the list set out in Mr
        Hammond’s letter is complete but I am inclined to think that there are some gaps.
        Obviously, to be sure one would have to check through the exhibits and transcripts but I

        happen to have) I refer to my intention to show three videos on the 20th November. I would

             Dear Mr Dorries

             At a meeting of the Hillsborough Family Support Group held
             yesterday, I was approached by Mr- Wright who lost his 17 year old
             son, Graham, in the disaster.  He has asked me to assist hint, in
             obtaining a copy of the transcript of Graham's mini-inquest
             proceedings

              I should be grateful if you could forward a copy of the same to me
              so that I can take Mr. Wright through the proceedings.

              I thank you for your assistance.

              Yours sincerely

             Dear Mr. Dorries,


                             Further to my recent request for information
             relating to Philips death I should be grateful if you would
             provide me with the following video footage:-

             Ref C278 - shown to the jury on 20th November 1990.

             Ref C539 - shown to the jury on 15th March 1991.

             Ref C334 & SGBl “                shown to the jury on 19th December 1990.

             Ref C411 & Mapl -                shown to the jury on 30th January 1991.

             I am trying to ascertain the precise extent of the footage shown
             to the jury which I presume will be strictly indexed and logged
             at the Medico Legal Centre.
             If there is footage additional to the above I should be grateful
             if you would also   copy this to me I will of course pay all
             copying charges.

             Finally on 31st December 1991, Day 42 Page 109F Doctor Popper
             stated that he was changing his mind on a previous ruling and he
             would probably let the jury take the Video/exhibits  into their
             room when they came to their deliberations. Did the jury in fact
             take any video footage in with them. If so, please let me have a
             copy of the same. Speaking of the jury I should be grateful if
             you would let me know if there is any ban on families speaking to
             any of the jurors? I thank you for your assistance.

Dear Mr Hammond
Hillsborough Inquest
I refer to your letter of the 11 th February 1997. I am sorry for the delay in letting you have a written
reply but we have of course spoken on two occasions in the meantime.
Your request for video footage has been passed to the police who, as you are aware, have the
facility to provide copies whilst I do not.
i am not clear as to the exact answer to your query concerning the video shown to the jury.
. .vould have thought that the most defirgjivedocument on the subject was the actual transcript and I
am not personally aware of a schedule wpen and beyond that, if you wish, adding to the points set
out below, I could query this with Dr Popper.
When we last spoke I suggested it may be appropriate to put the query concerning the video in the
last paragraph of your letter to Dr popper.^f you wish to pursue that please let me know.
Finally, we spoke on the telephone concerning your question on approaching the jury and you
understood that you could n o t^ y j^ eth at line.
if I can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to write or telephone me.
Yours sincerely

O         Dear Dr Popper,

                        •I ant trying to ascertain the precise extent of the
          video footage shown to the jury, after reading all he transcripts
          the dates I find are as follows,

          Ref C278                        -shown to the jury on 20th November 1990.

          Ref C33S                        -shown to the jury on 15th March 1991,

          Ref C234                        &5GB1 - shown to the jury on 19th December 1990,

          Ref C41J                        kMapl - Shown to the jury on 30th January 1991,,

         Finally on the 31st December 1991, Day 42 page 109 (F) you stated
         that you was changing your mind on a previous ruling and you
         would probably let the jury take the video/exhibits into their
         room when they came to their deliberation. Did the jury in fact
         take any video footage in with them. If so, please could you let

o        me have the information of what video,© they took.


         Your sincerely


          Philip Hammonc

Dear Stefan
Hillsborough Inquest
I am enclosing a copy of a letter received from Philip Hammond, father of one of the
deceased and also Secretary of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.
I have spoken to Mr Hammond on a few occasions. He has been trying to work out
whether the jury had sight of some particular video footage. Apparently you had originally
said that they would not have this in the jury room with them but later indicated a change
of heart. Howevei^ he is not clear whether the jury actually had the item. Plainly I could
not answer this and I said that if he wrote to me I would pass the letter on to you.
I wonder if I could trouble you to either let me have your comments or reply direct to Mr
Hammond (letting me have a copy for the file).

Dear Mr Greenaway
Hillsborough Inquest
I enclose a note received today from Mr Hammond from which you will notice that he is
asking for a full list of exhibits produced at the inquest.
I assume that there is some record in existence, probably amongst the documentation of
the WestVkJIands Police. I wonder if you would be kind enough to have a quick search
and let me know what can be found.
If there is no immediate answer then I will ask Dr Popper for his comments.

Dear Mr Greenaway
Hillsborough Inquest
I enclose a letter received today from M*sStringer asking for some documentation. Unless
you are aware of something to the contrary I will assume that all of these were documents
referred to in evidence and that Mrs Stringer is entitled to them
The last paragraph of MtfStringer’s letter asking for “good quality glossy copies” is
obviously based on the recent problems. Might I ask what the normal procedure for
copying photographs is? I think it is perfectly fair to say that relatives should be given a
good quality photograph even if that means that they are then asked to pay a production
charge. Do the police hold the negatives?
I will be grateful for your comments in early course.
Yours sincerely

Mr David Alton MP
House of Commons
LONDON
SW1A OAA




Dear Mr Alton

MR PHILIP HAMMOND
HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

Thank you for your letter of the 20 May 1992 concerning Mr H a m mond’s request
for copies of four witness statements.

I had in fact already given further thought to this case and Mr H a m mond’s
query is now fully resolved.  However, I have taken the liberty of setting
out the difficulties that the law presents me with and the actions taken in
this particular case in some detail, as I suspect that the question of
Hillsborough documentation may be with us for some time yet and you may
perhaps be approached by other constituents.

You will appreciate, I am sure, that I am bound by the statutory provisions
contained in The Coroner’s Act 1988 and The Coroner’s Rules 1984.  Rule 57 of
the latter provides that interested parties (eg families) are entitled to
obtain from me (inter alia) a copy "of any document put in evidence at an
Inquest".

Other than that statutory provision I have no power to release documents
which are given to me by the police for the purpose of an Inquest.  The case
of R v Hammersmith Coroner ex parte Peach (1980:2 WLR 496) makes it
abundantly clear that ownership of such documents rests with the Police not
with the Coroner.

The four witnesses referred to by Mr Hammond did not apparently give evidence
at the Inquest nor were their statements "documents put in evidence".   It
seems to be the case, however, that some of the contents of some of the
statements were summarised by a Reporting Officer at the "Mini Inquest" when
evidence of identification was taken.  Whilst this might not have been ideal
in every way it was, I am sure, the only practicable way of dealing with this
case.

I therefore had very grave doubts as to whether the statements that Mr
Hammond requested fell within Rule 57.  However, I am well aware that the
South Yorkshire Police have released a lot of statements to relatives and I
asked Chief Superintendent Mole if he would make the same arrangements for Mr
Hammond.  I understand the Police have asked permission of the person making

                                                                  Cont/d
the statement in each case before releasing it, but permission has not been
refused by a Police Officer although it has been by Ambulance Service
personnel.

As I understand it, Chief Superintendent Mole immediately rang Mr Hammond and
informed him that, subject to consent, statements would be sent to him, I
feel therefore that Mr Hammond’s comment in his letter of the 11 May 1992 is
more than a little unfair.

I had always indicated to Mr Hammond in correspondence that I was extremely
sympathetic with his request.  Indeed I am sure that I would have been making
exactly the same request had our roles been reversed.  I gave a great deal of
thought to the matter and in a further discussion with Chief Superintendent
Mole reached agreement to the effect that whoever had the right to release
the papers, as neither of us had any objection to this, I would send
the statements out to Mr Hammond.  These were despatched about ten days ago.




Yours sincerely

         Dear Mr Hammond

         HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST
         REQUEST FOR STATEMENTS

c        Thank you for your letter of the 11 May 1992.  I have given this matter a
         great deal of thought because I am most sympathetic to your request and
         would wish to assist you if I can do so within the terms of the statute that
         govern my position.

         I should say that I have considerable difficulty in accepting the points set
         out in the second paragraph of your letter.   It is clear that the relevant
         statements were taken by or on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police for a
         number of purposes, but the prime purpose was for the criminal enquiry which
         resulted in papers being sent to the DPP.   I must maintain, therefore, that
         unless such statements fall within Rule 57 that they are the property of the
         Police and not mine to give away.  There is a specific legal precedent on
         this point.

         However, whilst we may disagree about the law involved, I remain sympathetic
         to your perfectly understandable request to have sight of the statements.  I
         have, therefore, had further talks with the Police and have agreed to release
         the documents on the basis that Rule 57 either might apply or might well have
         applied in the more normal circumstances of an individual Inquest.

         Accordingly, I enclose the statements that you have asked for.  I hope that
         these will assist your family to come to terms with the tragedy which has
         befallen you.

         If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

    Dear Mr. Dorries,

    My constituent Mr. Philip Hammond lost his son Philip during the
    Hillsborough tragedy.   He did write to you requesting copies of the
    statements made by four of the witnesses who attended the inquest but
    unfortunately you were unable to provide them referring him instead to
    the South Yorkshire Constabulary.    As you will see from the attached
    correspondence they have been of little help and I would be greatful if
    you would re-consider this matter.     I am copying the corresponence to
    the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire.

    Youra sincerely

Dear Mr.Alton


             I am so sorry to bother you again, but has you can
see from the enclosed letters I have asked for the statements
from the four witnesses who attended to Philip on the 15th April
1989 from the Coroner of South Yorkshire, but He seems to be
passing me on to the South Yorkshire Police who have no time for
any body related to Hillsborough.

As you can see from my last letter dated 11/5/92 I think the
Coroner is wrong in this respect He should be able to release the
statements.

Could you please write to the Coroner on my behalf just to l$t
him know that you are taking an intress in my case.

Yours Faithfully

Dear Sir,

             Request for Statements.

        I refer to your letter of 8th May and I am dismayed to
see that you feel unable to release the statements to me.
You will be aware that at the mini - inquest, evidence was
presented in the form of a summary read out by a presenting
officer. In Philip's case the "Summary" consisted of details
taken from statements prepared by those people whose statements I
now seek. In my view those statements were incorporated into the
West Midlands Police Summary, and therefore should be released in
accordance with the spirit of rule 57.

You will also be aware that at the inquest Dr.Popper dispensed
with the requirements of rule 37 on the grounds of practicality.
Had he not acted in such an arbitrary fashion I would have
insisted that all relevant eye witnesses be called to give oral
evidence. Having been denied this basic right by Dr.Popper , I
feel aggrieved that you now compound this injustice by depriving
me of witnesses statements, which incidentally were taken for the
purpose of Philip's inquest and not on behalf of South Yorkshire
Police.
I therefore re-iterate my request for you to release the
statements failing which I shall have no alternative but to seek
legal recourse.

Yours Faithfully


P .Hammond

Dear Mr Hammond

REQUEST FOR STATEMENTS

Thank you for your letter of the 5 May 1992, I am sorry for the delay in
replying but I think that this has been explained to you over the telephone
by my staff.

Rule 57 of The Coroners Rules 1984 says that a Coroner, on application, shall
supply to a properly interested person (which obviously includes you) a copy
of any report of a post-mortem examination, or of any notes of evidence, or
of any document put in evidence at an Inquest.

I was, therefore, able to supply you with a copy of the Post-Mortem Report
without any difficulty.  However, it was necessary for me to ascertain
whether the statements that you refer to were "any document put in evidence
at an Inquest".  So far as I can ascertain this is not the case, it may be
that those witnesses gave evidence orally, but that is different to their
statements becoming a document put in evidence.

However much I would like to assist you, I am afraid that this means that I
do not personally have the power to release these statements to you.  So far
as I can see the power rests with the Chief Constable on whose behalf the
statements were taken.

A number of relatives have requested statements from the Police and I gather
that almost without exception the documents have been supplied.  I cannot say
whether this includes statements from Ambulance Service Personnel.

I have, therefore, referred your request to Chief Superintendent Brian Mole
who is the officer who is dealing with such requests.

Being acutely aware of the delay in dealing with your request, I have spoken
with Mr Mole this morning and he has assured me that he will telephone you
this afternoon.  I have given him the number




                                                              Cont/d.
I am sorry if your request seems to be going around the houses but I am
placed in a situation whereby I cannot release documents that do not belong
to me unless there is a specific legal power for me to do so.

If I can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.



If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
submit.

Your^ jrai^fe^ully,

   Dear Sir,

   Re:          Philip Hamnond (deceased) - Hillsborough Disaster

   We note that you intend to resume the inquests in this matter shortly.
   Mr and Mrs Hammond will obviously wish to attend their son's inquest.
   In fixing the date for the resumption of Philip's inquest we should be
   obliged if you would avoid the dates 20th to 27th April and 6th to 21st
   July 1990 when Mr and Mrs Hammond will not be available to attend your
   Court.

   Yours faithfully,

Dear           S irs,
He:        PHILIP ammm) (deo*aa*d) H©.95.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S*L*Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

Dear Sirs,

3e: PHILIP HAMMMED (deceased).

Thank you for your letter of the 2nd of August. V/hilst
I cannot say that you should not allow a copy of the
post mortem report to be given to Philip's parents,
subject to the conditions which I have outlined to you,
I do suggest that you consider carefully whether this
is advisable. It may be better to suggest to them that
you will let their G.P. have a copy, so that he can
discuss the matter with them.

I hope that these comments are of assistance to you.

With regard to your penultimate paragraph, I am agsMd
I am not in a position at this time to give you any
additional information regarding Philip*s death.

Thank you for enclosing your cheque for £2.75.

Yours faithfully,

            REi__PHILIP_HAMMOND_(DECEASED)_:_HILLSBOROUGH_DISASTER

            We thank you for your letter dated 31 May.  You will appreciate that
            in addition to the inquest we are also instructed by the relatives of
            Philip Hammond deceased in connection with their claims for damages
            arising out of the circumstances surrounding Philip's death.  One element
            of this claim will relate to the pain and suffering sustained by Philip
            prior to his death.  In order for us to present our clients' claim as
            quickly as possible we are anxious to obtain evidence in this regard.
            It would therefore be of great assistance to us if yqu could release
            the post mortem report in respect of Philip at this stage rather than
            to await the inquest, which we presume will not take place for a number
            of months.  We thank you in anticipation for your assistance in this
            regard and look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

            Yours faithfully

            We write to inform you that we are instructed by Mr & Mrs Hammond in connection
            with Phil ip’s estate's claim for damages arising out of the circumstances
            surrounding his death.   Please note our interest in this matter and inform
            us in due course of the adjourned hearing date for Philip's inquest.    At
            this stage, we should be obliged if you would also provide us with the
            name and address of the doctor who treated Philip in respect of his injuries
            and/or carried out the autopsy examination since we may wish to instruct
            this doctor to provide us with a medical report upon Philip's injuries.

            Your assistance in this matter            is appreciated.

            Yours faithfully

             Dear Mr. Hammond,

             Re: PHILIP HAMMOND (deceased).
                                               I


             There is one other detail which we require for registration purposes in the
             case of young people who died under the age of sixteen.

             That information is the occupation if any of the mother.  Unfortunately we
             have not got a record of this in your case and Iwould be grateful if you
             could please complete the attached form, sign and date it and return it in
             the envelope provided by return, of post.


             Yours sincerely,




             S.L.Popper,
             H.M.Coroner.

!<' ^ifer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sl¥ath concerning the release of the deceased persons from

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

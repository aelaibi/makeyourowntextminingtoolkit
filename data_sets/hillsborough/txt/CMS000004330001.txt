Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report



Speaking
       ,, Note
           |*.



DOE's interest in the report is primarily concerned with the
chapters on Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 and the
national membership scheme. The report records the judge's
concern that the technology for the scheme might not be reliable
or robust enough to operate safely. He is not convinced that the
scheme envisaged would eliminate hooliganism inside or outside
grounds; and he thinks it might place excessive demands on the
police. He therefore recommends against implementation.

The Prime Minister and senior Ministers have therefore decided
not to press ahead with the scheme now. It will be placed on the



                                                         •   anH i
                            JV   could   work.   This

Government expenditure,   for which Treasury agreement would be
needed.


     does not accept the judge's criticisms of the proposal for
the national membership scheme. He has raised no new arguments
and he has made his judgement on the basis of an outline for a
scheme which does not yet exist.]




Background Note


The report is likely to be published on Monday 29 January. The
Home Secretary will make a statement to the House; we will be
consulted on its drafting (meeting with Secretary of State at
9.30am Wednesday to discuss possible HO draft).

              I a tt e n d e d as a Liverpool S u p p o r t e r           and have       supported Liverpool            for

              about     three years        now.    I am a season ticket                  holder and         regularly

              at t e n d home matches.

              I obtained my m atch ticket               by using a voucher                from my season ticket.

              The     ticket was        for the Leppi ng s Lane             terracing and          cost me           pounds,

              I travelled to the game with the fo 1.1 owi ng                         peo pie.

We    travailed       in
                      in                            private    car.     We were held up once             on

the>way to Sheffield,                that was at an        island at the end of a motorway

Naming    into Sheffield,                We were    held up for about       half an h o u r .       We

travelled directly             to She ff ie ld without making any stops.

We    parked our       car    in a side street         off a mai n      road at about     half      past

one    (1330).

The    side street was about a twenty minute walk                        to the ground.        We each

bought a bag of             chips and started to walk            towards    the ground.        we    saw

P o l i c e m e n on the way to the ground but we d i d n ’t need any directions

as we knew the way             to the ground.          We had a l l been to the same semi

final at     the ground         last gyear.
                                      r o u ny      1 saw people asking        people    if they had

any spare       tici-^eej/s.        I also   saw s upporters      standing     outside    pubs

d rinking and s upporters                drinking    from beer    cans    in the street.         I did

not see a n y bo dy drunk.                                      did not walk all        the way      to

the ground with us.                 He   left us earlier       because    he had a ticket        for

the seats       in the West Stand.

We a r r i v e ^ in the L ap pings Lane             turnstile    area at about       twenty     five

past    tw/f (1425).          The    turnstile a rea was        packed .and the      crowd

stretched back             from the turnstiles         to the jndfter gates.         There were          no

orderly queues.              There we re two mountain Pol i cemen outs i de the

 ur nst i 1 e s .    One     of them was a Mej^feyside P o l ic e ma n wit h a moustache.

He^ was   talking          to the    crowd and trying         to get them to move        back.       It

took us about          ten minutes         to get to a turnstile.           It was    packed     in the

crowd,    but       I wasn't    crushed at any time,            1 don*t    neffrtfmber seeing any

other P o l i c e m e n,     there weren't any         by the    tuj^^TiIes     checking      for

tickets.        I d i d n ’t see any stewards           outside       the turnstiles.        I d i d n ’t

see any u n a u t h or i se d entry          into the ground.          We all went    through the

same    turnstile and handed our                 tickets    into the turnstile        operator.           We

were all     given the stub              portion back.

                                                                                                               8 3316

Once    inside     the ground we decideji^To use                    the    central          tunnel     that      runs

under    the West Stand.              j j ^ fTadn *t seen any signs              or any directions                   to

the t e r r a c i n g .     Wgn^Thought that the            tunnel     was      the only way           in.       I

didn't     s\g             fighting       or any other        sort of disorder               I didn't          see any

people drinking             inside    the ground or any d r u n k e n e s s .

We wa l k e d along         the    central    tunnel       to get to the terracing.                      We were

able    to walk along             the tunnel       quite    freely.        I didn't          see any

P o l i c e m a n or S te wards at the entrance                to the tunnel               and    I d o n ’t

remember      seeing any stewards              or Police         inside        the tunnel.

At the end of the             tunnel      we went     to the       left hand side and                 into pen

four.      It was     quite        busy    in the    pen when we entered at about                        twenty to

-hree     (144-0).                  is quite well          built so he led the way through the

crowd.      We went across            to the       left,    towards       pen number five.                We took

up a position not             far    from the dividing            fence with           pen five,         a few

feet    from the      rear of the           pen.     I have ma rk ed this              position on the

separate      grid        plan using       the figure one.            We stopped            in this      position

intending        to w atch the m atch from there.                     During         the    next few minutes,

the    pen was     becoming more and more                  p a c k e d , but    it wasn't

uncomfortable.              It was    like any normal            football        crowd wit h          people

pushing and jostling.                 We were       talking and we were                having a look at

the match        programme.          At about       five    tp-’
                                                               ^ thres     (1455),          the teams were

being a n n o u n c e d over        the tannoy.^/T          remember       thinking          that     it was a

big surprise         that Alan HANSE M / w a s         playing        for Liverpool.                 It was

whi 1 e the teams were              bei      a n no un ce d that there was a strong                      surge

from behind.              It w a j / ? sudden surge and            it carried me down the

terracing.         I finis h ed about          five or si;-: steps              further          down the

terracing and had become                   separated from                      and               ,   I remember

looking      back and        I saw             further        up the terracing.                  He sh outed to

me,    “Hold on                     i t ’s alright we'll           come and get y o u . ”              I have

              While    I was     in position           1A,    I became more and more               packed    in by the

              crowd and      c o u l d n ’t    see anything of the pitch.                  As I became more

              tightly     packed     in,       I felt myself         being carried         by the movem en t        of     the

              crowd,     it was an i nvolunta ry movement,                     you   c o u l d n ’t help but       bs

              carried by the         crowd.          It was a slow gradual               movement.        The     game must

              have    kicked off while              I was     in that     position.        There was an obvious

              response     from the           crowd.

              The movement        of the        crowd was       carrying me g radually down the                    pen

              towards     the front.            The movement        only stopped when              I became       pinned up

              a gainst a crush barrier.                    It was   the       crush barrier about           half way down

              the    pen on the      left hand side,             thats as you         look at the          pitch.

              The    game must     have        still       been g o i          the   crowd    were    still

              responding       to what         was     hapD^irtfng on the        pitch. Whilst       I was against

              that    barrier     I saw a Jfdlf            caste youth        pinned up agai ns t          the    centre of

              the    crush bar r i a ^ T        I was against           the   right hand end of the              barrier.

              The    h alV cjy^fe lad was            screaming      in de sp er at io n and he had tears                  in

              his eyes.        I think         it was      this that made me          realise       that something

              drastic was        happening.            I edged my way along              the edge of the           barrier

               net was    carried a gain with the m ov ement                     of the    crowd towards           the front

, ,       ^   I didn't     see    that half          caste     lad a ga in but he a p p e ar e d          in real

              trouble.      The    half        caste had dark,           straight     hair and was aged between

              twenty and twenty five.                   I c a n ’t remember anything              else about        him.

              The movement        of the        crowd      carried me towards            the front        of the fence.

              By now I was        having        problem^ with my breathing,                  as    I found       it hard to

              get my head above               the   c/owd to try and take             in a i r «     There was           a man

              down near      the front y o f         the     pen who     could 'see that          I was    having

              problems     so he m a n a g e d to          clear a bit of space            for me.         I was    then

              able    to breath/'a little              bit more.         After    that    I was able        to make my

      ^       way to the          nee    between        pen four and           pen five where        I was       helped over

              four.        I got out of the          pen at about       quarter    past three     (1513).       I

              was abso l ut el y exh au st ed and felt that                I was   in a dream.      From      inside

              pen five       I saw an amb ul an ce        stop by the goal.          I climbed through          the

              gate and went          onto    the track.       I then walked ar ou nd       in a dase for a

              while.       A short     time    later      I saw            a gain and he took me over           to

              the North Stand.              I climbed over         into the N orth S tand and sat down

              about    five    rows back.        Some     time     later           came back     to me and said

              he had found                  and that we were          going to leave the ground.              We all

              left    the ground together and               returned to the        car.   I d o n ’t know what

              time we      left the ground.

              Throughout       the    co/rse    of the a ft e rn o on      I did not see a ny th i ng      that      I

              would    consider/to          be a criminal         offence.

              As a result jfif my e xp er ien ces at H i l l s b o ro u gh          I sus ta in ed bruised          ribs

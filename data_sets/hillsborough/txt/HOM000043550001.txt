        Q.   You came to Sheffield            on 15th April                     this year?           A.        Yes.

        Q.   I think you had also attended                      the same                 fixture last year?
             A.   Last season.

        Q. When you came this year, at what time did you arrive?
           A.   Twenty past eleven.in the morning.

        Q. Did you then visit           a local public house?                                A.     Yes.

        Q. Do you know which one it was?   A.   Yes, I seen it on
           the way down here this afternoon, The Gate.

        Q.   The Gate?    A.        Yes.

        Q.   For how long did you: stay                   in there?   A.   We had been
             since twenty past eleven,                    had our sandwiches and we had
             a pint - I had a pint and                    a half because I was driving
             home;  the other lads had                    a couple of pints, and we had
             left - it would have been                    about twenty past one, made our
             way to the ground.

        Q.   Had the pub been full?                 A.          Not originally                    but people
             had started to come in,               like.

        Q.   Were they all Liverpool supporters                                 or a mixture?             A.     All
             Liverpool and local people.

        Q.   You had tickets,       did you?               A.         Yes.

        Q.    For which part?  A.   Well, out of the party of four,
             two of us had tickets for the Lepping end  and the other
             two lads had the main stand to the left.

        Q.   Whilst you were in the public house, was there any
             discussion or c o n v e r s a t i o n about tickets?   A.   Yes,
             when we were there there were young lads roaming round
             looking for spares, which they normally do at all big games.
             There was one lad       offering Forest end tickets for £10
             and then while that was going on another lad come over and
             said he could get them in the ground.             They had a discussion
                                        D.   PE RRY



and they went out into the corridor.    I went to the
toilet and while I was in there he said he was a steward
and he could get them in for £5 apiece.

Do you know whether, in fact, he was a steward?        A.   Well,
he produced i d e n tif ication and the young lads were happy
enough with it.

What did you understand the arrangement was for them
getting in?    A.   They were all going to give him £5 each
and he would get them in with a couple of his friends that
he was going to get into the  ground himself.

And how many people   did that involve?   A.   I don't know
how many friends he   had with him but there was four or five
young lads around and then they disappeared.

Altogether whilst you were in the public house, how many
people were enquiring about tickets?   A.   There was
them four or five young lads and there was another two
young lads walking round and that was it.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   So - what - he was selling the
tickets for £10 and then wanted £5 for himself, was that
it?   A.   No.   There was a fellow selling Forest Und
tickets for £10 but this other lad approached them, he
could get them in.   He said he was a steward and he could
get them into the ground.

I see,   just £5 and no ticket?    A.    No ticket.

     MR. GOLDSACK:    They just had to see his friend   on
the gate Iafter paying the £5?     A.   They had to see
him.   He was going to bring them in with his own friends.

Is that something that you come across at other matches?
A.   Yes, it is a frequent thing, especially at big games,
if you go to big matches.   It is a regular occurrence.

What time did you actually make your way to the ground?
A.   We left the pub about twenty past one.   We must have
got down there aboit half past one.

Did   you make your way straight into the ground?           A.Yes.

Did you have any difficulty at that time?   A.    No, we just
walked straight up to the turnstile, we were body^searched
and then  allowed to go in.

That is by the police,   is it?    A.    Yes.

Just outside   the turnstiles?    A.     Just   outside   the
turnstiles.

      Q. And to which part of the ground did you go?                  A.   Straight
         into the Lepping end.

      Q.   Through the tunnel?          A.    Through   the tunnel.

      Q.   Into which pen?        A.     Pen 4.

      Q. And at half past one, how full was it?   A.                 It was
         pretty full then.   There wasn't much space               then at that
         time of the day.

      Q.   Were you surprised that it was that full that early?
           A.   Not really, not for a big match.

      Q.   How quickly, ii your estimation,        did it become as full      as
           it comfortably could be?    A.          I would say within a
           good half hour.

^ ^   Q. By 2 o'clock.       A.        It must have had its capacity then.

      Q. After 2 o'clock did the build-up of people in the pen
         continue?   A.   Well, they were still slowly coming in.
         You could see people pushing through, still coming down.

      Q. And at what stage so far as you were concerned did the
         pressure on that pen become unbearable?    A.   Well, we
         felt a large push about,half past two, round about that
         time.   We were shoved down and over to the left a bit
         and then round about 3 o'clock there was another one, and
         that was the main one.

      Q.   So after the push, at half past two, were you still able
           to move around within the crowd?    A.   No, not freely.
           You could just about shuffle yourself but you were jammed
           in then.

      Q.   That was the position,         you say, for about half an hour
           before another  push.           A.   You stood there where you
           were.

      Q.   In the part of Pen 4 where you were, was that the worst
           affected part or not?   A.   Well, after the second crush
           it was.   It was bad then.

      Q.   After that second crush, what was your main assessment of
           what was going on around you?   A.   Well, it was just a
           case of surviving then, literally.

      Q. How far from the perimeter fence were jou?  A.   Must
         have been about 8 ft. from the front and a couple of feet
         in from the adjoining section.

      Q.   Could you see what was going on at the perimeter fence?
           A.   You could see people were disappearing.   They would
           go down out of your sight and that was it.   You knew
                                    83



                                               D.       PE R RY



     if you went   down,   you had gone

Q. Could you see people going over the fence?   A.   After
   a couple of minutes, people were attempting to get out
   but they were getting gestures by the police to get back
   in and that was all you could see.

Q. Could you see the perimeter gate?  A.    Well, it was
   there.   I know it is there at the time.    At the time
   you couldn't notice it but it was there.

Q. So did you simply try and maintain your posiion where
   you were?   A.   That's   all you could do.  As long as
   you stayed on your feet   you were alright.

Q. Did the crush where youewere eventually ease?   A.   As
   people started getting out on to the pitch, after about
   10 minutes it slowly eased off.

Q. Were you conscious of any people immediately next to you
   being in greater distress than yourself?      A.     There
   was two lads on the barrier - one of the barriers behind
   us - they were trapped over   that and they were doubled
   at the bar across their stomach.   We tried      to push
   them off it to give them a bit of breath but we ended
   up hurting them.

Q.   Now, when you; had gone through the turnstiles and through
     the tunnel, had you seen any stewards at half past one?
     A.   No.

Q. At any point?   A.    Not on the inside,               no.     There was
   no-one on the inside.

Q. Did you see police       on the inside?         A.       No.

Q.   At half past one?       A.     No.

Q. When you had attended          the same match    last year --- ?
   A.   Yes.

Q. At what time did you arrive?   A.   We must have reached
   Sheffield about 2 o'clock - Sheffield, by the ground,
   about 2 o'clock.

Q.   So rather later than this year?          A.         Yes.

Q. Did you notice any d ifferences in the o r g a n isation between
   last year and this?    A.   Yes, it was organised last year
   it wasn't this year.    That is my own opinion.

Q.   Let us just explore what you mean.    How was it organised
     last year?   A.   Last year we were coming over the Snake
     Pass, same again as we did this year, and we were stopped
     on the outskirts and the vehicle we were in was searched
                                                                       D.    PE RRY



          for alcohol and we got into Sheffield and we had to park
          away from the ground where this time we were parked
          right on the ground, and we then filtered through the
          crowd with Police Officers in the road.   You had to
          walk through and you had to produce your ticket.

     Q. Roughly how far back from the turnstiles last year
        were you asked to produce your ticket?   A.   it was round
        about where the public house is now, there by The Gate,
        200 yards a w a y .

     Q.   Near   The G3te public hotase?            A.         Yes.

     Q.   And .then what happened after that, last year? A.  Then
          we were fed up to the turnstiles and we were searched at
          the turnstiles and then we were shown where to go.

     Q. Were there      queues?       A.     Small       queues,      not much.
Vj
     Q.   That was just after 2 o'clock.                  A.      Lastyjear,     yes.

     Q. How did you get the impression that the organisation
        this year was d ifferent?   A.   Well, we just arrived
        in Sheffield.    You could see the Police Officers, they
 !      were just all standing round.    They were all having
        comical jokes with the fans and t h a t ;- :it wfeerall good-
        humoured that way - and they were just standing around
        talking to the fans.    No-one actually approached you
        until you actually got to the ground, the turnstile itself.

     Q. What about inside the ground?   Lastyear, did you see
        any stewards?   A.   I can't remember now at the moment
        but there was ---   We were in the Stand last year so
        it was different that time.

                 MR.   GOLDSACK:      Yes,    thank you.

                           Cross-e x a m i n e d   by MR.       WOODWARD:

     Q.   Mr.    Perry, may   I ask you about        last year,         please?
          A.      Yes, sir.

     Q.   Last year when you had gone to the ground,                        to the match,
          you had arrived at about 2 o'clock?   A.                          Yes.

     Q.   ]myour motor car?          A.    Yes.

     Q.    And you had then parked         up.      A.         Parked up.

     Q.    Quite a long way from the ground?                A.   Yes,         we had to
          walk right down the big main road                 that leads        into Sheffield.

     Q.   Do you know where Wadsley Bridge Station                     is?      Whereabouts,
          was it that you pprked, do you remember?                       A.      It was a godd
          way up the road.

                                                                     D.   PE RRY



    Q. Up the hill?       A.       Yes,     up the big hill.

    Q. On the north     side,      as it were,      roughly.         A.     Yes.

    Q. And you walked down?            A.        Walked down.

    Q. And you  say that police officers checked you?   A.   Yes,
       as we were coming down, the Police Officers seemed to be
       strung out across the road.

    Q. Whereabouts was that?            A.        It was just a couple of hundred
       yards off the playing          field,      the pitch, the ground.

    Q.   It was a couple of hundred yards             up the road away             from
         the Leppings Lane entrance?   A.               Yes.

         Was that a solid cordon of   policemen or what are you trying
         to "describe?  A.     No, it was just every so often there
         was a couple of policemen and you just had to pass through
         them to get past them and they just asked you if you had
         a t ic k e t .

    Q.   You were walking      on the pavement,       were     you?        A.      Yes.

    Q.   And the pavement was - what - 10 or 12                ft.    wide?        A.     Yes.

    Q.   And so do   you mean that as you walked along th e pavement
         to go to    the ground here and there you would encounter
         a couple    of p o l i c e m e n ? A. Policemeh U were just
         standing    there.

    Q.   One or other of which        group might         say to you,       "Have you
         got a ticket?"   A.          Yes.

    Q.   It was nothing     more      formal than that?         A.        Nothing more
         formal, no.

    Q.   It was not having      to go through        a solid cordon of police?
         A.   No.

    Q. A perimeter fence or anything like that of policemen.
       It was policemen checking you?   A.   Yes.

    Q.   Not necessarily everyone you passed but, "Have you got a
         ticket?"   A.   Yes.   I think they checked everyone
         because they were strung across the sidewalk so you had
         to go past them to get actually through.

    Q.   But if the pavement is as wide as you have described,
         that would only allow for some supporters and a couple
         of policemen.   A.   Yes.

    Q.   Is that what    you mean?          A.     Yes.

                                                     D.   PERRY



Q.   So the check consisted at some point of a couple of
     policemen asking you if you had got tickets?   A.   Yes.

Q.   Nothing more than that?        A.    No.

Q.   And you were   just asked the once,        were you?      A.   Pardon?

Q.   Just asked   the once?    A.        Yes.

Q.   There were quite a lot of policemen   on your walk to the
     ground in 1989, were there not?    A.     Yes.

Q. You passed them, they were on the sidewalk.  A.  Just
   on the sidewalk, yes.   It was one of the policemen put
   us on to where we parked the car, actually.

Q. The mood was friendly? - A. Very friendly.

Q. No confrontation situation,      jokes being exchanged? - A. Yes.

Q. The Police were obviously interested in the passage of
   people? - A. No, they weren't holding anyone up, they were
   just letting them through.

Q. They weren't holding anybody up but they were keeping an
   eye on people that walked past? ~ A. Yes.

Q. You did not see anybody held up? - A. No.

Q. Eventually you got down to the entrance? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see any Policemen at the entrance? - A. At the
   actual turnstile there was Policemen on either side.

Q. But any on the approach to the turnstiles? - A. Not actually
   ordering anyone round.  They were just stood in groups
   talking.

Q. There was a Police presence there? - A. There was a Police
   presence there, yes.

Q. You were quite early,     this is 1.30? - A. Yes.

Q. So you made your way to the turnstile and you went through?
   - A. After being body searched, yes.

Q. Eventually you went through into the terrace where you
   intended to go? - A. Yes.

 O. Did you notice anything about the throng or the crowd in
    the terrace at that stage, 1.30? - A. Well when we got
    there as I say it was pretty packed out because there was
    a good many supporters on the stand.

 Q. Did you have any difficulty in getting to where you wanted
    to go? - A. Not much.  As I say we were early.

 Q. Is the picture you have of that day of the crowd building
    up steadily? - A. Steadily built up, yes.

 Q.    And like a crowd in the terrace it built up, there was run.
      Did you see the beach ball? - A. I don't think so, no.

 Q.   Singing? -   A. There was singing and shouting.

 Q.    Swaying? - A. Pushing more likely. There was the big
      main push and then it was sort of small pushes.

 Q. When did the main push come? - A. There was one about
    half-past-2, that took up excess space and then there was
    the big one at 3 o'clock, that was the crush in the bodies
    then.

             Q. So there was one at half-past-2.        Did you feel incommoded
                at that time or not? - A. Wo.

             Q. Under any difficulty or embarrassment? - A. No, we were
                squashed.

             Q. How did that compare with your other experiences? - A. Big
                matches that is normal.  At that point it was normal.

             Q. So there was nothing about the state of the crowd at 2.30
                that caused you any concern? - A. No.

             Q. It did not make you uncomfortable?        It did not give you
                any anxiety? - A. No.

             Q. Then you say something happened about 3 o'clock?  - A. Yes,
                there was a surge but you never actually went anywhere.

( ^          Q. Had the game actually started? - A. No.

             Q. The kick-off was at 3? - A. It was round about 3.   I was
                not    sure of the time. At that time if you were on      your
                feet you were lucky, you just stayed that way.

             Q. That second movement that you talk     about was round about
                the   time of the kick-off was it? - A. Yes, it must have
                been.

             Q. Certainly after the team were on the field? - A. Either that
                or coming on the field.  I could not be precise on that.

             Q. But your best recollection is round about 3 o'clock? - A.
                Yes.

                       MR. GLASGOW:    No thank you,    sir.


                                 Re-Examined by MR. C Q L L I N S :

             Q. In your experience is there normally a surge when the teams
                come on the pitch? - A. Not so much a "surge".  It is
                normally jumping about, excitement, and they roar the team
                on like.

             Q.   Can that sometimes create a surge? - A. No,         it normally causes
                  a push to one side or the other.

             Q.   Surges tend to happen do they when for example there is a
                  near miss of a goal or a goal? - A. Yes.

             Q. Or some other exciting moment in the match? - A. Yes, but
                this was not a surge like that.  You knew that something
                was wrong because you never went nov/here, you were trapped.

             Q. Because normally the surge goes forward and then you go
                back again to your original position? - A. That is correct.
                                                  D. PERRY


        Q. This time you are describing something where you went
           forward but stayed forward? - A. You went forward and stayed
           forward and you were under a great pressure.

        Q. And it was at that moment which you put round about 3 that
           you realised something was badly wrong.  Is that the picture?
           - A. Yes.

                   MR. COLLINS:    Yes,   thank you.

                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;      Thank you very much.

                                Examined by MR. PHILIPS;

        Q.   Is your name David Anthony Cruice? -- A     Yes.

        Q. Do you live in                              Ln Liverpool? - A. Yes
kV -■
    1
        Q. You went along to the match on the 15th of April,        did you?
             - A. Yes.

        Q. Did you get in with some friends? - A. Y e s .

        Q. How many of you went altogether? - A. There was four,        well
             including myself there was five.

        Q. Had you bought tickets in Liverpool? - A. Yes, we got them
             from the ground

        Q. And you paid £6 for them? - A. Yes.

        Q. Was this a ticket for the Leppings Lane terraces? - A.Yes.

        Q. Did you all have tickets for those terraces? - A.Wo, three
           of us had tickets for that particular terrace and one had
           a ticket for the North Stand and one had one for the
           Leppings Lane Stand.

        Q. How did you go to the ground? - A. In my car.        There was five
           of us in the car.

        Q. You were driving? - A. Yes.

        Q.   Did you stop on the way?     - A. Yes, we stopped off at a public
             house to use the toilets     and rather than just walk in and
             use the toilets and go        out we got a drink each.  We
             thought it would be a bit     impolite to use the toilets and
             leave again.

        Q. Of course.    You had a drink each on the way? - A. Yes.

        Q.   What time did you get into Sheffield? - A. We went past the
             Leppings Lane end of the ground.  We actually come in round
             the back on the A57 so it meant we had to go past the Spion
             Kop end, up Leppings Lane and we went past the terraces in
             the car about 2.30.

             Q. You were in the car still then? - A. Yes.

             Q. Had you met any trouble on the way? - A. No, none at all.

             Q. You had come across the Snake Pass then? - A. Yes.

             Q. Where did you park the car? - A. It was about a five minute
                walk up the hill from Leppings Lane just directly past.

             Q. Did you know where you were going? - A. Yes, it was, well
                I was not too sure where we were when we went past Leppings
                Lane because as I say I had not been in that way before.
                I sort of went the wrong way which I was supposed to go and
                I come in round the back but I knew how to get back to the
                terraces.  It was just a straight road.

             Q. Had you been to Hillsborough before then? - A. Yes, I was
                there last year for the semi-final and about four years
                ago for a league game.
(
v
    ’)
             Q. So you were about five minutes away from the ground? - A.
                Yes.

             Q. Did you go down towards the ground? - A. Yes, we just
                parked the car and walked straight back down towards the
                ground then.  We could see where we were going so there
                was no problem.

             Q. Did you meet any Police Officers on the way? - A. Yes, there
                was quite a few at a main junction which we had gone through
                to get a parking space.  They were just directing the
                traffic really and keeping the traffic flowing.

             Q. They were on traffic point duty, were they? - A. It was a
                bit of both really.  If you needed the information as to
                where the ground was it was there but you could see the
                ground from where we stood.  I think it was more for traffic
                really or may be enquiries.

             Q. If I showed you a map of Sheffield would you be able to say
                where you parked? - A. Possibly, yes.

                      MR. COLLINS:  Sir, I understand we now have some
                copies of that large plan.  What we perhaps will do is
                find somewhere to stick it up.

                      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I think that might be helpful
                because if I may say so Mr. Poole is doing a great job with
                the model and if we could perhaps have the plan put beside
                it he might be able to use his pointer effectively on that
                as well.

                      MR. COLLINS:  We will endeavour to pin it up on some­
                thing beside the model at some stage by tomorrow.

                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That would be very helpful,   I
                think.     Good.

    q.         MR. PHILIPS:  Have you found where you parked your
         car? - A. Yes, it was either Dixon Road or the one Just
         further up, I think it is Farr Lane.

    Q. Can you just turn the map round so that I can see it? - A.
       It is about t h e r e .

    Q. Just behind the ground then? - A. Off Wadsley Lane.

    Q. So you had to walk downhill then towards the ground? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. And you were coming in along Leppings Lane from the top?
       - A. Yes.

    Q. Had you noticed any difference in the number of Policemen
       about on that occasion from the previous year? - A. Not
       really, there was the same amount of Policemen but they
       did not seem to be doing anything . Last year they were
\      checking tickets and organising people.    This year they
       just seemed to be stood around on the corners ready to
       answer any questions.   That was about it.

    Q. If you did not approach them they did not approach you?
       - A. No, not at all.

    Q. What time would it be then when you got to the turnstile
       area? - A. I would say about 25-to-3.

    Q. And what was the situation like then? - A. It was chaotic.
       I have seen the pictures on the television which seem a
       lot worse than when I was there.  There was a queue may
       be 1 5 / 2 0 ’ back.

    Q. A queue? - A. Well not a queue, I would say just a surge.
       It was like a wedge shape.  It was quite wide at the back
       and everyone was just going towards these two turnstiles
       so you were going nowhere really.  You just could not move.

    Q. You were going through the turnstiles on the right-hand
       side, weren^t you? - A. Yes, I was.

     Q. Did you have any difficulty finding the right turnstiles
        to aim for? - A. I did not have any difficulty finding
        them, it was just trying to get to them was the problem.
        As I say I had been there last year and the time before
        so I knew where I was going really.

     Q. What time did you arrive at the ground the previous year?
        - A. I think that was possibly 2 o'clock, somewhere round
        there, because I had some spare time to myself because
        we got in the ground quite early and I was in the stands
        by myself so I had some spare time.

     Q. I see, so you had come later this year in fact than you
        had the previous year? - A. Well I was planning to get

                                        D.A. CRUICE


      there the same time this year but when I went out to the
      car in the morning I was planning to set off at 10 o'clock.
      I had a few problems  with the speakers in the car.  I
      could not get any sound out of them, so consequently I
      did not leave until 11 o'clock which put us slightly back.

    Q. Had there been many people waiting to get into the tur n ­
       stiles the previous year when you went? - A.No, it was a
       lot more organised the year before.  There was Police
       manning the actual blue railings before the turnstiles.
       I was asked for my ticket there and as soon as I walked
       through there there was orderly queues then.  You know,
       there was nobody allowed to rush in without being checked
       for a ticket.  Everything was slowed down.

    Q. Tickets were checked at the outer railincjs, at the outer
       perimeter fence? - A. Mine and my friends were that year,
       yes.

    Q. And this year how many Policemen did you see about in that
       part of the approach? - A. I saw about four on horseback
       and there was two stood right outside the turnstiles
       where I got in and there was may be another two on the far
       side of the block of people.  They could not really do much.

    Q. What were those Officers on horseback doing? - A. Being
       a nuisance really, to tell you the truth. That is the only
       way I can describe it.

    Q. Well how was that? - A. If I can just pick analogies with
       Liverpool.  With Liverpool Police on horseback he directs
       you to a queue, he will formulate two queues and he will
       stay there.  At Sheffield this year there was horses, he
       was just backing into this big block of people, walking
       through it.  He was not really bothered, any of them.   It
       was a case of trying to get people to move out of the
       way, not forming any queue.

    Q. What about the Policemen on foot outside the turnstiles.
       What were they doing? - A. Panicking.  That is about all I
       can summon up really.  There was two of them there.  There
       was a Policeman there, I would say about 45, round that
       age and one a bit younger and when I got to the front of
       the turnstile the one about 45 you could see the fear in
       his face.  There was that many people.

    Q. Was he saying or doing anything? - A. He was trying     to get
       away from   the turnstile. That is about all he could   do.

    Q. How long did it take you to get through to the turnstile?
       - A. I would say about 15 minutes.

    Q. Did you keep with one of your friends, Andrew Burse? - A.
       Yes, as I  say two of them were in the stands and we lost
       the other   lad who was in the Leppings Lane end, just me and
       Andy.

          Q. Did you go through the turnstile and get your stub b a c k ?
             - A. Yes.   I have given the stub to the Wes t M i d l a n d s
             Police.

          Q. Did you hav e any trouble going through the turnstile
             itself? - A. Yes,           it was        just chaotic.         Say that was
             the turnstile n ext to me, I was stuck agai n s t the w a l l
             here, just trying to lever myself in.                        Tha t took m a y b e
             three or four minu t e s and I was stood nex t to it to ge t
             into it.    T h e r e was just no way of m o v i n g and that w a s
             after the P o l i c e m e n got themselves out of there b e c a u s e I
             think they r e a l i s e d s o m e t h i n g was g e t t i n g out of h a n d at
             that time.      Whe n I finally did get through the
             turnstiles they wer e b o t h inside the ground.

          Q. T h e s e P o l i c e m e n that you talk a bout b e i n g outside the
/"“"a        turnstiles, w ere they w e a r i n g h e l m e t s or flat caps? - A.
V.J          T hey h a d the bi g helmets.

          Q. Y o u got   through the turnstile then?            - A.    Yes.,

          Q. Did the turnstile          itself w o r k a d e q u a t e l y once you w e r e
             inside the tunnel         at the turnstile? - A. Yes, there was
             no p r o b l e m there, s t r a i g h t through.

          Q. Was A n d r e w still w i t h you? - A. No, I h a d lost h i m at
             this time.         W hen I got towards the front of the queue, I
             turned round and I had lost him.           As soon as I got
             through the turnstile I just stood for a couple of
             m i n u t e s and then A ndy came through then.      He h a d m a n a g e d
             to get h i m s e l f through.

          Q. Did you see any p e o p l e g e t t i n g into the ground in any
             other way than through the turnstiles? - A. No, I saw two
             lads c l i m b i n g up on top of the ac t u a l c a n t i l e v e r doors
             bu t they got b a c k d o w n again.       I think there m u s t have
             bee n P o l i c e inside.

          Q. Y o u di d not see any of         the gates o p e ning?     - A. No,     I did
             no t w i t n e s s that.

          Q. W h e r e did you intend to go to w h e n you got into the
             ground? - A. I was not too sure really.          I just w a l k e d
             in and there was just the tunnel in front of me.               There
             w e r e no signs saying to go to the sides.       L ast y ear I
             was in the stands but w h e n I was in the terraces the last
             time it was four years ago, so I h a d for g o t t e n w h e r e to

        Q. Yo u c o u l d not recall the layout of the terrace then? - A.
           No.       Y o u h a v e got to w a l k round the side of Leppings
           Lane.         Y o u do not a c t u a l l y go into it. I just w a l k e d
           d o w n ...

        Q.    Down the tunnel? - A. A l o n g that tunnel,    yes, so I d i d
             not really see any ent r a n c e s towards the terrace   that
             year.

        Q. Yes, I understand.    Y o u say the last time you w ere on
           the terraces   was about four years ago? - A. Yes, and then
           I was on the   far right han d side at the top end then.

        Q.    I do not suppose you could r e m ember very  well by then? -
             A. No.     As I say, it was a long time ago and    it was not
             really a m a t c h to r e m e m b e r either!

^""v\   Q« So you went straight         through the tunnel?     - A. Yes.

        Q. Was A n d r e w w ith you then? - A. Yes. W e had bot h just
           g one into the toilets and then we came dow n and w a l k e d
           d own the tunnel on to the terraces.

        Q. Did you h a v e any trouble going through the tunnel? - A.
           No, it was clear then, just a few p e o p l e w a l k i n g through.

        Q. Did you see any stewards or Po l i c e Of f i c e r s ? - A. No.
           That was something I found strange really.                    As soon as I
           w a l k e d in, I only saw the two P o l i c e O f f i c e r s who w ere
           o u t s i d e and they wer e just b r u s h i n g themselves off and
           g e t t i n g themselves together and the only stewards I saw
           were...         It is the steps up into the stands, the
           L e p pings L ane stands, the right h a n d ones as you go in.
           T h o s e were the only stewards I saw and they were only to
           stop the terrace ticket hold e r s g oing up into the stands.

        Q. The y w ere actually on the steps themselves?            - A. Yes,
           that was the only r e a s o n they were there.

        Q. The y ear b e f o r e had yo u seen any mor e stewards about on
           the inside of the ground?               That is to say, on the inside
           of the turnstiles? - A. A g a i n I c ould not really say
           b e c a u s e it is not som e t h i n g you look out for.   I was
           m a i n l y just standing b y the canteen.        I just went
           straight to the stands and stood by the canteen for half
           an hour, forty-five minutes.

        Q. W h e n   you got through the tunnel, w e r e you able to get
           down      that straight away, or did y o u h a v e any diffic u l t y ?
           - A.      It was quite tightly pa c k e d w h e n we got there.
           When      we got to the b o t t o m of the tunnel we turned right
           into,      I think, pen 3.

                                                          D. A. CRUICE


Q. W h e r e did you stand in pen 3 w hen you first got in there?
   - A. It was about quar t e r of the way down, and I w o u l d
   say about half way across.

Q. A bout to the mid d l e of the pen then?             - A. Yes,    and a b o u t
   a q u a r t e r of the way down.

Q. Wha t time w o u l d this be then? - A. I w o u l d say we got
   into the ground about ten minutes to, so I would say
   about two minutes later, something like that.

Q. Was there room for any mor e p e o p l e in that pen w h e n y o u
   got there? - A. Not really, no.                   It was pretty well
   tightly packed.              As I say, when I w ent d own that tunne l
   I was not p l a n n i n g to go in that pen.               I looked, and I
   thought, with o u t seeing any other entrances you were
   suppo s e d to go in, w a l k d own the b a c k of the pens to go
   into outer pens, but as soon as y o u w a l k e d in there I
   r e a l i s e d once I was in that I was not going a n y where
   else.          T h e r e were p e o p l e coming in be h i n d me so there
   was no way of g e t t i n g bac k out really.

Q. Did you not see any way through to the outer pens? - A.
   No.        The only e n t r a n c e I saw was the big tunnel.          I
   w a l k e d d o w n there e x p e c t i n g to be abl e to wal k right
   across.           I k n e w by the time I ha d got in it was g o i n g to
   be tightly pa c k e d b e h i n d the goal as it always is.              With
   my not seeing any signs to other ent r a n c e s I thought I
   could w a l k a long the b a c k and get into o uter pens then.

Q.    Yo u w a n t e d to go to an outer pen, did you? - A. Well, I
     was not p l a n n i n g on d o i n g that b u t as soon as I got
     behind the goa l and got in that p e n I thought it w o u l d
     h a v e b een be t t e r to.      I was p l a n n i n g to move right over.
     I had a look around and there was n o w h e r e to go.

Q.    Did yo u not see a g a t e on the d i v i d i n g fence b e t w e e n pen
     3 and 2 at the back? - A. No.             As I say, it was that
     tightly packed.           We just got in there and thought
     well...         We h a d a look around.       I thought it w o u l d just
     be a walkway, w h i c h I think was just commonsense, and
     there was noth i n g there.           Anyway, I just stayed there
     b e c a u s e there were p e o p l e coming in beh i n d me.

Q. W ere you close to a barrier? - A. Yes.                  We h a d a b a r r i e r
   just in front of us.           Me and A n d y w ere stood side by
   side and there w ere two fellows in front of us who wer e
   o b v i o u s l y friends. T h e y w ere a g a i n s t the b a r r i e r just
   in front of us, sort of b e t w e e n us and the barrier.

Q. Did there come a time w h e n there was a p u s h from behind?
   - A. Yes.           I would say it was just a couple of minu t e s
   b e f o r e the kick-off b e c a u s e the last thing I r e m e m b e r is
   the N o t t i n g h a m Forest team being a n n o u n c e d on the tannoy.

Could you hear it f rom w h e r e yo u were? - A. Yes, I c o u l d
hea r that*       It was not too bad.       It was a decent
tannby.     T h e r e w ere no problems w i t h it.  That was the
last thing I remember, really.

            LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR: Y o u c ould mak e out what was
said?          Not just h e a r that it was there?        Yo u could
a c t u a l l y m ake out the names? - A. I c ould actua l l y m a k e
out the names, yes.

           MR. PHILIPS:         Did something h a p p e n to your fr i e n d
A n d r e w at this time? - A. Yes.           It started gett i n g a lot
w orse then.         W h e n we first got in there it was like a
full h o u s e at L i v e r p o o l in the Kop.     It was tight but
there was a good mood.               W e were laughing and joking.
T hen suddenly And y seemed to end up against the barrier.
He was sort of bent do u b l e over the barrier.               He lo o k e d
round at me and h i s face was dea d red, like, he could not
breathe.        Y o u c ould just see the fear on his face an d he
saying, "Get me off.               Get me off".

W h a t di d you do? - A. I was still stood by the side of
h i m at this time.      I put ray arms over his shoulders like
that to d rag h i m off and I was scr e a m i n g to people b e h i n d
to p u s h b ack and pul l h i m bac k w i t h them.   He just c o u l d
not move.       Th e force was that great.         I was just trying
to p u s h and pull him b a c k all the time.

Did you get any h e l p from anybody else? - A. Yes.                As
soon as I asked for h e l p just a load of h a n d s came over
and started d r a g g i n g h i m bac k as soon as they r e a l i s e d
s o mething was wrong.

Did you in fact try to mov e your p o s i t i o n to h e l p him? -
A. Yes.         A f t e r a co u p l e of seconds I r e a lised he was not
g oing to be g oing anywhere.               As soon as we pulled h i m
off the force just pushed h i m b a c k on again.               I managed
to get myself round his b a c k and I m a n a g e d to slide round
the barrier.              I caught my legs a c o u p l e of times.     I
got b r u i s e d up and d o w n my legs. I finally m a n a g e d      to
get round to the front of h i m and his hea d was d own by my
s t o m a c h then.        He was just bent double.          I put my arms
on the front of his shoulders and pu s h e d him right up
again.         I was scr e a m i n g for p e o p l e just to get b ack and
a g a i n somebody p u l l e d h i m and he m a n a g e d to get his h ands
in front of his hips then to lever h i m s e l f off.               I
started d r a g g i n g h i m round the back, trying to d r a g hi m
to the end of the b a r r i e r then.

To b r i n g h i m in front of the b a r r i e r you mean?       Where
you were? - A. Yes, I was trying                to do that.

W e r e yo u able to do that? - A. I got h i m so far.           I got
h i m - say this is w h e r e we were stood to b e g i n w i t h and I
                                                     D. A. CRUICE


got h i m just   on the cor n e r of the barrier, but w i t h the
arms and the     legs co m i n g d o w n he was jammed in it then.
He c ould not    m ove his legs any further.         He was trying
to pull them     round.

S tuck b e t w e e n the struts and the b a r r i e r itself do y o u
mean? - A. Yes.          I got h i m to the co r n e r of the b a r r i e r
and h e could not m o v e any further.          He got his leg r o u n d
one of them and then the force a gain was just p u s h i n g the
bar into his groin.          Tha t is w hen I lost sight of h i m
then.

Did you see anybody g e t t i n g out of the pen? - A. I was
c o nscious of people g e t t i n g out.         I was not actually
s tanding there w a t c h i n g them b e c a u s e it was just total
mayhem.     I was c o nscious of people c l i m b i n g over a r o u n d
me and trying to get out at that time.

W h e r e wer e they c l i m b i n g to? - A. J u s t mainly into the
o p p osite pens.      The m a i n place w h e r e I saw - as I was
f acing to the ground I think it was                into    pen  4.They
were c l i mbing over and being pul l e d           over    by people.

If it was on your right         it w o u l d be pen 2? -    A.   Yes.

They were c l i mbing into pen 2? - A.            Yes.

Wer e yo u able to see into that pen from w h e r e yo u were? -
A. No.     It was as if n o t h i n g was going on outside that
pen.     I did not even k n o w they h a d kicked-off.              I did
not even k n o w they ha d actua l l y star t e d playing, or the
game h a d a c t u a l l y b e e n stopped. Y o u r w h o l e w orld was
just in that one pen at that moment.

Did y o u see somebody else that yo u took n o t i c e of?               A
girl? - A. Yes.         A cou p l e of m i n u t e s later after I h a d
b ee n pu s h e d further down.      It was g e t t i n g really tight.
I could h a r d l y m ove my arms.         T h e n a f e l l o w shouted that
there was a g irl in trouble.              I turned round and she was
just agai n s t my s h o ulder there.            I did not even k n o w she
was there until I looked.            T h e n this fe l l o w grab b e d h e r
ar o u n d the hips and lifted h e r u p as far as h e could.

Was she not s t a nding up? - A. Yes, well, she could not
move. ^ She just looked up at me for m a y b e h e l p or
something.          T h e f e l l o w picked h e r up by the hips and I
g r a b b e d he r round the ankles and we lifted her up and she
went dow n over p e o p l e ' s heads then.

P a s s e d forwards.   - A. That was     the last I saw of he r
then.

Q. Did yo u mov e from your position?               Did you mov e f o r w a r d
   during the co u r s e of... - A. Yes, I was c o n s t a n t l y b e i n g
   pu s h e d forward from my p o s i t i o n w h e r e I was.

Q. Ho w far from the front fence did you finish up? - A. I
   would say it was about may be 10 - about 15 to 20 feet
   bac k from the actua l gat e in the fencing. I think o n e
   of the barriers was a couple of feet in front, the f inal
   barrier, before the fencing.

Q. Did you see anyb o d y on the wall on the o ther side of the
   fence? - A. I saw P o l i c e m e n there.   They wer e on the
   fence, like standin g on the c o n c r e t e and they w e r e a b o v e
   the fence?

Q. H o w many?    - A.   I think there were            three,     p o s sibly four
   there.

Q. Wha t     wer e they    doing? - A. We w ere screaming at them to
   o pen     the gates     b e c a u s e pe o p l e w ere gett i n g c r u s h e d d o w n
   at the     front.       They w ere just telling us to go b a c k out
   of the     exits.       W e c ould not even turn round at this
   time.

Q«LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLORi               Could yo u h e a r what they
     wer e     saying? - A. Y o u wer e sort of read i n g their lips,
     saying, "Go to the e xit" and they w ere p o i n t i n g over
     towards that way.        T h e r e was just no way.        T h e r e must
     h a v e bee n thousands of people.

Q«               MR* PHILIPS:    At that time was there anyb o d y on
     the floor? - A. I never a c t ually saw it myself.           I was
     c o nscious of it b e c a u s e as I looked d o w n towards the
     front there was not exac t l y p e o p l e standing up against
     the fence, if yo u k n o w what I mean.         They were being
     c r u s h e d and somebody shouted out that there were pe o p l e
     d ying and gett i n g c r u s h e d on the floors.    It was as if
     there was a void b e t w e e n just w h e r e I was and the ac t u a l
     fence.         There were no actual h eads to be seen.       It was
     if they were p o s s i b l y on the floor.

Q. Lying down? - A. Possibly.           I c ould not see.          It was
   just the fact there seemed to be a g a p b e t w e e n w here I
   was stood and the front of the fence.           N o r m a l l y y o u just
   see h e a d s going straight d o w n and there did not see m to
   be any there.

Q. Was this the si t u a t i o n whe n the P o l i c e were on the wall
   u s h e r i n g you to go backw a r d s ? - A. Yes.          They were
   telling us to stop the pushing.                I do not think they
   k n e w that the gates o u t s i d e h a d b e e n o p e n e d b e c a u s e they
   wer e telling us to b a c k off and go out of the exit.
   T h e r e w ere times whe n I c o u l d not e ven breathe, the
   p r e s s u r e was that severe.

       Q. Do you remember the gates of the p i t c h being opened? - A.
          I never a c t u a l l y s a w that myself.         I was just s c r e a m i n g
          for them to open the gates and yo u could see the p e o p l e
          agai n s t the fences.          We were just screaming for them to
          open the gates.             I m a n a g e d to turn round and I was just
          shouting to peo p l e to pus h back.              Suddenly I was a w a r e
          they wer e open.          It seemed a long time after wha t they
          should h ave been, after we first a sked for them to be.

       Q. A f t e r the gates w e r e open did you see people b eing taken
          out? - A. Yes.            It seemed s u d d e n l y the p u s h i n g s t o p p e d
          then and the gates w e r e opened an d the P o l i c e wer e jus t
          dr a g g i n g bodies out and d r a g g i n g pe o p l e out.        T h e r e was
          no big mad rus h for the gates by an y o n e who was stood up
          w h e r e I was b e c a u s e you c ould see there wer e so many
\— J      pe o p l e on the floor.         If you h a d tried to get out you
          w o u l d h ave been stand i n g on people.

       Q. Th e Police w e r e d o i n g this, wer e they, p u l l i n g them
          through the gates? - A. Yes, they were trying to, but as
          I say, they w e r e just jammed p a c k e d there.

       Q. Did you see some pe o p l e who wer e b e i n g pu l l e d b a c k the
          other way on to the terrace? - A. I d i d not a c t ually
          witness that, no.      I saw people runn i n g dow n from w h e r e
          I was to h e l p people.

       Q. Did you see some o n e on the floor in the terrace near your
          friend Andrew? - A. Yes.                    A f t e r the gates h a d been
          opened every o n e seemed to r e a l i s e s o m e t h i n g had g o n e on
          w h i c h should not h a v e done.                I w e n t b a c k up to find Andy
          b e c a u s e I did not k n o w whet h e r he was all r ight or not.
          Wh e n I finally found A n d y there was a man lying on the
          floor on his b a c k w i t h his arms by his side.                       His face
          was just dead blue.                T here w e r e some lads k n e e l i n g over
          him.          They wer e just ordinary supporters.                     I do not
          think they k n e w him.              A n d y was leaning a g a i n s t a
          barrier.            He ha d h urt his legs so I told h i m to lean on
          me.         W e w e r e just s h o uting to these lads to start
          b r e a t h i n g into him, m a y b e give h i m m o u t h to mouth.

          leaning over him, saying they di d not k n o w w h a t to do.
          My mat e And y just said, "Start b r e a t h i n g into his mouth".
          Y o u c o u l d see it was no good d o i n g a n y t h i n g for hi m but
          at least s o m ebody was trying for him.

       Q. I think you s a w some P o l i c e m e n than taking part in trying
          to reco v e r some of the injured peop l e ? - A. Yes.                 I was
          looking round me to see if there w e r e any Po l i c e m e n
          there.      The gate was open.           We shou t e d for a P o l i c e m a n
          to come u p and h e l p him.       F i n a l l y one cam e runn i n g up to
          us.    T h e fe l l o w was still lying there.           The P o l i c e m a n
          took his pulse, c h e c k e d his eyes.

So you did not se e any s t e w a r d s near to th e g a t e w h e r e you

You say w h e n yo u got to t h e end of t h e tunnel you w e r e
c a t a p u l t e d ? - A. Yes.

What do you m e a n by t hat? - A. The s u r g e co m i n g t h r o u g h the
t unnel was p r e t t y tight as y o u come out of t h e t u n n e l , and it
was just like a c a t a p u l t i n g e f f e c t d o w n t h r o u g h into t h e
t e r r a c e s . I was t aken a l o n g and t h r o u g h w i t h th e s u r g e of
people.

Did you g i v e any thou g h t of t r y i n g to go back and find t h e
e n t r a n c e to the stand? - A. O n c e I was in t h e tunnel and I
r e a lised I was g o i n g on to t h e t e r r a c i n g I did try and
a c t u a l l y go back, but w i t h t h e s u r g e of p e o p l e t h e r e was
no c h a n c e of g o i n g back.

And so w h e r e did you fina l l y end u p ? - A. A p p r o x i m a t e l y just
to the right of the goal, a bout 3 or 4 p e o p l e off the front.

T hree or 4 p e o p l e back from th e p e r i m e t e r fence? - A.           Yes.

What s t a g e was that?        W e r e t h e players on t h e field? - A. Not
t hat I saw, no.

C ould you in fact see the pit c h ? - A. All I could see was the
t op of th e goal.        The top of th e g o a l m o u t h was all I could
r e a l l y see. T h e r e was th e p e o p l e in front and that was it.

At that s t a g e did t h e r e app e a r to be any p a n i c a m o n g s t t h e
cr o w d ? - A. T h e r e was still p e o p l e s u r g i n g from the t o p of the
t e r r a c i n g behind me, and t hey w e r e com i n g d o w n from behind me
instead of s p r e a d i n g o u t s i d e th e thing.      So the crush was
g e t t i n g p r e t t y bad then.

Did you at any s tage b e c o m e a w a r e of t h e players b e i n g on the
field? - A. I did a c t u a l l y s e e B r u c e G r o b b e l a r once, f i l t e r i n g
t h r o u g h t h e heads of people.

W e r e you w e r e w h e t h e r or not   the g a m e had ki c k e d off? - A.        I
t hink that was just p r i o r to          the k ick off.

At w hat s t a g e did you b e c o m e w o r r i e d ? - A. It must h ave b een
w h e n the players cam e out on to t h e pitch.             I only had an
i n d i c a t i o n of that way, but at that t i m e th e c rush was bad,
very b a d .

So far as you recall was it a st e a d y b uild up or was t h e r e a
p a r t i c u l a r su r g e ? - A. A f t e r I first cam e h u r t l i n g d o w n the
t e r r a c i n g t h e r e was a s u r g e then, but a f t e r a w h i l e that
s eemed to stop, and t hen it was just a g r a d u a l build u p of

          landed i m m e d i a t e l y a d j a c e n t to me.   He was blu e and c o l o u r i n g
          all purplish, and his eyes w e r e round t h e back of his head
          somewhere.            I d o n ' t t h i n k he was breathing.   I don't know.

           Q. Did you summon any assistance for that man?       A.   I tried
              to give him the kiss of life myself.      I mean, I was trapped
              up to my waist in bodies and I tried to give him the kiss
              of life and I   was screaming, you know, "Don't die on me,
              mate" and all this, and then after that, like, I remember
              turning round and looking up and there was a group of Police
              Officers there, maybe seven or eight of them, and I s c r eamed
              at one in particular, "Get them out.       Get this guy out,
              I think he is dead."     He bent down and tried to drag
              this guy clear but he couldn't because the guy was like
              myself, he was buried up to his waist in bodies.       His
              c olleagues just seemed to be standing around, just mill i n g
              around, and I   had to lean back up again and, you know,
              start lifting    all the legs and arms and all that, so
              we could drag this guy clear.

           Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     This was seven or eight
                Officers on the.inside of the pen?    A.   On the inside,
                standing on the terrace.

           Q.   They had come in from the tunnel    or what?        A.   I have no
                idea.

           Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:  Were you at this stage still just
                a few feet back f®om theperimeter fence?    A.    A bit
                further,   like.   Obviously the fall had took me back some.

           Q. And where were the six or seven policemen in relation to
              you and the entrance to the tunnel?     A.   They were
              standing   immediately behind me at a distance of 3 ft.
              or so.     I don't know how long they had been there, you
              know.

           Q. Did you see any other policemen in Pen 3 at that stage,
              apart from the group of six or seven?   A.   In the
              actual terracing?

           Q.   Yes.   A.   Nio.

           Q.    So there was just the one substantial   group      of them?
                A.    Yes, that is all I was aware of.

           Q. At that stage how much had the crowd thinned out?
              A.    A lot of the crowd at that stage were on the pitch.
              A pparently they had gone out from the back of the terracing
              somewhere, I don't know where.

           Q. And apart from the man that you were trying to assist, do
              you know whether at that stage there were other people still
              on the ground?   A.   There was a lot of people there,
              lying in front of me on the ground, yes.

           Q.   Was that man eventua lly   taken out?   A.     Yes.

Q.   Via the tunnel?      A.     Yes.

Q. Were you in fact injured yourself?   A.   Yes, I had my
   arm trapped in between two people standing next to me,
   type of thing, and I got a numbness across the top of my
   forearm through to the thumb through the crushing.    I
   think it is just trapped nerves or something.

Q. Which route did you leave by?   A.                I think   I went   out   back
   through the tunnel where I came in.

Q. Well now, were there any differences that you noticed
   between this year and last year?   A.   One immediate
   difference that I noticed, as we pulled in on the coaches
   last year there was a group of say three or four Officers
   asking for tickets as we stepped off the coach, whereas
   this year there was none.  There was Officers standing
   about but they wasn't doing anything, just stood there.

Q.   Where had you parked the coach last year - in a   proper
     coach park or ---?   A.   There is a police station there,
     a traffic police station at the top of the road.

Q. Clay Wheels Lane?   A.    I am not sure.               I am not aware
   of the name of the road.   It was opposite             there.  It was
   the same place both years.

Q. Any other      differences between the two years?    A.   As               I
   said, the      police asked to produce tickets as and when
   they were      getting off the coach last year whereas this
   year they      wasn't.

Q. What about      as you a pproached     the entrance in Leppings
   Lane?    A.       Well, I noticed      there was a lack of police
   pres ence,      basically.

Q.   This year?     A.   Yes,   this year.

Q. What about last year in Leppings Lane itself?   A.   In
   Leppings Lane itself, I couldn't state with any certainty
   to be honest with you.

Q.   Now what about inside the ground last year?   Did you
     know where to go?   A.   Yes, like I say, I was in the
     North Stand last year.

Q. Had you been to the North Stand before?     A.                No.     I
   was with a lad who had been before p r eviously              so ---

Q. Can you recall whether         or not there were any stewards on
   show last year?   A.           I couldn't statd with any certainty,
   no.

              A.   Yes.

         Q.   It is usual, is it not, when you get into a ground,
              particularly if you are an away supporter, to find
              directional signs telling you where to go and stewards
              to help you on your way if you do not know?    A.   Yes.

                             Cross-e x a m i n e d   by MR.    WOODWARD:

            relation to the entrance to the ground?   A.     Opposite the
            police station, same as it was this year.

         Q.   And when you got off the coach on that occasion, what
              happened?   A.   There were three or four policemen asking
              you to produce tickets as we got off the coach.

         Q.   About what time was that last year?   A.   It                     mgst have
              been about the same time, quarter past one or                     so.

         Q.   And then you had made your way to the ground much as you
              did in 1989?    A.   It was more or less a repeat
              p erformance except for the fact that I was in a different
              stand this year.

         Q.   Were there many     coaches in 1988 up at the same place?
              A.   Yes.

         Q.   The same sort of number as this              year?     A.     Yes,      I would
              say so, yes.

         Q.   Did you see any p o l icemen        up around    that area?            A.     Yes.

         Q.   Thjsjyear?   A.      Yes.

         Q.   And you made your way down to the ground.  Did                     you
              e ncounter policemen on the way?  A.   Well, I                     didn't
              count.

         Q.   I am sorry, did you meet them on the way?                    A.        Yes,
              I spotted one or two, you know ---

         Q.   But you were not looking out for policemen.                       A.    No,
              I wasn't counting them, you know.

         Q. Did it strike you that there was any unusual number of
            police about?   A.   There seemed to be ---   The year
            before there seemed to be a much larger police presence

               on show,     type of thing,    you know.

          Q.    The crowd that you made your way with to get to the gates,
               to get to the turnstiles from the coach, was it the
               same sort of volume?    A.   I would say so, yes.

          Q.   Each >ear?      A.    Yes.

          Q. Nothing very differ ent?            A. No,not much         that            I noticed

          Q.You went and had a drink this year?                 A.      Yes.

          Q. And is it right        that the public house was really too                       full
             of fans?   A.          Not too full, like, but it was full.


   G      Q. Was that the same as last year?
             a drink at the  same place?   A.
                                                  Did you stop and have
                                                  Not at the same place.
             It was the pub  next door last year.     There are two pubs
             adjacent to each other.

          Q.   Eventually you       made your way to    the ground?                A.    Yes.

          Q.    As you got close to the ground, were you able to walk
               conveniently along the pavement or was there quite a crowd
               of people in 1989?    A.   In 1989?

          Q.   Yes, this year?    A.         It was a fair volume of people,                     yes
               Nothing excessive.

          Q.   Nothing unusual?         A.      No. No.

          Q And then you came to the gates           at the     perimeter fence.
             A.   Yes.

          Q.   Giving access to the turnstiles.                Were    they open this
               year?  A.      Yes.

          Q.   Did you see many police around there?   A.                     The only
               two I seen in that vicinity was two Mounted                    Policemen.
               That is the  only ones I seen.

          Q.   You saw them, did you, between the turnstiles and                         the
               gate?   A.No, they were actually on     the gate.

          Q.   Actually     on the railings gate?         A.         Yes.

          Q.   On the outside,      next to the kerb?           A.          Yes.

          Q.   In front of which, the 1-16 or the A-G turnstiles?
               A.   I think it was the A- G but I am not sure at the
               moment.

                                                   P.   CUNNINGHAM



Q.   You only saw two Mounted Police?   A.        That is all I
     seen in that vicinity.   There may have      been more, I
     don't know but ---

Q.   You were not looking   out for them?      You just happened
     to notice two.    A.     I wasn't aware of any, you know.

Q.   And then you made your way to get down to the turnstile.
     Were the police giving instructions to the crowd, those
     on the horses?    A.   No.

Q.   Were they not doing anything?      A.     They were   just sat
     on the horses, stood there.

Q.   Not doing anything apart    from sitting on the horses?
     A.  Not doing anything.

Q. What about the crowd of people?   Were they making their
   way round the horses?   A.   They didn't have to make
   their way round the horses.  Like I say, they were on the
   edge of the gate, type of thing, so the gates were open,
   they were on that side of the gate so the people just had
   easy access.

Q.   Just walked past?      A.   They had easy access,      yes.

Q. Did you recognise     any of those police officers?
   A.   No.

Q.   Because there were some Liverpool       Police, Mounted Police
     there.  Did you know that?   A.         Yes, I did hear that,
     yes.

Q.   Then you went through the gate    and up to the terrace.
     A.   Yes, with my ticket still    in my hand unused.

Q.   You described how you.went along the tunnel and how you
     came out of the tunnel on to the terrace.   A.  Yes.

Q.   Did;>ou go straight forwards at that point?   A.   Not
     straight forward, I wouldn't say.    It was a bit of a ---
     I don't know, like a train of people coming through.
     There was like a surge, type of thing, and I skeetered
     off to the right slightly.   I have got no actual accurate
     r ecollection of ---

Q.   Having come through the tunnel exit on to the terrace, did
     you more or less go straight down or did you go in a
     diagonal direction?      A.   It was difficult to tell.   I
     mean, it is a c o n fusing moment actually, as I was actually
     c atapulted on to the terrace.     It is difficult to assess
     which way you were going.

                                                           P.   CUNNINGHAM



Q.   Because you said that you ended up about three                  or four
     people from the front.   A.   Yes.

Q.   That means   from the      fence,   the perimeter      fence.     A.   Yes.

Q.    Would you have a look, please, at photograph 24 in the
     Inquiry bundle, the large bundle.     (H a n d e d )  That shows
     the pen into which you went, does it not?          A.   Yes.

Q.   And that is a view showing on the left-hand side of those
     photographs the railings that divide Pen 4 from Pen 3?
     A.   Yes.

Q.   Orvthe left-hand   side.      A.      Yes.

Q.   One can just see.    In about the centre of the photograph,
     running at a slight angle but a few steps down the terrace,
     one can see that barrier.  A.  Yes.

Q. And beyond that barrier down to the perimeter fence is
   perhaps 8, 9 or 10 steps;  it is difficult to see there.
   Do you? see? A.   Yes .

Q.   Are you saying that you went          beyond that     barrier?
     A.   Yes.

Q.   In the way you came out of the tunnel?   A.   Not immediately
     as I come out of the tunnel.   I mean, the crowd was going
     haywire from there, like, as you come out of the tunnel,
     so you couldn't assess any general  direction in which I
     was going.   I was at the mercy of the crowd, basically.

Q.   That is what I want to ask you^about because the
     description is of you being catapuJted more or less so far
     to where you ended up.   A.  Yes, eventually, like.    I
     mean, there was three or four minutes had elapsed before
     I actually ended up where I was.

Q.   So from coming from the tunnel exit to where you stopped
     was three or four minutes.     You could raofe get to the
     position in which you stopped without having to in some way
     get past that barrier, could you?     A.      Yes.

Q.   How?   A.   I am agreeing with          you,   yes,    I had to get
     by that barrier somewhere.

Q. Did you go under the barrier?              A.     Not that       I can recall,
   no.

Q. Did you go over the barrier?              A.     Nd,    I must    have gone
     round it.

Q.   You must have gone round        it?     A.     Yes.

                                                   CUNNINGHAM



Q.   If you went round it, that means you must have gone down
     towards the position where we see irathat photograph the
     barrier that has failed?   A.   Yes, but the final
     stopping point was much left -- further to the left of that.

Q.   So having gone round the barrier,   you then came to rest      in
     a position somewhere to the left.     A.   Yes.

Q. What - in a sort   of line with the goalposts     as we look    in
   the photograph?     A.     More or less,yes.

Q.   So you had made your   way in this    manoeuvre from the tunnel
     exit diagonally, in fact, round towards the end of the
     barrier on the right and then along the steps in front of
     that barrier back towards the pen? A.  Slightly, yes.
     I must have b e e n «  Where you can see the fencing
     being ripped open and the gate, I must have been somewhere
     in the middle of that.

Q.   Or was it just a case of you not being catapulted along
     but worming your way through to get to the position you
     wanted to get to?    A.    Certainly not, no.   I was
     catapulted.  I mean,    like I say,  I was at the mercy of
     the crowd and, like,    it was just  pushing going on all
     over the place.

Q. Was it like anything    you had been in before?      A.   No.

Q. Did there come   a time when you were concerned     for yourself?
   A.   Yes.

Q.   When was that? A.      I have no estimation of the exact
     time.   I should imagine it would be about kick-off time -
     there or thereabouts.

Q.   So it was about kick- o f f time that you started --- A.  The
     match may have kicked off, for all I know because I couldn't
     see anything of the pitch.

Q.   So it is not earlier than kick-off time that you are
     concerned for yourself?    A.  I was concerned right the
     way through but not  concerned for my life, no.

Q.   Were you making any endeavour - whether it is possible or
     not is another matter - but were you making any endeavour
     to go in a different direction?      A.    As I said before,
     you'* we re just at the mercy of the crowd.

Q.   Was that a good position from which    to view the match -
     the one which you did get to?   A.      No, because I couldn't
     see anything.

Q. Why' was that?   Why couldn't     you see in that position?
   A.    I don't know.   I mean,     I don't know whether everyone       just

           in front of me seemed to     be bigger than me, I   don't   know,
           like, but the way it was,    I just couldn't --

      Q.   Because the terrace slopes downwards with the steps.
           How tall are you?    A.    At that point, you are more or
           less looking up anyway.     I mean, you are not looking
           down on the pitch there at that point, you are looking
           up, and all I could see from where I was standing was
           the top of the nets.

                                         P. CUNNINGHAM


Q. The concern you had, is it about the time of the kick-off
   particularly? - A. There or thereabouts, yes.

Q. Some four or five minutes after you had been on the terrace
   roughly?:- A. Roughly, yes.

          MR. WOODWARD;    Thank you.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. G L A S G O W :

Q. Mr. Cunningham, just one matter.  You have described the
   way in which you were carried in with the crowd through
   that gate? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that still the impression you have of being carried
   along regardless of where you wanted to go? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you in fact have any choice where you went at all or
   were you simply carried along? - A. No, you were at the
   mercy of the crowd, as I have said.

Q. I think Mr. Cunningham it is not your fault but some people
   may have the impression if there had been Policemen or
   Stewards around you could have stopped, passed the time of
   day with them and asked themewhere the West Stand was, but
   that is ludicrous, isn't it, you could not stop and talk
   to anybody in that situation? - A.No.

Q.    Of course you couldn't. We have had the advantage most
     of us of seeing a film of people coming in through that
     gateway.  I don't suppose you have seen that on television,
     have you? - A. No.

Q. I can tell you, because I don't think it will be disputed,
   that there were some Policemen and Stewards standing inside
   the gate through which you came.  If that is right, and I
   have to put it to you in that way to be fair, if that is
   right did you have the chance to see them at all as you
   were catapulted past them? - A. No, as I say I never saw
   any Police or Steward present.

Q.   And you would not have had any opportunity of talking   to
     them even if you had been aware of them? - A. No.

           MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much, Mr. Cunningham.


                    Re-Examined by MR. C O L L I N S :

Q. Can I just follow up from that.      I think what was being
   put to you was that you were catapulted through the gate
   when you first came i n t o .the ground.  I don't think you
   told us that? - A. No, I was not catapulted through the
   gate.  I walked through the gate.

                                        P. CUNNINGHAM


Q. As I understood what you were saying, when you got to the
   end of the tunnel that is when you were catapulted, as you
   put it, and were at the mercy of the crowd and going down
   into Pen 3? - A. Yes.

Q. But when you actually came in initially to the ground through
   that open gate how did you come in then? - A. Just walked
   in.

Q. Did you notice any Steward or Police Officers around then?
   - A. Two Police Officers, mounted Police Officers.

Q. Apart from the mounted Officers? - A. No.

Q. When you actually got into the ground did you notice anyone?
   - A. On the terracing?

Q. No, no, when you get in through the gate because the gate
   lets you in to the other side of the turnstiles, as it were,
   although you did not of course go through any turnstiles?
   - A. No, I did not see any Policemen there.

Q. Did you want to find someone to ask the way or not? - A. I
   had already asked a mounted Policeman:  "Where do I go for
   the West Stand?"  He just nodded his head.

Q. He nodded towards the gate? - A. He nodded in the general
   direction of the crowd.

Q. Did you think that the tunnel was the way to the Stand when
   you first went into the tunnel? - A. I thought there would
   be some sort of separating area.

Q. When was it that you first realised that you were not going
   to the Stand but you were going to the terraces? - A. When
   I was actually in the tunnel.  Just as you were going into
   the tunnel you could see at the end of the daylight the
   terracing.

Q. Nov/ once you were there was there any turning back? - A.
   There was no turning back, no.

Q. That was because? - A. The sheer pressure of the crowd took
   you along.  The momentumfof the crowd took you away.

Q. In fact there is we know at the back of the stand a stairway
   up? - A. Yes.

Q.   You may now know? - A. Yes,    I know now, yes.

Q.    Can you look, you have got the bundle of photographs in front
     of you, if you would be good enough to look at Photograph 17.
     That is the scene that would have faced you as you came in
     through the gate very roughly.    You can see the tunnel ahead
     with the big number "2" above it.    To the right of that there
     is a stairway, do you see, with a blue gate at the bottom?
     - A. Yes.

Q. The gangway is Y and Z? - A. Yes.

Q. That in fact is the way up to the stand but did you spot
   it at the time? - A. No.

Q. There is no sign is there which says "Stands" specifically?
   - A. There was just a mass of people around there like, you
   know, immediately in front of you.

           MR. COLLINS:    Yes,   thank you.

           MR. HYTNER;  Sir, can I just say that Mr. King will
     continue to represent the families today, tomorrow and
     Friday.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you.     Yes, thank you very
     much indeed.

                      Examined by MR. P H I L I P S :

Q. Is your full name Keith Leonard? - A. Yes.

Q.   Do you live in the Liverpool 8 District? - A. Yes.

Q.   Your occupation is a Council Housing Warden.          Is     that right?
     - A. Yes.

Q. On the 15th April you went to Sheffield, did you,               to see
   the match with Nottingham Forest? - A. Yes.

Q.   And    had you a ticket for that? - A.             Yes,    I had a       season
     ticket allocation.

Q.   You have got a season ticket for Liverpool,         have     you? - A.    Yes.

Q.   Are you a keen   supporter of Liverpool? - A. Yes.

Q. Had you been to the match the year before? - A. Yes.   I was
   in the West Stand the year before, the stand above the
   te rr ace s.

Q. So you would have gone in through the same entrance the
   year before? ~ A. No, because the ground entrances are to
   the right, the stand are to the left.

Q.   You would have gone in through the Leppings Lane             gates the
     year before? - A. Yes, but as I say ....

Q. Through a different turnstile? -         A. Through a different
   turnstile.

Q. How were you going to get to Sheffield from Liverpool? - A.
   Sorry, how was I or how did I?

             Q.   How did you? - A. By mini bus with a group of friends.

             Q.   How many people did you go with in fact? - A. Ten   of us.

             Q.    Did you have a reasonable journey to Sheffield? - A. From
                  what I can gather.    There was a bit of a delay as we got
                  towards Sheffield over the Pennines area.    We went on the
                  motorway route because last year or the year before when
                  we went we went across the Snake Pass and that was worse
                  probably, the year before.

             Q. Did    you have any stops on the way? - A. No.

             Q. Did     you have any alcohol in the mini bus? - A. Well a few
                had   a couple of cans early on, may be a can or two each,
                but   we knew anyway from the year before the coaches and that
                you   could not have alcohol in Sheffield anyway so we did
                not   bother taking many cans.

             Q. So by the time you got to Sheffield had they all been con­
                sumed? - A. Well there was only a couple of cans each,  if
                that.  Some people did not even have a drink.

             Q. Was your mini bus stopped when you got to Sheffield? - A. No.

             Q. Had you been stopped the year before? - A. Yes.

             Q. Had    you gone by mini bus the year before? - A. Yes.

             Q. Where did you park the mini bus? - A. Up the long road where
                all   the coaches were, you know, towards the back part of
                the coaches.

             Q. Were there any Police about when you stopped? - A. A few,
                not so you would really notice but there were a few around.

             Q. Did you have any Police come on to your mini bus when you
                stopped? - A. No, we parked them on a side street.

             Q. How far from the ground would you have to go? - A. 10-15
                minutes may be.

             Q. On the way down there did you go straight to the ground?
                - A. Yes.

             Q. What time had you arrived there do you think? - A. Approxi­
                mately 2.30.

             Q. Were there other people going down to the ground as well
                as you? - A. It was a steady stream down that road, mainly
                the pavements ....

             Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  2.30 at the ground? - A. At
                  the actual ground.  When we stopped off it was approximately
                  quarter-past-2, something like that when we actually got
                  off the bus.

Q.          MR. PHILIPS;   So you get to the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you notice any differences on your way to the ground from
   the year before? - A. Well the year before we came from a
   slightly different direction so we parked not in that long
   road, in another road coming in from the opposite direction
   of Leppings Lane.  I don't know what the road is called
   but that is a fairly main road as well.  I d o n ’t know the
   name of it.

Q. Had you noticed any difference on your way to the ground
   with regard to the presence of Policemen? - A. Again it was
   a different road so I could not really say but again there
   was just Policemen generally dotted about. However, it was
   quite late when we got there last year.  It was about lO-to-3
   with the traffic coming across the Snake Pass.  It was quite
   late last year when I got there.

Q. I see.  On this occasion were there Policemen dotted about
   as you went down? - A. Yes, there were one or two on corners
   and one or two walking along slowly alongside and that.

Q. When you got to the entrance       to the Leppings Lane turnstile
   did you know where to go to?       - A.Not immediately but I had
   a rough idea and then I just       looked for Section B, standing
   only, so I went to those six       turnstiles, to that side.

Q. Did you see many Policemen about then? - A. Not in that
   particular area round by the wrought-iron gates.  There was
   just too many people around.  It was such a block there and
   wedge shape of people at the standing section turnstiles
   going into Section B.  It was already very full then.

Q.   When    you got there it was already full? - A. Yes.

Q.    Were you able to see on to the other side of the fence, the
     Turnstiles 1-16? - A. Would that be like one of the standing
     sections, seated sections sorry?

Q. Yes? - A. No, well I did not really take much notice of
   those because I was heading towards 'B' so I did not really
   look in towards that.

Q. Were you able to get through the crowd towards the turnstiles?
   - A. Not at first, no.  I got to about the wrought-iron
   gates and the crowd was more or less up to there.  You know
   it was very solid at the front towards the turnstiles so
   I just decided to make my way into the crowd because by
   then we thought we were going to be queueing up for about
   quarter-of-an-hour here, 20 minutes at least to get in.

Q. Gan you say how long it took you to get from the back to
   the front? - A. Well I must have got in approximately
   10-to-3, 5-to-3, between 10-to and 5-to-3.

Q. So that would be what, something like 20 minutes then to
   get from the back to the front? - A. At least a quarter-of-
   an-hour or so, yes.

                                      K. LEONARD


Q. Did you notice any Policemen while you were going through?
   - A. Yes, there were one or two.  There were a couple of
   mounted Policemen around by the wrought-iron gates and I
   did see one or two to my right-hand side as you are going
   into the turnstiles.

Q. Mounted Policemen? - A. No, standing Policemen,   foot P olice­
   men.

Q.   What    were they doing? - A. They were just    standing  tothe
     side of the crowd from what I could see.  Again I did not
     take a great deal of notice of those.

Q.    Did you see what any of the mounted Policemen were doing?
     - A. Well they did not seem to be doing anything to control
     the queue.   Well I am saying "queue".  It was not a queue.
     It was obviously just a mass of people in front of the turn­
     stiles.   One mounted Policeman did just come back into the
     crowd and he seemed to just back into the crowd and people
     moved out of the way. Obviously you move out of the w a y of
     a horse, of course.

Q. The horse was going backwards,   was it? - A. I mean not charging
   into people but you know moving back, moving backwards towards
   people and that, so people were just moving out of the way.

Q. People were able to get out of the way, were they? - A. Well
   as best as you can get out of the way.  This was right at
   the back.  This was at the back by the wrought-iron gates.
   This was not in the main part of the crush.

Q. Were they annoyed about it? - A. Well I suppose one or two
   were; .not happy about a horse pushing you out of the way but
   there was no aggression or anything like that.    There was
   the odd shout may b e .

Q. Did you see any disturbed behaviour outside the turnstiles?
   - A. None whatsoever.  It was very full, obviously, but
   no violence or aggressive behaviour.

Q. Did you have any trouble getting through the turnstiles when
   you got to them? - A. Yes, as soon as we got to near the
   front of the turnstiles we had to sort of push your way
   to the sides to actually get into the turnstile itself.
   You could not just go directly   in. You had to sort of
   push yourself through into it.    By the time you got to the
   turnstiles it was quite full.

Q. While you were waiting to get into the turnstile did you
   see     people getting in by any other way? - A. I did see
   one or two climb up on to the concertina gates to try and
   get in there.  I don't know whether they got over or not.
   I did not really notice.

Q. When you got through the turnstiles were you with any of
   your friends at that time? - A. Just the one, yes.

Q.   What's his name? - A. Jacques Mareau.

Q.   He was going through with you to the standing area, was he?
     - a . Yes, that is right. There was only us two together
     going into that section.  The others had stand tickets.

Q. Did he come through straight after you? - A. Within a
   few seconds.  He was the second or third person behind me
   or something like that.

Q. Were people actually going through the turnstiles at a
   reasonable rate? ~ A. Well it was not easy to get into the
   turnstile but I suppose once you got in there you just
   more or less went in, so once you are actually in the
   turnstile itself it was alright but it was getting up to
   it that was the problem.

Q. T h e p r o b l e m was g e t t i n g into it in the first place?         - A.
   Yes.

Q. When you got to the other side of the turnstile w h e r e did
   you go to then? - A. W a i t e d for a few seconds for my
   friend, obviously, and then just s t a nding round by the
   front - well, the inside of the turnstiles then, and
   star t e d w a l k i n g towards w h e r e you c o u l d see the tunnel
   e n t r a n c e into the ground.

Q. H o w m u c h did you kno w about the layout of the ground
   be f o r e you got there? - A. Well, a little bit.         As I
   say, last year I w ent in the stand above, so you hav e to
   go up those stairs and there there are stewards and
   P o l i c e who take your ticket and c h e c k your ticket to go
   up the stair.        As soon as I w a l k e d in I just saw the
   tunnel entrance.

Q. Y o u h a d gone up the stairs at the rear of the s t a n d . . . -
   A. Tha t was the year before.

Q. Yes.    You said there were stewards            and P o l i c e m e n   there
   the yea r before? - A. Yes.

Q. W h e r e they in fact there this year as well? - A. Well, I
   di d not go to the s tand stairs.     I did not go near them
   at all.

Q. Y o u did not see them?       - A.No.

Q. As yo u wer e g o i n g across the yard towards the tunnel did
   s o mething h a p p e n b e h i n d you? - A. Yes.   J ust as I was
   w a l k i n g away from the turnstiles, just after I got inside
   into the open area b e t w e e n the ground, I looked to my
   right.         Jus t as I looked to my r ight the gate was
   opened, the small c o n c e r t i n a gate to my right h a n d side
   was op e n e d up and a large amount of pe o p l e w e r e let in.
   This was a p p r o x i m a t e l y ten to or five to three.

Q. Y o u h a d come in thro u g h the turnstiles A to G and it was
   the gat e on the r ight h and side of yo u that was open? -
   A. Onc e you are inside the turnstiles it is on your right
   h a n d side.

Q. T h a t wil l be gate C? - A. Yes.

Q. W h a t effect d i d this have? - A. I just saw the gates
   opened.           It was fully opened and a large amount of
   p e o p l e started c o m i n g in.      As soon as I saw that I
   s t a r t e d w a l k i n g away towards the tunnel e n t r a n c e so I did
   n ot look bac k a g a i n to see h o w m any p e o p l e c a m e in.     I
   just n o t i c e d that it h a d been o p e n e d and a few w e r e let

in - well, I c ould not say h o w man y w e r e let in, to be
quite honest, but the gate was cer t a i n l y fully opened.

Did y o u join the pe o p l e coming through the tunnel fro m
the gate? - A. No, b e c a u s e by then I was half way across
the open area and I just started to w a l k towards the
tunnel myself.

When you wen t into the tunnel w ere you able to w a l k d o w n
the tunnel all right? - A. Yes, not too bad.     It was not
a b s o l u t e l y full.

W hen you got to the end of the tunnel w h i c h side of the
fence did yo u go? - A. T h e d i v i d i n g fence to the right.

To the right,       pen 3.       Is that right?        - A. Yes.

W hat time w o u l d it be w h e n you got on to the terrace? -
A. I cannot be exact but I w o u l d c e r t a i n l y say
a p p r o x i m a t e l y five to beca u s e w h e n I got in the first I
n o t i c e d was that Ala n Ha n s o n was playing, w h i c h h a d no t

Yo u saw h i m on the pitch? - A. Well, he was w a r m i n g u p in
the w a r m ups be f o r e the game, so I k n o w it m u s t h a v e been
a round five to or just after.

The players w e r e alre a d y out on the p i t c h w h e n yo u got      to
the terrace? - A. Yes.

W ha t was   the terrace      like that you w a l k e d into? - A. Very
full.

Was there roo m for any more people? - A. It is d i f f i c u l t
to say b e c a u s e as soon as I got on to the terrace yo u are
sort of forced into the c rowd a little bit and I just
star t e d to mak e my way down as best I c o u l d into the
c rowd somewhere.

H o w far did you get? - A. A f t e r about a couple of minu t e s
m ost of the way towards the front, you know, w i t h a bit
of p u s h i n g - well, not my s e l f pushing, but push i n g in the
c rowd and just trying to w o r k your wa y through, you know,
to get a better v i e w really.

H o w c l o s e to the front fence di d yo u get? -A. I ended up
at the front barrier, as you are in it, the left han d
corner, p r o b a b l y a little bit further along a p p r o x i m a t e l y
there.

Th e front    left han d barrier?        - A. Yes.

Th e one n e a r e s t the p e r i m e t e r fence?   - A. Probably,   yes.

Were there peo p l e in front of you? - A.               No.      I was
crus h e d agai n s t the b a r r i e r myself in the end.          As I
say, first of all yo u do not n a t u r a l l y get straight
b ehind the b a r r i e r but w i t h the w e i g h t of peo p l e and it
was so full I b e c a m e p u s h e d a g a i n s t the barrier, you
know, one of the c r u s h barriers.

Were there peo p l e on the other side of the barr i e r in
front of you? - A. Yes.

A lot of people? - A. Well, there wer e a lot of p e o p l e
all round.   It was o b v i o u s l y very full.

Did you h e a r anything?         Did you hea r people s h o uting? -
A. Well, at that stage o b viously I k n e w it was very full
and there was a p r o b l e m w i t h the c r u s h of people.        Then
I started to pus h e d a g a i n s t the b a r r i e r and I was in
agony then.       I was d o u b l e d up over the barrier.          B ent
over like a "C" shape w i t h my h e a d forced down.             I was
c rus h e d on my hips and groin area on to the barrier.
Yo u know, the w e i g h t of pe o p l e b e h i n d me.

Y o u could not p u s h back? - A. Yo u p h y s i c a l l y could not
p ush b a c k at all.        I was s c r e a m i n g in the end, " Push
back.        Push back.         I ca n n o t b r e a t h e here", b e c a u s e the
w e i g h t of pe o p l e on me c r u shing me agai n s t the barrier.
It was just u n b e a r a b l e but you just p h y s i c a l l y c o u l d not
move.        Unlike, say, at Anfield, I am use d to big cro w d s
and n o r m a l l y it w o u l d not w o r r y me as much.          Normally
you can p u s h y o u rself b a c k or m o v e a bout or m o v e from
side to side, but I jus t c ould no t m ove at all.                         Not an
inch hardly.

W er e there people as w ell as y o u rself shouting out in the
crowd? - A. Yes, there w e r e plenty of pe o p l e shouting
out.     People were scr e a m i n g in agony.    I was s c r e a m i n g
out myself, " Push back".          I was really p a n i c k i n g at that
time.

W er e you able to see anyb o d y o u t s i d e the pen on the
t rackside of the fence? - A. No, not a soul really at
that stage.      Jus t b e f o r e I was co m i n g in, as I was
settl i n g in to that p o s i t i o n I d i d n o t i c e pe o p l e even
then - well, there w e r e one or two - trying to c l i m b over
the fences.      T h a t wa s p r o bably r o u n d a b o u t just be f o r e
kick-off I w o u l d imagine, or at some stage then.

Did yo u see any P o l i c e m e n or s t e wards on the other side
of the fence? - A. Not that I n o t i c e d b e c a u s e as I say,
by then I was very crushed.                A t the stage w hen I was at
the b a r r i e r I do not r e m e m b e r anything.    Well, I did not
see a n y t h i n g about the match.          I did not even k n o w we
h a d k i c k e d - o f f or anything.

Did you manage e v e n t u a l l y to get into an upright
position? - A. Well, it mus t h ave b e e n after about ten
minutes.      As I say, whe n I was p i n n e d against the
barr i e r I was in that p o s i t i o n for about ten minutes -
five or ten minutes anyway.               I shouted to my friend who
was in front of me, in front of the barr i e r - you know,
like I am c r u s h e d a g a i n s t the b a r r i e r and he is in front
of me to try and pus h me back.                 He just could not.       He
was frantic.        He was push i n g as h a r d as he could.          I
was using all my s t r e n g t h w i t h my hands to try and p u s h
myself bac k and I j ust c ould not.

Did you see then w h e n ten minutes later you w e r e able to
get upright? - A. As I say, my h e a d was bent over and I
kept saying to m y s e l f - you know, it was h a r d to get your
b r e a t h beca u s e w i t h b e i n g d o u b l e d over there w e r e p e o p l e
a bove me and I was g e t t i n g no air at all - I was just
saying to myself, " Just keep b r e a t h i n g slowly and try and
k eep calm", b e c a u s e I kne w at that stage just h o w b a d the
sit u a t i o n was.       Again, I just kept doing that and
e ventually I m a n a g e d to lift my h e a d up again and get
some m o r e air, but I still c o u l d not see a n y thing at all.
I did not k n o w the g a m e was on or a n y t h i n g at all.                 I
could hea r the o c c a s i o n a l roar of the crowd.                I presumed
it h a d kicked-off, but that was all I knew.

Y o u did not see w h a t was h a p p e n i n g a r o u n d you? - A. No,
not at that stage b e c a u s e I was far too packed in.

W hen did yo u start to be aware of w h a t was h a p p e n i n g
around you? - A. A g a i n I can only say it was
a p p r o x i m a t e l y ten m i n u t e s or so a fter I was in that
p o s i t i o n and the p r e s s u r e r e l i e v e d ma i n l y be h i n d me
obviously, b e c a u s e I c o u l d not go forward anyway w i t h
be i n g on the barrier, so I r e a l i s e d then I could m o v e a
little bit and I c o u l d p ush my s e l f off the barrier
slightly.               At this s tage I s t a r t e d to stand up and I
r e a l i s e d there was a bit more roo m b e h i n d me a n d to the
sides of me.               It was p r o bably a m i n u t e or so later w h e n
I c o u l d stand up p r o p e r l y that I n o t i c e d to my right h a n d
side at the front of the fence a bout two or three yards
away, m a y b e a little bit more, w e r e just a pil e of pe o p l e
four or five dee p just p i l e d at the front of the fence.

Di d yo u see the c r u s h b a r r i e r to the right of the one
a g a i n s t w h i c h you h a d been... - A. No, I did not n o t i c e
the barrier, I just sa w the p e o p l e s t r a i g h t away.

Di d you see at that time whet h e r the gat e in the
p e r i m e t e r fence was open? - A. No. Well, I am saying
no.         I did not see.

Did you see anyb o d y on the p e r i m e t e r fence on the o ther
side? - A. Not at all b e c a u s e im m e d i a t e l y I sa w the

     pe o p l e in front of me my initial r e a ction was to pic k
     them up and try and ge t them out.               I ran over to w h e r e
     they w ere all lying an d immedi a t e l y n o t i c e d the p e o p l e at
     the b o t t o m of the pile w e r e in a very b a d way.       Yo u
     c ould see their faces were like a bluey-white.                Their
     lips were purple.        I even sa w one man w i t h vomit come
     out of his mouth.        He was o b v i o u s l y in a bad way.

     I ran over towards the pile of pe o p l e and started to h e l p
     to p i c k some o n e out from the n e a r e s t on the top of them.
     I g r a b b e d one man by his arms and tried to pull h i m o u t
     from amongst the people, b a ckwards towards me.                         Another
     lad jumped in to h e l p me and he s t a r t e d pulling w i t h me.
     This man seemed to be OK.                He see m e d to be b r e a t h i n g so
     we said to some lads behind, "Look a fter him.                         He is
     OK".         I then w ent b a c k to try and pull somebody else out
     from amongst everybody.                 The next pe r s o n we tried to
     pull out, we c o u l d not free hi m at all.                   His w a i s t a n d
     legs w ere in a m o n g s t everybody.            I was trying to pul l
     him w i t h this o ther lad.             H e was h e l p i n g me.     In the
     end I ha d to shout anot h e r lad to get his legs, to
     w r i g g l e his legs free to h e l p to pull h i m out.                In the
     end we got h i m out as well, again h o p e f u l l y he was all
     right.         T h e r e se e m e d to be signs of life.

Q. T h e r e were two or three of you p u l l i n g them out b a c k of
   the... - A. Well, the two or three immedi a t e l y by me, I
   c annot say if a n y o n e else was d o i n g a n y t h i n g b e c a u s e you
   a re just looking at that one cert a i n thing you are d o i n g
   yourself.

Q. Y o u di d not see any pe o p l e g o i n g out through the fence or
   o ver the fence? - A. Not at that stage b e c a u s e as I say I
   was far too busy h e l p i n g out.

Q. T hen did you see a time whe n P o l i c e m e n c ame into the pen?
   -A. Yes.      This again was from the stage when I went in
   to h e l p to pull p e o p l e out.     I w o u l d say it was five
   minu t e s or so bef o r e any Po l i c e a c t u a l l y came on to the
   terrace to help.

Q.   Did you see w h e r e they came from? -              A. I think from that
     gat e w h i c h was p r o b a b l y slightly to my left, w h e r e I was
     standing then in a m o n g s t behind the p ile of w h e r e mos t of
     the pe o p l e were.        T h e gates w o u l d p r o b a b l y be slightly
     to my left.

Q. You m e a n they came fro m the p i t c h side? - A. Yes.

Q.   Rather     than from thro u g h the tunnel?         -   A. Yes.

Q.    Can you say h o w m any P o l i c e m e n c ame in then? - A.
     A p p r o x i m a t e l y four or five, I think, at first.

W h a t did they do? - A. They m ore or less tried to take
over the situation themselves r e a l i s i n g the fans ha d d o n e
as m u c h as p o s s i b l e in helping. The n they sort of m o v e d
past me and went themselves to go and h e l p and as s i s t as
mu c h as possible.

Did you see the fence at the front b e i n g pu l l e d up,
broken up? - A. No, I did not see it pu l l e d up.                    After a
few minutes I did not k n o w what to do then because
o bv i o u s l y other p e o p l e had taken ove r and I was also in a
lot of agony w i t h b e i n g hurt myself, so I was bent o v e r
and I thought I w o u l d get out of the terrace and on to
the pitch.          That gate was open then, the gate that leads
on to the pitch.             I w a l k e d u p to that and I n o t i c e d then
that the wir e m e s h nex t to it ha d been partly ripped
open.

Did you get through that wir e m e s h or through the gate?                          -
A. T h r o u g h the gate itself.

Did you h e l p take a n y b o d y out through the w ire mesh?                   - A.
No, not at that time.

Yo u say not at that time... - A. No, sorry, I am sa y i n g
at that stage I d i d not do any more.      I wal k e d out o n to
the pitch.    I was a little bit d a z e d then as to w h a t to
do next.

Did you see people g oing through that h o l e in the fence?
- A. I did not personally.

W h e r e d i d you go to w h e n you got on to the pitch? - A. I
wen t towards the goal m o u t h and I was still looking for
my friend who I had lost at the time, just before the
c r u s h be c a m e unbearable.             I was looking round for h i m
and an y o n e else that I knew.                   A f t e r a few minutes I saw
that eve r y b o d y was s t a r t i n g to h e l p peo p l e on the pitch.
T h e r e w ere peo p l e lying down, p e o p l e giving the kiss of
life.          I saw these lads s t r u g g l i n g w i t h one of those
ad v e r t i s i n g h o a r d i n g s to take the lads across towards the
eme r g e n c y post at the o ther end and I said I w o u l d give
them a h and w i t h that*                 I g r a b b e d h o l d of the b o a r d and
ran across myself towards that e m e r g e n c y first aid a rea
in the o p p o s i t e corner.

H o w m any trips did you make w i t h the board? - A. I m ade
that trip and then I cam e b a c k again.                I was still
l ooking for my friend and then I saw again there wer e
mor e p e o p l e in n eed of stretchers.              I saw these lads
t rying to b r e a k a f ence in half, on e of the big
a d v e r t i s i n g hoardings.     I h e l p e d them to b r e a k that and
we c a r r i e d anot h e r pe r s o n over towards the e m e rgency
first aid.

I think you e v e n t u a l l y met up w i t h your friend? - A. I
saw h i m again.      He h a d remained on the terrace, pen 3,
w h e r e it all happened.        I was looking round, trying to
look on the p i t c h for anybody I knew, p a r t i c u l a r l y my
friend.       T hen I saw h i m in pen 3.        I shouted to him.
He be c a m e a little bit upset then.           A Pol i c e m a n c ame up
to h i m and put his ar m round h i m and said h e w o u l d take
h i m out at the back, m e a n i n g towards the bac k of the
terracing and out that way.            He said, "He'll be all
right", so I went to see if there was a n y thing else I
c ould do and go and tell the other people that w e k n e w
that we w ere all right and that.

                         d o n ' t know.  Unless it was to try and form an orderly

                         "queue" is not the r ight word, really.              The mass of p e o p l e as

                       T h e r e was no wa y to s t a r t anyway.      It was just a w e d g e of
                       people.        You just had to get in and go forward.

                    Q.    W e r e you p u s h i n g in? - A. No, just g e n e r a l l y t r y i n g to get
                         into the turns t i l e s like e v e r y b o d y else.

                         of y o u ? - A. As you w o u l d in any queue, behind   p e o p l e or to

     mass of p e o p l e like m o s t p e o p l e did to get into the
     turnstiles.

Q.   You w e r e intent on g o i n g in to s e e the game.              You did       not w a n t

Q.   Y ou g o t thro u g h the t u r n s t i l e ?   - A. Yes.

Q.   And yo u did not go s t r a i g h t on          w h e n y o u got through.   You

     s t a r t e d w a l k i n g across the ope n area just past the turnstiles,
     and as I looked to my r ight that g a t e was o p e n e d and the
     p e o p l e star t e d c o m i n g in then.      So by then I am h a l f w a y across

     entrance.

Q.   So y o u c ame all m ixed u p w i t h them, did y o u ? - A. Well, no,

   through.

Q.   No t b e i n g d r i v e n ? - A. No, you could       not pus h in o n e way.       You
     had to try and m a k e y o u r wa y t h r o u g h     the best possible.

Q.   Would it be right to s a y w h e n you g o t to the p o s i t i o n you

Q. Yes.        It p r o b a b l y would be a v e r y s i l l y thing to ask you but
   do you h a p p e n to k now the e x a c t time that you are talking
   a b o u t ? - A. Again, I can o n l y g ive yo u a rough idea because of
   the fact w h e n I go t into the t e r r a c e I know the players were
   w a r m i n g up.      That is the onl y thing I know in terms of time.

Q.   I d o n ' t m e a n to be rude. That does not help us because we
     kno w the incidents w e r e onl y 3 minutes apart. - A. Oh, well.

Q.   Whe n you e n t e r e d t h e ope n area it was r e l a t i v e l y clear of
     p e o p l e ? - A. Yes.

Q.   But to h a v e the l o c a t i o n s p r e c i s e the only stewards and Po l i c e
                                                                K. LEONARD


w h o m you s a w w e r e to you r r ight by          the in s i d e of the g a t e and
the t u r n s t i l e s ? - A. T h e g a t e that     was opened, and a l s o as you
c ome into the t u rnstiles there are                 t h r e e or four of t h e m that
stand t h e r e and n o r m a l l y sea r c h or      just check that t h e
turnstiles a r e all right and that.                    So t here w e r e a c o u p l e -
th e r e w e r e a few t here as w e l l .

     LOR D J U S T I C E TAYLOR:  That is Police, not s t e w a r d s ? - A.
Police, yes.       I did not se e any s t e wards there.

        MR. GLASGOW:        W h e r e did you se e the s t e w a r d s ? - A. I seem
to r e c o l l e c t whe n the g a t e was opened t h e r e was c e r t a i n l y a
P o l i c e m a n there, but I do feel t h e r e was a steward t h e r e w i t h
a y e l l o w jacket on as well.          Again, I did say in my s t a t e m e n t
I c an't be t o t a l l y exact, but from my r e c o l l e c t i o n of s e e i n g
the p e o p l e co m i n g in I w ould say t h e r e w e r e P o l i c e a n d a
stew a r d there.

A g a i n I d o n ' t w ant u n f a i r l y to hold you to y o u r statement.        I
am s u r e you w e r e d o i n g you r best, but you use d the s e n t e n c e
"the o n l y P o l i c e and s t e w a r d s " that you sa w w e r e i n s i d e the
t u r n s t i l e s ? - A. I am sorry, that was p r o b a b l y just a gene r a l
phrase.             It was only P o l i c e I sa w just in s i d e the turnstiles.

Did you intend to say you had s e e n any s t e w a r d s , or can you
not n o w r e m e m b e r one w a y or the o t h e r ? - A. I cannot r e m e m b e r
se e i n g any s t e wards e x c e p t at t hat g a t e w h e r e it was o p e n e d .

Ho w m a n y stewards did you se e at the g a t e ? - A.               I t h i n k there

learned friend, but I just think it r ight to put on t h e r e c o r d
that I am not sur e I would a g r e e e n t i r e l y w i t h the u s e of the
word "running" w h e n the g a t e was first opened.               C e r t a i n l y they
came in m u c h m o r e q u i c k l y on the first o c c a s i o n than o n the
second occasion, but w e can all see the film anyway.

        L O R D JUST I C E TAYLOR:      Yes.




 /MR.    GLASGOW:       Sir,   I d e l i b e r a t e l y took it in v e r y much.
          MR. GLASGOW:   Sir, I deliberately took it in very
     much shorthand.   Perhaps it would be helpful if e v e r y ­
     body sees the film at some point -  Itdo not know who
     has - because I would very respectfully maintain p r e cisely
     the Words I used.   There is the very clearest evidence
     of people running and it is quite an important point.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Well, there will be o p p o r t u n i t y
     for anybody to see it.    Has everybody now got access to
     it, whether they have actually seen it or not?   E v e rybody
     has.

          MR. COLLINS:   Sir, if ithelps, although we do not propose,
     subject to your direction, to show the film as part of the
     Inquiry as such, but I shall make arrangements so that the
     press or any members of the press who want to see it can
     because I think that would be helpful.   Of course, so far
     as supporters and so on are concerned, the Football
     Supporters' A ssociation have a copy, as do the repr e s e n t a t i v e s
     of the victims and therefore no doubt arrangements can
     be made for anyone who wishes to see it to do so, because
     there are those spare copies.

          LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:       Yes.

          MR.   KING:    That   is the position.

                           WAYNE WINDEVER, called

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Mr. Windever, it is a very
     big room, this, and although we have got assistance you
     must speak up a bit, please.    I did not catch your answer.

     A.    No.   I lost them by the Spion Kop end.

          MR.    GLASGOW:   It is very difficult             to hear.

     friends by the Spion Kop end, is that right?   A.   Yes.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I wonder if you                would try and
     speak closer to that.    That is better, and                 as clearly
     as you can, please.

     for about half two.

Q.   Were you on'your own then?                A.     Yes.

              the tunnel?     A.   No.

         Q.   You were not being      forced along,      were you? A.           No.

(    )   Q. What made you decide to go where you went?   A.                            I don't
    vy      know, because that's where I ended up last year,                          actually.

         Q.   You wanted    to have   the same position            - it was a godd, s p o t ?
              A.   Yes.

         Q. And that position was - what - down close to the per i m e t e r

         Q.   The fence with the mesh in it?    A.               Yes.         I got

         Q.   I am sorry, would you repeat         that.           A.      I asked     them   if
              I could get past them.

Q.   They let you through.       A.     Yes.

Q.    You moved through and managed to get your  way down.
     Did you go under any barriers?    A.    When I got right
     down to the very bottom, there was like a barrier there
     and I had to get un derneath it.

Q.   So that the crowd was such that it was allowing            you
     to come through. A.  Yes.

Q.   How tall are you?      A.   Pardon?

Q.   How tall are you?      A. About 5 ft.     8.

Q.   And the crowd   let   you go through?     A.   Yes.

                                              W. WINDEVER


        Q. At that stage were the teams out on the pitch? - A. Yes.

        Q. And up till this time had you any worries or concern for
           your safety whilst you were coming down the terrace to
           get to your place? - A. No.

        Q.    How did it compare with your normal experience of a football
             match? - A. It was the worse one I had ever been to.

        Q. Up to this time.     What was different about it?  This time
           once you were in    the ground making your way to your place
           you wanted to go,   what was different about it from any other
           big game you had    been to? - A./The way it was organised and
           that.  There was    no directions to say:  "Go that side or
           go that side".

^   )   Q. But you knew where you wanted to go, didn't you? - A. But
           that is where I went last time.

        Q. But this time you wanted to go to the same place, didn't
           you, so you knew where you wanted to go, didn't you? - A. Yes.

        Q.   So you did not need to have any directions,   did you? -   A.
             No.

        Q. Because you were intent on going up to that spot behind the
           goal? - A. Yes.  When I go to the Kop at Anfield I go behind
           the goal then.

        Q.    It is a good place to see the action? - A. Yes.

        Q.    You just made your way, passing people, moving through
             quite normally to get down to the front? - A. Yes.

        0. And by the time you got to the front to the fence, the teams
           were on the pitch but the game had not started or had it?
           - A. I don't know.   I could not see nothing. When I come
           through I only see the players on the pitch so I made my
           way down to the front.

        Q. Were they just warming up? - A. I think so.

        Q. You have told Counsel that there was a stage when you saw
           someone trying to get over the fence to get out and you
           saw a Policeman do something? - A. Yes.

        Q.    What did you see a Policeman do? - A. Beat   someone in the
             face.

        Q.    You see you made a statement about this about your   experdi&nce
             at the match and there is no mention in it about a    Policeman
             hurting anybody? - A. Well I seen him do it.

        Q.    Yes, you say that now. That was something that must have
             stock in your mind? - A. But I did not fancy saying that
             like on the statement.

                                             W. WINDEVER


    Q.   Why not? - A. Because I wanted to    bring it out on the     day-
         like when I come down here.

    Q.   I am sorry? - A. I just wanted to    bring it out when I come
         down here.

    Q.   Well why are you saving it? - A. I don't know.

    Q.   What was the point of saving that serious matter? You were
         asked to make a statement to tell it all, weren't you?
         - a . Yes, but I could not think like what happened at the
         time.

    Q. At the time you could not  think what happened but this  is
       a statement that you made quite recently, isn't it, within

o      the past fortnight or so? - A.,Yes.

               MR. WOODWARD;  There is no date on it sir.         I beg
         your pardon, the 27th of April.

    Q.   Three wefeks after. Why if what you say happened,         why if a
         Policeman did that to somebody didn't you mention         it? - A.
         Because it has only just come to me.

    Q. It has   only just come to you? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did it happen? - A. Yes.

    Q. Are you sure? - A. Yes.

    Q.   The Policeman was up on the fence, was he?    - A.Yes.

    Q.    What on the top of the fence? - A. The Policeman        did not
         know what was going on at the time.

    Q.   What do you say he did? - A. Beat him.

    Q. So the Policeman must have been up on the top of the fence?
       - a . Yes, standing on top of the fence.

    Q. There was a Policeman standing up on the top of the fence?
       - A. Yes.

    Q.   How tall was he,   taller than you? - A. I don't know.

    Q.   Got a helmet on or a flat hat? - A. A helmet      on.

    Q. Standing up on the fence? - A. Yes.

    Q. In a position to stand and kick someone? - A. Yes, because
       you can get your feet through the mesh.

    Q.   You can get your feet through the mesh? - A.      Yes.

    Q. So was the policeman standing on the top or not? - A.
       Standing on the top of the mesh.

        Q. Kicking down at the man that was trying to get out? - A. Yes.

        Q. How many times did he do it? - A. Once.

        Q. There was no reason not to tell anybody about that, was there,
           if it happened? - A. It did happen, my mate has even seen
           it as well that were there.

                 MR. WOODWARD:      Thank you.


                           Cross-Examined by MR. G L A S G O W :

        Q. Mr. Windever, I just want to ask you about the way in which
           you came through the gate.  Do you remember coming through
           the gate from the outside before you get to the tunnel? -
           A. Yes.

        Q. Now we have seen this on the film but there seems to be some
           dispute about it so I want to see whether there is any doubt
           in your mind.

           Were people running when they came through that gate? - A.
           Well I was walking a bit fast and so was the rest because
           we wanted to get to the game.

        Q. Was anybody running? - A. No.

        Q. You said in your statement again, Mr. Windever, that you
           remembered people "running past you" to get through the.gate.
           Is that wrong? - A. They weren't running, they were walking.

        Q. So it is wrong.  You said "running" in your statement but
           that is wrong, you want to change it do you to walking?
           - A. Yes.

        Q. The next sentence but one you said that you were still
           walking fast but there were quite a few people "running
           towards the tunnel".   Is that wrong? Do you want to change
           that as well? - A. No.

        Q. Were people running, Mr. Windever? - A. No.

        Q. You then used the phrase:      "There was no pushing, just a
           mad rush to get in the g r o u n d " . I expect you want to change
           that as well, do you? - A. No.

        Q. That is true,    is it? - A. Yes.

        Q. "There was a mad rush to get in the ground"? ~ A. Yes.

        0. And you were carried along? - A. People were rushing towards
           the gate to get through.

        Q. People were "rushing towards the gate"? - A. Yes.

                                             W. WINDEVER


    Q. You prefer the word "rushing"       to "running", do you? - A. Yes,
       just rushing.

    Q. But at least you are happy with your own phrase "mad rush"
       are you.  You don't want to change that? - A . No.

              MR. GLASGOW:   Thank you.

              MR. COLLINS:   No questions.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.      That is all.

       but  did you eventually leave about 10.45? - A. Yes.

    Q. Was there any particular reason for that?' - A. No, it was
       just that there were Everton fans and Liverpool fans leaving

   excessive, you know.

Q. What do you recall? -A. Well people had cans but people also

   had a few sandwiches and that so we went to get a couple

   on the grass opening cans of beer and whatever, so we
   had two cans of lager and we sat down on the grass to
   drink them.

   of people sat on the grass.

Q. How far is the ground? - A. How far is it from the ground?

Q. How long did it take you to get to the ground? - A. It
   is a five or ten minute walk from where we were.

Q.   Does that mean that you arrived at the ground shortly
     after 2? - A. About 10-past-2, something like that.

Q.   What     was the   state when you got there outside the gates?
     - a . When we got there there was a lot of people around
     when we got there at 10-past-2.     We somehow managed to
     get through the gate into C section but we did not know
     at the time but we should have been in B.

Q. Can you just take it a little more slowly.  You had tickets
   for the game which we how know is the smaller group of
   turnstiles on the right-hand side of the barrier? - A. Yes,
   that is right.

Q. You in fact went to the wrong side,     I gather? - A. Yes.

Q. To the left-hand side? - A. Yes.   I asked a mounted P o l ice ­
   man if we could go in there and he said:    "No, you are in
   the B section just around the corner".

Q. Was it easy to get out? - A. Not really, no.  There was a
   lot of people coming into the C section at that time.
   We eventually managed to get out and that is where I lost
   my two mates then trying to get round to the B section.
   Now in the B section ....

           MR. COLLINS:   Can you try and slow down?

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You are going    like an express
     train.   Can you just go a little slower.    The poor
     Shorthand Writer, have pity on her.

           THE WITNESS;   At C section that  is where I lost my
     two mates then trying to get to the B section.   There was
     another mounted Policeman there just on the gate going
     to the B section.   There was a bit of a disturbance going
     into the B section and he was trying to jostle the fans
     out of the way.   He was not saying anything to them.  He
     was just moving the horse trying to get them out of the way.

Q.         MR. COLLINS:  When you say a "bit of a disturbance"
     was that caused by the horse or were the fans ....
     A. That was caused by the horse.  There was actually
     one or two people underneath the body of the horse.

Q. In any event when you got round eventually to the B section
   side ....  A. I was Tield up against the wall between the
   B section and the C section.

Q. Do I gather from that that there were a lot of people
   in the C section side? - A. Yes.

Q. How long did it take you to get up to the turnstiles?
   - A. I would say a good 20 minutes.  I helped three
   lads get up on to the dividing wall in the B section.
   The sweat was just dripping off them they were that
   squashed.

Q. Did you see any people climbing up over   the turnstiles?
   - A. There was people on the top of the   wall, yes, but
   some of them were people I had actually   helped to get out
   of the way.  They were really panicking   at that time,
   they were squashed.

      Q. Yes.     Eventually, anyway, you get to the turnstile a n d
         get yourself through? - A. Yes.      I gave my ticket in.
         He took my ticket off me and gave me my stub back.         I
         w en t straight through the turnstile, went to the toilet
         and last year whe n I wen t we w ere h i g h u p on the bank.

      Q. Y o u m e a n on one of the sides do you? - A. O n the o t h e r
         side there. Y o u wer e         hig h up looking down on to the
         pitch.              Isaw like a gate w i t h two P o l i c e m e n on it.      I
         a p p r o a c h e d them and said, "Can I go through there".

      Q.    Before you go any further can you just identify   the gate?
           Is that   the one on the right hand side? - A. Yes.

      Q. Not the      one the u sher is p o i n t i n g to. The inside of the
         gate... - A. The gate leading to the standing area a b o v e
(^j       the L e p pings Lan e area it was.

      Q.   G ate C? - A. Yes.

      Q. You say there were a couple of P o l i c e m e n and a s t e ward?             -
         A. T h e r e w ere two P o l i c e m e n and one steward, yes.

      Q. W h a t di d you go over to them for? - A. I went over to
         them to see if I c o u l d go in that p a r t i c u l a r gr o u n d w i t h
         the stub I had.         I showed them my stub and the s t e w a r d
         said, "No.       Y o u hav e got to go through that tunnel
         there", w h i c h is the tunnel w h i c h leads on to pen 3.

      Q. W h e r e w ere you w a n t i n g to go? - A. Well, not k n o w i n g    the
         ground I thought I c ould get w h e r e I was last year,
         h i g h e r up, looking down.

      Q. You w e r e asking w h e t h e r you c o u l d c l i m b up into the
         stand? - A. But h e said, "No, you h a v e got to go thro u g h
         the tunnel".

      Q. W e r e   you by n o w w i t h your friend or w ere you still on
         y our     own? - A. No, I am still on my own at this time.

      Q. Did you go down       the tunnel?        - A. Yes.

      Q. W h a t sort of time h a v e we reac h e d now? - A. It is about
         twenty to three, s o m ething like that, by the time I got
         into the terracing.         I w a l k e d into the terracing and I
         turned right, as you get into pe n 3.              I never go r i g h t
         at the b o t t o m anyway b e c a u s e you always k now there is a
         lot of pushing and that.              I wen t about one - t h i r d of the
         way d own and to my right as I go thro u g h into pen 3.

      Q. W h a t was the state of pen 3 then? - A. T here were a few
         people around.       I h a d to w o r m my way round. As I h a v e
                                                    G. GAINS


said before,      it was not just w a l k straight in and that's
it.

I think "a few people around" is a slight u n d e r ­
statement? - A. Well, OK, there w e r e a lot of people
around.

A n y w a y you had no d i f f i c u l t y in gett i n g into the pen at
that point?

         L ORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:  Wha t   time are we talking
about?     - A. T w e n t y to three.

         MR. COLLINS:         Wer e you near any barr i e r w h e r e you
wer e standing? - A. I had been in the gr o u n d for a b o u t
five or ten minu t e s and I felt a b i t of a pus h on the
b a c k of me, then I was starting to get pushed down.                   It
was more or less a diagonal.                I was going down
diagonally.        I c ame to one b a r r i e r and I r e m e m b e r I
thought if I c ould get my hea d u n d e r n e a t h it and get my
b a c k to the b a r r i e r and I w o u l d be a little bit b e t t e r
off.      I mus t h a v e b e e n there one or two minu t e s and I
felt another p u s h again.

      LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:      Did you get u nder that
barrier? - A. I was u n d e r n e a t h the first b a r r i e r and h a d
got my b a c k to it, yes.       The n I was pu s h e d d own again.

      LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR;  Y o u are g oing far too fast.
If you w o u l d just s low down.     T h e r e is no kick-off!

           MR. COLLINS:         I k n o w it is difficult.    Yo u are a
bit nervous but try to slow down.                 We h ave got you
d u c k e d under a b a r r i e r and then there is a further p u s h
be h i n d w h i c h pushes you further forward? - A. Yes.

W h e r e did you end up? - A. Th e last barr i e r b e f o r e     the
p i t c h on the right h and side.

W e r e you c l o s e then to the b a r r i e r or the wall w h i c h
divi d e s pen 3 from pen 2? - A. Yes.

Had the players c ome on the p i t c h by now?          - A.   I think
they were just c o m i n g on at that time.

J u s t co m i n g on.  Yo u w ere then in a sort of corner, as
it were, b e t w e e n the d i v i d i n g fence to pen 2 and the
b a r r i e r in front of you?         Is that the situation? - A. It
is, yes.

T h e r e are, of course, people on your left also agai n s t
that same barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember s o m e t h i n g h a p p e n i n g in relation to that
   b a r r i e r and a lad who was also stuck up against it? - A.
   T h e r e was a y oung lad about         fifteen or sixteen.          He was
   in front of me and as we got pus h e d                d own to the last
   b a r r i e r he tried to m o v e his body round.            As he m o v e d
   his body round his leg came              up.        I was immediately
   b e h i n d h i m and I was pu s h e d   against his k n e e c a p in my
   groin.

Q. So his knee was w e d g e d in b e t w e e n you and the b a r r i e r ? -
   A. A g a i n s t the barrier.  He was s c r eaming out w i t h pain,
   r eally screaming and I was shouting, "Push back", but
   there was just no way you could mov e back.                 He was
   really screaming w i t h the pain.           I h e a r d his knee crack.
   He was just s c reaming out.       I hea d somebody shout, " T h e
   barr i e r is going", and I h eard like a c r a cking noise.
   Th e barr i e r went...

Q. This was the barr i e r to your left?                The same b a r r i e r   as
   you w ere against b u t a bit further to your left? - A.
   Yes, I am sort of to the left of the barrier
   supporting...        T h e b a r r i e r went, p e o p l e just could
   not...    Pe o p l e were squashed...

Q. Can we see if we can get the time at w h i c h the b a r r i e r
   went?    I do not ex p e c t you looked at your w a t c h or
   anything, but can you h e l p as to w h e t h e r the players h a d
   then come on to the pitch? - A. I think the players w e r e
   on the p i t c h at that time.

Q. They were already on the pitch.         Had they only just com e
   on or ha d they bee n on? - A. Pe o p l e w e r e shouting at five
   m i n u t e s to three to let people out.     People were g e t t i n g
   squashed.

Q. Had the game started whe n the b a r r i e r went? - A. No,
   b e c a u s e I do not even r e m ember the gam e starting.

Q. It was some time shortly after or a bout the time they
   came on the pitch? - A. Yes, that is w hat I am saying.

Q. T h e effect of the b a r r i e r going was people falling
   forward but could not fall, as I u n d e r s t a n d it, b e c a u s e
   of the c rush in front? - A. Yes, it was not like a
   d r a m a t i c fall. The y oung lad in front of me went, the
   y oung lad who had his leg squashed, h e just went, like.
   He did not just fall, he just slid on to the floor.

Q.   I think you got your leg caught in the fallen part of the
     b a r r i e r at one stage? - A. Th e support - you h a v e like
     the bar going across and there are like two supports on
     either end, I had my foot twisted r ound that.            I assume
     it was the lad who was in front of m e was on the floor.

Q. E v e n t u a l l y you w ere h e l p e d and pulled out on to the
   pitch.            Was that t h r o u g h the open gat e in the front of
   the... - A. Well, it seemed to go on for ages and a g e s
   and even t u a l l y two lads one on either end of my arm w a s
   p u l l i n g me and pull i n g me and e v e n t u a l l y they m a n a g e d to
   pull me out and it c r a s h e d over into pen 2.

Q. Yo u  w ent over - A. R i g h t over into pen 2 and then on to
   the pitch.

Q. T hen you were given h e l p by first of all the St. J o h n ' s
   A m b u l ance... - A. I was taken over to the west stand and
   it was the St. John*s A m b u l a n c e who a t t e n d e d to my foot.
   I cut my ankle and that.              At this time a young lad,
   well, a lad of about 20-odd said, "There is someone d y i n g
   over there", so I said, "Leave me.                 J u s t give a b a n dage.
   Go and see to him".         O b v i o u s l y the St. J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e
   wen t off w i t h him and I w r a p p e d the band a g e round my foot
   and I star t e d walk i n g round the pitch.             I was in a b i t of
   a daze.

Q. Did    you e ventually m a n a g e to get some attention?             - A. I
   was taken to the N o r t h e r n Gene r a l H o s p i t a l later on.

Q.   I think you had injuries to your ankle?                       - A.   I was
     r e l eased later that night.

Q. Do you r e m ember p e o p l e shouting               to the Po l i c e to ope n      the
   gates? - A. Yes, I do.

Q. Do you k n o w when that was in r e l a t i o n to the k i ck-off? -
   A. Well, be f o r e the kick-off.     I am talking a bout five
   to three people were shout i n g and scr e a m i n g to ope n the
   gates.

Q. W h e r e w ere the Police? - A. I c o u l d see Police in front
   of the w ire fencing.           I could see P o l i c e obv i o u s l y on
   the other side.        T h e r e were stewards on the other side
   as well.

Q. Did you see any r e a c t i o n to that? - A. I think...    I am
   sure the gate was op e n e d and I c o u l d see people who w e r e
   let on to the p itch and the gate was shut again.          That
   was about five to three.

Q. Mr. Gains, you h a d a d r i n k on the coach,                    did you?     - A.   I

T h e r e was quite a lot of d r i n k i n g g oing on, wa s n ' t there?
- A. Depends what you mean by "quite a lot".                 L et's b e
honest, the aver a g e p e r s o n has a bout two pints only.
You do not go to a football m a t c h and h ave a lot of beer.

Well, it may mak e it dif f i c u l t to w a t c h the game and
c o n c e n t r a t e on... - A. You are g o i n g to the toilet e v e r y
minute.

You h a d h a d about four pints,           had you?    - A. No,     I h a d had
three cans of beer.

T o g e t h e r wit h lots of other people? - A. T here wer e lots
of o ther people sat on the grass v erge outside G a t eway.

T he Police did m ake some end e a v o u r         to get you to m o v e on?
- A. Down to the ground, yes.

T h a t was a general end e a v o u r that was being mad e by the

people on? - A. Peo p l e w ere m o v i n g on.      There w a s n ' t any
sort of...

It was good advice at that time?                - A.   It was yes.

Y o u m a d e your way d o w n to get to the ground and
e v e n t u a l l y you came to the L e p pings Lane entrance?           - A.
Yes.

Was it a normal day for you?                A n y t h i n g abnormal a bout
it? - A. Not particularly.              I m i g h t add as I w a l k e d dow n
from G a t e w a y down towards the L e p p i n g s Lane end there was
a bit of a roun d a b o u t there and there wer e about four or
five P o l i c e m e n stood there.       At that time I never g a v e a
thought about it u ntil I got to the ground.                       All I c o u l d
see w ere the two m o u n t e d P o l i c e m e n o u t s i d e the ground.
I di d comm e n t at the time that the P o l i c e m e n we ha d seen

y ou d i d not see any P o l i c e m e n b e t w e e n that point and

W e r e you looking for Policemen? - A. Not p a r t i c u l a r l y .   I
was just w a l k i n g a long talking.        I did go to the m a t c h
last year, to the same ground, and travelled by train.                  I
got there for about one o ' c l o c k on the train.           When we
got off the train we w ere met by P o l i c e m e n then.        We
w er e he r d e d on to buses.     They c h e c k e d our tickets.
T h e y took us to the g r o u n d and we w e r e in the ground for
h alf past one.

Yo u did not c ome by train this year?               - A. No, we c ame by
coach.

H a v e you been co m i n g   to football matc h e s over the years?
- A. Yes.

Has   the way you h a v e got there changed?             - A.   It has,    yes.

Is that something that has been h a p p e n i n g w ith f o o t b a l l
supporters?   They h a v e gon e away from pub l i c transport,
from trains, to their own ways of g e t t i n g there? - A. I
do not know.   T h e r e are a lot m o r e p e o p l e w ith their own
transport these day than there was years ago.

W e r e Brit i s h Rail rather strict about d r i n k on trains?                 -
A. The y h a v e been, yes.

It is not allowed,         is it? - A.      It is not, no.

The y m a k e sure,   as far as they can,          that there isn't any?
- A. No.                                                             7

Does that m a k e it less a t t r a c t i v e to travel by train? -
A. Not really b e c a u s e I w o u l d not c all one can of bee r
excessive.      Yo u c o u l d do with o u t one can of beer.

On this o c c asion you c a m e to the ground?            - A. Yes.

Yo u went in through the turnstile?               - A.   I event u a l l y got
thro u g h the turnstile.

In order to get to the turnstile did you h a v e to go
through the crowd that was there or did you go w i t h the
c rowd that was there? - A. O b v i o u s l y I had to join the
b a c k of the queue.    As the lad b e f o r e said, there was
just a mass of pe o p l e so you just get to the b a c k of the
queue.

Was there any push i n g going on? - A. Not really.                      The y
could not h a v e been all p u s h i n g b e c a u s e p e o p l e wer e
pa c k e d together.  T h e r e was no way y o u c ould push.

Y o u w e r e not d o i n g any pushing? - A. No, y o u just ha d to
w ai t until you got m o r e or less to the front.         It was
two paces forwards and four steps back, sort of thing.

Q. Was there any p r o b l e m g oing dow n the tunnel?         - A. No.
   We just wa l k e d s t r a i g h t down them tunnel.

Q. H a v i n g got into the terrace, wha t time w o u l d that be?           -
   A. I w o u l d say about twenty to three.

Q. Yo u c o u l d see the c r o w d on the terrace when you c ame out
   of the tunnel entrance? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you mak e a decision, a choice, to go... - A. As                  I
   said before, I do not like going too nea r the front
   a nyway b e c a u s e it gets a bit c h o c k e r down the front      and
   there is a lot of p u s h i n g going on.          I always like      to
   stay m o r e or less in the m i d d l e or m o r e to the b ack       than
   nearer the front.

Q. You w o r m e d your way r ound to w h e r e you wan t e d to go? - A.
   Yes, to the right and about o n e - t h i r d of the way d own the
   terracing.

Q. Does that m ean that you went under barriers? - A. No,                    not
   initially,    I only w e n t under barriers... Y o u see,                 I
   went d own in a lump.

Q. O n e can look at the p i c t u r e s and it may not be n e c e s s a r y
   to d e s c r i b e your r oute exactly, but yo u got towards the
   far corner, the far right han d co r n e r as one saw the
   terrace from the tunnel exit?             Did yo u h a v e any c o n c e r n
   at that time for your safety? - A. W h a t time are we
   talking about?

Q. As you were ma k i n g you r way dow n to w h e r e you want        to be?
   - A. This is when I first go into the terracing?

Q. Yes. - A. Not really, no.     Even whe n I got pushed
   initially I did not think a n y t h i n g of it, really, b e c a u s e
   you do get pushed at football m a t c h e s anyway.

Q. Y o u thought n o t h i n g of it the first time you wer e pushed?
   - A. U s u a l l y you go back, you go forward, and then you
   c ome back, but this was just a c o n s t a n t forward, forward,
   forward.

   b a r r i e r gave way w ere the teams out on the field? - A.

   was not through choice.

Q. Before you went under the barrier?              - A. Oh, no,    the teams
   wer e not out at that time.

Q. T hen you went under the barr i e r and you wer e pushed a w a y
   from it? - A. No, I was pushed in the bac k again,
   actually.       I had my b a c k to the first b a r r i e r and was
   pus h e d d own again.

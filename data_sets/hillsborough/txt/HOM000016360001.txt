 I enclose a copy of the letter I have received from the Statistical Section
 of the House of Commons Library, following my enquiries into several
 Hiatters surrounding events at Hillsborough on April 15th.

I would like to repeat the request I made to the Library - namely, for
information on the contracts for the televising of the FA Cup Semi-final
raatch between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, In particular, I would like
to know to whicn television companies the Football Association had granted
rights to televise the match and the value of the contracts. I realise that
the contract was not fulfilled under the circumstances, but I would be
grateful it you could iurnish me with the appropriate information.

My concern in this matter is to                represent constituents who were present at
Hillsborough and I.believe that                in the light of the tragic events of April
Ibth their interests should not                be subordinate to the Football
Association's considerations of                commercial confidentiality. I look forward
to your early reply.


Yours sincerely




Terry Fields MP

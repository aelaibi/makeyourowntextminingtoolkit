           I am a single person living at the above address with my parents and

           sister

           I am a Liverpool Football Club Supporter and have been all my life.                     I

           am a season ticket holder for the kop and attend all the home matches

           and the occasional away main matches.

           On Saturday 15th April      1989 I------------
                                              went to Hi 1Isborough Football Stadium in

           Sheffield to see Liverpool       play Nottingham Forest      in the F .A.

           challenge cup semi-final.        I purchased m y ticket from Anfield on

           Thursday 13th April,       I paid si//pounds for a Leppings Lane standing.

           I left home for the match at /10 am on the day with my friend

                                              .Widnes.     We travelled in his car direct

           to Sheffield stopping only once at a Motorway Service area for

           refreshments.      We experienced little traffic delays and arrived in
                                                                          PAGE         2
                                                                          SI 944

Sheffield at 12.3 0 p m .        parked the car outside Bass Hope Brewery.

We then walked to the ground without any problems arriving initally at

12.45pm.    We then decided      to go for something to eat    at a fish and

chip shop and returned to        the groun^'at about 1.30. There were a         lot

of people around the outside to tne Leppings LAne Entrances.             They

were eating and drinking cans of soft drinks and some were drinking

cans of beer.    There were very few people going into      the ground.         2

Policemen on horseback       came up to us and said   "Could   you get intothe

ground please or move off".        I believe the Police were anxious to get

people who had tickets       into the grp*rffd, and those without of which

there were quite a few away J*fom the ground.         I saw a lot of peopie

going around asking f oj^Xi ckets.

We both decidedJ^e^go       into the ground and entered through the

turnstiles for the terraces.        I was searched prior to going   in by the

Police who I beleive were looking for weapons and alcohol.

I handed my ticket to the turnstile operator and entered the ground

without any problem.        I did not see any gates open at this time and

people entering the ground went through the turnstiles.

Once   in the ground (having not been there before)       I had difficulty in

finding when the entrance was for the terraces.          There were no

stewards anywhere to assist except a programme seller.          I eventually

saw a tunnel    leading to terrace and fans were standing at the end of

it.    We both made our way through the tunnel and went to the left             into

what   I now know to be pen 4.      The time was about   1.40 and there were

very few people in the pen.        We had plenty of choice of where to stand

and decided to get our       ’spec* at a position in the pen (as shown to me

by the Police) G6.

We both sat down and relaxed in the sunshine reading the programmes.

From this time the pen started to fill with spectators and eventually

I had to stand up.     The crowd built up as the time went on but there
                                                                        PAGE         3
                                                                        S 1944

were no problems.      I'm used to crowds in the kop.

At about 2.50 the situation started to get uncomfortable.           The crowd

pressure was such that     I couldn't move.    We were still stood in our

orginal    position against a crush barrier.     We both decided to move to

the front of the barrier.

At about 2.55 I saw one or two people climbing over the front fence

and onto the pitch then moving to the left and climbing into another

pen.    Someone shouted from behind "help this girl" and a girl aged

about   14 was passed forward and towards the corner of the pen.           She

seemed to be in a distressed state and her face was very red.

I couldn ’t see the pitch due to the crowds.       I did not know if the

match had started or not.       At this point we were both unhappy with the

situation of being crushed.       The pressure was getting worse, we were

getting    pushed towards the front of the pen to a point where we were

about four people deep from the fence.        I saw to my left a person

standing on the fence which seperates       pen 4 and 5.   He was pulling

people out of the pen and passing them into the gap where the people

were able to get through a gate and onto the pitch.

The next thing I know was a sudden surge and I found myself against

the fence at the front of the pen.        I immediately grabbed hold of the

fence and climbed up and move#' to iTiy left and over the fence that

seperates the pens and intp' the gap.       I went out onto the pitch

through the gate and I tKen noticed my friend was not with me.             I went

back    into the gap (pen 5 )   to see where he was.   I saw him struggling

to get out.     I saw him assisted out into the gap and as we went out

onto the pitch I saw a girl       (who I had noticed earlier before the

crowds had built up in the pert) and she was in a distressed state.              I

would describe her as aged about       18, short brown h#ir .   Height about

5 ”4 “ , she was dressed in a red jacket with embroidered       ’ Liverpool F C ’

in white on the back.      Also red jogging tro us4 rs .   Her arms were
                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                  SI 944

         reaching up on the fence.        On one arm I saw a camera dangling,     and I

         believe a handbag on the other arm.        Her eyes were staring and the

         colour of her face was pale bluish/white.        The last I saw of her was

         when she slipped into the crowd to her right.        I did not see her

         again.     Police were now in the gap and we decided to get out of the

         way.     We both went out through the gate and onto the pitch and made

         our way over towards the North Stand area where we sat down at the

         side of the pitch and remained there for about 45 minutes.            We were

         then told by the Police to move back into the pens.            At this time the

         dead and injured had been moved from the ground or had been moved to

         the Forest end of the pitch.        We got into the pert <pen 3) through a

         gap in the fence and remained in the pen by the tunnel exit until an

         announcement was made to say that the match was cancelled.

         We left the ground via tunnel and exit gate at abou1^/4.30pm and made

         our way to the car.        We travelled back to Runcq/n,   direct,   having made

         a phone call home    in Sheffield, arriving aj^about 8.30pm,

         The next morning    I discovered a bruiseytfo my ribs on the right side.

         I did not attend hospital or receive any treatment.            I have since

         recovered both from the injury fnd shock.

                                                                    '           ' SIGNED

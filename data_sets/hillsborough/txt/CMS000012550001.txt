THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL AND THE HILLSBOROUGH U g n r f e , ( n

Your minute of 3 May commissioned an aide-memoire!                     Sir Terry,
in advance of tomorrow’s Permanent Secretarie’S


Departmental responsibility


Hillsborough Inquiry - Home Office responsibility

We have had no part in the Setting up Of the Iftqildbfy* nor in
subsequent discussions with Lord Justice Taylor* Responsibility
rests with the Home Office because they are th6^ Department
responsible for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act fittd for the
police. I understand that the Judge will expect written ^evidence
from us about the national membership Scheme th<5tt§|tt^6 have
received no invitation yet. The Secretary of State Will *iftb doubt
have views on what if anything we should say.


The Football Spectators Bill - Part I (the national membership
scheme) is DOE's, in consultation with the Home Office. Part II
(restriction orders) is the Home Office’s.    »     t


 Prime Minister’s meeting

 The question of withdrawing the Football Spectators Bill and
 re-introducing it next session, after Lord Justice Taylpr has
 reported, was apparently not raised at this morning's: meeting.
 The intention is to proceed with the present Bill but to amend it
 so that:                                                ‘,


            (1) the Secretary of State ’s approval of the> Scheme is
            subject to Parliamentary approval by negative resolution
            (already promised in the Lords);            .?|f;,




                                  CONFIDENTIAL
                             CONFIDENTIAL

       (2) the Football Membership Authority is not required to
       submit the scheme for approval until directed to do so by
       the Secretary of State, following a debate following the
       Taylor report (by implication, in case Taylor attacks the
       scheme);

       (3) the licensing provisions under the Bill are wide
       enough to allow the licensing authority (which may have to
       be a quango) to take into account any relevant Taylor
       recommendations.


Action on these amendments is primarily for us and the Secretary
of State is to report back before Whitsun. The first two are
straightforward; the third raises questions on the scope of the
Bill on which we will need Counsel to consult the House
authorities (following official discussions with the Home Office
this week). No decisions were taken on the timetable for the Bill
but Mr Moynihan thought that it would be as follows:


       Lords Third Reading                  after Whitsun
       Commons Second Reading               mid-to-late June
       Standing Committee                   July   (to      complete   if
                                            possible)
       Remaining stages                     October.

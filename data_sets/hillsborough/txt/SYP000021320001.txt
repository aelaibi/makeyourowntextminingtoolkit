Lord Justice Taylor,
Hillsborough Enquiry,
House of Lords,
London.


Dear Sir,
Following the appointment of your goodself as Lord Justice to the
Hillsborough Disaster Enquiry, I thought I would write to you about my
thoughts on Saturday, April 15th 1989.
I left Nottingham at 11:20 with my son aged 14 and two of my friends and
after a pleasant drive through the Dukeries we arrived in good time at
Sheffied at 12:20.
We parked in a side street on waste land to have our packed lunch. Of the
party of four, there were ony three seats in the unreserved seats of the
South Stand and my friend had a standing ticket for the Kop. With that in
mind, at 1 o'clock, he decided to go on his way to prepared for the
game. We followed 30 minutes later, as with stand seats, our position was
quaranteed.
During the 20 minutes walk to the ground we went passed numerous Public
Houses, the small ones were closed, but the large ones were open and doing
a good business, with many hundreds of fans outside singing and drinking.
I turned to a policemen and said, " Why do you allow these pubs to open?"
and he just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'Money1.
After arriving at the ground we formed an orderly queue, bought programmes
and headed for our seats. My first impression on entering the ground at
1:55 was that the Kop wasfull of Forest fans, the North Stand and Lepping
Lane Stand were very sparse, but the terraces on the Lepping Lane end were
full.
For the next hour we sat back, enjoyed the teams practise, watched the
crowd arrive and awaited the start of the game.
When the teams were out at 2:55,     I could see that all was not    right
behind the Liverpool goal and commented to my son and friend that there
was no way the game should be allowed to start. However, it did and in six
minutes the game was over.
Numerous mistakes were made on that Saturday and I shall start with the
fact that the Referee did not appear to want to know about the trouble
behind the goal as he was more interested in making sure that game went
ahead and it annoyed me that a policeman had to tell him of the problems,
because on one point he had been up by the goal when Forest won a corner.
    On match tickets there should be information advising supportors to be
I   in position by 2:00 for a 3:00 game. If you buy a Wembley ticket this is
|   clearly printed on them. If this had been done, who knows it might have
?   made supporters get to the ground earlier. I feel in future for all big
:   games this should be a statuatory obligation and would obviously give the
    police more time to control the crowd.
    As regards to the ticket allocation, I feel this is a red herring thrown up
    along with the traffic congestion, to avoid getting to the real problem.
    I cannot understand by people, (a) wait until the last minute to arrive at
    the game, and (b) leave their departure for a game so that they get held
    up in traffice. Airports are quite clear about their information - arrive
    an hour or in some cases two hours before      departure and I would have
    thought the same applied here. If this was the case, supporters in 1989
    seem to forget that on a journey, road works are a common part of life in
    Britain.
    These factors above lead to the disaster which occured when grown men took
    the law into their own hands and decided it was their right to be allowed
    into the ground before the kick-off, despite the fact that they had left
    it to the last minute to get in,   so consequently the problems arose.
    Many words have been written and spoken about the tanoy system, which I
    can only agree was useless, obviously somewhere down the line there was no
    co-operation.
    Following this I come to another topic,         that it appears Sheffield
    Wednesday have lost the ability      to stage biggames because their own team
    has had no success over recent years and consequently Stewards and Staff
    are out of touch with large crowds. All this season they have been dealing
    with crowds in the region of below 20,000, then suddenly 54,000 arrive.
    Stewards are lost. If the game had been played on a ground, say Manchester
    United, or any club with large regular attendances, then I am sure these
    problems may not have occured.     I feel complacency sets in. They had
    forgotten how to handle a big attendance.
    I hope the above may be of interest to you during your enquiry.

    Yours sincerely,




    Nottingham,

CRUSH BARRIER INSPECTION AND TESTING

I forward herewith another response which has been made by consultants in
this field of activity. In this instance Ross Materials Technology Limited
have responded with a useful summary of their approach to the requirements
of the 'Green Guide'. I have written separately to them to thank them for
their contribution.

I trust this is of some assistance to you. I have sent copies of this
correspondence to Mr R. M. Whalley, Professor Maunder and Dr Nicholson.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T         S h e ffie ld

                For     the     past     10-12 years         I have        been a supporter            of the L i v ^ p o o l

                club,              to outside           interests.

                1'f I used the            club to a t t e n d matches               I n or ma ll y    contact                   who

Saturday           15th April         1989      (150489).         I contacted                      and he a r r a n g e d

e ve r y t h i n g    for me.

                arranged        everything,              I paid him £10,           £6 of w hich was         for the

ticket        to the match,               w hi ch was      for the L ep p i n g s Ln terraces.

To be honest                I have only used the transport                        provided by the          club on

only one           previous         o cc as i o n this year          before       the Hillsborough.

O n the day of the                  semi-final           it was a r r a n g e d    that    I w ould      catch the

I arranged            to catch t                oach at        10.30am

A f te r     leaving C o v e n t r y we also                picked up supporter* at Nuneaton,

H i n c k l e y and Leicester,                as    I have a l r e a d y m e n t i o n e d   I have       rarely used

the t ransport               provided by the               supporters      club,     and did not know

an y of the           s upporters who              got     on the    coach at the other             picking up

The    coach         company used was Lloyds                         Jurieaton,

We were         t r a n s po rt ed d ir ec tl y to S h e f f i e l d with ou t             stopping       for

r e fr eshment and never                    s uf fered * n y      traffic     delays       until    we    reached

Sheffield            then we were            slowed down by the volume                    of traffic       going

towards         the ground,           and also           due to us being Liverpool                 supporters         we

were       d i r ec t e d    into more        traffic,        enabling       us to park with the other

L i v e r po o l     s upporters          coaches.         The    coach    park was about a quarter                   of a

mile a w a y from the ground.

We a r r i v e d at the             car     park at about           1.45pm    (1345)      - 1.50pm        (1350),

w h i c h was a side            street more              than a car       park and had a slow walk                 to

            T he re was         orderly queues at this                time and whe n           I joined one of them,

            there were about 2 0 y p e o p l e              in front       of m e .       I c a n ’t recall       seeing any

            the    t erraces at this              time      seenuira quite       packed at this t^ime so               I pushed

            my way        t hro ug h and took up/fny viewing                    postion as indicated by                point      1

            on the        grid.         Iwas    staging       w ith the       rest of          my friends.

            F r o m the        time    I reached my viewing              position there was a gradual                     build

            up of        pressure        due    to more      people    coming          onto   the    terraces.

            The a t mo s p h e r e was          good wit h the        normal      swaying and          chanting,      and     I

            did expect           to be more           cramped than normal               due to the game        being a

            semi-f i n a l .

            A f t er     the    players        came on to the         pitch w h i c h         resulted    in the     normal

            r e ac t io n from the             fans    (jumping   up and chanting)    I was                 still      not

            Just       before        the game was due to k^ck off                  there was a great              surge      from

            b eh in d     and also from my              right, jwhich resulted                 in    me being forced to

    pos it io n 2 on the grid                reference,           w h i c h was about 3 or 4 feet a way

    from the           s eg r e g a t i o n fence   to pen 4 and there was a person                   in front of

    me up against             the    perimeter       fence.         The    pressure      exerted on me was

    u n co m f o r t a b l e and     I found        I was unable          to breath      in fully.

    At    the     time     I was     pushed to my left              I had my arms a loft and due to

    this my feet were                up against        the fence,          I was able to move my head,

    and    legs but found                d i ff ic ul ty    in turning       the upper      part of my body.

    As soon as            I got     near    to the fence           I was able       to put my right         foot up

    a ga in s t    the wall         below the        perimeter       fence,      which    I believe was        trying

    to take        some of the           pressure      off the       people against         the fence       in front

    of m e .

    A f te r about 3 or 4 minutes                    the    pressure       in my    part of the      pen seemed

    to decrease            but    it was     total     choas all around,             peopl^shouting           and

    s c r e a m in g    for help to get out,                people     climbing      oyer   the   perimeter

    fence,        just     to get out        of the        pen,    I had no yaea. what was           going     on and

    what     had caused           it.

    I thought a couple                  of times      of getting          over    the fence   but    never

    attempted           to but did assist a young                   lad to get       out from the      pen.

I                 crowt* c le a r e d e ve nt u a l l y      I saw a man          I b el ieved to be dead

    lying on the             terraces,       w i t h a P o l i c e m a n tunic over his upper            half       of

    this     body.

    I rem ai ne d on the terraces w i t h a n d |                                 for sometime,      I d o n ’t

    think       I really         realised how bad the s i t u a t i o n was.

    At a bout 4 . 4 5 p m         (1645)     we knew the m a t c h w a s n ’t going           to take       place,

    so we       left the ground,             using the tunnel             a g ai n and at this       time     the

    tunnel        was     quite     clear.

    We made        our way back            to the     coach a rr iv in g         there at about 5pm         (1700)

    (1710)        - 5 . 1 0 p m a nd w ai t e d till         everyone was aboard.             At 6, 3 0 p m

    (1830)        we s ta rt e d on our         return journey and at w hi ch time                   I did not

    realise        two     people       off the     coach had been missing.

    .'      It was     not until       the f ollowing M on d a y evening       that two   lads on the

            coach I had used had been killed                in the disaster,, and at this         point

            also    I became aware        their   names was HEWITT.

            The P ol ic e       seemed slow to realise       how s e r o u s   the sit ua ti on was and to

                   upon    it.

            I do believe a new system of fencing a r o u n d                football   ground should be

            i n tr o du c ed to enable      quicker andr safer access          from the terraces.

            I was    not    injured at this       game 'whilst     I was    on the terraces     I never

            saw a n y b o d y    I r ecog ni se d as travelling     on the same     coach o r g a ni se d by

POLICE CONSTABLE 2887



'Bl' DIVISION



At    9.00 am on Saturday                15 April          1989,   I reported      for duty at Barnsley

Divisional Headquarters and subsequently travelled through to Hillsborough

Football Ground.             I then attended in the main North Stand for the pre-match

briefing       and    after     a   short meal         break I attended at               the Leppings              Lane

Terrace, together with Police Sergeant 13^1 Crawford and other officers from

the    Serial        (14).     We       had    a    further    briefing    from     Inspector              White    who

instructed all re-searching of fans and emergency procedures.

At approximately 11.30 am, the serial moved to the enclosure at the rear of

Leppings Lane Terrace directly behind turnstiles A-G.                                  Turnstiles A and B

were already open at this stage, the remaining were soon opened.                                            All were

open    by     11.45     am.        I    was       given    responsibility,        together          with      Police

Constable 2819 McManus, for turnstiles F and G.                           Arrangements were made with

the turnstile operators that if they were in difficulty they would bang on

the window at the rear of their turnstile in order to call our attention.

At approximately 12 noon the first of the Liverpool fans began to arrive.

They were few in number and in good spirits.                          I had a clear view through the

turnstiles and could see officers outside searching them as they arrived.                                             I

did not search these fans as they had already been searched.                                          However, we

were    then     instructed         by    Inspector         White    to   search     everyone              regardless

whether they had been searched before or not.
By 1.30 pm, the number of fans increased but was not excessive.                     Most were

searched, a few complained about the number of times they had been searched,

but they were still generally good humoured.                   There was still a good view

through the turnstiles and it could be seen that the area outside was still

effectively clear.

At approximately 2.00 pm, the turnstile operator knocked on the window to

indicate a problem, he told us that a fan was trying to get in without a

ticket.     He came through the turnstile and was ejected straight through gate

'C' to our left.

In the process of doing this, Police Constable McManus and I were surrounded

by a number of his friends who were abusing us and indignantly claiming that

he did have a ticket.

This happened approximately a dozen times in the next twenty minutes.                   I saw

some fans offering money to the operators in order to gain entry.                    This was

refused, however, and they left the turnstile peacefully.

By 2.30     pm,    large numbers      of Liverpool       supporters   had arrived and were

pressed up to the turnstiles.           The view through the turnstile was no longer

possible.         It quickly became apparent         that the searching of fans was no

longer practical or possible.               The priority became giving entry to as many

ticket holding fans as quickly and safely as possible.                   Fans without tickets

were still being ejected by Police Constable 2819 McManus and myself.

Whilst attempting to eject one man through gate 'C', the steward on the gate

refused to open it because he feared that supporters would rush in.                    He was

ordered     to    open   the   gate   and    the   man   was   ejected   without   significant

problems.
Pressure continued to increase outside the turnstiles and fans were becoming

trapped within them, as a result causing more problems.                      Large numbers of

fans entering the ground were under the influence of alcohol,                         some quite

heavily.     It was impossible to eject them though due to pressure behind both

turnstiles and gate 'C'.

By 2.45 pm, it had become apparent that there were seriousproblems outside.

Fans entering the ground were near to collapse.                    Many didfall down through

exhaustion     on   gaining   entry.         Some   fans   were    crying,   nearly    all    were

extremely    angry abusing us and            shouting at me       to do something.           I was

grabbed by one hysterical man in his late twenties who shook me violently

and screamed into my face,           "Listen you fucking bastard they're dying out

there - kids.       Where's your fucking radio do something - do something".

I was without a radio and continued to assist other fans.                       One fan became

trapped in the turnstile with his jeans hookedon the turnstile.                          It was

necessary to use a knife to cut him free.

By this stage all officers within Serial 14 were being subjected to abuse,

threats, being pushed and jostled around.              No supervisory officers, with the

exception of Police Sergeant           1341 Crawford,       could be seen.        As I looked

around I could see only 10 or 12 officers, mainly Serial 14, attempting to

control large numbers of fans inside the ground in the area immediately next

to the turnstiles.       We were heavily out-numbered at the point, I believe, of

coming under serious physical attack from very irate and upset fans.                     I have

never been more concerned for my own or my colleagues safety.

A number of fans had begun climbing over the wall into the ground, but again

we   were   powerless   to    stop   this.      Turnstile    'D'    collapsed    and    appeared

inoperative.
After a period        of what can only be described as chaos, a Senior Officer

shouted for the gate 'C' to be opened.

I assisted other officers to open the gate.            No objections were voiced by

stewards on the gate.       The crowd surged through and people at the front fell

down.     They were trampled on by the crowd who flooded through the gates,

screaming abuse at Police, striking out at officers as they charged in.                  I

could see many fans carrying cans of beer as they forced their way through

but it was impossible to do anything about this.

After the main body of supporters had come through         the gate, I helped force

the gate shut.     During the surge, I had been forced back against            the wall of

turnstile 'G'. I stayed there for my own safety.           Fans who had fallen were

helped to their feet.       I would estimate that around 2,000 people          had entered

through the gate.     Within a moment the gate was opened for a second time and

about 200-300 more fans ran in.        The numbers entering dwindled to a trickle

and the gate was left ajar to act as an additional                turnstile.      However,

there was no-one left outside.

The scene inside could only then have         been described as a 'sea of fans' all

congregating on       the area behind the turnstiles       Ato G. It was        as though

they were all taking their breath to try and recover.         A large cheer went up

inside the ground and I watched as within a matter of 1-2 minutes the area

emptied   entirely,   the   majority   of   fans   running down    the   tunnel    to the

central terrace.

I look around to see the other officers from my serial more or less in tact

and thought 'thank god that's over'.         I stood up for a moment to recover but

looked up to see a large number of Police officers, about 30, running around

the foot of the West Stand and Leppings Lane Terrace.              We ran as a serial
and joined them and made our way through the South Stand onto the pitch.

As I stepped onto the pitch an announcement came over the ground 'tannoy'

requesting that Liverpool        fans left the pitch.       I could see a numberof fans

wandering up and down in         front of the fence and more climbing over.          I ran

up to the front of the terrace - the centre south enclosure and was met with

a scene of carnage.       Fans were crushed tight up against the fence, some were

already blue faced.

Other officers present were stood on            the fence    shouting for the crowd to

move back, to no avail.          The    gate at the front    of the enclosure No 3 had

been opened but this did little to help the situation.                  There is a three

foot step up to escape the terrace.            The man who was directly behind the

gate when it was opened fell forward due to pressure behind him.                His legs

were trapped below the level of the pitch and people were packed tighter

than sardines behind him.          Gate 3 became blocked.        I struggled with other

officers to free people.           One or two were rescued.        The gate then became

cluttered with Police, a senior officer ran up with a loud hailer and began

shouting at officers at gate           three to move back to let people out.         Some

officers   moved   away   but    the    problem of the    trapped man    remained.    He

effectively   blocked the       gate   completely.     I helped a supporter out and

escorted him to the penalty area of the pitch.              He appeared to be recovering

so I placed him in the recovery position.                I looked up and saw officers

trying to pull down the fence in front of CS enclosure.                 I ran to assist,

but this exercise proved         futile.    I helped some     fans over the top of the

fence and returned to Gate 3.

Throughout    this period    the    officers at      the front of the fence had been

subjected to a hail of missiles from the crowd.             The blue crash barrier that

had collapsed was thrown from the crowd and landed on officers at the front.
I was hit by a shoe and I believe coins, although I cannot be certain of

what    the missiles        were.      I assisted at Gate       3 and      carried,    with other

officers, eight bodies from the terrace.                I attempted to resuscitate four of

these to no avail.

The    crowd up against        the fence were still being, crushed,             unable to help

themselves due to being weak through lack of air.                   Another problem was that

people had died in the crush and were lying as 'dead weight' on people who

were still      alive.       The ninth body I removed was placed on a make shift

stretcher - a piece of advertising board and I carried him to the gymnasium.

I wrote my number on his hand and returned to the pitch where I attended to

the    injured.      I     carried    a young lad of about          12 years    of age      to the

gymnasium for transport to hospital.              I then remained with my body.

The body was subsequently numbered No 31.                 He was a male, white, about 50

years, brown greying hair and moustache, 5'11" tall, wearing a blue shirt,

white tee shirt,         grey trousers and socks, black shoes and wearing a gold

coloured Rotary wrist          watch on his       left wrist.        He   had no identifiable

property    -     (£36.00    cash,    a cigarette     lighter and packets        of cigs).        I

remained    with     the    body     carrying   out   duties   as   instructed,       ie,   Gen   18

preparation for photograph etc.

At 8.30 pm, I handed the body over to a CID Officer and completed a GJA

statement to that effect.

I went off duty at 9-00 pm.

I am aware that it is inevitable that there will be criticism of various

aspects of the incident at Hillsborough.                 I feel, however,       that given the

circumstances,       the    decisions    taken,   particularly      in    relation    to    opening

gates, were correct.          I fully support them and feel it was the only course

of action to take.
There is little point in 'iffing' and 'butting' about Police action.         The

circumstances were something that could never have been prepared for and I

am sure    if it happened tomorrow, most officers would behave in the same

manner.    Very   little,   if anything,   could have been done to prevent   the

tragedy.

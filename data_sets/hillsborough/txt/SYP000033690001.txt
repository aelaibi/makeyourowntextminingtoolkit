                HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUIRY



                           PHASE I



       WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS OF THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION




Introduction



1.        The FA is concerned to assist the Inquiry on

interim general recommendations about the needs of crowd

control and safety at sports grounds, pending completion of

the Final Report of the Inquiry.     Other parties will no

doubt be making detailed submissions to the Inquiry as to

the events on 15 April 1989 and recommendations specific to

the particular topography or organisation of Hillsborough

football ground, and the FA's submissions on such matters

are limited to those relevant to general interim

recommendations.



2.        It is obviously important that the public can be

reassured that during the next football season (which begins

on 19 August 1989) spectators can attend football matches in

reasonable safety following the serious breakdown in crowd

control and safety which occurred at Hillsborough both

inside, and to a lesser extent outside, the ground on the

day of the tragedy.   It is assumed that the Inquiry will

wish to make interim recommendations necessary for that
    \
K




        purpose.   As the disaster occurred at one of the big

        football events of the year and involved a failure to

        control a large and eager crowd,       it may be of assistance to

        the Inquiry to know the high profile matches which are

        likely to occur prior to 1 January 1990.       A list of matches,

        at grounds with a capacity   of more than 30,000 spectators,

        where the attendance is expected to reach 75% of the

        capacity appears at Appendix 1.



             There are however many important general issues such as

        the retention or appropriate design of perimeter fencing,

        the appropriate design or division of terracing, the

        desirability and practicability of all-seater stadia, the

        relevance of identity cards under a national membership

        scheme and difficulties caused by alcohol abuse and late

        arrival of spectators, on which evidence will only be

        available to the Inquiry in Phase II from clubs or other

        organisations not represented in Phase I.



        3.         The FA have therefore taken the liberty of

        assuming that the Inquiry will only make general interim

        recommendations if (a) it considers them necessary for crowd

        safety pending completion of the Final Report or (b) it

        considers them of such obvious general application as not to

        be influenced by evidence to be taken in Phase II.




                                      -   2-
4.           The FA will deal in this submission with:-



       (i)   A brief discussion of the principal cause of the

             disaster [paragraphs 6 to 15]



      (ii)   The FA's proposals to the Inquiry on

             recommendations prior to the new season

             [paragraphs 16 to 27]



     (iii)   Matters given in evidence which directly involve

             the FA [paragraphs 28 to 31]



Appendix 2 sets out relevant references to the evidence

supporting the propositions in each paragraph below.



The Principal cause of the Disaster



5.           The principal cause of the disaster was the

failure to close off the mouth of the tunnel by about

2.45 pm when Pens 3 and 4 of the Leppings Lane terraces were

up to or near safe capacity.        Had that been done, fans could

not have crowded down the tunnel causing gross overcrowding

of Pens 3 and 4 and the deaths of many of those already in

the pens and some of those crowding down.        If the tunnel had

been closed off in proper time, the many other events which

have given rise to criticism would have taken place without




                                -   3-
disaster and indeed without significant overcrowding,          since

the evidence indicates that the numbers of spectators which

entered the Leppings Lane End, including those who entered

through the gates or got in illicitly without tickets, did

not or did not significantly exceed the capacity of the west

and north sides of the ground.           Put another way, the tragedy

occurred because of crowd distribution within the west end

of the ground, not because of excessive numbers entering the

ground.



6.          The evidence is overwhelming that the

responsibility for preventing overcrowding of the central

pens had been undertaken by the police, and that the cause

of the disaster was accordingly a failure in policing.           The

police,    including the South Yorkshire Police, in general do

a magnificent job in managing football crowds week in and

week out throughout the season at a very considerable

commitment of officers' time and police resources in

general.     Everyone concerned with football must be grateful

to them for their willingness       (and, despite Hillsborough,

their continued willingness)    to police football matches and

allow spectators to enjoy themselves in passionate support

of their team.    Most of the officers of all ranks of the

South Yorkshire Police who have given evidence have shown

impressive character and professionalism.




                                -   4-
7.        There is general agreement that the decision of

Supt Marshall to demand the opening of the gates at the

Leppings Lane End was correct in view of the risk of injury

outside the ground.    Only Supt Marshall appeared (wrongly)

to blame himself for that decision.      The actions to be taken

inside the ground if the gates were to be opened were not

Supt Marshall's responsibility, but that of the Police

Commander.



8.        The Police Commander did not consider delaying the

kick off (until far too late) because of a police

preconception that the kick off should not be delayed if

fans had no excuse for late arrival.      The conversation

between the Police Commander and Supt Murray at about 2.30

reflected this.     A decision to delay the kick off for

fifteen minutes announced at 2.3 0 would probably have

relieved the frustration of the crowd which was building up,

prevented the hysteria to get in which developed, and

enabled the turnstiles to work faster.      It is in fact likely

that the kick off would have had to be delayed by up to half

an hour to allow the whole crowd in.



9.           The division of the Leppings Lane Terrace by

radial fences was a system appropriate for use by opposing

fans of different parts of the terrace or convenient

management of a limited crowd by filling one or more pens on

the terrace.     In such situations it promoted the safety of




                                -   5-
the spectators by preventing groups of fans having excessive

space to run in or possibly preventing horizontal surges in

the crowd.     It almost certainly enabled the police to reduce

their manpower commitment at the Leppings Lane End for

league matches.



10.          For the three semi-finals of 1987-9 however, which

were known in advance to be all ticket sell-outs at least at

that end of the ground, the police formed the view that the

fans would find their own level on the terraces.     In

contrast to league games they made no provision in their

operations orders for specific responsibility in checking

the level of the known favourite pens    (3 and 4), for

directing the crowd away from them or closing the tunnel

entrance before they became too full, or for the

communication between officers charged with these duties.

Instead they relied on general monitoring by officers in the

vicinity including the Police Control Box.     In retrospect it

can be seen that it was essential to have express provision

in the operation orders to cover these matters.     Fans were

not in fact able to find a comfortable level in all areas of

pens 3 and 4 because the lack of gates in the radial fences

(save at the top) prevented lateral escape.     The situation

in local areas of the terraces appears    (on the evidence now

available)   to have been uncomfortable in 1987 and 1988

(although the 1988 black and white photographs of the

terrace during the match (Exhibit 68) shows a tight but not




                                -   6-
obviously uncomfortable crowd).          There may have been

overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4 in 1989 before Gate C was

opened for the first time at 2.47 pm:          at any rate they

would have become gradually overcrowded even without the two

mass entries of fans through Gate C, whilst Pens 5 and 6

remained comparatively empty.



11.         The configuration of the West Stand and Terrace

presents an obvious problem of crowd management.          Crowding

on a terrace cannot be observed from the top or back of that

terrace,   let alone through a concrete stand:        Pens 3 and 4

could only be observed from the West Stand, the perimeter

track or the Police Control Box (or indeed, as the

photograph exhibited late in the Inquiry shows, the top of

the North Stand).    Closure of entrances could only be

achieved from behind the West Stand, where obviously

officers were out of sight of the observers.          Despite the

views expressed in evidence by the Police Commander, it was

hazardous to leave such a matter to the initiative of local

officers.



12.         The methods by which Chief Inspector Creaser, who

was in charge of the concourse behind the West Stand and the

turnstiles, expected to be informed that the pens were full

and that the tunnel needed to be closed were haphazard.             It

is submitted that it was for the Police Control Box or other

officers to ensure that Chief Insp Creaser was informed when




                                -   7-
the tunnel required to be closed, not his responsibility to

seek such information, particularly when he had taken care

to enquire as to the method to be used.



13.      It will be recalled that Insp Bullas gave evidence

that from his position in the West Stand above Pens 3 and 4

at about 3 pm he saw a "river of people" flowing down Pen 3.

It is submitted that this evidence assists in assessing the

results of the opening of Gate C for the second time at 2.53

with the entrance to the tunnel uncontrolled.    The entry en

masse from above of a large number of eager spectators would

obviously have created intolerable crushing in that Pen.

While the absence of perimeter fencing would have allowed

the crowd to spill out into the pitch and not remain crushed

in the pens,   it is suggested that even in the absence of

perimeter fencing there would very probably have been some

serious crushing casualties and even deaths against crush

barriers or from spectators spilling over those in front.



14.      In the event, as everyone knows, the spectators

were crushed together and against the perimeter wire for a

considerable time.    Casualties must have been very greatly

reduced had the perimeter gates been larger or the radial

fences been absent or broken by gates or gaps at the bottom

corner of the pens.




                               -   8-
Interim Recommendations



15.          In proposing interim recommendations the FA has

examined in particular the problems associated with

terracing and perimeter fencing.          It is also concerned about

the problems associated with the National Membership Scheme.

These three subjects are briefly discussed below and the

interim measures are suggested in paragraph 27 below.



Terraces



16.        There is obviously increased danger of crushing in

a narrow pen such as Leppings Lane Pens 3 and 4 which has

its sole or main entrance at the top with lateral fences

with no bottom gates, and with spectators walking down to

the entrance at the top of the terrace rather than having to

climb (as for instance they do at the Kop en d ) .        Terraces of

course vary in their configuration and the position of their

entrances.     Recommendations appropriate for a terrace such

as Leppings Lane may for instance be different to those

appropriate for the Kop.



17.        The evidence has shown that monitoring spectator

density by eye may have allowed at least local over-crowding

on the Leppings Lane terraces.           It must be remembered that

for many years police officers or stewards have monitored

the crowding in a terrace by eye or by walking through the




                                -   9-
terrace and have acted accordingly to control overcrowding.

Granted that spectators may have accepted a level of

crowding which an outsider would consider uncomfortable

(probably a tighter level of crowding thirty years ago than

they do tod a y ) , this system seems to have been generally

successful in preventing crushing.



18.         However, the density expected to be seen by police

or stewards monitoring the terrace may have been too great.

In the light of the disaster, it seems advisable, pending

full consideration of the problem in Phase II of the Inquiry

to reduce the density expected in terraces and pens with

perimeter fencing in order to assist the safe monitoring of

the   crowd       in those areas.The FA believe that the density

allowed for in the safety certificates at many grounds (at

least before the disaster) has been based on the maximum of

5.4 spectators per square metre set out in the Green Guide.



19.         The FA therefore invite the Inquiry to made two

interim recommendations to Certifying Authorities:



      (i)   where a terrace   is divided into pens which are

              self-contained or at least have restricted exits

              at the bottom of the pen, each pen should have its

              own crowd capacity stated in the Safety

              Certificate;




                                -   10 -
      (ii)   where there is perimeter fencing of the pen or

             terrace and no mechanical counting system to

             establish the numbers admitted to each pen, there

             should subject to local conditions be a 20%

             reduction from pre-Hillsborough levels in the

             number of spectators permitted on the terrace or

             pen   (where no individual pen capacity is being

             allotted it will be necessary to divide the

             capacity of the terrace appropriately in order to

             establish the appropriate reduced capacity for

             each pen on the terrace).



20.          The FA suggests that this overall recommended

reduction should be "subject to local conditions" because

there will be many terraces at league grounds which can

safely be monitored by eye and where the permitted

capacities are already cautious.           There are probably many

Licensing Authorities who have proceeded in a different way

to the Licensing Authority for Hillsborough.           For instance,

where lower densities have been applied to a terrace in the

safety certificate, or very wide gates have been required in

any perimeter fencing (and there has been a good deal of

such safety work over the summer since the disaster)          it

seems likely that the Licensing Authority has already

applied its mind to particular problems of that terrace and

that no further reduction (or less than the standard




                                -   11 -
recommended 20%)   is necessary to reassure spectators of

their reasonable safety.



21.         The FA expressly suggest a reduction from

pre-Hillsborough levels because within days of the disaster

it asked all league clubs to review safety at their grounds

and it is aware that many Certifying Authorities have

actively considered safety on terraces and have imposed

reductions in the numbers permitted on particular terraces.

It should be made clear that 20% is not meant to apply

indiscriminately where a reduction in response to the

disaster has already been made.



Perimeter Fencing



22.         There have been moments during the course of the

Inquiry when one or other party appears to have treated

crowd safety and crowd control as two separate matters and

has suggested that perimeter fencing is concerned with

control and not safety,     In fact safety and control of

spectators are not divisible in the context of football

matches.     Perimeter fences have not been erected (and often

insisted upon by the FA) in order to keep the pitch

beautiful.     They are there to prevent overexcited or

malevolent fans from proceeding onto the pitch to challenge

rival fans    (an invitation to battle which is likely to be

accepted)    or to attack players or officials or to stop the




                               -   12 -
game.   Experience has shown that if fans get onto the wide

expanse of the   pitch in order to indulge in violence it is

very difficult   for the   police to control them and that (as

with any crowd) the violence can be contagious.          In extreme

cases this can lead to very serious incidents such as the

pitch battle at Birmingham (Popplewell Final report)         or at

the Luton-Millwall match, both of which occurred in 1985 and

involved serious casualties.        There has been crowd violence

since the Hillsborough disaster.          Even a "benign" crowd

invasion, such   as that   which occurred at the Cup Final in

1989, may only   require   one ortwo fights to be picked for

general violence to develop, particularly when drink has

been taken.   It will be recalled that the requirement for a

barrier to protect the playing area from invasion is not

just a requirement of the FA, but is stressed by UEFA.



23.        For these reasons the FA believes that perimeter

fencing will continue to be necessary at many grounds.            The

appropriate design for such fencing will be an important

matter for Phase II of the Inquiry and the FA has already

inspected a collapsible system in France.



24.        FA Rule 24(i)(b) makes clubs responsible for

ensuring inter alia that no spectator is permitted to

encroach onto the pitch and Rule 2 4 (ii) makes any failure to

discharge its responsibility misconduct subject to the

defence of no control and all due diligence.          Clause D2 of




                               -   13 -
\




    the 1985 Memorandum (Common Bundle page 296)   is an extension

    of this.   The FA will make clear to all clubs that no

    disciplinary action will be taken if spectators are

    temporarily allowed onto the pitch because of fear of

    overcrowding (which might taken literally be a breach of

    Rule 24(i)(b)) and will consider whether the Rule should

    formally be amended.    This will of course leave open the

    possibility of disciplinary proceedings for having allowed

    any overcrowding to develop in the first place.    There is

    evidence that in spite of the wording of clause II of the

    1985 Memorandum no club has in fact been disciplined merely

    for failure to implement a precaution in the Memorandum and

    the FA will take the opportunity of clarifying this to

    clubs.



    National Membership Scheme



    25.        The Inquiry will be aware in general terms of the

    National Membership Scheme provided in the Football

    Spectators Bill 1989.    It is generally assumed that any such

    scheme will have to involve the presentation at the

    turnstile by a spectator to a computerised machine of an

    identification card.    Such a procedure is bound to increase

    delay at turnstiles and arguments have been raised that such

    a scheme would have increased the problems at Hillsborough.

    In view of the political issues involved,   it is respectfully

    suggested that it should be made clear in the Interim Report




                                  -   14 -
(if it is the Inquiry's intention) that these matters will

be considered in Phase II and that none of the interim

recommendations are to be read as favouring (or dismissing)

the scheme.



Specific Recommendations



26.          In providing for crowd safety pending the Final

Report of the Inquiry the FA submits that the following

interim recommendations be made:



       (i)   a general recommendation for a 20% reduction from

             pre-Hillsborough levels (subject to local

             conditions)   in numbers of spectators permitted

             under safety certificates in pens or on terraces

             with perimeter fencing (see paragraph 20 above).



      (ii)   where a pen or terrace is expected to be full and

             the perimeter fence in front of it has narrow

             gates,   it may be appropriate for the gates to be

             kept open throughout the match with stewards and

             police in attendance.          This expedient was employed

             by Manchester United FC at the Liverpool v

             Nottingham Forest FA Cup Semi-final replay on 7

             May at Old Trafford (which has similar fencing to

             Hillsborough all round the perimeter)          in order to

             allay fears of spectators in the aftermath of the




                                 -   15 -
        disaster.   It has in fact been used at various

        grounds on previous occasions.



(iii)   clubs must ensure that demarcation of

        responsibility between themselves and the police

        for crowd control and safety within the ground has

        been clearly agreed in advance.      Where, as appears

        to be usual, the police undertake responsibilities

        within the ground they must clearly stress in

        their operation orders for matches the necessity

        for awareness of possible crowd distress and

        response in opening perimeter gates if

        overcrowding is anticipated.       It is essential that

        there is a sufficient police or steward presence

        on the perimeter track for this purpose.       It is

        further recommended       that one or more specific

        police officers and/or stewards be expressly

        assigned to monitor the crowding of terraces or

        pens from suitable vantage points.       We have

        already commented (paragraph 11 above)      on the need

        for specific provision in operations orders to

        ensure proper communication between those

        monitoring crowding and those in position to close

        the relevant entrances.



 (iv)   it is apparent that improvements are needed in the

        medical care available to spectators.       While the




                           -   16 -
FA are not experts in the detail of equipment

needed, it is submitted that the following would,

in general terms, be appropriate:



(a)   every club should have a designated first aid

      room with a sink, a work top, preferably two

      beds with curtains, a stocked cabinet, power,

      light, water, a direct telephone line and

      reasonably close access for emergency

      vehicles.   Stretchers, a carrying chair and

      oxygen should be available during matches.

      One person at the club should expressly be

      made responsible for upkeep of the first aid

      room and facilities.



(b)   a doctor should be present from a reasonable

      time before all matches.         There is no reason

      why the doctor should not, at typical League

      matches with small crowds, be there as cover

      for both spectators and players, since

      players are far more likely to be injured

      than spectators,         He should however be

      located so as to be available for both.         At

      matches with larger attendances,        it may be

      appropriate to have increased medical cover,

      although it is suggested that paramedical

      ambulance cover may be of greater importance.




                    -   17 -
      (c)   for all matches with an anticipated

            attendance of over 5,000 spectators, at least

            one fully equipped ambulance with paramedical

            staff should be in attendance.       For big

            matches two ambulances and a foot team of

            ambulance men should be available.



      (d)   the above is intended to be in addition to,

            and not to be in substitution for, the

            services presently supplied by the St. John's

            Ambulance Brigade or the like at matches.



(v)   One may have sympathy with the general police

      approach and apparent prior agreement of

      Supt Murray and the Police Commander, evidenced in

      their conversation at about 2.30 pm, to the effect

      that if fans choose to drink in pubs and turn up

      late at the ground in large numbers they should

      expect to miss part of the match and not to have

      the kick off delayed for their benefit to the

      inconvenience of those fans who have taken the

      trouble to turn up early.        It may well be that

      that principle could have been applied at the

      Penistone Road end without causing a crush

      situation, since there is no bottleneck at that

      end of the ground.        Nevertheless, as Chief Supt.

      Mole observed, a decision on delaying kick-offs




                           -   18 -
       should not depend on why spectators are late, and

       it is regrettable that the Police Commander never

       considered this option until it was too late.            It

       is submitted that the kick off should be delayed

       if the police anticipate a considerable

       accumulation of fans at turnstiles shortly before

       kick off for whatever cause, if the police

       consider that there may be consequent difficulty

       in crowd control.        The addition of the proviso is

       necessary to prevent late fans having any

       confidence that the match will be delayed for

       their convenience.



(vi)   the marking or sign posting of turnstiles and

       entrances or exits inside and outside the Leppings

       Lane End left much to be desired.         (The Inquiry

       may however, feel that the spectators admitted

       through gate C would have proceeded down the

       tunnel to see what was happening whatever the

       state of the signs above the tunnel and therefore

       the lack of signs to the flank entrances was not a

       cause of the disaster).         It also seems clear that

       spectators would have been assisted by clearer

       colour matching of turnstiles to the colour of

       their tickets.   The Inquiry will no doubt wish to

       make appropriate recommendations on these matters.




                            -   19 -
      (vii)   the FA remain of the view, mentioned in evidence

              by Mr Kelly that the attendance of non-ticket

              holders at all ticket matches will persist unless

              and until they experience regular disappointment

              in seeking to gain entrance to the ground, and

              that all possible measures must be taken to

              prevent such entrance.        It is hoped that this will

              be a matter for more detailed discussion in

              Phase II of the Inquiry.



The Choice of Hillsborough for the Semi-final in 1989



27.           It is obvious that it would have been more

appropriate from the supporters' point of view if Liverpool

had been allocated the Spion Kop end of the ground both in

1988 and in 1989, since the club has a much larger home

support than Nottingham Forest.            The allocation of ends was

a matter for the police, who made it clear that Liverpool

must on crowd management grounds be allocated the Leppings

Land End.      The correctness of the police decision has not

been challenged, nor has it been suggested that the FA could

have reversed it.      The FA accept, as Mr Kelly acknowledged

in evidence that there was an element of unfairness in the

choice of Hillsborough for the second year running.            The FA

understand it to be generally accepted that the choice of

ground, while unfair in that way, was not causative of the

disaster.




                                -   20 -
28.          It was natural and understandable to stage a

semi-final between the same teams as last year at the same

venue as last year when the staging club and the local

police force had unrivalled experience in staging

semi-finals and the 1988 match had apparently gone well.

The police appear to have regarded it as helpful to them

that they were staging a repeat fixture.     While the

telephone call from Liverpool prior to the Meeting of the

Cup Committee should have been disclosed to the Committee as

a whole and not merely to the Chairman of the Matches and

Grounds Committee, Mr Kelly is almost certainly right in

saying that the Committee would still have accepted that

Chairman's recommendation.



29.          Selection of semi-final venues is always

difficult.     The FA will be taking steps to improve the

information available to it on the suitability of venues for

particular ties, including information from supporters.     For

example, it appears that one of the grounds offered to the

FA as a venue had not, unknown to the FA, been issued with a

safety certificate, although it should be said in fairness

to the club that there is no indication that the ground was

unsafe.



30.          The internal misunderstanding at the FA and

consequent failure to notify Sheffield Wednesday ten days

before the match that there would be no pre-match




                               -   21 -
entertainment is regretted, but the Inquiry will have noted

that the tie was advertised in Liverpool as having pre-match

entertainment.   The lack of the pre-match entertainment

cannot therefore have influenced the time of arrival of

Liverpool fans, although some fans who arrived early may

have been disappointed.   No significant evidence of

disappointment has been given and the view at Watford FC

that pre-match entertainment does not materially influence

time of arrival may well be correct.

                            PHASE I



       WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS OF THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION




Introduction



1.        The FA is concerned to assist the Inquiry on

interim general recommendations about the needs of crowd

control and safety at sports grounds, pending completion of

the Final Report of the Inquiry.      Other parties will no

doubt be making detailed submissions to the Inquiry as to

the events on 15 April 1989 and recommendations specific to

the particular topography or organisation of Hillsborough

football ground, and the FA's submissions on such matters

are limited to those relevant to general interim

recommendations.



2.        It is obviously important that the public can be

reassured that during the next football season (which begins

on 19 August 1989) spectators can attend football matches in

reasonable safety following the serious breakdown in crowd

control and safety which occurred at Hillsborough both

inside, and to a lesser extent outside, the ground on the

day of the tragedy.   It is assumed that the Inquiry will

wish to make interim recommendations necessary for that
purpose.   As the disaster occurred at one of the big

football events of the year and involved a failure to

control a large and eager crowd, it may be of assistance to

the Inquiry to know the high profile matches which are

likely to occur prior to 1 January 1990.    A list of matches,

at grounds with a capacity   of more than 30,000 spectators,

where the attendance is expected to reach 75% of the

capacity appears at Appendix 1.



     There are however many important general issues such as

the retention or appropriate design of perimeter fencing,

the appropriate design or division of terracing, the

desirability and practicability of all-seater stadia, the

relevance of identity cards under a national membership

scheme and difficulties caused by alcohol abuse and late

arrival of spectators, on which evidence will only be

available to the Inquiry in Phase II from clubs or other

organisations not represented in Phase I.



3.         The FA have therefore taken the liberty of

assuming that the Inquiry will only make general interim

recommendations if (a) it considers them necessary for crowd

safety pending completion of the Final Report or (b) it

considers them of such obvious general application as not to

be influenced by evidence to be taken in Phase II.




                             -2-
4.           The FA will deal in this submission with:-



       (i)   A brief discussion of the principal cause of the

             disaster [paragraphs 6 to 15]



      (ii)   The FA's proposals to the Inquiry on

             recommendations prior to the new season

             [paragraphs 16 to 27]



     (iii)   Matters given in evidence which directly involve

             the FA [paragraphs 28 to 31]



Appendix 2 sets out relevant references to the evidence

supporting the propositions in each paragraph below.



The Principal cause of the Disaster



5.           The principal cause of the disaster was the

failure to close off the mouth of the tunnel by about

2.45 pm when Pens 3 and 4 of the Leppings Lane terraces were

up to or near safe capacity.     Had that been done, fans could

not have crowded down the tunnel causing gross overcrowding

of Pens 3 and 4 and the deaths of many of those already in

the pens and some of those crowding down.     If the tunnel had

been closed off in proper time, the many other events which

have given rise to criticism would have taken place without
1   1




        disaster and indeed without significant overcrowding, since

        the evidence indicates that the numbers of spectators which

        entered the Leppings Lane End, including those who entered

        through the gates or got in illicitly without tickets, did

        not or did not significantly exceed the capacity of the west

        and north sides of the ground.        Put another way, the tragedy

        occurred because of crowd distribution within the west end

        of the ground, not because of excessive numbers entering the

        ground.



        6.          The evidence is overwhelming that the

        responsibility for preventing overcrowding of the central

        pens had been undertaken by the police, and that the cause

        of the disaster was accordingly a failure in policing.        The

        police,    including the South Yorkshire Police,    in general do

        a magnificent job in managing football crowds week in and

        week out throughout the season at a very considerable

        commitment of officers' time and police resources in

        general.    Everyone concerned with football must be grateful

        to them for their willingness (and, despite Hillsborough,

        their continued willingness)    to police football matches and

        allow spectators to enjoy themselves in passionate support

        of their team.    Most of the officers of all ranks of the

        South Yorkshire Police who have given evidence have shown

        impressive character and professionalism.




                                        -4-
7.         There is general agreement that the decision of

Supt Marshall to demand the opening of the gates at the

Leppings Lane End was correct in view of the risk of injury

outside the ground.    Only Supt Marshall appeared (wrongly)

to blame himself for that decision.     The actions to be taken

inside the ground if the gates were to be opened were not

Supt Marshall's responsibility, but that of the Police

Commander.



8.           The Police Commander did not consider delaying the

kick off (until far too late) because of a police

preconception that the kick off should not be delayed if

fans had no excuse for late arrival.     The conversation

between the Police Commander and Supt Murray at about 2.30

reflected this.    A decision to delay the kick off for

fifteen minutes announced at 2.30 would probably have

relieved the frustration of the crowd which was building up,

prevented the hysteria to get in which developed, and

enabled the turnstiles to work faster.     It is in fact likely

that the kick off would have had to be delayed by up to half

an hour to allow the whole crowd in.



9.           The division of the Leppings Lane Terrace by

radial fences    was a system appropriate for use by opposing

fans ofdifferent parts of the terrace    or convenient

management of a limited crowd by filling one or more pens on

the terrace.    In such situations it promoted the safety of




                               -5-
the spectators by preventing groups of fans having excessive

space to run in or possibly preventing horizontal surges in

the crowd.     It almost certainly enabled the police to reduce

their manpower commitment at the Leppings Lane End for

league matches.



10.          For the three semi-finals of 1987-9 however, which

were known in advance to be all ticket sell-outs at least at

that end of the ground, the police formed the view that the

fans would find their own level on the terraces.     In

contrast to league games they made no provision in their

operations orders for specific responsibility in checking

the level of the known favourite pens (3 and 4), for

directing the crowd away from them or closing the tunnel

entrance before they became too full, or for the

communication between officers charged with these duties.

Instead they relied on general monitoring by officers in the

vicinity including the Police Control Box.     In retrospect it

can be seen that it was essential to have express provision

in the operation orders to cover these matters.     Fans were

not in fact able to find a comfortable level in all areas of

pens 3 and 4 because the lack of gates in the radial fences

(save at the top) prevented lateral escape.    The situation

in local areas of the terraces appears (on the evidence now

available) to have been uncomfortable in 1987 and 1988

(although the 1988 black and white photographs of the

terrace during the match (Exhibit 68) shows a tight but not




                               -6-
obviously uncomfortable crowd).       There may have been

overcrowding in Pens 3 and 4 in 1989 before Gate C was

opened for the first time at 2.47 pm:       at any rate they

would have become gradually overcrowded even without the two

mass entries of fans through Gate C, whilst Pens 5 and 6

remained comparatively empty.



11.         The configuration of the West Stand and Terrace

presents an obvious problem of crowd management.       Crowding

on a terrace cannot be observed from the top or back of that

terrace,    let alone through a concrete stand:    Pens 3 and 4

could only be observed from the West Stand, the perimeter

track or the Police Control Box (or indeed, as the

photograph exhibited late in the Inquiry shows, the top of

the North Stand).     Closure of entrances could only be

achieved from behind the West Stand, where obviously

officers were out of sight of the observers.       Despite the

views expressed in evidence by the Police Commander, it was

hazardous to leave such a matter to the initiative of local

officers.



12.         The methods by which Chief Inspector Creaser, who

was in charge of the concourse behind the West Stand and the

turnstiles, expected to be informed that the pens were full

and that the tunnel needed to be closed were haphazard.          It

is submitted that it was for the Police Control Box or other

officers to ensure that Chief Insp Creaser was informed when




                                -7-
the tunnel required to be closed, not his responsibility to

seek such information, particularly when he had taken care

to enquire as to the method to be used.



13.       It will be recalled that Insp Bullas gave evidence

that from his position in the West Stand above Pens 3 and 4

at about 3 pm he saw a "river of people" flowing down Pen 3.

It is submitted that this evidence assists in assessing the

results of the opening of Gate C for the second time at 2.53

with the entrance to the tunnel uncontrolled.    The entry en

masse from above of a large number of eager spectators would

obviously have created intolerable crushing in that Pen.

While the absence of perimeter fencing would have allowed

the crowd to spill out into the pitch and not remain crushed

in the pens,   it is suggested that even in the absence of

perimeter fencing there would very probably have been some

serious crushing casualties and even deaths against crush

barriers or from spectators spilling over those in front.



14.       In the event, as everyone knows, the spectators

were crushed together and against the perimeter wire for a

considerable time.    Casualties must have been very greatly

reduced had the perimeter gates been larger or the radial

fences been absent or broken by gates or gaps at the bottom

corner of the pens.




                               -8-
Interim Recommendations



15.          In proposing interim recommendations the FA has

examined in particular the problems associated with

terracing and perimeter fencing.        It is also concerned about

the problems associated with the National Membership Scheme.

These three subjects are briefly discussed below and the

interim measures are suggested in paragraph 27 below.



Terraces



16.        There is obviously increased danger of crushing in

a narrow pen such as Leppings Lane Pens 3 and 4 which has

its sole or main entrance at the top with lateral fences

with no bottom gates, and with spectators walking down to

the entrance at the top of the terrace rather than having to

climb (as for instance they do at the Hop e n d ) .    Terraces of

course vary in their configuration and the position of their

entrances.    Recommendations appropriate for a terrace such

as Leppings Lane may for instance be different to those

appropriate for the Hop.



17.        The evidence has shown that monitoring spectator

density by eye may have allowed at least local over-crowding

on the Leppings Lane terraces.        It must be remembered that

for many years police officers or stewards have monitored

the crowding in a terrace by eye or by walking through the




                                -9-
terrace and have acted accordingly to control overcrowding.

Granted that spectators may have accepted a level of

crowding which an outsider would consider uncomfortable

(probably a tighter level of crowding thirty years ago than

they do today), this system seems to have been generally

successful in preventing crushing.



18.         However, the density expected to be seen by police

or stewards monitoring the terrace may have been too great.

In the light of the disaster,    it seems advisable, pending

full consideration of the problem in Phase II of the Inquiry

to reduce the density expected in terraces and pens with

perimeter fencing in order to assist the safe monitoring of

the crowd     in those areas. The FA believe that the density

allowed for in the safety    certificates at many grounds (at

least before the disaster) has been based on the maximum of

5.4 spectators per square metre set out in the Green Guide.



19.         The FA therefore invite the Inquiry to made two

interim recommendations to Certifying Authorities:



      (i)     where a terrace is divided into pens which are

            self-contained or at least have restricted exits

            at the bottom of the pen, each pen should have its

            own crowd capacity stated in the Safety

            Certificate;




                               -10-
      (ii)   where there is perimeter fencing of the pen or

             terrace and no mechanical counting system to

             establish the numbers admitted to each pen, there

             should subject to local conditions be a 20%

             reduction from pre-Hillsborough levels in the

             number of spectators permitted on the terrace or

             pen (where no individual pen capacity is being

             allotted it will be necessary to divide the

             capacity of the terrace appropriately in order to

             establish the appropriate reduced capacity for

             each pen on the terrace).



20.          The FA suggests that this overall recommended

reduction should be "subject to local conditions" because

there will be many terraces at league grounds which can

safely be monitored by eye and where the permitted

capacities are already cautious.     There are probably many

Licensing Authorities who have proceeded in a different way

to the Licensing Authority for Hillsborough.     For instance,

where lower densities have been applied to a terrace in the

safety certificate, or very wide gates have been required in

any perimeter fencing (and there has been a good deal of

such safety work over the summer since the disaster)    it

seems likely that the Licensing Authority has already

applied its mind to particular problems of that terrace and

that no further reduction (or less than the standard




                              -11-
recommended 20%)    is necessary to reassure spectators of

their reasonable safety.



21.         The FA expressly suggest a reduction from

pre-Hillsborough levels because within days of the disaster

it asked all league clubs to review safety at their grounds

and it is aware that many Certifying Authorities have

actively considered safety on terraces and have imposed

reductions in the numbers permitted on particular terraces.

It should be made clear that 20% is not meant to apply

indiscriminately where a reduction in response to the

disaster has already been made.



Perimeter Fencing



22.         There have been moments during the course of the

Inquiry when one or other party appears to have treated

crowd safety and crowd control as two separate matters and

has suggested that perimeter fencing is concerned with

control and not safety,     In fact safety and control of

spectators are not divisible in the context of football

matches.     Perimeter fences have not been erected (and often

insisted upon by the FA) in order to keep the pitch

beautiful.     They are there to prevent overexcited or

malevolent fans from proceeding onto the pitch to challenge

rival fans (an invitation to battle which is likely to be

accepted)    or to attack players or officials or to stop the




                               -12-
game.   Experience has shown that if fans get onto the wide

expanse of the pitch in order to indulge in violence it is

very difficult for the police to control them and that (as

with any crowd) the violence can be contagious.      In extreme

cases this can lead to very serious incidents such as the

pitch battle at Birmingham (Popplewell Final report)     or at

the Luton-Millwall match, both of which occurred in 1985 and

involved serious casualties.     There has been crowd violence

since the Hillsborough disaster.      Even a "benign" crowd

invasion, such as that which occurred at the Cup Final in

1989, may only require one or two fights to be picked for

general violence to develop, particularly when drink has

been taken.   It will be recalled that the requirement for a

barrier to protect the playing area from invasion is not

just a requirement of the FA, but is stressed by UEFA.



23.        For these reasons the FA believes that perimeter

fencing will continue to be necessary at many grounds.        The

appropriate design for such fencing will be an important

matter for Phase II of the Inquiry and the FA has already

inspected a collapsible system in France.



24.        FA Rule 24(i)(b) makes clubs responsible for

ensuring inter alia that no spectator is permitted to

encroach onto the pitch and Rule 2 4 (ii) makes any failure to

discharge its responsibility misconduct subject to the

defence of no control and all due diligence.     Clause D2 of




                               -13-
the 1985 Memorandum (Common Bundle page 296) is an extension

of this.   The FA will make clear to all clubs that no

disciplinary action will be taken if spectators are

temporarily allowed onto the pitch because of fear of

overcrowding (which might taken literally be a breach of

Rule 2 4 (i)(b)) and will consider whether the Rule should

formally be amended.    This will of course leave open the

possibility of disciplinary proceedings for having allowed

any overcrowding to develop in the first place.    There is

evidence that in spite of the wording of clause II of the

1985 Memorandum no club has in fact been disciplined merely

for failure to implement a precaution in the Memorandum and

the FA will take the opportunity of clarifying this to

clubs.



National Membership Scheme



25.        The Inquiry will be aware in general terms of the

National Membership Scheme provided in the Football

Spectators Bill 1989.    It is generally assumed that any such

scheme will have to involve the presentation at the

turnstile by a spectator to a computerised machine of an

identification card.    Such a procedure is bound to increase

delay at turnstiles and arguments have been raised that such

a scheme would have increased the problems at Hillsborough.

In view of the political issues involved,   it is respectfully

suggested that it should be made clear in the Interim Report




                             -14-
(if it is the Inquiry's intention) that these matters will

be considered in Phase II and that none of the interim

recommendations are to be read as favouring (or dismissing)

the scheme.



Specific Recommendations



26.          In providing for crowd safety pending the Final

Report of the Inquiry the FA submits that the following

interim recommendations be made:



       (i)   a general recommendation for a 20% reduction from

             pre-Hillsborough levels (subject to local

             conditions)   in numbers of spectators permitted

             under safety certificates in pens or on terraces

             with perimeter fencing (see paragraph 20 above).



      (ii)   where a pen or terrace is expected to be full and

             the perimeter fence in front of it has narrow

             gates,   it may be appropriate for the gates to be

             kept open throughout the match with stewards and

             police in attendance.     This expedient was employed

             by Manchester United FC at the Liverpool v

             Nottingham Forest FA Cup Semi-final replay on 7

             May at Old Trafford (which has similar fencing to

             Hillsborough all round the perimeter)     in order to

             allay fears of spectators in the aftermath of the




                                -15-
1




            disaster.   It has in fact been used at various

            grounds on previous occasions.



    (iii)   clubs must ensure that demarcation of

            responsibility between themselves and the police

            for crowd control and safety within the ground has

            been clearly agreed in advance.    Where, as appears

            to be usual, the police undertake responsibilities

            within the ground they must clearly stress in

            their operation orders for matches the necessity

            for awareness of possible crowd distress and

            response in opening perimeter gates if

            overcrowding is anticipated.     It is essential that

            there is a sufficient police or steward presence

            on the perimeter track for this purpose.     It is

            further recommended   that one or more specific

            police officers and/or stewards be expressly

            assigned to monitor the crowding of terraces or

            pens from suitable vantage points.    We have

            already commented (paragraph 11 above)    on the need

            for specific provision in operations orders to

            ensure proper communication between those

            monitoring crowding and those in position to close

            the relevant entrances.



     (iv)   it is apparent that improvements are needed in the

            medical care available to spectators.    While the




                              -16-
FA are not experts in the detail of equipment

needed,   it is submitted that the following would,

in general terms, be appropriate:



(a)   every club should have a designated first aid

      room with a sink, a work top, preferably two

      beds with curtains, a stocked cabinet, power,

      light, water, a direct telephone line and

      reasonably close access for emergency

      vehicles.   Stretchers, a carrying chair and

      oxygen should be available during matches.

      One person at the club should expressly be

      made responsible for upkeep of the first aid

      room and facilities.



(b)   a doctor should be present from a reasonable

      time before all matches.     There is no reason

      why the doctor should not, at typical League

      matches with small crowds, be there as cover

      for both spectators and players,    since

      players are far more likely to be injured

      than spectators,     He should however be

      located so as to be available for both.     At

      matches with larger attendances,    it may be

      appropriate to have increased medical cover,

      although it is suggested that paramedical

      ambulance cover may be of greater importance.




                    -17-
      (c)   for all matches with an anticipated

            attendance of over 5,000 spectators, at least

            one fully equipped ambulance with paramedical

            staff should be in attendance.    For big

            matches two ambulances and a foot team of

            ambulance men should be available.



      (d)   the above is intended to be in addition to,

            and not to be in substitution for, the

            services presently supplied by the St. John's

            Ambulance Brigade or the like at matches.



(v)   One may have sympathy with the general police

      approach and apparent prior agreement of

      Supt Murray and the Police Commander, evidenced in

      their conversation at about 2.30 pm, to the effect

      that if fans choose to drink in pubs and turn up

      late at the ground in large numbers they should

      expect to miss part of the match and not to have

      the kick off delayed for their benefit to the

      inconvenience of those fans who have taken the

      trouble to turn up early.     It may well be that

      that principle could have been applied at the

      Penistone Road end without causing a crush

      situation, since there is no bottleneck at that

      end of the ground.     Nevertheless, as Chief Supt.

      Mole observed, a decision on delaying kick-offs




                           -18-
       should not depend on why spectators are late, and

       it is regrettable that the Police Commander never

       considered this option until it was too late.        It

       is submitted that the kick off should be delayed

       if the police anticipate a considerable

       accumulation of fans at turnstiles shortly before

       kick off for whatever cause,    if the police

       consider that there may be consequent difficulty

       in crowd control.     The addition of the proviso is

       necessary to prevent late fans having any

       confidence that the match will be delayed for

       their convenience.



(vi)   the marking or sign posting of turnstiles and

       entrances or exits inside and outside the Leppings

       Lane End left much to be desired.     (The Inquiry

       may however, feel that the spectators admitted

       through gate C would have proceeded down the

       tunnel to see what was happening whatever the

       state of the signs above the tunnel and therefore

       the lack of signs to the flank entrances was not a

       cause of the disaster).     It also seems clear that

       spectators would have been assisted by clearer

       colour matching of turnstiles to the colour of

       their tickets.   The Inquiry will no doubt wish to

       make appropriate recommendations on these matters.




                            -19-
      (vii)   the FA remain of the view, mentioned in evidence

              by Mr Kelly that the attendance of non-ticket

              holders at all ticket matches will persist unless

              and until they experience regular disappointment

              in seeking to gain entrance to the ground, and

              that all possible measures must be taken to

              prevent such entrance.     It is hoped that this will

              be a matter for more detailed discussion in

              Phase II of the Inquiry.



The Choice of Hillsborough for the Semi-final in 1989



27.           It is obvious that it would have been more

appropriate from the supporters' point of view if Liverpool

had been      allocated the Spion Kop end of the ground both in

1988 and      in 1989, since the club has a much larger home

support than Nottingham Forest.        The allocation of ends was

a matter      for the police, who made it clear that Liverpool

must on crowd management grounds be allocated the Leppings

Land End.      The correctness of the police decision has not

been challenged, nor has it been suggested that the FA could

have reversed it.      The FA accept, as Mr Kelly acknowledged

in evidence that there was an element of unfairness in the

choice of Hillsborough for the second year running.         The FA

understand it to be generally accepted that the choice of

ground, while unfair in that way, was not causative of the

disaster.




                                -20-
28.          It was natural and understandable to stage a

semi-final between the same teams as last year at the same

venue as last year when the staging club and the local

police force had unrivalled experience in staging

semi-finals and the 1988 match had apparently gone well.

The police appear to have regarded it as helpful to them

that they were staging a repeat fixture.     While the

telephone call from Liverpool prior to the Meeting of the

Cup Committee should have been disclosed to the Committee as

a whole and not merely to the Chairman of the Matches and

Grounds Committee, Mr Kelly is almost certainly right in

saying that the Committee would still have accepted that

Chairman's recommendation.



29.        Selection of semi-final venues is always

difficult.     The FA will be taking steps to improve the

information available to it on the suitability of venues for

particular ties, including information from supporters.     For

example,   it appears that one of the grounds offered to the

FA as a venue had not, unknown to the FA, been issued with a

safety certificate, although it should be said in fairness

to the club that there is no indication that the ground was

unsafe.



30.        The internal misunderstanding at the FA and

consequent failure to notify Sheffield Wednesday ten days

before the match that there would be no pre-match




                               -21-
entertainment is regretted, but the Inquiry will have noted

that the tie was advertised in Liverpool as having pre-match

entertainment.   The lack of the pre-match entertainment

cannot therefore have influenced the time of arrival of

Liverpool fans, although some fans who arrived early may

have been disappointed.   No significant evidence of

disappointment has been given and the view at Watford FC

that pre-match entertainment does not materially influence

time of arrival may well be correct.

     (i)   "up to or near safe capacity".   —    see Photos

   (iii)   Excess of capacity by entry of non ticket holders.

           The general impression is of no great excess

           although no accurate estimates can be made.

           HSE Report at para 9.7 gives a maximum estimate of

           10,124 people entering through Gate C and

           Turnstiles A-G.    Some of those will have been

           ticket holders for the West or even the North

           Stand, so should be deducted:       equally ticket
           holders for the terraces and some non ticket

           holders will have come through Turnstiles 1-16

           (see eg evidence of Sgt Burns, D17 eg 49 E-F) ,

           although the actual numbers of non ticket holders

           coming in would not have been great.



Not all non ticket holders outside gained entry.      Some were

left outside looking dejected.

           flow rates through the turnstiles over the time of

           the crush.   On the basis argued, the crush would

           have been relieved earlier with consequent

           increase in flow.

 AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE 1 OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

              AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISASTER
SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS ASSOCIATION
 AT THE CONCLUSION OF PHASE 1 OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
               AS TO THE CAUSE OF THE DISASTER


                           SUMMARY


The Disaster was wholly avoidable.


95 spectators died as a result of overcrowding in pens 3 and 4
of the Leppings Lane Terraces.


The overcrowding was caused by the failure of those responsible
to take sufficient care to ensure the safety of the crowd.
Spectators were allowed to enter the central pens without any
mechanical monitoring of their numbers. They were allowed to
pack without any sufficient observations being made as to their
distribution and without any attempt being made to distribute
them evenly and safely.


The effect of the overcrowding was exacerbated both by the
layout of the barriers in pen 3 and the size of the perimeter
gates which became the only possible means of escape.


The apparent indifference of the police to the overcrowding was
caused by an over-emphasis both during their training and in
their matchday approach to the problem of crowd disorder.


Distress and injuries but not necessarily fatalities, were
caused by the delay in appreciating that the problem was one of
overcrowding and not a pitch invasion.


The evidence revealed a number of deficiencies in both the long
and short term plans and preparation for staging events at
Hillsborough in general and the 1989 F.A. Cup Semi-Final in
particular.


The problems that arose out of the deficiencies were
foreseeable.   Further the build up of spectators outside the
Leppings Lane turnstiles was not only foreseeable but was
                                  - 2 -


     almost inevitable.



9.   The allegations of misbehaviour made against spectators were
     exaggerated.   Such misbehaviour as occurred was not causative
     of the disaster, but undoubtedly contributed to the
     difficulties of policing the Semi Final.


10. By April 15th 1989 the problem areas were already the subject
     of a number of rules, regulations and guidelines.    More careful
     consideration of such matters would have resulted in steps
     being taken that would have averted the tragedy.



1.    At the outset may I concede that repeatedly over at least the
     last 20 years a proportion of the people attending football
     matches, and in some cases a sizeable proportion, has behaved
     quite disgracefully.   "Football Supporter" has become a term of
     abuse.


2.   After years of unsuccessful attempts to eradicate the problem
     of hooliganism, by 1989 the policies of policing and
     stewarding were almost invariably designed with restraint and
     control uppermost in mind.     Perimeter and radial fences and
     thus pens were amongst the weapons used in the continuing
     conflict between the Authorities and the hooligans.
     Important as the problem of hooliganism was and regrettably
     still is, the emphasis upon it has contributed to there being
     occasions when less than sufficient attention has been paid to
     the safety aspects of crowd management.


3.   Before I deal with the events which preceded the tragedy and
     the Disaster itself, may I further concede that none of the
     allegations made against some of the supporters are
     inventions. People arriving late, drunk, without tickets and
     anxious to get into the ground and prepared to invent all
     kinds of excuses as to why they should be admitted and on
     occasions stooping to improper methods to gain entry are
                                   - 3 -


     nothing new.   Indeed, such matters are commonplace.     If the
     S.Y.P. were genuinely as surprised about such matters as their
     evidence would have us believe then their knowledge of
     football crowds and thus their ability to police properly is
     severely limited.


CONSPIRACY THEORY


It may be appropriate at this point to deal with the only positive
explanation put forward by the police for their inability to
police the crowd.   Whilst accepting the presence of some ticketless
and drunken fans, I completely reject and indeed deplore the
S.Y.P.'s attempts to develop a "conspiracy theory" to explain the
sudden change in atmosphere of the fans at around 2.40 p.m.      Any
change in atmosphere was much more likely to be due to the fans'
complete lack of patience and faith in the police's ability to
handle the situation.    Delays escalated from 2.20 onwards and by
2.40 the crowd had simply had enough.


P.S. Morgan (Day 15 Page 123 at Page 130) describes people
remaining outside the gates after 3.00 p.m.      If there had been a
conspiracy amongst Liverpool fans to force an entry, those clearly
ticketless fans would have been inside the ground and not outside
resigned to missing the game.      Witnesses describe hundreds of fans
displaying their tickets as they walked calmly through Gate C.


In any event and whilst the "conspiracy theory" is rejected, I
would submit that such a theory can be no excuse for the police's
failure to perform and can at best be described as an attempt by
the S.Y.P. to deflect criticism to other quarters and thereby save
face, and avoid civil liability.     Inspector Calvert (Day 30 Page 7
at Pages 40) described the system adopted in 1987 for the Leeds -v-
Coventry City game, of how the police had their plans laid down for
the expected invasion of ticketless Leeds fans.     He described the
steps taken to keep ticketless fans away from the turnstile areas.
Several fans described similar steps being taken in 1988.
                                   - 4 -


To support their theory, the S.Y.P. have produced a history of
alleged misbehaviour by Liverpool fans.      If information is so
crucial to the manner in which the game should be policed, then
why did the police not arm themselves with it before hand?      I would
submit that the reality is that the police were aware of the
problem of ticketless fans but took no positive steps to deal with
it and, that in any event, the number of ticketless fans was
nothing like that which would support any "conspiracy theory"
whatsoever.


EVENTS OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES -


4.    In any event, the evidence as to the misbehaviour of the fans
outside the turnstiles will have to be carefully considered.        It
would appear that a number of each of the undesirable categories
mentioned above was present, and contributed to the difficulties
encountered by the police.   Nevertheless, when all the evidence is
considered and in particular:-


i.    The contents of the video;
ii.   The S.Y.P. composite album of photographs of the crowd
      outside;
iii. The evidence of P.S. Proctor, Day 16, Page 38, at Pages 39
      and 45.
      P.S. Morgan, Day 15, Page 123, at Day 16, Page 4.
      Mr Kay Day 25, Page l at Pages 2-7.
      Mr Garrett Day 4, Page 58 at Pages 59, 64 and 70.


The Inquiry may well come to the conclusion that in this particular
tragedy hooliganism was not a major factor but merely an
aggrevating difficulty for the police.      (No doubt in Phase 2 of
the Inquiry the question of hooliganism will be more relevant and
submissions will be made to the Inquiry by the Football Supporters
Association).
                                 - 5 -

THE ATTITUDE OF THE POLICE


5.   The final general submission concerns the approach by the
police to the question of safety and comfort of the paying
customers who entered the Leppings Lane Terraces.     I emphasise only
once the true status, that is of paying customer, of those
described as either fans or supporters or perhaps dismissively as
"the crowd".   Clearly there is no question of mal-fides, but
perhaps because of their pre-occupation with control, there was a
total disregard of the possibility of overcrowding and consequent
crushing, until far too late.


6.   Regrettably I cannot make the same concession at to mal-fides
about the approach of the South Yorkshire Police to the Inquiry.
The evidence given by a number of Police Officers as to whether
or not they knew or should have known of the clear overcrowding of
pens 3 and 4 was at best less than satisfactory and at worst
intended to mislead.     Throughout the Inquiry the Police seemed
unable to make the slightest concession even when faced with
overwhelming evidence.    Time and again Counsel for the S.Y.P was
compelled to cross-examine on a basis clearly unsupported by the
evidence of the senior Police Officers called to give evidence.


CHOICE OF HILLSBOROUGH AS THE VENUE


7.   As all provincial stadia were designed originally for
non-segregated crowds and thereafter adapted for "home" and "away"
segregation with large imbalances of numbers, there is always a
problem in seeking venues for F.A. Cup Semi Finals.


A matter complained of by many Liverpool supporters and by
Liverpool Football Club was the choice of Hillsborough as the
venue, because of the consequent allocation of the Leppings Lane
end with the lesser number of tickets to the better supported club.
Although Mr Kelly of the Football Association made a concession
that there was an element of unfairness in the choice, the choice
of venue and the allocation of ends was not in itself a
contributing factor.   There were, however, two unfortunate effects
                                 - 6 -


both foreseeable of allocating the Leppings Lane end to the better
supported club. Firstly more fans would arrive without tickets and
more fans with "Kop" tickets would appear at the Leppings Lane end
seeking entry.


The choice of Hillsborough as a Semi Final venue really only
becomes questionable when the configuration of the Leppings Lane
turnstiles and the allocation of turnstiles as a whole is taken
into account.     The rate at which the turnstiles were expected to
operate at various sections of the ground does not appear to have
been the subject of sufficient consideration by the organisers.


8.   In two respects the Football Association could properly be
criticised.     First the members of the Challenge Cup Committee were
not informed of all the facts surrounding the choice of
Hillsborough and in particular only Mr Kelly and Mr Wiseman were
made aware of Liverpool's representations.     Secondly, too much
importance was attached to Mr Evans' report on the 1988 Semi-final.
Clearly, there had been no in-depth investigation of Hillsborough
by Mr Evans, certainly insufficient to justify the report
outweighing all other considerations.


9.   The Inquiry has investigated in depth all the relevant matters
not only the events of the day but the history of Hillsborough.
Many areas of concern have been revealed but these submissions deal
principally with those aspects which more directly concern the
supporters.


10. In essence the main cause of the tragedy can be simply
expressed.    Ninety-five people were crushed and in an area which
was overcrowded.     People had been allowed to enter the central pens
without any mechanical monitoring of their number and allowed to
"pack" without any sufficient observations being made as to the
density and without any attempt being made to distribute them
evenly and safely.
                                - 7 -


HISTORY OF HILLSBOROUGH


11. The background to the staging of matches is a catalogue of
errors and omissions which coupled with the deficiencies of
policing and stewarding on the day led to the deaths of 95 fans.


12. The possibility of uneven packing and consequent danger to
spectators should have been in the forefront of the organisers '
minds.


(a) Beginning in 1981 (see page 127 Inquiry bundle) the debriefing
of the police after the Semi-final mentions allegations of
overcrowing, the usual packing problems and the operation of safer
limits.


(b) The letter to the Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
(page 140 Inquiry bundle)   5th June 1981 states;


    "The Leppings Lane end is not constructed to give maximum aid
    to the packing and control of the crowd and the accepted crowd
    capacity is such that there is no safety margin".


(c) Thereafter there has been the introduction of radial fences
which created initially a central pen.      Subsequently further
alterations created the present layout of the terraces.      Finally a
barrier (144) was removed.


Clearly these changes should have been reflected in the safety
certificate but they were ignored.      More importantly insufficient
consideration was given to the effect of all the changes on the
capacity of Lepping Lane Terrace as a whole or to the proper limits
of the separate areas.    Just how little attention has been paid to
such matters was reflected in misunderstandings during the Inquiry
as to appropriate limits.    Only when the H.S.E. reported was the
level of overcrowding finally revealed.
                               - 8 -


LICENSING AUTHORITY


13. There have been no amendments to the Safety Certificate since
it was originally issued in 1979 to take account of the structural
alterations that have occurred.


ADVISORY GROUP


A wholly unsatisfactory arrangement existed.     The
representative of the Sheffield City Council, Mr Bownes, considered
that it was appropriate for the "advisory committee" to discuss
certain matters, and for him at the conclusion to make
recommendations. The discussions concerning the removal of barrier
144 ended with Inspector Calvert's views outweighing the
reservations of Mr Strange.   In the event, Mr Bownes made the
decision on this very important issue.     I would submit that careful
consideration should be given by the Inquiry to recommending
greater control at a higher level by Licensing Authorities,
although the members of the advisory committee are wholly
professional, they represent particular standpoints and thus it is
important that the final decision should be made by someone with a
sufficient knowledge, expertise and experience to balance all
factors.


The position was that by April 1989 the Local Authority in the
shape of Mr Bownes was unaware of the possible effect of the radial
fences or safe capacities or that the question had been raised and
not dealt with on a number of occasions.


RESPONSIBILITY FOR POLICING & STEWARDING THE TERRACES


14. As the Inquiry progressed and the Senior Police Officers
gave their evidence and Counsel for the police cross-examined, one
could have been forgiven for concluding that there was an element
of misunderstanding between the police and the club as to whose
responsibility it was to monitor the distribution of the fans.
However, after consideration of all the evidence and particularly
that of Mr Lock (Day 31 Page 45) and that of Mr Calvert (Day 30
                               - 9 -


Page 7) the matter would seem to have been settled.    The Police
failed in their duty and lamentably tried to blame others.     As Dr.
Eastwood said (Day 26 Page 75) the Leppings Lane Terraces were
perfectly safe if the packing was properly controlled.


15. However, by April 15th 1989 the astonishing position was that
the supporters were left "to find their own level".    No submission
of mine can condemn sufficiently this appallingly dangerous
practice nor what I can only describe as the disgraceful and
pathetic attempts by some witnesses to justify the policy.     Despite
having to concede that one of the methods of re-distribution was
for supporters to climb over fences, the S.Y.P. still failed to
make any concession at all as to the inadequacy of the method of
distribution.


LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILE AREA


16. During 1985/6 there had been various discussions and plans
prepared with a view to re-organising the turnstiles at the
Leppings Lane end of the ground.    The Plans were prepared with
segregation in mind and when they were abandoned apparently
interest in the loading of the individual pens was also abandoned.


17. On semi-final day only turnstiles A-G were in use for both
the West and North West Terraces.   Even if no account is taken of
the creation of pens 3 and 4 by the construction of the radial
fences, the Safety Certificate could not be complied with as there
was no way of monitoring the numbers in the North West Terrace.      In
itself not a vitally important matter, but very important as an
indication that the distribution of the fans was hardly considered.
Exactly the same conclusion is arrived at when one considers the
Operational Orders for Semi-Finals, which differ from the orders
for League Matches.   Quite clearly when segregation and hooliganism
are considered the packing of the terraces is also considered.
However, when safety alone is the concern apparently no one
considers the problem of even and safe distribution.
                               - 10 -

EVENTS OF APRIL 1STH 1989


The history of Hillsborough has resulted in a configuration at
the Leppings Lane turnstiles which can only be described as
unsatisfactory.   The most cursory consideration of the
configuration and the turnstile allocation would have revealed the
danger of problems arising outside the grounds. The police
apparently ignored the lesson of the 1923 Cup Final.      However, the
evidence of Mr Walker (Day 24 Page 128) about 1988 and Mr Morath
 (Day 28 Page 99 at Page 100 ) about 1987 seems to show that a
filtering system useful at all grounds but essential at the
Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough had been used but the police
previously but for some reason was abandoned in 1989.


19. The organisers claimed to have grounds for expecting the fans
to arrive early and at a steady rate.   How exactly they came to
that conclusion was never satisfactorily explained.     All the other
warning signs were ignored.   There was a half hearted attempt to
encourage people to arrive early, not assisted by the information
on the tickets, but surely the authorities should have realised
that standing on the terraces for longer than is necessary is less
attractive then sitting on the park wall with a can of lager.


20. Almost everyone connected with football knows that virtually
every attempt to encourage people to arrive early has failed.
Despite the events of 1981, of 1987, the knowledge that Sheffield
fans themselves were starting to arrive later, apparently because
there were no problems in 1988 no contingency plans were made.


21. There was clearly insufficient consideration of the Green Guide
at paragraph 46 which deals with contingency plans, paragraph 47
which deals with turnstile flows and the ACPO Guide to Policing of
Football Matches, Entry to Grounds at paragraph 1.40 to 1.45.


22. Despite the number of officers from serials 14-15-16-17 who
were assigned to perform the duty by the Operational Order no
attempt was made to organise orderly queueing.   The disappearance
                               - 11 -


of Sergeant Payne and a number of serial 16 was not properly
explained by the length of time allegedly taken to process a
prisoner, nor has the whereabouts of Inspector White been revealed
to the Inquiry.   The absence of Sergeant Morgan was unfortunate and
the nett result was the absence of an effective police presence at
the turnstile area.


23. Many spectators gave evidence of the abnormally slow rate of
admission, no doubt caused by a combination of factors, which
included in addition to those set out above, the searching of fans
and on some occasions searching fans twice, the crushing itself,
people without tickets, people with tickets for different
turnstiles to the one through which they were seeking entry.      No
doubt the insufficient and misleading signs outside the grounds
did not assist. The evidence was of a lack of police presence at
around 2.20 and attempts to inform the police of the situation met
with a cool response.


Perhaps the evidence of Inspector Hand-Davies   (Day 13 Page 22
at Pages 29,31,48-49) and his attitude when giving evidence best
illustrates the unfortunate relationship between a few of the
police officers and a number of the supporters.


DELAYING THE KICK-OFF


24. The result was that by the latest 2.40 consideration should
have been given to delaying the kick-off.   If the situation was so
grave as to necessitate Superintendent Marshall seeking permission
to open the gates then clearly the kick-off should have been
delayed.   It would appear that the decision not to delay was made
bearing in mind every aspect of the problem other than safety.     A
wholly improper approach was taken and a suspicion arose that the
fans were in some way being punished for arriving at a time which
the senior police officers considered "late".     There are many very
goods reasons why kick-offs should not be delayed, but safety
factors should outweigh all other considerations.
                                 - 12 -


EVENTS INSIDE THE STADIUM


25. In addition to the intelligence from outside the ground,
the computer, the CCTV and visual observation of the crowds inside
of the ground should have led to an early realisation that the
crowd would not be in the ground by 3.00 p.m.     There are many
unfortunate direct conflicts of evidence about these matters, most
notably between Mr Kirton and Mr Mackrell.     Whatever the Inquiry's
finding about the conflicts it is quite clear that insufficient
attention was paid to the possible effect of many people being
outside the ground and anxious to enter by kick-off.


26. There is little reason to dwell on the arrangements inside the
turnstile area.     All the evidence points to a total disregard of
the necessity of sufficient directional signs.     In the event,
coupled with the insufficient and misleading directions on the
tickets, these were important matters.     The evidence of a number of
fans was to the effect that they believed the tunnel to be only
means of entry to the terraces.     Not surprisingly, therefore, when
gate C was opened the resultant flow was down the tunnel towards
the already overcrowded central pens.


POLICE CONTROL ROOM


27. The actions and reactions of these in the control room between
the first request from Superintendent Marshall and the visit by
Messrs Kelly and Kirton are difficult to explain.    Suffice it to
say that apparently between the time of Mr Marshall's first request
and final demand Chief Superintendent Duckenfield apparently froze.
Despite being encouraged by his Officers to make decisions none
were forthcoming.    In the 6-7 minutes immediately prior to all
gates being opened there was a total failure of the police to
consider the effects of so doing.    It is quite clear from the
evidence - Dr. Eastwood, Mr Eccleston and Mr Lord and others - that
closing the tunnel has been an effective method of crowd
distribution but apparently it was not even considered.    Indeed for
many weeks of the Inquiry attempts were made to suggest that such
                                 - 13 -


a method has never been used; and was inappropriate and even
impractical    (the Inquiry was never shown the statement of former
Sergeant Higgins which apparently described the blocking of the
tunnel in 1988 and was in the possession of the S.Y.P before the
Inquiry started). No attempt was made to inform the club or indeed
Superintendent Greenwood of the intention to open the gates.
Whether it was the recent promotion of Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield and his consequent lack of experience which alone
caused the problem is a matter perhaps for the Inquiry.       What is
absolutely clear is that the performance of those in the control
room was less than satisfactory.


28. A matter of grave concern to the supporters was the behaviour
of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield       when Mr Kelly visited the
control box.     A full if somewhat belated apology for what happened
is not sufficient.     It would clearly have been sensible for Mr
Duckenfield to make no comment as to the cause of the tragedy,
indeed that would have been the appropriate action. To allow and
deliberately allow Mr Kelly to leave the room with the
understanding that the fans were responsible for forcing open the
gates was a deliberate attempt to avoid the criticism that he
expected for opening the gates.     The misleading of Assistant Chief
Constable Jackson will no doubt be considered elsewhere.


EVENTS INSIDE THE STADIUM


29. By 2.45 p.m. despite there being a very substantial number
of Liverpool supporters outside the ground, pens 3-4 were full.         It
is perhaps indicative of the attitude of the police as to what was
acceptable in terms of packing that despite there being
overwhelming evidence of overcrowding and discomfort, no one in
authority seemed to notice.    The compelling and disturbing evidence
of Mr Hicks    (Day 4 Page at Page 12 ) will have to be carefully
considered.   It accepted, his evidence reveals the most blatant and
total disregard for the spectators.       It is difficult to accept that
despite the position of the police control box, despite the
presence of officers and stewards on the perimeter track, no one
noticed the obvious overcrowding.     Perhaps the true explanation is
                                 - 14 -


that the police did see what to others is obviously
overcrowding, but at the time considered it acceptable.      The
absence at lunch of PC Smith was another unfortunate and avoidable
coincidence.     The evidence of the level acceptable to the police
and hitherto tolerated by the fans was disturbing.      Apparently
little short of screams for help or actual casualties would have
caused action to be taken.     Indeed at 3.00 there is evidence that
such screams failed to bring a response.


POSSIBLE DELAY


30. Many hours of evidence were heard on this subject, but perhaps
consideration could be given to three particular pieces of evidence
that support the submission that by the latest 2.55/2.56 should
have been realised that there was a serious overcrowding problem.


(a) Inspector McRobbie    (Day 20 Page 12 at Pages 13, 18-19)


    From a position in the control room he noticed that
    supporters were being let out onto the track,     that action was
    presumably taken by an officer who by that stage had noticed
    overcrowding.   Inspector McRobbie left the control box and went
    to the track. Video evidence shows him by the track at 2.59.
    Thus the observation of the overcrowding by the officer on the
    track must have been at the latest 2.55/2.56.


(b) Mr Towler (Day 19, Page 86 at Page 87)


   Mr Towler describes being summoned to Gate 4 by a colleague
   some 5 minutes before kick-off and then describes people being
   crushed against the perimeter fence.


(c) P.C. Illingworth (Day 17 Page 130 at Pages 133-5)


   P.C. Hooson (Day 29 Page 14 at Pages 17-19)


   It would appear that PC Illingworth arrived first at Gate 4 and
   opened the gate at a time when people were able to spill out.
                                - 15 -


    He then moved to Gate 5 intending to assist people to transfer
    to a less crowded area.    Gate 4 must then have been closed
    because when it was opened by PC Hooson he remained at the
    gate for some time.


    Photograph 212 from the Liverpool Echo shows that at 2.59 gates
    3,4, and 5 were all open and according to PC Hooson his arrival
    at the track was before 2.59.


31. There was evidence that not all the police officers realised as
quickly as they might have done what was happening.     As a result
some spectators trying to escape were returned to the pens and the
gates closed on more than one occasion.     Such actions caused
feelings of resentment but were clearly caused by a genuine
misunderstanding of the situation.


32. Overall there was an unacceptable     delay probably arising in
fact from the training of the police which concentrated on the
control aspect of crowd management (P.C. Bichard Day 19 Page 39 at
Page 52).


33. The adequacy or otherwise of the emergency plans and
possible improvements will no doubt be the subject of submission
from others. Nevertheless the F.S.A. wish sincerely but wholly
inadequately to thank all the individual policemen,    fireman,
ambulancemen and volunteers who heroically gave of their best.


PERIMETER FENCES


34. Although submissions as to possible recommendations are to be
made by the FSA in Phase 2, immediate action must be taken about
perimeter fences.   Any consideration of the problems of crowd
management reveals the difficulty of balancing the approach needed
to both detect control and eradicate disorder and to ensure safety.


The primary function of a perimeter fence is to prevent
encroachment onto the pitch.   The nature of the Hillsborough fences
was such that the pens became traps.     Clearly such fences must be
                                - 16 -


immediately removed.   Although bolt cutters on site may sound
initially attractive and can do no harm, as was said by the Fire
Brigade,   if you need bolt cutters, you have got the wrong type of
fence.


35. With some reservations the F.S.A. accept that perimeter fences
are necessary for crowd control.   Clearly the Inquiry will have to
assess the expert evidence available and thereafter make
recommendations which balance the two    conflicting aspects.

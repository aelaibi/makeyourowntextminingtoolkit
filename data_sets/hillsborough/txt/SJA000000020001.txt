      I reported for duty at 1425 h r s . accompanied by Cadet Cpl
                              Ambulance Cadet |                 I
    We were positioned by the Westfield Disable stand nearest to
      the new Kop stand.
               Approx ima 1 1ey  6  min.    into    play,  there  was   a
  disturbance     at the Leppings Lane end of the field, at first we
  thought it was just rowdy fans climbing over the fence. The
  police went past us to deal with the situation, wâ€že thought they
   had gone to make them go back into the stand. When the second
   detachment of police went by, |                 our officer in charg,
   odero/us down with them.
   I left ________________ with Adult Ambulance Member
   When we arrived at the Leppings Lane end, we were grabbed          by
   eager hands to assit cassualties laid out on the pitch not
  breathing. I begain to help a W. P. C. to resuscitation to          a
    young boy, she gave the kiss of life whilst I did compressions
    ( 1 to 5 ) . We kept this up until           a man claiming to be a
  doctor, told us to stop and        go on to another casualty at our
  side.   He too was not breathing, I cleared his airway & begain
  ressucitating him (2 to 15) until a P.C> came to assist me          we
  changed to ($ to 5) method. A second P.C. spell me with the
  compressions, we worked in this fashion until a doctor said the
   man was d e a d .
  As I stood up I was grabbed by the wrist by a W.P.C. & dragged
   at great speed to the south corner of the pitch, were I saw a
  man on the floor, he also was not breathing. The W.P.C. & Myself
  begain resuscitation (1 to 5 ). But almost immediatley we were
Iq by a doctor that we were to late & tof#backf*other casualties
  behind   the goal     area.   Where   I  tried    to resuscitate more
  casualties assited by police & members of the public (Fans).
  I lost count of number of casualties I resusitated .
  I remember helping to take a man with leg injuries to the
  ambulance room on a carrying        chair & taking another man with
  a arm injury to the ambula nc e room. At one point I was sent to
  direct a ambulance round to the goal area.
  I was then asked to look at aman being resuscitated by a P.C.
  & a man. 'I took over from the man giving compressions I felt a
  pulse & at that precise moment a fire officer asked if we had
  apulse, I said yes & he put an oxygen mask over the casualties
   mouth, but he did not respond a doctor examined him & said he
  was   dead. By this time casualties were beging cleared from the
  pitch on stretchers & make shift stretchers. When the pitch had
  been cleared I wandered among the remaining fans who were in
  shock trying to help & consol them, at this point four Red Cross
  Members approached me & asked what could they do to help. Told
  them to spread themselfs around the field to help the people
  stood around as most of the serious cases had been taken to
  hospital or moved to the gym. I then came across a man bleeding
  from the nose & mouth, he said he had been head butted. I took
  him to the ambulance room. On my way back to the pitch a
  policeman asked me to get a stretcher & follow him. Which I did
  to the south end of the Kop stand, a man was laid on the pitch
                                                         <

it turn out he was a Notts Forrest fan. I was told by another man
who was with him that he had fell & twisted his knee, also that
he suffered from Epilepsy. He did not appear to be in a fit so
I proceed to examin his knee which I found to have a. hospital
dressing on, his friend told me that he had just been in hospital
fo r < x H . o p e r a tion on the knee.So I immobilised the leg by strapping
it to his qood 1eq with a fiqur of 8 round his feet & a. broad
bandage above the knee this was all I c o u l d ^ e c a u s e I had no more
bandages left. We transported him to an ambulance.
I was then told to qo to the ambulance room and wait for
instruction.                At about 1800hrs we were told we could qo home if
we wished I decided to take the two cadets home.
It was not until 1 qot home that I realised I was covered in
blood. My arms & leqs & ribs ached were I was kicked & walked
on      by        people      carryinq  casualties  over  me   whilst  I was
resuscitating other casualties. I recall being struck on the head
with           board thrown down by fans to be used as a. makeshift
stretcher. Cosidering the conditions we had to work in everyone,
( Police, Fans, Doctors, Ground staff, St Johns) DID A DAMNED
GOOD JOB.

HILLSBOROUGH: LETTER FROM MRS SPEARRTTT


As requested I attach a draft reply to the letter from
Mrs Spearritt whose 14 year old son died at Hillsborough.

Our   enquiries  of       local   authorities have resulted   in an
encouraging overall      response.    This is reflected in the draft
reply.

Safety certificates are not issued annually because the 1975 Act
is framed in such a way that once a sports ground is designated
by the Secretary of State the ground occupier must apply for
rather than hold a safety certificate.    The local authority is
under a duty to issue one.     It is then the safety certificate
which, by imposing terms and conditions, is intended to achieve
reasonable safety at the sports ground.    Local authorities must
arrange for inspections of the ground at least once a year.

FI are content with the paragraph of the draft reply covering the
point about senior officers of the South Yorkshire police.

               LETTER DRAFTED FOR SIGNATURE BY' ...PS to S of S ......
                                                   (NAME OF SIGNATORY)



               The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter
               of 2 0 September and to say how very sorry he was to learn
               that you lost your son at Hillsborough.


               You asked whether there were any plans to make Lord Justice
               Taylor's    recommendations        law.       I should       explain    that       the
               present recommendations           are   interim recommendations.                  Lord
               Justice Taylor is expected to complete his report at about
               the   end   of   the     year    and    the   Government       will    of       course
               consider whether any changes in the law are necessary in the
               light of his final conclusions.


               In the meantime the Home Office has been monitoring, through
               the   police,    the     Fire    Service      and     the    local    authorities
               responsible      for    safety    certificates,        the    extent    to       which
               those   interim        recommendations        which    Lord    Justice          Taylor
               regarded as urgent have been complied with.                    The information
               which we have indicates that in the great majority of cases
               those recommendations have already been implemented.                            We are
               exploring with the local authorities concerned any cases of
difficulty and tfeeset it seems unlikely that, at least in the
short term, any change in the law will be necessary.


Safety       certificates        for    sports      grounds    are    not    like   MOT
certificates.            They    are    not      issued   annually    because       each
certificate         is    a   detailed        document    containing        terms    and
conditions needed to secure reasonable safety for the number
of spectators who are permitted to enter the different parts
of    the    ground      to which      it     applies.       Each    certificate      is
different.          Provided the circumstances of the ground remain
unchanged,          the       certificate          remains     relevant.        Local
authorities are nevertheless required by law to inspect each
designated football ground at least once a year and clubs
are under an obligation to notify the local authority of any
proposal       to   make      changes       to   the   ground which       may   affect
safety of spectators.               It is quite possible, therefore,                 for
a safety certificate to be amended more often than once a
year.


The Home Secretary has noted your views on the position of
senior officers of the South Yorkshire Police.                          As you know
a number of matters arising from the Hillsborough incident
are still under investigation.                     The Chief Constable offered
his    resignation         but   the    South      Yorkshire     Police     Authority
declined to accept it.                 This was entirely a matter for the
South       Yorkshire      Police      Authority and         is not   one    on which
I can comment.

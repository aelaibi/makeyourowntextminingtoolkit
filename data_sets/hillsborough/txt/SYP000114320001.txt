                 At    this     time    a       PS    came       around             asking        for      people        to    form    a    detail             to

                 believed        to    be       in    there.              After       a wait          of     some     t i m e , while           tne       ground

                 was    being      cleared;               we    went       o ut      onto      the      football          fieid       out       it       was

                 clear     that       any       remaining             bodies          had      been        cleared.,           Ws   were        tnen

                 directed        to    wait          in    the       North          stand,        with       other       officers          already

                 t h e r e , until      directed                to    do       otherwise.

              I am a single man               residing at the above address with rny parents and

              brother.
                                                              ___________ i_____________

              I am a Liverpool           s u p p o r t & rja .nd have    been for most          of my    life.     This

              year a friend of mine                                                 got me a ticket       for    the FA

              Cup semi-final            between Liverpool          FC and N o tt i n g h a m Forrest at

              H i l l s b o r o u g h to be    played on the       15th of April           1989    (150489).

              I paid £ 6.00 for the              ticket,      w hich was      to stand       in the Leppings Ln end

              of the g r o u n d .

              There were        four     friends      going    to the game w ith me and we were



              w ith   them,     they are,                                                       whose dad owned the

              car,    but the other            two   lads   I d o n ?t know that well,             they are      friends

                                                                                                                             S2362

                  of the other           two.

                  I d o n ’t know                     or                  addresses.

                  We started out on S a t ur d ay the                    15th    (150489)      at about     11.00am         (1100),

                  we did not stop a ny wh er e               on route to the game               nor did we       engage any

                  traffic       delays.         We a r r iv e d    in S he f fi e ld at about          12.15pm       (1215)       and

                  parked on a pub car               park,      the    pub I think was           called the Glass Bowl,

                  this was a p p r o x i m a t el y 2 or 3 miles                 from the ground.

                  I had seen a number               of supporters             from Liverpool        drinking         in vans       on

                  the way to the ground,                   but they were being               stopped by Police             outside

                  S h e f f i e l d and being       told to drink up or throw                   it away.       Inside

                  S h e f f i e l d itself I also saw a number of supporters, mostly Liverpool,
                  V                                                                                              -



                  drinking        from    cans walking around.

                  The    pub that we went             into,       the Glass Bowl,            for a drink was          packed with

                  L iv erpool       supporters,        but a lt ho ug h         they were having a good drink,

                  there was         no real      drunkeness          or fighting,         in fact      it was well          behaved.

                  We    came out of the            pub at about 2 . 0 0 p m         (1400)      a ga i n got   into        the    car

                  and drove         it to a side           street     near the ground,           but    I d o n ’t know

                  exactly where.            On route         to the ground          itself we did not            receive any

                  Police      d i rection       nor did we see any disturbances,                       fighting       or

                  d ru n k e n e s s .

                  It was about 2. 2 5 p m           (1425)        when          reached the entrance           to the        ground,

                  At the ground there were massej                        of     people,      in fact    it was       just    chaos,

                  these      seemed to be aboAit 2Qyqueues                      going   into 8 turnstiles.                 ihere was

             Up until          this   point     I had not seen any trouble wi th in the                      ground nor

             realised that            there was      going     to be a problem.

                I was    very scared at this time,                   I was     crushed over my            friend                and

                he was       crushed over      someone      else.          I c o u l d n ’t move my       arms and my       feet

                were    still    off the ground.            People         behLprti u s , who      had    m a na ge d to get

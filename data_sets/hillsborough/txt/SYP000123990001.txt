 NO.



G 17

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE FRONT FENCING WAS RATHER HIGH AND HAD SPIKES AT THE TOP WHICH MADE IT

 VERY DIFFICULT FOR FANS TO GET OVER THEM.          I ALSO FEEL THAT THE SIDE FENCING

 BETWEEN THE PENS WAS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR AS THERE WAS NO WHERE FOR THE FANS
                                                                                 PAGE    S

<318

 <351

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 WE WAITED IN THE GROUND FOR A WHILE AS A RESULT OF THE LOUD SPEAKER

 ANNOUNCEMENT AND EVENTUALLY LEFT WHEN OTHERS STARTED TO DO SO BUT WITHOUT

^ Y     RUSH.

 <352

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING      THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 THE POLICE WAS THE FGCAL      POINT OF THE FANS ANGER.    I SAW ONE POLICEMAN   ENTER

 PEN 3 FROM THE PITCH AT ABOUT 3.30 PM <1530) AND HE WAS SET UPON BY A COUPLE

 OF FANS.       OTHER POLICE HAD TO GO IN TO RESCUE HIM.    I SAW NOTHING ELSE OF A

 CRIMINAL NATURE.


019

 <353

 j ^ Y O U HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK IT TOOK TOO LONG      FOR THE POLICE TO REALISE JUST WHAT WAS HAPPENING

 IN PENS 3 AND 4.       HOWEVER WHEN THEY DID REALISE THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

 SITUATION THEY DID APPEAR TO DO A GOOD JOB AND TRIED TO HELP AS MUCH AS

 THEY COULD.

 <354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 NO.

 PENS 3 AND 4 LOOKED PACKED FULL.

 G^tA

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH?    IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 HAPPENED?

 NO.

 043

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,    IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 NO I SAW THE PENS GETTING MORE AND MORE PACKED AND SAW FANS START CLIMBING OU"

 BUT DIDN’T SEE A SURGE.


Q 16

 m

 WERE YOU INJURED,    IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

 Q47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED,    I SAW PEOPLE BEING CARRIED ONTO THE PITCH.        I

 SAW ABOUT 8 PEOPLE BEING CARRIED ON BOARDINGS.     THEY APPEARED TO BE DEAD.

 Q48

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,     IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

        I WENT ONTO THE PITCH AND HELPED ONE FAN WHO WAS S^^flNG SLUMPED.     HE

 APPEARED HURT BUT WANTED TO GET UP TO FIND HIS BfJP'fftER.   I HELPED HIM UP AND

 HE MANAGED TO WALK AWAY.     PEOPLE SAID GET BSf^RDINGS TO CARRY THE INJURED ON.

         MYSELF AND OTHER FANS GOT BO&ft?!-? FROM THE NORTH STAND AND THROUGH THEM

 ON THE PITCH.     I WENT BACK^0Wf5 THE PITCH TO SEE IF THERE WERE ANY OF MY

 FRIENDS WHO NEEDED HELP BUT A POLICEMAN TOLD ME TO GET BACK.        I SWORE AT HIM,

 AND HE DIDN'T BOTHER ANY FURTHER.     SHORTLY AFTERWARDS,      |SAID HE COULDN'T

 TAKE ANYMORE, SO WE THEN LEFT THE GROUND.

       ’ *                                                GSL77S

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 NO - I DIDN'T SEE WHAT HAD CAUSED IT - JUST THE CROWDED PENS WITH MORE AND

 MORE COMING INTO THEM.

 G5Q

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 4 <1600) - 4.15 PM <1615).

 Q51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

       OUR OWN ACCORD BECAUSE       LJ WAS FEELING THE PRESSURE.


Q1S

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 YES STRONG VIEWS.

 ^ I         THINK THAT THE GATES AT THE FRONT OF PENS 3 AND 4 SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 OPENED STRAIGHT AWAY WHEN THE FIRST SIGNS OF THE FANS GETTING CRUSHED

 STARTED.

 2) THE MAJORITY OF THE POLICEMEN ON THE PITCH JUST STOOD THERE DOING NOTHING

 AT ALL.

 3) THE ATTITUDE OF SOME OF THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND BEFORE THE MATCH WAS

 BAD (TALKED TO US AS THOUGH WE WERE DIRT).

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 NO - THE MATCH WAS THE SAME AS LAST YEAR.         THE PENS AT THE LEPPINGS LN END
                                                                             PAGE      9

 (3 & 4), WERE PACKED THE SAME LAST YEAR BUT I WAS IN THE WEST STAND SEATING

 AREA THEN.       I DIDN’T NOTICE ANY DIFFERENT ARRANGEMENTS BY POLICE/STEWARDS THIS

 YEAR.     LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE SPION HOP END OF THE

 GROUND.

 INQUIRY?

 IN THE YARD AT THE     BACK OF THE TUNNEL BETWEEN THE TURNSTILES I SAW 4 DEAD

 BODIES MALES LYING     IN THE YARD.

 I WENT TO THE SAME     GROUND LAST YEAR. THE SAME PROBLEM OUTSIDE   THE GROUND:

WITH THE CROWD EXISTED THEN.
f-  — .
 AS FAR AS I KNOW - NO GATES WERE OPENED.

AIIERE
   e      IS NOT ENOUGH TURNSTILES FOR PEOPLE TO ENTER THE GROUND.

 I MISS THE START OF LAST YEARS GAME DUE TO PROBLEMS ENTERING THE GROUND AND

 FELT THAT THE TERRACING WAS NOT ADEQUATE THEN.

 I WAS DISSAPOINTED TO FIND THAT THE SAME GROUND AND TERRACE WAS TO BE USED

 AGAIN.      THE USE OF PENS PREVENTING THE SPREADING OF FANS WAS ALSO A PROBLEM,

 I THOUGHT SOME LESSONS WOULD HAVE BEEN LEARNED FOR THIS YEARS.

 054
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE WAS A LOT OF THINGS WRONG WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO CAUSE THE TRAGEDY

 BUT THE MOST NOTICEABLE THING TO ME WAS THE LACK OF DIRECTION TO THE

 CROWDS WHEN THEY ENTERED THROUGH THE GATE TELLING THEM THEY COULD GO TO

 EITHER SIDE OF THE GROUND THEN THIS WOULDN’T HAVE HAPPENED.

 I THINK IF THE GATES WERE NOT OPENED OUTSIDE THE GROUND THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
                                                                              PAGE

 PEOPLsjE KILLED OUTSIDE.   I CAN'T SAY THAT OPENING THE GATES WAS RIGHT OR

 WRONG BUT I DON'T THINK THE MAN THAT MADE THAT DECISION     SHOULD BE

 PERSECUTED FOR.

 I WENT TO THE GROUND LAST YEAR FOR THE SEMI CUP FINAL AND THERE WAS A VERY

 BAD CRUSH OUTSIDE THE GROUND BUT NOTHING LIKE WHAT HAD HAPPENED THIS YEAR.

 YOU WERE ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT AND FIND OUT WHERE YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO GO.

 I THINK THIS MATCH SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD AT OLD TRAFFORD IN THE FIRST

 PLACE AND THE PROMOTERS SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO LIVERPOOL FC.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIQgNT WAS HANDLED

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?                                                     CQMM|

 I ^ E V E N THOUGH THE GAME HAD STOPPED THE POLICE IN FSONT OF THE FENCE DIDN'T

SEEM TO REALISE THAI_ THERE WAS A CRUSH AND PEOPL e UJ e RE DYING.        THEY DIDN'T

SEEM TO KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.              / ,    /

 2.     THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS   W T   USED   TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE.   I AM A

FIRST AIDER AND COULD OF BEEN AN/ASSISTANCE BUT I NEVER HEARD THEM ASK AND

FROM WHERE I WAS IT DIDN'T APPEAR THAT SERIOUS.

<354

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS JUDICAL

 INQUIRY?

 1^     FROM WHAT I SAW OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND INSIDE THERE SEEMED TO BE NO

PROBLEM BUT I WAS AWARE OF A LOT OF COACHES ARRIVING LATE AS A RESULT OF THE

 TRAFFIC DELAYS.

 2.     THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS ARE WRONG.

 3.     I BELEIVE THAT THE FRONT FENCES SHOULD REMAIN.      BUT   I THINK IT WAS THE

 SIDE FENCES WHICH CAUSED THE DEATHS.         YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE ACROSS THE

 TERRACING.     THAT WAY THERE WOULD BE NO CRUSH.

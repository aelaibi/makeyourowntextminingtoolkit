Thank you for your letter of 13 February, enclosing one from
of                                                  who commented, amongst
other things, on the tragic events at Hillsborough.

In December, in the House of Commons, I undertook to consider carefully the
points which were made in the programme Hillsborough, and the representations
made to me by the bereaved families and by others. The decision to reopen the
inquiry is one that cannot be taken lightly, and I will need to be convinced that it is
in the public interest to do so and that it will stand a chance of providing a better
understanding than there is at present of what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to my decision, I will consider whether there is any new evidence. I will
also consider whether that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it
been put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

I have now received a detailed report of all the points raised by the programme
from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, and I am also considering copies of
the video surveillance tapes used at the ground that day which have been
supplied by South Yorkshire Police. I will reach a decision on any further action
to be taken as soon as possible.

The Hillsborough Disaster

I have enclosed a letter from my constituent,                    who has
brought to my attention recent reports which lead him to believe that new
evidence should be presented to a fresh inquest on the Hillsborough
Disaster. I would be grateful for your comments.

 Dear Mr Portillo

 I write on three counts.

              diuma£ed that the recent budget resulted in such a

I would h«Sf ^ P ^ ovement. are not very good, to say the least.
LcTe h S L       r     y°U *111 be.able to use your influence to
tranSnor+ i r ®overnment funding in the future for public
to attr^i-              *.At 3 time When we need to be finding ways

right toneby investing in public transport.

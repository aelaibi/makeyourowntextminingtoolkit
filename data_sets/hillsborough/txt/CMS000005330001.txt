Building Regulations
1.   The purpose of building regulations is to secure the health

and safety of persons in or about buildings and of others who

may be affected by buildings.     Sporfcs stadia are "buildings"

so far as the Building Regulations are concerned and thus are

subject to the relevant requirements of the regulations.

2.   DOE, has a particular interest in securing consistency

between the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (The Green Guide)
issued by the Home Office and the building regulations for which

DOE Ministers are responsible.

3.   Building regulations are concerned with new work only.        The

Green Guide is primarily concerned with conditions at existing

grounds and therefore takes account of the constraints and

difficulties which are inherent in this situation.      It is no*fc

a design brief for a new sports ground i^E^or major reconstruction

work and in these situations higher standrads will often be

appropriate.    At the same time, the standards for new work should

clearly not be lower than those set out in the Green Guide.

4.    For thfijae ;reasons DOE will probably wish to retain advice

and guidance in the Building Regulations which is more stringent

than those in the Guide.      There are some requirements which are

less stringent than those in the revised Green Guide, particularly

relating to stairs, and we are proposing to bring these into line

as part of the current review of the Regulations.

                        Home Secretary announced on 12 November that 3
          would be introduced at the earliest opportunity to create new
          criminal offences specific to football as recommended by Taylor
          to control football hooliganism. The new legislation would ban
          the throwing of missiles, the chanting of racialist or obscene
          abuse, going onto the pitch without reasonable excuse arid ticket
          touting on the day of the match.

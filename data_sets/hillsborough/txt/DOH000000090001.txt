Jo,

SYMAS received extensive coverage in yesterday's Sunday People newspaper
with regard to Hillsborough - Tony Edwards again quoted, along with the
emergency controller at the time, Ray Clarke.

Derbyshire   Ambulance is now in the equation, as a paramedic at the time
having spoken out in support of SYMAS staff's comments.

I have left the newspaper with Beryl, but would be grateful if you could
then pass to Glenis for file copies.

Thanks
Tracy

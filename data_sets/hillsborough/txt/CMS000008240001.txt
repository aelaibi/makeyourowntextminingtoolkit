          Dear Mr Hurd

          Thank you for your letter of the 21 June,                                                      dSpseial^        as   I
          appreciate you must be an extremely busy man.

          I will now take this matter up with the ChaA:ft»an|of t ^ South
          Yorkshire Police Authority but trust that my Jooijlplaint Jsmd any
          subsequent action will not be prejudiced by this*irt4dy®rterft breach
          of protocol.

          If Miss Bannister's letter of 8 June on your bshalfjhad aTso made
          this clear it would not have been necessary t a havi bothered you
          further on this particular matter. Nevertheless^ X ajn grat iful for
          your clarification.

          Yourfaith                                                              x
                                                  1. F U A e.

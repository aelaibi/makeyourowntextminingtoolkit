  many      of    the       supposers            go     into.         I could            see    that       the    pub w a s           packed

   obviously           drunk       and     was       arrested         by S e c t i o n         Officer!                    We    walked

  with     the        man     down      Herries         Road     to    the         ground where             there          is a

   detention           r oo n     under        the    North      Stand.             We a r r i v e d       at    the       detention

   r o o m at     about         3.00pm         and    went     through             the    u s ual        booking        in      procedure.

  Whilst         we    were       in the        detention           room          I heard a          call       o ver      the     personal

                r o o m at a p p r o x i m a t e l y            3.15pm and              walked        to    the       Penistone                   Road          entrance

                to    the     ground.             I saw         three        or    four        unmarked          transit                vans          park       up    j us t

                outside          the     gates        and       ten     or    so    police          officers              got       out          from       each and

                ran     into      the     ground.               This      in fact            was    my     first,         football                match          and       I

                assumed          that     this        was       th e    normal          procedure           when          there          was          a    pitch

                invasion          or     fighting            had       broken       out,          so we     r e m a i n e d at               the          gates       as       we

                were     not      to     get      involved.               After         five       minutes           or    so       I saw a                number          of

                ambulances             arrive         and       then      fire      engines          and        so    I realized                      that       there

                was     something             very        serious         happening               inside        the       ground.                 I

                decided          that     I would            go    into       the       ground           and     see       if       1 c o u l d h elp.

                As    I approached               the        pitch       to a t t e m p t           to e n t e r       between                the N o r t h         Stand

                and     l aid     out     by f a n s         using        the a d v e r t i s i n g         hoardings.                       Almost

                felt     wa s     tight         around          hi s    neck.           I took       this        off a n d              put       it       in    his

                ba ck    trouser          pocket           and     undid          the    buttons           at    the       top          of       his       shirt.              1

                then     turned          him     on       his     side       attempting             to     put       him       into          a    recovery

                started          to    g iv e    him       oxygen.            The       man's       friend           was       hysterical                   trying             to

                shake       him       to w a k e      up     so    I pulled             him a w a y        whilst          the          ambulance                crew

                tried       to    revive         the       man.         The       man    calmed          down after                 a     short            while       so          I

As    1 walked           out       onto, the        Ditch          I saw          that          there     was       a    cordon          of

Policemen across                    the hhalf

                                                          \                      Ini
of    fans       coming          towards       rne c a r r y i n g           anotrier            man     by    his       arms       and       legs.

I j oi ne d       t h e m as        they      carried             him       to    the       p la c e     under          the N o r t h         Stand

where       they        put      him    on    the       floor          just       n ea r        to a n arnl&t^_ance.                    I turned

him    o ver                           le a n d     put       my       hand       in his          mouth        and       pulled          his

tongue       out,       t,u             him    from          choking.                 He m a d e       a few        gurgling             noises

and    he was          semi-conscious                   so    I assumed                                   be a l r i g h t .             I left

him    in the          charge          of    the    people             who       ha                      . him      round and             they

attended          toN^im.              I would          describe             the       man       a s w h i t e , 18--22 y e a r s .                     I

think       he was            clehsri s h a v e n .          He    was       fully          clothed           but       I cannot          remember

what    he was           wearing.

As    I left          t his      man    I saw       that          the       police          had     started             to    take       the

bodies       that        were       obviously            dead          into       the       gymnasium.                  Soon after             that          1

was    told       to     go      for    a briefing                of    special             constables              under          the    North

Stand.           From     there        we     were       told          to    go       to    the L e p p i n g s          Lane       exit       gates

and    control           the      supporters             as       they       left          the    ground.               We    left       the

ground       vi a      the P e n i s t o n e        Road          gates          and       walked        round          the       side    streets

to    the    Leppings             Lane       end.        I have             no    recollection                 of       what       the    time          was

when    we       arrived          the r e .        As    we       arrived             at    the     gates        to      the       ground          I

heard       an a n n o uncement               over       the       tannoy             telling          the     supporters                that          the

match       had       been ab a n d o n e d         and       to       leave          the       ground.          Soon after               the          fans

started          to    lea v e      the      ground          the       majority             of    whom were              well

behaved          a n d who        j us t     went       on    their          way.           There        were       some          however          who

were    very abusive                   to me       and       the       other          police        th e r e .          We    stayed          in

p o s i t i o n at       the      gates       for       approximately                      an    hou r    u n t il       the       last       of       the

fans    had       left a n d           then went             back       into          the       ground        where          at    6.00pm          we

had a       de--br i ef i ng           in the       North          Stand.              I left          the     g r o u n d at           6.30pm          and

went    straight               home.

             At    no   t im e   during     my    tour    of    duty      did    I witness        anything           I believe       to

             be a       criminal     offence       nor    did      I see      anyone         urinate     over       the    dead

             however       Section     Officer             did      have      one.      During         the    initial       briefing

             we    were    told    that     if    there    was      an    emergency          during      the    match       then

             there      would     be a n    announcement             o v er   the    tannoy       stating "Would             Mr

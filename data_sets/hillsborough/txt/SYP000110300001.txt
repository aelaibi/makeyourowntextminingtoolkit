    x iNraopucnoN

    1.1   Following an incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
          Football Club's (SWPC) Hillsborough Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
          request of Mr M S Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
          Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
          Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the HSE team
          investigating the incident following correspondence between the Court of
          Inquiry and the Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hammer.

    1.2 This report contains details of examinations performed on site and in the
        laboratory. The work was carried out by me and by other staff of HSE
        working on my instructions and under my general supervision.


    2 SURVEY OF PENS 3 AND 4

    2.1 Using the drawings prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, 1340/02 and 03,
        and comparing with figures stated in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
        1986, the following assessments were made.

    2.2   The heights of crush barriers should be 1.02m to 1.12m with a preferred
          height of 1.1m. In Ben 3 four out of five barriers do not conform. In
          Ben 4 six out of nine barriers do not conform.

    2.3   The alignment of gaps in successive reus of barriers on a terrace should
          form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. Of the four 'paths of
          gaps' in Ben 3, two do not conform. Of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Ben
          4, one does not conform.

    2.4   Gaps in the line of crush barriers should be at least 1.1m and not more
          than 1.4m in width. In Ben 3, four out of five gaps do not conform. In
          Ben 4, nine out of ten gaps do not conform.

    2.5   For a terrace slcpe of approximately 14° the interpolated maximum
          horizontal distance between barriers is 3.9m. In Ben 3 only one spacing
          does not conform. In Ben 4 only two spacings do not conform.

    2.6   Gates or other access points should have a minimum width of 1.1m. The
          gate to Ben 3 has a clearance width of 0.81 to 0.82m and the gate to Ben 4
          has a clearance width of 0.77 to 0.79m. Both therefore do not conform.

    2.7   The aim is for every spectator on the terraces to be within 12m of a
          gangway or exit. If the perimeter gaps are not considered as exits then
          approximately 40% of the spectators in Bens 3 and 4 will not be within
          12 metres of an exit.


    3 EXAMINATION OF THE BROKEN BftKRIER - NO 124A

    3.1   Barrier 124A was examined by HSE staff at Hillsborough Football Ground   chi
          17 April 1989. Various parts of this barrier and 3 core samples of
          concrete were taken to the Sheffield Laboratory on 24 April 1989 for
          detailed assessment.

    3.2   It was deduced that barrier 124A had consisted of a continuous horizontal
          tube, made from wrought iron, and four vertical supports each made from
          two lengths of steel angle section joined at the tcp by a steel gusset

                                            1
      plate. Five of the eight support feet were reinforced by additional angle
      sections which appeared to be let into the concrete terrace steps. TVro of
      the rear support legs were braced by further angle sections. A
      reconstruction is shewn in Figure 1. The barrier had failed apparently by
      partial collapse and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the
      horizontal tube at supports 2, 3 and 4, as shewn in Figure 2. Hie portion
      of the tube which had been located between supports 2 and 3 had been bent
      uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 133mn at midspan. The
      portion of the tube which had been located between supports 3 and 4 had
      been bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 20Qnsn at
      midspan. Carrier 124A was estimated to be approximately 60 years old,
      although it had received a number of modifications during its lifetime.

3.3   The tensile strength of the wrought iron 'tube material was measured at
      365MPa (23.6 tanf/in2) with an estimated elastic limit of 150MPa
      (9.7 tanf/in2). The tensile strength of the mild steel angle used for
      the supports was measured at 36GMPa (23.3 tonf/in ) with a yield stress
      of 288MPa (18.6 tonf/in2).

3.4   The tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under the
      metal straps designed to retain the tube. At these locations the tubes
      had not been painted, and the tube wall thicknesses, nominally 4.5mm, had
      been reduced significantly by corrosion. At the fracture surface
      corresponding to support 2 the residual thickness of the tube wall was
      found to vary from 0.4mm to 4.4mm arcund the circumference. Similarly at
      the fracture surface corresponding to support 3 the wall thickness was in
      the range 1.6nm to 4.5mm. At support 4, however, there was evidence that
      the tube wall had been perforated by corrosion at two locations producing
      holes which would have been approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before
      the collapse. Elsewhere, around the fracture corresponding to support 4,
      the wall thickness was in the range 1.1mm to 4.5nm.

3.5   In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
      iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. Fracture
      of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on the uphill
      side of the barrier at a position approximately 90° frcm top dead centre.
      The other tube fractures had suffered seme post-failure damage and the
      origins were not readily identifiable.

3.6 The failed supports had been corroded, particularly at the junction with
    the concrete steps and/or reinforcement angles. In these regions residual
    thicknesses in the range 3.1mm - 5.9mm were measured compared with a
    nominal thickness of 6.3mm.

3.7   large amounts of metal had been lost by corrosion fran supports 3 and 4
      near, what would have been, the original junctions between the support
      feet and the terrace. In one case (rear leg support 4) a ligament of
      metal 8nm wide was all that remained of the original angle section (50 x
      50nsn). On two of the four feet this region had been reinforced by the
      addition of a length of metal angle which had been bolted on top of the
      original angle front which the support had been made. The height of the
      concrete terrace had been raised at some stage and this had concealed the
      previous aorrosion damage. The appearance of the concrete cores,
      extracted from near the support feet, was consistent with this
      observation.

3.8   Calculations to establish the force required to cause the collapse of
      barrier 124A, and the collapse sequence are currently underway.
9 One of the refining barriers in the Centred. Pen will be tested to
  destruction in the near future in order to validate the calculations.


    INVESTIGATION OF TURNSTILES AT TOE TJPPTNGS IANE END

1 On 25 April 1989 HSE staff made tests on turnstiles at the Leppings Lane
  end of the stadium to investigate how the application of a farce to a
  'gate' affected the release of a turnstile. On 28 April 1989 tests were
  made to assess the accuracy of the computerised, system for counting and
  recording the admissions through the turnstiles. Calculations were made
  to ccnpare the average admission requirements of turnstiles serving the
  designated zones of the stadium. Counts of people passing through the
  turnstiles A to G were made from video recordings.

     THE EFFECT QF A HORIZONTAL FORCE HJSHING ON THE 'GATE' OF A TURNSTILE

2 Turnstiles C to G appeared to be of the same pattern, whilst turnstiles A
  and B were of a different pattern. In the tests a known force measured by
  a load cell was applied to the 'gate' of the turnstile. Standard test
  weights were then placed gently on the pedal until the spindle was
  released. The tests showed that turnstiles C to G were likely to be more
  difficult to release than turnstiles A and B.

3     A turnstile operator having a weight of 750 N (12 stone) or less might
     have difficulty in releasing turnstiles in the group C to G if a force of
     480 N (110 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'. The same operator
     might have difficulty in releasing turnstiles A and B if a force of 1340 N
     (300 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'.

     THE ACCURACY OF THE CCMRJTERISED SYSTEM FOR COUNTING AND RECORDING
     ADMISSIONS

4    Turnstiles were checked by rotating the 'gate' a known number of times and
     then recording the count measured in the control room. Tests of
     turnstiles in the group 9 to 16 indicated that they recorded the correct
     number of admissions.

5     Tests indicated that turnstiles A, B, C, D, E and F were likely to record
     the correct number of admissions^ In my opinion turnstiles A to F, as a
     group, wculd indicate the correct number of admissions to within 1%.

6 Tests indicated that there could be a persistent error in the recorded
  number of admissions through turnstile G. It is my opinion that this
  turnstile might continuously register less than the correct number of
  admissions during a period of operation. It was concluded that the error
  was probably attributable to the roller of the roller-plunger micro-switch
  fitted to this turnstile only just making contact with the upper boss of
  each 'gate'.

7 Additional detectors were installed across each turnstile passageway at
  positions above the gates. Examination of these devices indicated that
  seme appeared to be disconnected and in sane cases the wiring had been
  cut.

     AVERAGE AEMISSIONS REQUIRED FRCM THE TURNSTILES

8    By reference to Eastwood & Partners Drawing No 8945/1A dated 16/4/87
     figures were obtained for their estimates of the capacity of the various
           zones of the stadium. On 28 April 1989 HSE staff surveyed the outside
           perimeter of the stadium to identify the numbers of turnstiles used by
           each zone. Six groups of turnstiles served the six zones of the stadium.
           These are summarised in the following Table.

     4.10 The average admission requirement of the turnstiles serving the West
          Terrace was the highest for any zone of the stadium. It was almost 3.5
          times the lcwest average admission requirement which is that for the South
          Stand Uncovered Seating and approximately 2.9 times the average admission
          requirement for Spion Kqp.

           OCUNTTNG OF PEOPLE AEMCTTED THR0CX3I TURNSTILES A TO G FRCM VIDEO
           RECORDINGS

     4.11 The video recordings used for the counting were delivered by West Midlands
          Police and were identified RJH2/E/Part 1, RJH2/E/Part 2, RJH2/E/Part 3,
          RJH2/F/Part 1, RJH2/F/Part 2, RJH2/F/Part 3. They showed the exits of
          turnstile booths A to G frcm approximately 12.55pm until 3.10pm on
          15 April 1989. The continuous reference timings on the video recordings
          were with respect to the start of each recording, and not to British
          Summer Time (BST), hut the relationship between the recording times and
          BST was determined frcm the observation of specific events in conjunction
          with West Midlands Police.

     4.12 The method of counting used a micrx>-<xxnputer and specially developed
          program. A push-button was depressed every time a person was seen to
          emerge frcm an identified turnstile booth and the computer recorded the
          signal and its time. People emerging frcm turnstiles A and B were counted
          together because it was not always possible to differentiate between
          people emerging frcm these individual turnstiles.

     4.13 The analysed data provided the relationship between the total number of
          people seai to emerge frcm turnstiles A to G and the time that they
          emerged. Figure 3 shows the total number of people that had emerged from
          turnstiles A to G over the relevant period of time.

                                               4
4.14 I was informed by West Midlands Police that the turnstiles were opened
     before the start of the video recordings. At approximately 2.00pm just
     over 2,000 people had been counted and at 2.52pm this number had risen to
     approximately 6,000. The final total count was 7247 people.

     The HSE count totals are surtraarised in the following table and compared
     with the SWPC computer print-out, taken bn 15 April 1989, a copy of which
     was provided by West Midlands Police.



       Turnstiles    HSE      SWPC     Difference
                    Count   Computer


       A+B          1930      2004          -3.7%

       C            1168      1206          -3.3%

       D4-E         2130      2196          -3.0%

       F+G          2019      1632*

       TOTAL        7247      7038*


     * See paragraph 4.15

     Turnstiles A and B, D and E and F and G had cannon exits, and hence the
     HSE and SWPC counts of these pairs of turnstiles have been combined.

4.15 Paragraph 4.6 of this report referred to a persistent error in the count
     obtained from turnstile G. This could result in no signal being sent to
     the computer even though a person had passed through the turnstile and
     could account for the discrepancy between the HSE count of 2019 for F plus
     G and the SWPC count of 1632.

4.16 Based on the assumption that the SWEC computer printout accurately
     recorded A to E and that the HSE count for F and G was less than the
     number who actually passed through F and G by a similar percentage to that
     obtained frcm A to E, the estimate for the total number of people that
     entered through turnstiles A to G is 7494. In my opinion the actual
     number is unlikely -to have exceeded this value by more than 2%, i.e. 7644.

4.17 The rate at which people were counted through all the turnstiles is shown
     in Figure 4. The rate is for a 3 minute time period and shows the number
     of people per hour per turnstile. The rate increases rapidly at about
     1.40pm and remains fairly constant between 2.05pm and 2.50pm. The mean
     rate for this period was about 660 people per turnstile per hour. Between
     2.55pm and 3.00pm the rate increased and reached a maximum of about 1150
     people per turnstile per hour. This increased rate coincides with the
     time Gate C was opened and could therefore be a result of decreased crowd
     pressure allowing a faster flew through the turnstiles.

4.18 If the rate of 660 had been maintained frcm 2.50pm onwards and no gates
     had been opened I estimate that it would have taken until about 3.40pm to
     bring the total number of people admitted through turnstiles A to G to
     10,100. (The quoted capacity of the West Terrace standing area.)

        5   ESTIMATE OF FBQPTJ3 AEMTITED THRCQgi 'GATE C' TAKEN FRCM VIDBO RECORDINGS

        5.1 A video recording labelled RJH2, delivered by West Midlands Police, was
            used for this analysis. It was copied by HSE photographers and a timing
            reference added. This copy was given the identification DF1/B. It showed
            the exits of turnstile booths A to G, Gate C and the general area on the
            West Stand side of these turnstiles. The continuous reference timings on
            the video recording related to the start of the tape and not to BST.

        5.2   I was told by West Midlands Police that, following scrutiny of
              synchronised video recordings, the 'First Opening' of Gate C had occurred
              at approximately 14.48pm for a duration of ~30 seconds. I was also told
              that the 'Second Opening' of Gate C h a d started at ~ 14.52pm and finished
              at ~14.58pm, a duration o f - 5^ minutes. A 'Third Opening' then .occurred
              approximately one minute later when the gate was opened for approximately
              8 minutes, sufficient to allcw the entry of people in single file.

        5.3   The method of assessment for the first two openings was to count the
              number of people passing a reference line for a period of 3 seconds and
              then to repeat this process at intervals of no greater than 15 seconds.
              At times when the rate was seen to vary rapidly, and for the whole of the
              'First Opening', sanples were taken more frequently than at 15 seconds.
              Figure 5 shews a Cfraph of the number of people who entered through Gate C
              during the 'Second Opening'.
                                                        •

        5.4   Estimates of accuracy are based on the possibility of missing one in ten
              of the people passing the reference line and the unlikelihood of missing
              more than two in ten.

        5.5   Hie estimate of the number of people passing thrcugh Gate C during the
              'Second Opening' based on the counting was 1800 tut this should be
              regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be 10% higher than 1800
              i.e. about 2000, and in xny opinion the actual number was unlikely to be
              greater than 2200.

        5.6   The estimate of the number of people passing thrcugh Gate C during the
              'First Opening' based on the counting was 130 but this should again be
              regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be abcut 150, and in my
    #         opinion the actual number was unlikely to be greater than 180.

        5.7   In the 'Third Opening' entries were much slower and a more accurate count
              was possible. A total of 90 were counted over a period of abcut 8
              minutes, and in my'opinion the actual number is unlikely to be greater
              than 100.

        5.8   The following table is a summary of the estimates of both Gate C and
              turnstile A to G entries.

6     ESTIMATES OF THE CAPACITY OF THE WEST TERRACE

6.1    Drawing 1340/02A by Ralph Brade & Associates gives dimensions of Pens 3
       and 4. Both Pens are shewn as being 13.1m deep; Pen 3 is shown as being
       14.350m wide and Pen 4 as being 14.645m wide. Based chi these dimensions
       the areas are 188. Osq m and 191.8sq m.

6.2    The 1986 "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" states

        "222    The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:

                a.   54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or
                     viewing slcpe is in good condition (as set out in
                     Chapter 8); and

                b.   27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially
                     deviates frcra the reconmended guidlines, so as to
                     constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
                     packed.

       223   It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures where
       conditions fall between the two extremes. When ..."

6.3    If 54 people per 10 sq m is assumed as the allowable packing density
       for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and the
       capacity of Pen 4 is 1036 making a total of 2051 for the canbined
       area.

6.5    The above calculations of capacity must therefore be ag.«=annp<i to be
       the maximum allowable capacity for this terrace area. The guide aicn
       gives examples of how this maximum capacity figure should be reduced
       when certain factors do not conform to the guide. Examples include

       a)       When the strength of crush barriers conform with the
                guidelines but the spacing of such barriers does not ...

       b)      Mien perimeter wall and crush barriers do not ccnply with
                strength or spacing requirements ...
        c)   When the positioning and width of gangways do not meet with the
             recommendations of Chapter 8. ...

6.6    It also states that when crush barriers do not meet the guidelines on
       strength      but are well constructed, consideration may be given to
       allowing a lower packing density figure for the purpose of calculation.


7     ESTIMATES OF THE PACKING DENSITTFS OF THE WEST TERRACE

7.1 West Midlands Police provided me with several albums of photographs, taken
    at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, and several of these photographs were
    identified as providing material for the estimation of the numbers in
    Pen 3. Enlargements of photographs FR1/7A and FR1/8A were provided by
    West Midlands Police and these two photographs were analysed in detail.
    The time identification marking on both these photographs was 15.03.

7.2    The method of assessment entailed mounting the photographs on an
       electronic digitising table (Digitiser) and then marking the head of each
       person who was discernible. The Digitiser was linked to Computer Aided
       Drafting software and the act of marking each person cn the photograph
       enabled the physical points cn the photograph to be placed cn an
       electronic grid which could then be displayed, under computer control, on
       a VEU screen or printed cut cn a graphics plotter. Actual counting of the
       number of those identified within a specified area was carried out
       automatically and no allowance was made for people that were hidden from
       view.

7.3    On 22 May 1989 photographs were taken of the empty pons by the same
       photographer, using the same camera and camera position. This enabled the
       boundaries and barrier locations in Pen 3 to be transposed onto the
       computer image of photographs taken on 15 April 1989. ER1/7A arri ER1/8A
       covered abcut 75% of Pen 3 and it was assumed that the density of people
       in the remaining 25% was similar to that in the photographed area of
       Pen 3.

7.4    The estimated headcount for the whole of Pen 3 was 1408 people but areas
       at the front of the pen were masked by people outside the pen and heads in
       the area forward of the first barriers were generally less discernible
       than those behind the first barrier; 1408 is therefore a minimum estimate.

7.5 The results from a more detailed analysis, in which Pen 3 was sub-divided
    into four rows, bounded by the perimeter fence and the rows of crush
    barriers, are summarised in the Table overleaf. Figures 6, 7 and 8
    illustrate the four rows and the numbers counted in rows 2, 3 and 4.

* The number of spectators in the First Rcw was estimated from the plan area and
an assumed packing density of 10.0 spectators per square meter. This density has
been shewn to be the maximum achievable without undue discomfort in tests at HSE's
Sheffield laboratories and has been corroborated by crcwd density measurements in
a selected area of the first row on photograph HU/10A.

7.6   The estimated total for Pen 3 of 1576 is about 55% greater than the value
      calculated frcm a packing density of 5.4 people per square metre.

7.7   An estimate of the packing density in Pen 2 was also made frcm photograph
      FR1/7A. The area selected shewed an overall packing density of 5.0 people
      per square metre.

8.1   I was asked to make estimates of the number of people which could have
      gathered outside the turnstiles at Leppings Lane but within the outer
      perimeter gates. The area between the Leppings Lane End turnstiles and
      the cuter perimeter gates is illustrated in Figure 9. The Figure is based
      cn Ralph Brade & Associates' Drawing No 1340/04. The area has been
      sub-divided into three separate areas (Area 1, Area 2 and Area 3) and the
      approximate area of each has been calculated by scaling frcm the Drawing.

8.2   The number of people that could stand in the areas has been rg>ir»iat-gH

9      SUMMARY

9.1 Various aspects of the crush barriers and perimeter gates in Pens 3 and 4
    did not conform to the 'Guide to Safely at Sports Grounds 1986'.

9.2     Die broken barrier, 124A, was made from wrought iron tube and mild steel
        angle section. Both tube and angle sections were heavily corroded in seine
        areas. Calculations on the mechanism and force required to cause the
        collapse of the barrier are proceeding.

9.3     Examination of turnstiles A~G indicated that there was a fault in the
        counting mechanism of G. Frcm assessment of video recordings, a best
        estimate of pecple entering through A~G was 7494, with a maximum of 7644.

9.4     If Gate C had not been opened, HSE estimate that it would have taken until
        abcut 3.40pm to admit 10,100 pecple through turnstiles A to G.

9.5 Assessment of the numbers of turnstiles allocated to various zones of the
    stadium revealed that the average admission requirement of the turnstiles
    serving the West Terrace was the highest for any zone of the stadium, and
    was approximately 2.9 times the requirement for Spion Kop.

9 i6    HSE's best estimate of the totat number of pecple who entered the ground
        during the three openings of Gate C was 2240 with a maximum of 2480.

9 .7    HSE's best estimate of the total number of pecple who entered the ground
        through gate C (3 openings) and turnstiles A-G was 9734, with a maximum
        value of 10124.

9.8     Even if the strength and spacing of the barriers had complied with the
        'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986', HSE's calculations showed that
        the capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was 1015 and 1036 respectively.

9.9     Since the barriers did not caiply in all respects with the Guide (see 9.1)
        the estimated capacity of Pens 3 and 4 would be less than in 9.7 above.

9.10 Ihe best estimate, based on photographs, of the number of pecple in Pen 3
     at 15.03 was 1576.

9.11 Ihe nuntoer of pecple who could be accomodated theoretically between the
     perimeter gates and the turnstiles at Leppings Lane was estimated to be
     3880 and 4850 for crowd packing densities 8.0 and 10.0 per square metre
     respectively.

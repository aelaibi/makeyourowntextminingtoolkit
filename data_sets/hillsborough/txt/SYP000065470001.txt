I then        saw      supporters               carrying        advertising              hordingsAowards                  the

board       n e ar     to w h e r e           I was    sat    and     began        to     lift     it away.

I took        hold        of    the       other       en d a n d     we    ran a c r o s s       the     pitch       towards        the

Liverpool            end.           As    we    reached       the      penalty          area     I saw a m on g s t          the

people        there,           two       people       lying     on    the       pitch,       their       faces       covered       with

clothing.              I realised               that    they       must     be     dead      and    the       shock     of    seeing

them     made        me    drop          the    advertisement              board.          I turned           and walked           back

to    tf■ie e.i nde rt rack               and    sat    ciown f o r 1 0 1 5             mi n u t e s .    At     thi s t irne I. had

no    feelings            I wa s         just    so    shocked        and       numb,,

As    I sat       on      the       track       I saw a m b u l a n c e s        and     fireman         arriving.            I l a ter

                                         my    brother       and     we    found



We    all     stayed           on    the       track    area       for     an    hour      or    so,     to     enable       the

emergency            services             to    work    and     not       get    in the         way.

At    4',, 1Cj pm      ( 1 i>16 hrs)            we    left    the      grourux.           i remember            looking       at    one

clock       by    the      police             control     room       on    our     left      handside»

All     the      friends            I had       gone    with       and     also     rny b r o t h e r     were       accounted           for

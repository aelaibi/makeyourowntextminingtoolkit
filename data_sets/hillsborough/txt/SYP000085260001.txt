                        I am                                        and    I live at     the above address           w ith my

                        family.         In my spare          time    I work as a turnstile             operator at           the

                        S h e f f i e l d W e dn es da y    ground at Hillsb o r o u g h .          I have work at           the ground

                        for 3 complete            seasons.

                        I w o r ke d    the L i v erpool       FC    versus N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC semi           final        match

                        at H il l s b o r o u g h on the        15th April      1989     (150489),       I was    pasted as a

                        tu rnstil e      to turnstile                       This     t u r nstile    is s i t u a t e d at    the S pion

                    X'op end of the ground w h i c h was a l l o c a t e d                   to N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t fans

                        only.        It was an all           ticket       game so my duties were            only to 'separate

                        the     two sections         of the      ticket      retain one      part and give          the other           bacl-

                        to the spectator.

                        I a r ri ve d at the gr o u n d at about a quarter                    to twelve and went               to     sign

                        in at     the stewards             room under      the S o u t h Stand.         In this     room,      I was
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           S 2952

given a slip of paper               stating       that    I had been a l l o c a t e d to t u rnstile

no          a canvas       bag for       the tickets and the             keys    to the        turnstile.

This     is normal        for any m a t c h      I went    immedi a t e l y     to the t u r nstile and

set myse lf        ready for       the a r r i v i n g   fans.     It was       strange        because       it wa

a good half an hour             before      the first       fan a r r i v e d at my t u r nstile and

on w hole        it was    very quiet.           The S p i o n Kop holds about 2 2 ?000                   I think



                                                                                        I only took abou.1

240 thro ugh my turnstile.                  I did see at          least    one       pj31 i c e me n o u t s i d e

my turnstile and            1 saw hirn making            fans    put    beer    or    pop cans        in the         b:l.

or ma k i n g     them drink       it up there and then.                 The    only fans          that     passed

t hr o u g h my turnstile          were N o t t i n g h a m Forest       fans and          they were        in goo

humour      laughing and joking             with me,       generally       enjoying           themselves.

None     of these fans were              drunk.

S o m e ti me    between half       past    one or two          1 saw at       least       three     pol i c e m e n

carrying a fan,            they seem ed       to have a leg and an arm a piece.                            He was

a big     lad and he was           really     s truggling        he was    kicking          out and       really

tw i sting       his   body to get        free    of them.        He was       shouting        but    I d o n ’t

think     swearing        saying    things       like,    "Let me down,          put me down."

He was      being      carried along P en is t o n e Road going                 up to the H a l i f a x Roa

a nd   I presumed t h e y ’d be going              to the       police    room.         The    police

officers         seemed to be trying             to move    him as       fast as        they     could and

were     having d i f f i cu lt y     in holding         him.

I w ould        describe    the fan as white male,                I w o u l d think about             five     feet

ten    in height and stocky               in build.        He was w e a r i n g       jeans,       a multi

coloured V neck jumper and a black                        blousson       type    leather        jacket.          All

I can remember about               his    face was       he had a black          designer          stubble       on

his face         (not a full       beard)     and short         black    hair.        He    had a round

face.      He was       not w ea r i n g a football         and    I c a n ’t recall           his accent.

A fter    this     incident a g a i n all         1 had was a steady flow of spectators.
                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                              S29S2

It rriads it boring           in fact.           I even take more             tickets        on a m a t c h day

than on that Saturday.

At about         a ten to three            or five      to three       I could see between                 150 and

200 fans         stood over       the      road by Charlie Browns                  garage,        some   of them

were     eating and some            of     them were drinking               but    they w e r e n ’t rowdy.

You    c a n ’t see an awful             lot out of the t u rnstile                  your    view     is s l i ghtly

r es t r i c t e d and at this           time    I w a s n ’t sure         if the     p o liceman there           or

not.       At about       this   time,         nearly    kick       off,    I was     in my turnstile             whic

1 think         is one of the older              types.        The    new ones        have        a metal     panel

w hi ch makes       jumping      over         p ractically         impossible.         The    older      ones     nave

two    pieces of wood as you enter                      the tur n s t i l e       on either        side at about

waist      height.        I have     seen       people       use    these an d use          them     like a      lever

to jump over            the turnstile.               Like a springboard.

S u d d e n l y a youth a pp e a r e d         from where          I d o n ’t know and jumped over                 the

turnstile.          I m a na ge d    to get          back door       of the       turnstile        open but

w a s n ’t able     to grab the youth.                  H e ’d gone        but while my back was                 turns

a no t h e r    two jumped over a nd             ran off       into    the S p i o n Kop.            I presume al

      hree were N ot ti n g h a m Forest               fans.        I told one        of the stewards             and

he    came and stood          in b et w e e n our        turnstiles.              I d i d n ’t know a n y t h i n g

about     what was       hap p e n i n g      in the West S t a n d and because                   of the    crowd

over     the     road we shut        the       turnstiles          early at about           three     oclock.          We

were     concerned that          they might all               come and       jump over the t u r n s t i l e            s

all    turnstiles         in our block                                      were     closed just after

three,         we made   that    d e ci s i on       on ourselves          unsure     that    the Police          were

outside.

At a bout a ten past             three         the steward          came and made           the    readings       on

the turn s t i l e s and thats                the first       I was    aware       of what        had h a p p e n e d a

the West Stnad.             I then went and handed                    the    tickets        in received          the

m o n e y a n d went     s t ra i g h t hio m a .

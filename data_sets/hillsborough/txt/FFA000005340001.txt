FA/HILLSBORQUGH
Speaking to John Dyson QC. We went over the various
submissions and the only one that worried us was Heiq#rtA»er's
extra ordinary submission against the FA that they haid failed
to check i>safety certificate, to inspect the ground, or look
at the turnstile configuration with regard to the number of
supporters coming in. None of these matters were put to the
FA who would have dealt with it by way of        sayingthatthey
were not safety experts. Vast amounts of         money wouldhave
had to be spent acquiring the expertise and a new department
would have had to have been set up. It was pretty unfair to
make that sort of allegation at this stage. However Dyson
was torn between saying too much or too little. The more we
said the more of an issue it became.
He found the FSA submission pretty confusing. I said that
they had said that we placed too much weight on Evans
outweighing everything else. However they had said that the
other matters were not contributing.

sought      my approval                for     two       ambulances           to    be    deployed             specifically              for

the     FA Cup Semi           Final          between Liverpool                         and N o t ti ng ha m Forest.                        T his

was     in a d d i t i o n    to       the       two       liaison           officers          who          would       be at       the    game

anyway*        I discussed              this          request             w i t h Mr P a g e        and          subsequently             told

Mr     JONES     of    the    approval.                    One       ambulance           was       to       be    stat i o n e d      ins i d e

the     ground and           the       other          at    Mi d d l e w o o d A m b u l a n c e             Station which                is

approximately            one       mile          to    the       north west              of    the          ground.           We    had

arranged         for    the       same       ambulance                cover       for     the       ground             for    the     identical

match      the    previous             year       and       there          had    been        no    problems.




8-      When     on    call       I carry a                bleep and             in a d d i t i o n          there        is a t e l e p h o n e

and     radio     in m y      car,.          All       messages              to me       come       from          ambulance           cont rol

at     Moorgate        Road-,      Rotherham.




9.      When     on    call       it    is o n l y          necessary             for me           to       be    contactable             and     to

be     reasonably        near          to a m b u l a n c e           control.




10*      Although         I was         only          on    call          I took my           vehicle             up    to    the Ml

motorway         to J u n c t i o n         33    be c a use          if     there       was       to       be a n      inciden-t at            that

time     <lunchtime)              it w a s        likely             to    be    on    the     motorway.                 Nothing

happened         there       and       so    I went             to    control.




•11.     I arrived           at    control,            at       14'10       (1410).           1 had          a    cup    of       tea a n d     took

a    couple      of    ca lls      relating                to    routine          admissions                 to    hospital.              At    143Q

(1430)        a call     came          in f r o m          the       liason       officers              (               an d H I G G I N S )      to

say     that     they    h a d a r r i v e d at                 the       ground.




1£.      At    approximately                 1506          (1506)          I s a w the         police             line       light       up.

There      is a d i r e c t        line          to    control             from       the P o l i c e            headquarters             at    Snig

Hill     in S h e f f i e l d .         Superintendent                       CLARK       took       the          call.        I heard          him

say     "What     is    it.        We've          got       liaison             officers           there"          but       he    did    not

that      the     police          had     said     t ha t     they wanted             a fleet          of    ambulances              at    the

Leppings          Lane       end     of    the H i l l s b o r o u g h         ground.           I commented             that

ambulances             could       not     get     into       that      end     of    the       ground       and    I questioned

why     they wo ul d want                 them-        The    Police           line    then       lit       up a g a i n a n d        this

not     seem      to    get       a satisfactory               reply.           I contacted             the       ambulance           which

was     on     standby        at     MjLddlewood a n d              instructed             it    to    go    to    the L e p p i n g s

Lane      en d    of    the       Hillsborough              ground       to     report          what    was       going       on.         I.

knew      that        the    liaison           officers        inside          the    ground          would       have

difficulty             getting          out     to L e p p i n g s      Lane     and       so w o u l d      not    be    able        to

report         on w h a t     was       happening           th er e -        I then        told       Superintendent                 CLARK

to    contact          the     liaison          officers          to    see     if    they       had a n y thing           to       report

and     I then         immediately              left-




13.       As     I left        the      control        building          Mr                     was    arriving          in a m a r k e d

remember          commenting              to Mr _________[that                 if a n y     ambulances             did    try        to    get

a re    not       sufficiently                high       to       permit       access*            I knew             there

had     been an          incident             some       ten years             earlier           where          an a m b u l a n c e        had

top     of    the       ambulance             had       been       damaged.              I t o l d M r __________ :,o radio                       to

only access              into          the    ground             which       ambulances           could          use*        Attached             to

this     statement                is a       plan,           I parked          the       Range        Rover          in the        position

coloured           yellow*              In    the       position             coloured           green       was       the    ambulance

which        had       been       stationed             at       the    ground        but       the    ambulance             men were             not

with     it.           I do       not      recall        seeing          either          of     the    ambulance             men       or

liaison           officers            at     that       time       although           I have          subsequently                b ee n     told

that     one       of    the          liaison          officers          spoke        to me       then.              I t o l d Mr

the     edge       of    th e         penalty area                in f r o n t      of     the    goal          at    th e   Leppings

Lane     end.           The       Police           were standing                 two       or    three          deep.        They were

letting           people          through and                 there      was      a      lot     of   people           on    the p i t c h o n

my     side       of    the       police            line w i t h         injured           people          on    hoarding.              As    I came

help;       they       were      all       spectators          who       were    helping             injured          peo ple,             I

ignored        them.          1 knew         that       the    injured          were       corning f r o m            the       Leppings

Lane     end      of    the      ground and             that       there       were     ten      or       twelve       ambulances                at

that     end      of    the      ground       and       I thought          t hat      they       could          not    get       access          to

the    injured,              The most         important             thing       for    me       to    do was          not       to

provide        immediate              help    to    the       injured          immediatley around                      but       to

supervise           the w h o 1 e o f , t h e           ambulance          operation,                 1 went          through             the

police       line       and      the       scene     looked         like       a battlefield.                    There          were

people       l y ing     on      the       pitch    and       I saw       others        behind            the    fence          M/ith t h eir

faces       pressed          against         it.        I only       stayed          there       for       a few       seconds             and

ran    back       across         the       pitch    towards          the a r e a w h e r e            I had          left Mr

and    the     Range         Rover.          I believed             that       the    ambulances                at, the         Leppings

Lane     end      could       not      get    to    the       incident          from where                they       were       and       I had

to    get    them       round         to    the    Penistone             Road    end       of    the       ground.              When       I ran

through        the      line       I saw a         police          officer       carrying             a    little          girl       in his

arms.        He     stumbled,              I took       the    child       from       him       and       continued             running

towards        the a r e a         where      the R a n g e         Rover       was     parked,              I got         to    the       ramp

between        the      north         stand       and    the       Kop    and    looked          at       the    girl       wh o      was

quite       obviously            dead.        The       policeman          then       caught          up w i t h me a n d                 1 told

him    to    t ak e     the      g i r l ’s b o d y      to    the       gymnasium          which          I knew,          from          our

attend       the       Penistone            Road    end       of    the    ground.              I also          asked       him       to       tell

17.     I then          went       to    the       gymnasium.             Outside       the     g y m na s i u m were         a group

of St,       John's       ambulance                people*         They        were    aged     about         14 a n d w e r e

clearly       extremely             ups e t .         I went       into        the    gymnasium          where      the    scene

seemed       to    be    one       of    chao s*          There       were      police       officers          in t h e r e     and

already       s ome      bodies          laid       on a d v e r t i s i n g     boards.           I had       gone    in t h e r e

to    see    if a n y     of       our       staff     were      the r e ?      there    w e r e n ’t*         There      was

nothing       I could          do       in t h e r e      and    so      I went       back    to     the      area where         the

Range       Rover       was    parked          to     find      t ha t    our a m b u l a n c e s       were    starting         to

IS.     The       yard was           full      of P o l i c e       vans       which    had also           been     there       when     I

arrived       and       these       hampered           vehicles           entering        the      yar d .       In fact , the

entrance          marked       on       the    p l a n as       "main       police      access"          could      not    be    used

because       it was          blocked*              There       were      also       police     horses         in the yard*




19.     The       first       ambulance             which       I saw arrive            was     driven         by Mr

onto    the       pitch       because          I thought           this        would    help       to    cairn d o w n     the

crowd       who    would       see       that       the a m b u l a n c e       services        were       present        and    also,

ambulance          and    took       the       bodies          to    the     gym.           The    ambulance                went       off    to

arnbulance         became       wedged              agai nst         the     stanchions                ho 1 di ng       up       t,he f enc i ng

on    its    rig h t *        Our    vehicle          was        backed         off       the     r amp      and       then       pulled

forward       to    let       the St.          Johns         ambulance            out.          The     St.       J o h n ’s a m b u l a n c e

forced       its    way       off    the       stanchion             and     up      the     ramp*           It     left         the    ground*




23.     I only          saw    three       of       our      ambulances              go     onto       the       pitch.           All       the

further       ambulances             were       reversed             into       the       yard     so       that       they       could       be

quickly       loaded          with       casualties              before         going        off       to    hospital.

24.       The       last       occasion             which       I had     b e e n at      the       g r o u n d was         a year

before         when       the     s ame        match       had    taken        place.          I had a t t e n d e d              then       simply

to     speak        to    the     liaison            officer.            Since       then a wheelchair                       access          ramp

had      been       put       on the       ramp which             went        from    the      yard      on to          the       pitch.

The      w h e e 1 chai r r a m p w a s              evidently           to    get    wheelchairs                 into       the    north

stand.             The    presence             of    this       wheelchair           access         r amp     had       considerably

restricted               the    width          of    the    ramp        doM/n to      the      pitch         which          had    caused

difficulties                  both    for       our     ambulances             and    the      S t . John's             ambulance*



23.       I was t h e n a p p r o a c h e d by A l a n H O R N S B Y                       (the A s s i s t a n t           Chief        Fire

Officer).                He    told       me    that       he    had     forty       men and           that       he    had       deployed

them      to       help       bring       casualties             onto     the       pitch.          He a s k e d        what       e lse      they

could         do    and       I believe             I told       hi m    to    continue          what        he w a s        doing.           By

t hi s    time       ambulances                were    arriving           all       the    time.          I only            saw    those

ambulances               wh ic h were           actually          coming        into       the      yard      and       I did       not       know

how      many       there       were       outside          the    ground.




26.      I do       not       rec a l l    when       the       ambulances           came        off    the       pitch.




27.       I was          then a p pr o ac he d             by L e a d i n g     Ambulance              man                           Lt the

top      of    the       ramp     from         the    pitch       to     the    yard.          He      is a t r a i n e d

paramedic            and       was    the       f i rst     one    that        I had       seen.          I sent            him    to    the

gymnasium where                   I knew            there       were     already          a number           of    injured          as well

as    dead.          I told          him       to    c h eck     all     the    in j u r e d ,      do w h a t         he    could       do       for

them       immediately and                     decide       upon        the    priorities              for    getting             them       to

ho s p i.ta 1 .




£8 .      I then          went       to    the       Range       Rover        and    spoke       to C o n t r o l           to    find       out

where         the m a j o r       incident            vehicle           was.        1 was      told      it w o u l d

be     there        in t h r e e      minutes.              They        also    told      me     t hat       Mr   P AGE was             on    his

    way      to    control..           The       major       incident          vehicle           arrived          shortly
%

    afterwards.                      I understand                that    it h a d      been       directed             by    police          off

    Penistone            Road        onto     the     service           road     round         towards        the L e p p i n g s            Lane

    end      of    the     ground.            I was         also       told    that       the     police          had       been       in the

    road      to    prevent           a disturbance                between          r i va l     fans       who    were,          by then,

    leaving         the     ground.




    29.       I instructed               the       driver         of    the    major        incident          vehicle             (Station

    Officer                              to      position          the     vehicle          in the          position marked                      in

    blue      on    the     plan a t t a c h e d            to    this     statement.                 I took       s o me        body       b ags

    from      the m a j o r          incident          vehicle          a n d wa s     on m y         way    to    the       gymnasium

    when      I met        Mr    Jones        who      had       apparently           come       round       from       the       Leppings

    Lane      end    of     th e      ground.           I was          very    pleased           to    see    him.           I told          him       to

    take      control           of    that       area       and    to    be    responsible              for       getting             the

    ambulances             in a n d      out.




    30.       I am       not     s ure      whether          I t ook       the      body       bags     to    the       gymnasium                or

    whether         I gave           them     to      someone          else    but     at      about        that       time       I was

    approached             by a D o c t o r .           He       had    been     in the          crowd       and       said       he       had

    three         other     doctors           with      him.           I do    not     know who             he was          but       he was          45/

    50 years         ol d       and was          wearing          a short        coat.           He    said       t hat      they          did    not

    h av e    any    gear.,           I saw a L e a d i n g             Ambulance           man       nearby       (I       do    not

    remember         who)        and     told         him    to    take       the    four        doctors          to    the       gymnasium

    and      introduce           them       to     leading         ambulance           man                             who       h a d his

    paramedic            equipment            with      him.           I told       him     to    tell                                to    t ake

    the      doctors        names.            Mr                   ,hen a p p r o c h e d         me w i t h       four          or    five

    ambulance            station         officers            (not       from SYMAS)              who    had       been       in the

    crowd.          I asked           them       to    help and          bring       casualties              from       the       pitch.              Mr

                   g ave    t h e m all          yellow          ambulance          jackets           and    s ent      them          onto       the

    pitch.          I do        not    r ec a l l      seeing          them again.

31.      I t h e n went,            b ack      to       the     gymnasium and                   saw Chief            Superintendent

ADDIS.        I needed          to       speak          to    him       to    ensure          proper       liaison            between       the

ambulance           and       police          services.                 He    t o l d rne t hat           he    had      just      spoken        to

the    coroner           (I    think          by    telephone                or    rad i o ) .       He    t o l d me         that    the

coroner        had       said       t hat      the       bodies          should          be     taken      to       various         locations.

In fact,           the    coroner             subsequently                   changed          his    mind       about         this.        Whilst

in the        gymnasium             talking             to C h i e f         Superintendent                ADDIS         I noticed          that

there       was     a medical              team         present          and       I was        told      that       they were

from     the       Northern             General          Hospital.                 1 am       not    sure       how

many     p«?ople w e r e            in the          team        but, I rec a l l              that     a coloured              Doctor       was

in    charge        and       I also          remember             seeing          two     or    three         nurses         holding

saline        drips.           At       this       time       we    had       just       started          moving         the       injured       out

of    the     gym.




32.      By    this       t ime         the    police           vehicles            which        had      been       hampering

entrance           and    exit          from       the       ground          had    been moved.                 Mr J O N E S a n d Mr

         had       ensured          a     c l ear       passage          for       ambulances.                 Mr    JONES         came    into

the    gymnasium and                    told       me    that       he       had    ten a m b u l a n c e s          on P e n i s t o n e    Road

and    f ive       outside          the       ground          with       a further              twenty         f iv e    in H a r r i e s    Road

bus    garage,           which          was    the       pre a r r a n g e d          overflow            site.          He    t o l d me    that

he w a s      aware       of    eleven             bodies          on    the       circular          road       at      the    Leppings

Lane     end       of    the    ground although                         I was       not       clear       as    to      whether       he m e a n t

inside        or    outside             the    ground.              I sent          Mr     Higgins         with         three      ambulances

to    the L e p p i n g s       Lane          end       of    the       ground        to      collect          the      bodies       w h i c h Mr

JONES       had     told       me       abo u t .        By     this         time     we      had    ambulances               to   spare.

34.        At    about        this    time        Chief       Superintendent                   ADDIS          told       me    that       the

coroner          had     now    decided           that       he w a n t e d     all       of       the       bodies          taken       into

the       gymnasium.            I arranged              for a       number          of    bodies             to    be    brought          back

from       the    Northern General                     Hospital         and     one       from          the       Royal       Hal lams hi r e »

I believe             that     these        were       all    people          who    had       died          in h o s p i t a l      or     en

route,          with     the    possible           exception             of    the       people          who       had       been    taken        to

hospital          by     the St.          J o h n ’s a m b u l a n c e .




35.        Some       time     later        the    coroner          arrived          and       we       discussed with

Chief       Superintendent                  ADDIS       the     question            of w h a t          to    do w i t h       the       bodies.

    The    coroner        decided           that       the    bodies          would       be       photographed                by

Polaroid,             t hat    the    bodies           would       be    taken       to       one       end       of    the    gymnasium

and       the    photographs              put     up at       the       other       end       so    that          relatives          could

look       at    the     photographs              and       then    be a s k e d         to    identify                bodies       if    they

thought          they     recognised              the       photographs.                 The       coroner             did    not w a n t

anybody          to    be m o v e d       prior        to    identification.                       The       g y m n a s i u m was

divided          into     three        by     nets      to m a k e       courts          and       we    put       blankets          over        the

net       towards        the    east        entrance          of    the       gymnasium.                 The       bodies          were     kept

at    the       west     end and          the     photographs             put       up    in the             eastern          section.            Mr

36.        I introduced              Mr     PAGE       to    Chief      Superintendent                       ADDIS.           By    t his    time

a    number       of a m b u l a n c e s         wre    parked          in the       car       park          around

the       gymnasium.            Earlier           vehicles          belonging             to       players             and    various

executives             had     been       parked        there.          There        were          ambulances                from    other

districts             as w e l l     as S h e f f i e l d       and R o therham.                    I arranged                for    the

ambulances             belonging            to    other       districts             to    be       s ent      back.           Mr J O N E S

dealt       with       this.         I also        t o l d Mr       JONES       that          I wanted             just       six S Y M A S

vehicles          in the        b ac k      yard       by    the    gym.

             37.      Bodies       were        removed       to    the M e d i c o       Legal     Centre       at    W a t e r y L n as

             they     were     identified.              The       Medico       Legal      Centre        is a p p r o x i m a t e l y     two

             miles      south       of    the H i l l s b o r o u g h        ground.




             38.      The     number       of    ambulances             was    later      scaled        down    to    two    or       thr e e .




             39.      At     about       2000    hours       (2000)          I went      b ack   to     control       where       a    number

             40,      I then went              b ack   to    the       ground      and    by 0 3 0 0     hours       (0300)       on Sunda y

             morning         the    number       of    poeple          coming      to    identify        bodies       had    gone        down

             to a     trickle.            The    last       of    the    identified          bodies        left      the    g r o u n d at

             0448     hours        (0448)       and    then       all    of    the      unidentified           bodies       were       also

             taken      down       to    the M e d i c o     Legal       Centre.




             41.       I closed          the    incident          at    0530     hours      (0530).

and Parsons           Cross        Estates.



From    the    t ime       of    the     early      arrival        of    supporters,            it w a s       evident        t hat

respective           parking         areas.         At    no    t ime    did     I see       any     alcoholic         drink         in

any    coach       or m i n i - b u s ,     nor     did     I h ear      of a n y     such      incident         over       the

radio.



Most    of    the     suppo rt er s were                making     for      public       hou ses,       shops        and

supermarkets             where      they      congregated             in v e r y     l a rge    numbers,         buying,

drinking       and       taking        away a great             deal     of    alcoholic           dri n k .    As     the

morning       and     early        afternoon            passed,       it was        obvious        t hat m a n y w e r e

or w e r e    becoming           the     worse      for     drink,       although         not      in a n a s t y      sort         of

as    'stupidly             under         the    influence           of       drink*„           There      was       no    hostility,

but      some        were       very      resentful           of    the a l l o c a t i o n        of    tickets.              On     the

mini-vans             w h i c h we        stopped        and       escorted,          we     found       t hat       there       was       at

w h e n we     go t      into       view       of    the    turnstile              area        I could          see    what       I can

only     describe            as     a    seething          mass       of     people           stretching             out    of    sight

forward        towards            the     turnstile          area .             I saw         people       climbing          over       the

much        success,              I went          to     the        bottom      of V e r e         Rd where            police         officers

were        still         letting           Liverpool               fans    through          the        barriers           and       put a        stop

to     it    in no         uncertain              ter ms .



During           this      t i me      the       radio m e s s a g e s         were        constantly                being        passed

between           POL SUP            MARSHALL            and        other     officers             on     the    gate a n d           ground

control.               It w a s        about          this      time       that      the     transmissions                   began          to    break­

up and           become         unintelligible.                       I passed            t ha t     information                to    ground

control,               I returned                to L e p p i n g s        Ln and         saw      that       the      crowd         ha d

diminished                considerably.                      I heard        somebody            on      the     radio        shouting,

"Stop        them - Stop                them,"               Th e    message         was     very         garbled and almost

unreadable.                    I heard           somebody - obviously                        in the           ground -            pass a

message           that         people        were        being        and     had     been         crushed,           and       something

about        "bodies"             or    "body."



I went           i n to    Leppings              Ln     to    give     instructions                  to    dog       handlers           th e re ,           I

have        no    idea what             time          it was.          I then went                 back       to m y       dog       van.         The

radio        had       ceased          to    operate            and    I had         no     information               as     to w h a t          had

happened            or     wa s      happening.                 I then        heard        somebody             on    the       r a d i o a g ai n ,

bu t     I cannot              remember           what        was     said      or w h o        said what.                 There       were

several           hundred            supporters               milling         about        Leppings             Ln.        At     this       time

very        little         seemed           to    be     coming        over       the      radio          and    as     I had         got

Leppings           Ln and            surrounding                roads       w el l    patrolled with                    dog       handlers,             I

decided           to      go    for     my       refreshment               at N i a g a r a        Club House.                  Many        other

officers           were         doing        likewise.                We    were     about           to    enter        Niagara Rd when

I heard           over         the     radio what              was     happening             at      the      gr o u n d ,        I went

straight            into        the     club a n d            got al l        the     dog       handlers             wh o w e r e      in for

their        meals         out       onto        their        original          pa tr ol        areas,           I returned with POL

leaving       the       ground.            I got        out     of    the       van a n d     went       to    speak         to a n

officer,          but w a s        instantly          hemmed         in by L i v e r p o o l        supporters who                    were

shouting          abuse*           I made my way               through          the    supporters             a n d was         then

approached          by a d o c t o r           who    a s k e d me      to      take    him      into     the       gr ou n d,            I

escorted          him    through          "A*    Gate and            via     the      lower N S t a n d          level;          took

him    to    the    gymnasium*                 The    hostility            of    the    Liverpool             supporters              was

indescribable*                 I wa s      threatened,               verbally abused and                      sp a t    upon*          On

entering          the    gymnasium with                 the      doctor         I was       horrified          to      see      very

many    dead       bodies*           I left          th e    g y m n a s i u m a n d as        I did      I s aw        three         young

men    carrying          what       looked       like        a girl.            She    appeared          to    be      dead*          I

went    to a s s i s t        a n d wa s       told,        " D o n ’t t o u c h      her    you murdering                bastard*"

They    carried          her/him           into       the     gymnasium*




I then went             down       the     ramp       onto      the    g ro un d an d saw           that       many       dog

handlers          had    been       deployed          across         the     pitch,         together          with a cordon                   of

foot    officers*              I realised             the      possibility             of a m a j o r         public         order

situation,          so    I went          round       every       dog      handler          to m a k e    s ur e       he k n e w

where       his    partner          was,       in c as e       they     had      to    leave      the     ground

quickly*           I then went             out       onto P e n i s t o n e        Rd N where            I saw POL PC 3 33 6

We w e r e    joined          by    other       police         officers.              P O L PC    GI.BBIN           t oo k me in

On a rr i va l      we    were       confronted              by L i v e r p o o l      supporters             who      w er e

extremely          hostile          and    threatening*                 I s e n t P O L PC G I B B I N              back        to

Penistone          Rd N and          I walked           down Leppings                 Ln*     The     h o s t i l i t y of           the

Liverpool          supprters             was    immense*             Very       many were         very        m u c h the w o r s e

for      drink.          I wa s      shoved and           pushed,          threatened             with        violence           and      spat

u p on.        I had      to      ignore      them,       even       those         who      came r i gh t        up to me            to

s p it    in m y      face*         They      stank       of    b oo s e .         I h e l p e d to        get     two        fire

engines         and      s o me     ambulances           through         the    mob,        there        is     no o t h e r        word

for      them.



I saw        a youth        standing          on    top    of     a Police           car.         I went         towards            him and

w as     immediately              surrounded         by L i v e r p o o l       fans .          I told          hi m     to get        down

as w h a t      he    was doing          w o u l d n ’t m a k e      things         any      better.              Threats            to kill

me     were     made.       I am      certain        that       had      I tried           to a r r e s t       t h at    youth           I

would        have     been        seriously         assaulted.




I went         along      Leppings           Ln and       put     d og     handlers            in g r o u p s      of 4 a n d 6               for

safety         and    told        them    that      they must            not       react       to the         a c t i o n s of      the

f ans     unless         they were           absolutely           forced.            I did        t hi s      with       every

officer         I came         across,        whether          dog    handler          or      not.        I wi l l       sa y      this,

t hat     under       the m o s t     hostile,           abusive         and     threatening                   crowd          I h av e e ve r

seen      in 2 9      a n d a h al f      years      of    service,            the        o f f i c e r s on L e p p i n g s        Ln,

whether         f oo t    officers,           traffic          officers,           mounted          officers             or    dog

handlers,            were      magnificent           in t h e i r        co n d u c t ,     and     by     such        conduct

pr e ve nt e d what            I believe           was    a major          public         order       situation arising.




To     say     that      I was       frightened           is    putting         it m i l d l y .           I was         in g e n u i n e

f e ar    of    being       seriously          assaulted-,            if     not     killed,          s u c h was         the       hatred

being        displayed.




I h av e       it    on m y       conscience         that       I did        not     stay       in the         ground          to    help.

I believe            that      at   t h at    time       there       was     enough         help      in the           ground and

knowing         what      was       likely     to    happen          outside         considered               that       to be my

place,

It    is m y     opinion          th at    t h is     t r a g e d y was          caused       by    the       very many

Liverpool            supporters           who      came      without         tickets,             with    one       i n t e n t i o n - to

get      into    the     ground anyway                t h at       they    co u ld .         If    the    gates          hadn't         b e en

opened,          they would          have        forced        them       irrespective              of    how many            people

they      put     in d a n g e r *        There       was      a    complete           disregard          for       the    safety            of

others         and     themselves          by t h i s        element.             They       achieved          their       objective.




As    I have         said    I have        29 and a            half       years        service          and    the m a j o r i t y           of

these      years        have      been     spent         working          the     H il ls b or ou gh Division.

Liverpool            supporters           have      never          endeared        themselves             to me a n d as                far

I have         been asked          on     several           occasions            why    I did       not       use    Police            dogs

to    c l ea r    the     turnstiles             a r ea .      My     reply       to    that       is    that       if    I had         been

asked      to     do    so    in t h o s e       circumstances,                  I would          have    flatly          refused            to

do    so a n d       I would       not     h av e     cared who            gave        the    order.           To    h av e     used

d og s    in s u c h a       tightly         pressed           crowd w oul d            have       been       the    height            of

stupidity            and would          ha v e     ended       in    complete           mayhem,          if not a          riot.




The      deployment          of    dogs      and      handlers            on s tr a te g ic         points          around         the

ground         and     the   outer        approaches               is a we l l         tried       and    proven          operation.

Every main             route      has     dog      handlers          and     their       marked          vehicles          in
                                                                                                                          PAGE          10


positions          where      they      can      be    clearly       seen.       S Yorkshire               officers       are

paired with             officers        from        other     Police      Forces          and    supervisory

sergeants         are     placed        in s u c h         position      that    their          location         fo r m s a

square      around        the     ground         are a -      Wherever         possible,.         S Yorkshire

officers         are     s t a t i o n e d at       locations        which      they are          well      conversant

w i th „



These      men     outside        the      Sheffield          Divisions         are       put    into m a i n       road a r e a s

on w h i c h     their        primary       role       is    the   escorting          of    supporters            coaches

etc.       Each      is a b l e    to      g i ve     back    up to      the    other       and       is   in    ra dio

contact         with Force         Control            as    well   as    Ground       Control.             I see     no    reason

to a l t e r     any     of    these       locations          or   duties       for       any    future         football

matches         p l a y e d at    Hillsborough.




Every      dog     handler        is a w e l l - g r o u n d e d ,       experienced             police         officer       in

whom a      very        great     d e al    of      faith     is   put,    due       to    the    r o le    they     carry         out.




If    I were       to    briefly        summarise            the   events       of    that       day,      it w o u l d    be      to

say    that      initially         the m o o d         was    good,      but    w it h an        underlying

resentment          which        surfaced and               became      evil    as    the       day    progressed.

About     i,4-3pm     (1345)       we    parked       in a lay-by         in Herrias         Rd opposite         the

We made a tour             of L a p pings       Ln,    M i d d l e w o o d Rd,   P a r k s i d e Rd and

D ivision,        to deploy a further                 dog    van on Herr i e s Rd.            This    I did.        The

problem was            with the N o t t i n g h a m       supporters,         not Liverpool,           This       extra

been ear 1 i e r ),



A bout     1.55pm        (1355)     we had      provided        part    of the      escort        for Liverpool

S h o r t l y after 2 . 3 0 p m        (1430)    we made a tour of Pen i s t o n e                 Rd N,    Herries

were      being       passed to and from the ground                     control       room.        I heard

somebody         request        the start       of the m a t c h be delayed,                 1 heard a reply

to the      effect        that,-    “ I t ’s too      late - one team             is on the          pitch." I

h eard s o m ebody         say words        to the effect             that   people were           being

crushed         in L e p p i n g s Ln and then somebody -                    I believe       it     was POL PS

GODDARD         in ground        control,       say,      "Open    ’A ’ Gate,       Ope n    ’A'    Gate,"

This    was N O T     "Open a gate."              He      repeated this           instruction          several

times,




We    then drove         round the        block and ente r e d L e p pings Ln -from P e n istone

Rd N,        Crowds      were    fairly heavy             for the first           200 yards       or so,          but

w h en we got       into view of the t u r nstile                      area     I could see what             I can

only des cribe as a seething mass                          of    people        s tretching      out    of sight

towards C a t c hb ar Ln,              The    road was a b s o l u t e l y solid from S h e nstone Rd

upward,        F r o m my      p o s ition    in the dog          van     (Multi--cage Dodge),               I could

see    over    the heads         of    the    people.           There was        no orderly       queuing as             in

previous years an d              I could see           that      the    crowd was        simply       pressing

■forward towards            the t u r nstile area,                 I saw       people    climbing       over       the

walls     near     to the       turnstiles        and mai n gates,               although       I could not see

''A9 Gate,         I saw a m o un te d officer                  and his        horse    pushed to one             side

and    I thought         that    he was       going       to go over           the wall    into       the    river.,



I heard       s o m e b o d y on the      radio      say that          if the gates were              not opened

there was        going      to be a disaster,                   I believe        that PO L SUP MARSH A L L

said this and further                  messa g e s     to the         effect     that    s o m ebody would          be

killed       if the      gates were          not opened          to    relieve     the    pressure.



It was at        this     time     that      I saw a       large       number     of L i verpool        supporters

only    residents         are a ll o w e d     in.        These       supporters        must    have    been       let

on these       barriers.          K no wi ng    the       problems       of the        past.    I got       out    of th

van and went          into Vere Rd where                  I saw other           officers       dragging

su pporte rs       out    of    passageways          between          the houses.         The    numbers          in the

road must        have     been     in excess         of    100,        M any    residents were          out and          I

saw,    as    I. went     down the        road,      that       the    passageways        had been used as
toilets.,           I spent         several     minutes        trying          to    pacify       residents,         without

m u c h success.              I went       to the      bottom of Vere Rd where                       police     officers

were       still       letting L i verp ool            fans    through the             barriers and. put a stop

to    it    in no u nc er t a i n terms.



During          this    time       the    radio m e s s a g e s were           cons t a n t l y    being      passed

control.            I returned            to L e p p i n g s Ln and saw that                the      crowd had

diminished             cansiderably,             I heard       s o m ebody on the             radio       shouting,

“S top them              S t op them,."         The message            was      very garb l e d and almost

I went          into L e p p i ng s Ln to give              i n s t r uctions         to dog       handlers       there.           1

have       no    idea what          time    it was,         I then went              back   to my dog van.               The

but    I cannot          remember what was                said or who               said what,.         There were

e s c or te d him thro u g h            5A 5 Gate an d via the                 lower N S t a n d       level;     took

him to the gymnasium.                      The      h os ti l i t y    of the Liverpool            supporters was

indescribable,                  I was    threatened,            v e r bally a b u s e d an d spat           upon.        On

en t e r i n g     the    g ym na s i u m with       the doctor          I was       h o r r i f i e d to see    very

m a ny dead         bodies,         I left       the g ym na s i u m a n d as           I did     I saw three youn

me n   carrying what               looked      like a girl.              She a p p e a r e d    to be dead,.          I

went     to assist and was                 told,         " D o n ’t touch her you. mur d e r i n g           bastard,"

They     ca rried her/him               into the          gymnasium.



I then went              down the       ramp onto          the ground and saw that man y dog

ha n dlers         had    been d e p loye d         across      the     pitch,       together with a cordon o

foot     officers,              I realised the             po s s i b i l i t y of a major         public order

situation,           so    I went       round every dog handler                      to make      sure    he knew

where      his      partner was,           in case         they had to           leave     the ground

quickly.            I then went          out onto P en i s t o n e Rd N where                   I saw POL PC 3 3 3 6

(iIBB IN who         had been         left     to     look after         the dog        vans.      She was

POL PC GIBB IN was                o b v io us ly     very shaken.              She    looked     terrible.          She

told m e she             had    been t h r e a te ne d       by a c r owd of Li v e r doo 1 s u c*P orters ,

We ware          joined        by other      police        officers,           POL PC G I B B I M      took me      in

her    van       round the block             to L e p p i n g s Ln,



On arrival           we were        c on f r o n t e d    by Liverpool          supporters         who were

e x t r e me l y hostile          and threatening.                    I sent POL PC G I B B I N back to

P e n is to ne Rd N and             I w a l k e d down Leppings                Ln,      The    hos t i l i t y of the

Li v e r p o o l    s u pprters was          immense.          Very man y were             very much the worse

for    drink,         I was   shaved and             pushed,       t h r e a t e n e d with violence and              spat

upon.         I had to        ignore       them, even those who                 came right        up to    me    to

spit       in my face.           They stank of             booze.,      I helped to get            two    fire

engi n e s arid some a mb u l a n c e s             thro u g h the mob.            there     is no other word

for    them,



I saw a youth, standing                 on top of a Police                car,           I went    towards      him and

was    i m m e d iately    s u r r o un de d by Liv e r p o o l         fans,        I told him to get             down

as what        he was     doing w o u l d n ’t make            things     any       better,.       Threats      to kill

me were made.,            I am certain              that   had     I tried to arrest               that y outh        1

w ou l d    have    been s er io u s l y assaulted,.



1 we nt a 1 o ng I....eppings Ln and                  put dog hand 1 e r s i ng r oups             of 4    and 6 f a r

sa f e t y and told them that              they must           not      react to the actions                of the

fans       unless     they were a b s o l u t e l y         forced.,      I did this with every

officer        I came across,-          whether         dog    handler        or    not,.      I will    say this,

that       under    the most      hostile,           a bu s i v e and    threat e n i n g       crowd     I have      ever

seen       in 29 and a half years                   of service,         the    o f f icers      on Loppings        Ln,

whet h e r     foot    officers;        traffic         officers,        m o u n t e d officers         or dog

handlers,          were m a g n if ic en t      in their         conduct,          and    by such conduct

pr e vented what          I believe        was a major             public      order        sit u a t i o n arising.,



To say that           I was    f ri g h t e n e d    is putt i ng       it mildly*             I was    in genuine

fear       of being     s er io u s l y assaulted,             if not     killed,           such was     the hatred

being        displayed.




I have        it on my     conscience          that        I did     not stay        in the ground to help,.

I believe          that at    that      time        there was        enough help            in the ground and

knowing       what was        likely to happen                outside     c o nsidered          that    to be my

It, is my opin i o n that               this     trag e d y was       caused      by the very many

L iv er p o o l    suppo r t e r s who        came with o u t       tickets,        with    one      intention - t

get    into       the    ground a n y wa y       that      they    could.         If the gates         h a d n ’t been

opened,        they would          have     forced        them    irrespective         of how many         people

they     put      in danger.          There was a complete                  d i s r e g a r d for   the safety of

others       and thems e l v e s        by this          element.      They a c h i e v e d     their    objective



A I      have      said    I have 29 an d a half                  years     service and the m a j o r i t y of

these years             have   been spent work i n g              the H i l l s b o r o u g h Division.

advantage.,             1 can go back           to the early,          mi d d l e and      late      1960*3

(000060),          long     before      fences were            thought      of and     find a long         line of

L i v e r p o a 1 s u.p p a r t e r s h i s t a r y .,



I have       p e rformed       duty at major              football     matc h e s     throughout        the S

Y o r ks hi re a r ea as -a Constable,                   Sergeant      and     Inspector,           but have    never

e x pe r i e n c e d a n y thing       like     the      15 April     1989     (150489),.



I have       been a s k ed on several                 occasions       why    I did nest use Police              dogs

to    clear       the    turnstiles         area.         Hy   reply to that          is that        if I had been

asked      to do so        in those         circumstances,            1 w o u l d have      flatly      refused to

do so and          I w ould      not have         cared who        gave     the   order.       To have        used

dogs     in such a tigh t l y             pressed         crowd would have           been the height            of

s t u pi di ty and w o u ld have              ended       in complete mayhem,              if not a riot.

th e N o r t h       Stand        where       we    signed          in the          duty       book.         I now        produce            the

(Exhibit           No              ) (Ref          SESS),            There       are     about           4-5    people          who     had

signed       on     before          us.

The    duty        allocation                for    the       day was           four     in the            first      aid       room

approximately                 30    other          staff        in a n d a r o u n d           the       ground.

For    the     first          30-45          minutes          until        about        2.15        pm     (1415)       the      fo u r      of    us

in the       first           aid    room        helped          arrange          the     room         for      the     possible

receipt        of       casualties              when       the       match       started.

At    2.15     pm       (1415)          the     first         casualty           of     th e     day was          a Nottingham

Forest       spectator              in his          late 2 0 ’s c o m p l a i n i n g                 of    high      blood          pressure

resulting           from          too    much       alcohol            intake,,          He      stated         that       he    ha d      some

medication              so    he    just        rested          for a w h i l e          before            going      back       out a g a i n .

Usually        the       names          of    casualties              ar e      placed         in a s e p e r a t e           book.          The

actual       book        used       was       already           filled          prior       to      the     start       of      the     ga m e     so

we    decided           we w o u l d         use    the       duty      book       as    described               (Ref      S E S2)      for

keeping        a    register             of     possible             casualties.                 On      the    o c c a s i o n we         d i d n ’t

At    2.30     pm       (1430)          a further             Nottingham              Forest          fan was          led      to    the     room

complaining              of a n         upset       stomach.               He    smelt         of a l c o h o l       a n d was         merely

rested       for        a few minutes.                     We    took        his      n a me     d o w n as Mr

                                                         He     l at e r     went       back        into       the S p i o n Hop.

At    2.45     pm       (1445)          a young          Liverpool              fan     came        into       the    first          aid     room

asking       for        a mirror             in o r d e r       to    put       his     contact            lens      b a ck     in*        There

w a s n ’t one          available             there        but       someone          lat e r       got     a mirror            and     as    far

as    I know        he was          led b a c k          into        the L i v e r p o o l          supporters             end.

Then     at 2 . 5 0          pm    (1450)          I went        out       into       the      ground          in f r o n t      of     pen 6

on    the S p i o n          Kop    to s o a k          in the a t m o s p h e r e             of     the      occasion.              I d i d n ’t

see    anything              to    bother          me    and w ent           back       into        the     first       aid      room.

Just       before          I went      back          I saw        the S u p e r i n t e n d e n t                                   >'ho is

in    charge          of    Sharrow         Division              he    said        the m a t c h m i g h t          have      to     be

postponed             for      some    time          to     let m o r e       late      fans        in.        At    t ha t    p o int     I

heard       an    immense            roar       from        the      crowd      and     immediately                 assumed         that       the

t e am s    had       c o me    out    onto          the     pitch.

At    3.15       pm    (1615)         a young             ten     year       ol d L i v e r p o o l       spectator            wa s

brought          in h a v i n g       an asthm a attack.                        He    said         he    h a d n ’t got        an     inhaler

with       him.        He w a s       quite          ba d    and       I attempted             to       control        his     breathing*

I then       became            more    aware          of a        steady        increase            of    casualties             come

flooding          into         the    first          aid     room,.          Before       I relate             to the         incidents

and    injuries             that      I dealt             with,        the    casualty             register          that      was     k e pt

in the       book          (Rf S E S 2 )        was       not     synchronized                with       the    chronological                  way

in w h i c h      I can         remember             the     events.            At     some        stage       I was       able       to   get

names       and       addresses            in the           book.       At    other       times          I couldn't*                I ’m not

even       sure       that      th e a c t u a l          addresses           and      names        are     correct.             It al l

happened          so       quickly         that       I just           felt     in m y        own mind          that       it was

imperative             to a t t e m p t         to    keep        some       record       of       the    unfolding            events.

Going       back       to      the    young          lad     suffering              from asthma -               he w a s       in s h o c k

but    I did          the      best    I could.                 He     was    then      left        sat     upright           and     someone

else       attended            to    him*

By    that       time                 and|________pad                left     the      first        aid     room       leaving

and    I to       deal         with    the 5 - 6            casualties              in the         r o o m a n d we        were       also

conscious             of    the      fact       that        more       injured were                being       brought         to the

corridor          outside            the    room.

Sitting          at    the      side       of    the        asthmatic           casualty            on the          c o u c h was      a male

teenager          complaining               of       crushed           ribs     to his         left       side.           This      lad was

about       17 y e a r s        old.        I think             I put        hi s    n a me    down       as

his    shirt          and      c o u l d n ’t feel           any       breakage         protrusions.                  His      b r e a t h wa s

                then      came        back       and     stated         that       about       3    people           had        died.           At   that

       point        I. w a s    deeply           shocked         and    was       gradually             becoming            aware          of    the

       enormity         and awakening                   horror         of    the    events          together              with        the

       pressure          of     the       work     and       countless            casualties.                 As     stated,,             names      and

       repeatedly              "Am    I going           to    loose         my a r m. "

       A    f i nal    year       medical          student         then        came      into       the       room,         identifying

The     lad w i t h         the       fractured          ankle      who      ha d      previously            been     holding

his    arm,        became         hysterical             for a m o m e n t          as    he    thought         his      f r i e n d was

dying        on him.             He    had    said       to me      " h o l d me         please",          which      I did       an d

the     young         lad w e p t       uncontrolably and                    for a m o m e n t          was     totally

oblivious             of    the       injury       to    his    ankle.

Within a matter                   of m i n u t e s       I wa s     in the          corridor           outside        the    fi r s t

aid     room att ending                 to    casualties            with multiple                   injuries         mostly       due      to

cr u s h i n g .

One     of    the       doctors         in the          corridor           directed my attention                      to a m a n wh o

wa s    in his          late      3 0 ’s w h o      had     lost       a    shoe,        stating        that       he was

possibly           suffering            from       a damaged           liver.            I put       his     mind     at    rest

about        arrangements               to    contact          families           as     he wa s       very       concerned about

letting         his        wife       know    that       he w a s      alright,

I made        my way         from       the    entrance           to       the    first a id           room     to    the    exit

into      the      open      air       directors          car     park       o u t s i d e the         gymnasium;           some      ten

yards        aM;ay.         That       corridor          which      is a b o u t         10-15 yards            wide       was

absolutely              packed         with    people          being        treated         on m a k e s h i f t      stretchers

from      hoarding           boards„           The       majority           of    people        doing        the     treatment

were     Police            and    doctors.

As     I went- t h r o u g h           I looked          at a f e w         cases.          They were           all      alive     and

being        well       tended         to a n d     there       didn't           appear        to    be a n y      case     for a l a r m

However,           as      I made       my way          out- into          the    directors            car    park       just     by the

main     entrance            to       the    gymnasium          hall        I saw a n d w e n t            to 3      casualties

who     appeared            to    be a l i v e .         They     were       laid        o n the       ground        one    after

the     ot h e r .         I can't          remember       if     they       were        on s t r e t c h e r s     or     just    on

th e    ground          i t self.           Their       faces     appeared             full     of     life     and      in g o o d

ruddy        coloured            complexion.              T h e y all        had       vomit        in t h e i r     mouths.

Their        eyes       were      all       closed       but    the        faces       w e r e n ’t c o n t o r t e d .

I had        j us t     started         to    do    heart       massage           on     the    f ir s t     one,     as    I couldnt

f eel    any       heartbeat.            I was        then       joined       by a       doctor          who     opened         his

eyelids        and       glanced        at    him.         He    put    his       arm    on m y      shoulder             and    said

it w a s      too     late,       that       he w a s      d e ad.

I went        on    to    the     s e c o nd man.           Th e      doctor       felt       for    a    pulse        in his

groin and           said     there       was       nothing         there      - that          he w as         also     dead.           I'm

sure     I felt          a slight        pulse        on    his       carotid        artery         but       it- wa s      faint.

The     doctor       f o 1 lowed        onto       the     third       body and also                said       it w a s      too

late.         They'd        been       placed       there        without          any    sheet       over        their       faces       and

I ’d n a t u r a l l y     assumed           they were           s t il l    alive.           Thats       why       I tried        to

revive        them.

It w a s      only when           the    doctor          pronouncedthem                 all     dead that              he    pulled

clothing           up o v e r     their       fa c e s .

It    didn't        register           then     that       they       were    dead       even       then.           T h e y ’d l o o k e d

f ull    of    life.        It w as      a hopeless              sh a me .

Straight           away     I approached              a young          policeman          who       was       walking        around

in    sh oc k .       I asked          him    if he w a n t e d         to    get       the    na m e s       a nd a d d r e s s e s     of

the     casualties           that       were       in m y        b o o k in o r d e r    to     placateanxious

relatives           then went           off.

Then     a young          man     called                    came       into       the    first       aid       room,        extremely

shocked and              very     upset       as    he'd        lost    his       brother       a n d w as          convinced

that     he w a s        dead.         I comforted              him and       he     stayed         in the          first       ai d

room.         1 took       his     name       down       in the        book       (Ref S E S 2 )         as

                                                I l a ter        wrote       to    him and          in f a c t       he     p h o n e d me

at    home     last       ni g h t .     H e ’s     lost        two    friends,          one 2 7 a n d           the      other        28.



Sometime           later     the       young       police        officer          to w h o m    I'd       spoken          to e a r l i e r

regarding           the     log    of    names        in the          book    came       up to me             and    stated        t h at

his     duty       inspector           also    wa s      in the        makeshift          mortuary             might        be a b l e

to    help     regarding           the       names.         Th e      young       officer       then          took     me    from

outside        the       first     aid       room     towards          the    gymnasium which                    I quickly
                                                                                                                                    P AG E


g a t h e r e d was       being         u s e d as      an    emergency             mortuary.               By    that      stage        I

heard       that     the       fatalities            had      risen          to 74       from       the     initial         broadcast

of 5 d e a t h s .

As    I entered           the     gym wit h          the      young          officer       I saw          a group          of

officials          by     the     doorway           checking            on    people       coming           in.        Through          the

gaps     I saw a bout             50-60        corpses         on       the    floor       draped           in    c l o t h es *

There       were     al l      si z e s ,     some      children,             many adults.                  The      police

Inspector          who      I was        directed            towards          appeared          very        busy and            I decided

not    to     bother        him.

Before        leaving          the      morgue,         where        the      atmosphere             was       uncanny          very

quiet       and    unreal,           I initially attempted                          to    console           a w o m a n who

identified           a    relative            from amongst               the    deceased.                 She     was      then     given

to    the a t t e n t i o n s        and      care      of    the       official          club Chaplain.

Again       I did        a check         on    the      casualties             in the          corridor           leading          to    the

first       aid    room.          The       majority          of     the      seriously             injured          had    been        taken

off    by a m b u l a n c e        to    hospital*

The    young       lad w h o         had      earlier         sustained             the    fractured              ankle         and who

had    been       holding         onto        his    friend          earlier         had       by    no w      gone      into      shock

and was        sobbing          as      after       having         reassured             all    the       casualties             in the

r o o m he     had       suddenly           had     time      to     think      about          himself,           no w     that     they

had    gone*         Until        this        point      he    ha d      been a jovial                 spirit,           trying         to

keep     people          in as       best      mood      as    possible             despite          his       own     injuries.              He

even     refused          to    go      on a t r o l l e y         to    the    ambulance              hopping           along      on       one

foot     to    s av e     the     sp a c e .

A Policeman              came     into        the    room and            cried       openly.              He     was     in d e ep

sh oc k .      I comforted               him      for    a while.              He    l ater         t h a n k e d me a n d         left.

Furthermore              every       casualty           had    someone          looking             after        them,      nobody           was

left     alone.

Three       doctors         who      ha d     run all         th e      way    from Hallamshire                      Hospital

a r r i v e d at     the       room      exhausted.                After       a brief          rest        they went           back         as
                                                                                                                                    PAGE


the     emergency           at       the    g r ou n d was          gradually          coming       under         control,

A    female        casualty was               then         brought        into    the     first       aid      room w ith a

fractured           elbow.            I applied a              triangular            bandage        but      then was              called

to a n       emergency           in the          corridor.           When     I got       there       I found           it w a s       just

one     of                 casualties              who      was     breathing erratically                      due      to

hysterics.              I think            her     name      was

A Mr B A L L        wh o    had       been       found        by    the R e d C r o s s       was      brought              in w i t h a

head       injury.          He       was     accompanied             by           ay o u n g e r     m anwho         wasvery          upset

as    to     the    whereabouts               of      his    friend.          I tried         to    comfort            him     by

s u g g e s t ing    various           places          he    could      have      possibly          been.          All        the

particulars             were         taken       by    the     Police       a n d Mr      BALL      was      advised           to     go    to

hospital,           but     he       refused,          stating        he w o u l d n ’t go          u n ti l      he    found         his

son.         I lat e r      found          out     the      following         Tuesday that             his        son Kester

BALL       had     died     in the           crush.

Just       then I                            |who      I ’d s p o k e n     to    earlier          came      in s a y i n g         that

h e ’d f o u n d     his        brother.              He    wa s    elated       and    I tried         to     use      his

euphonic           state        to    c h eer      up Mr       BALL.        However           I got       the      awful           feeling

t hat      Mr B A L L ’S so n was                d e ad.       I wa s      unfortuantely              l a ter      proved           right

in my        f e e 1 in g s .

T h e n a bo y       of     about          12 y e a r s      of a g e      was    brought          in s u f f e r i n g        from

sha c k .        However         a    lat e r      examinatiofi of               the    lads       body      I found           that

they       had     pressed           into     something             which     ha d     a screw        type        head        on    it.

It was        actually           pushed          into       his a b d o m e n .        From    observations                   1 couldn't

say     how      deep      the       actual        intrusion          into       the    f l e s h was.            I c o u l d n ’t

make       out     what     it was.              He    was     in s h o c k      and    d i d n ’t a p p e a r         to    k n ow

about        it.     He     was       soon       transferee! to             hospital.

At    about        5.40     pm       (1740)        w h i c h wa s     my    first       actual         a p p r e c i a t i o n of

time       since     3.15        pm    (1615)          the     room     had      cleared       of      all c a s u a l t i e s         and

only       the     police        and       St J o h n s      Ambulance           were     left.

One     of    the    doctors           came        in a n d        shook    hands       with       each      of    us       in t u r n
                                                                                                                           PAGE     10

             I left        Hillsborough          by a m b u l a n c e    at   about- 6 » 0 0   pm   ( 1800)    and arrived

             home    at    7.00     pm    (1900),

             From    my     own   point     of    view     I feel        a    certain   amount      of   guilt     in the     way

             that    I feel       that     despite       all    my      training,, I wish           I could      h a ve

             brought        these    three       people      back       to    life,   although      in h i n d s i g h t   I know

             they were        dead       prior    to m y a r r i v a l .

           he was       infact         dead,    & some       one   placed a Tee shirt across his face.

           All     I. can remember about               the de ce a s e d man was       that     he was a white male

           have a n y facial            hair    but    had. some growth,         I can also        recall     that     he

                I am     presently               stationed        at     Attercliffe             Police      Station,          Sheffield,            On

                April        1 5 th     1 98 9     I was     on 6 a m         (1800)      - 6      pm    (1800)     due    to    the S e mi

                end     of       the    ground.

                On attending               I expected           to      see   a   public         order       situation         but    I sa w

                the     rear          gates      to L e p p i n g s     Ln were        ope n .        Laid   out    on    the    floor     by     the

                river        I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y          10 b o d i e s    all      of     which    appeared        dead.

                There        were       3 or      4 other       Officers          in a t t e n d a n c e     with    the       bodies.

to     be    dead.           I passed             them       to a    line        of O f f i c e r s        I dont          k n o w 'who t h e y

pitch.            He    had       his    son w i t h          him who          was      a teenager.                 Th e    son was

shouting              "Do    something             do    something."                  I checked            his      pulse.          His         eyes

were        wide       open.        He       was    blue        in the         face.          He    was       dead.          I said            to       his

so n    " I ’m        sorry       the res         nothing        I can d o . "

I c o u l d n ’t s t a y           and       comfort          his    son       there       were         others       unattended.                        I

c a n ’t r e c a l l         anything             about       the    dead mans             description.

I went           into       the    goal       mouth          area    and       gave      mouth          to m o u t h       resuscitation

red     jumper.              He    w a s n ’t b r e a t h i n g        at      t h is    time,           I managed            to    restore

his     breathing             I obtained                assistance             of     some     civilians             and      I believe

POL     PC       GERMAN       to     carry         him       on m a k e     shift        stretcher             of    display

On arrival              at    the       gym       the    ’s t r e t c h e r ’ w o u l d n ’t go               through         the      s id e

him     through             the    door.           Once       inside,          someone,            I believe           a Police

Officer,         said       "Dead       to    the    left       injured             to    the       right."

I carried            the    casualty          to    the    centre          section             of    the      gym and          I f o u n d we

were     the     only       people       the r e,     there          were       no       doctors          or m e d i c a l

facilities            here       at    this    stage.

I checked            the    mans       pulse again.                 He    had a          pulse and            wa s      breathing

although         he w a s        unconscious.              I placed             him       in the           recovery           position             on

the    gym      floor       and       left    him with          a    c iv i li an who               I believe            was    his

I returned            to    the       pitch    and    assisted             in       removing             a w o m a n E0--30 y e a r s

in j e a n s     with a white                jumper       and a          pink       bra.        She       was      obviously             dead

and     had     no    pulse.           1 picked       her       up f r o m          somewhere             around         the    goal

mouth.          1 t oo k     her      on a     board       to       the    gym,          w i t h P O L PC          GERMAN and

civilians.In               the    gym    I laid       her       next       to       some       other        bodies.            At    this

stage,         I think        , it was,            I delegated             Officers             to s t a y w i t h            the    bodies

I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r        which Officer             and w h i c h            bodies          were         together.              I

returned         to    the       pitch a gai n        when          I saw a d i s t u r b a n c e                 break       out    in

th e    seated        area       of    the    north       stand          not    far       from       the      half       way    line,

between         fans       in s e a t e d a r e a a n d         others          on       the    pitch.             I tried          to       calm

the     situation           down.        While       I was          there       I saw          a fa n       in the        stand          strike

someone        else        in the       stand and          knock          him       to    the       fl o o r .         I climbed             into

th e    stand        and    dragged          the    offender             over       the    w al l        onto      the    pitch where

he     calmed        down and          said    he    was    s o rr y .          In v i e w          of    the      situation             with

bodies        still        being       carried       from       the       pitch          I escorted               him    to    the

entrance         at    the       side    of    the    gym and             ejected          him       from         the    ground.              I

w a s n ’t a b l e     to    obtain          details       of       either          the    offender               or    the    victim             in

the    sta n d .

I returned            to    the       pitch    and    assisted             in g r o u n d           control.             As    fans          left

the    ground         I attended             several       c a lls        of    disturbance                 around        the       ground

on mobile            patrol       w i t h P O L PC G E R M A N .               We    followed             fans         from    both          c l ubs

into     the     City Centre             and       eventually             made       our       way       ba c k    to A t t e r c l i f f e

                I am a married               man and       I live at        the a b o v e    address*




                A    short     time      after      the    disaster        at   the H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l   ground,

                was       interviewed         by    two P o l i c e    Officers       from     the W e s t      Midlands       Police

                and       I completed         a Supporters            Questionnaire          for     the H i l l s b o r o u g h

                Judicial         Inquiry.



                Further        to    the     information           contained       in my S u p p o r t e r s     Questionnaire,

                can a d d      the     following          in     regards    to m y    experiences          at    the    football

                game      held      at H i l l s b o r o u g h    on the    15th April         1 9 89   (150489).




                As    stated        in m y    questionnaire,            I travelled          to S h e f f i e l d     on a    coach

                from Village             Group      Coaches,!                   L Liverpool.            Most     of    the    persons
                                                                                                                                  P AG E


on    the       coach      were       known     to me       as      3'. u s e d    to    live       in                 [ although               I

knew       these         people       by sight,          I could         not       give       their       details.




The    details            I know       of    the      other      passengers              on    the       coach are          as    follows




He    has       been      seen    by     the Police,.




                                                                                                                      and

a    lad    called                    **ho w a s      w i t h me      on the        terraces               I only       know

because          I stand         by h i m at          Anfield.            I don't         know       his     surname.




As    previously            stated          I was      involved           in the         crush       outside          the    ground

and    eventually               I wa s      pulled       out     of     the       crush       by a m o u n t e d P o l i c e

Officer          and      I entered          the      ground        through         a    large       open       gate,       w h ic h was

situated            to    the    right       hand      side      of     the       terrace        turnstiles,                I no w     know

this       ga t e    to    be    gate       *C*.       It w a s       some        time    between          2,.5Q pm         (1450)         and

2,55       pm    £1455)         when     I entered          the       ground.




After       entering            the    g ro u n d ,    I went         down        the    tunnel          with]________________ a n d

            the      lad    I know          f r o m AnfieJ.d.            We       went    down       the     tunnel         because         I

thought          that      the    tunnel        was      the     only      entrance            to    the     terraces.              It w a s

my    intention            to    get     onto      the    terraces            and make          my way across                to

the    left         hand    s i de     of    the      terraces         on the           N stand          side    of    the       ground

to    vieM; the           game,




All    three         of    us    had     free      passage          along         the    tunnel          up to    its       end,     where

the    tunnel            joined       the L e p p i n g s      Ln     terraces,           then       I could          see    the
                                                                                                                                  P AG E         3


terraces           were    very       crowded.              We    pushed        our      M/ay into          the     crowd and

tried       to w o r k     our    way       over       to    the       left.        As    we     got    onto        the    back        of

the    terraces           I could       see       that       the       players        were       on the         pitch      for     their

kick     ab o u t .




We    had    only        pushed       our    way       into       the       back    of    pe n    number          four     for     a

distance           of a    few    feet       when       there          wa s    a sudden          surge        from     behind.

This     surge        pushed      me    further             o v er     to     the   left       and     at     the    same        time       it

s p u n me    around and              I ended          up    looking           up   into       the W S t a n d a b o v e           the

terraces.




I suspect           that    the       surge       was       caused          by m o r e    people        coming         into       pen

number       four        from    the    tunnel.




At    the    same        time    as    I. w a s    spun around                 by   this       surge,         I felt       that        the

pressure           from    the    crowd ar ou nd                 me    had     increased          compacting              people

tighter        together.




I. m a n a g e d    to    turn aroun d            to    face          the     pitch      again,        although           the     crush

had    increased,               I could       s t il l       move       although          only       very       li m i t e d ,     As       I

turned       around        the    players          were          sti ll       having      their        k ic k     about.




S h or tl y after          I had       turned myself                   around,        I felt         another         strong        surge

from     behind,          this    surge       p u s h e d me           forwards          and     further          over     to m y       left

to a     position about                halfway          down          the     terracing.




I have       marked        two    positions             on a s e p a r a t e          grid       plan which            I produce

Position           number       one       £1)       is    the     position             I was      in a f t e r      the    first          surge

where        I was       spun around                to    face        the W S t a n d .           I cannot          be    precise

about        the    time       I w as      in t h i s          position            other        than    to    say    it was       just

after        the    players          had       come       out     onto        the      pitch      for    the     kick      abo u t .




Position           number       two       (2)       is    t he    position             I was      in a f t e r      the    second

surge.         I was          about       half       way       down        the     terraces,           and    the    dividing             fence

between        pe n      number          four       and    pen        five       was     about     eight       feet       away    to my

left     hand       side.           In    position             tw o     (2)      I was      standing          with       a barrier             to

my     back,       although          on    first          arriving            at    that        position       I wa s      not a w a r e

of     the    presence          of       that       crush        barrier.              I cannot         sa y w h a t      time     I got

to     position          two    (2)       but       I am       sure        the     game     had    not       kicked       off.        On

arriving           in    position          two       (2)                                 wa s    still       close       to me

standing           ne:<t to me            on m y         left     hand        side.         I had       lost     sight      of I                   by

In     position          two    £2)       I was          crushed           to a n      extent      where       I c o u l d n ’t m o v e ,

bu t    I believe             because          1' w a s    standing              just     in f r o n t       of a    crush       barrier,

I was        not    being       c r u s h e d as          s e v e r e l y as        the     people       who     were      around             me.




In     position          two    (2)       there          was     a young           lad    immediately            in f r o n t      of me

and     pushed          up    agai nst         me,       he wa s        pani cki ng        sayi ng he          c o u 1 d n ’t b r e a t h

My     hands       were       stuck       down       by m y       sides          and     I tried        to    grab       hold    of       this

young        lad    to       push    him       up    to    help         him.        Ha    was     only a young             lad,       I

think        about       16 y e a r s      old.           He     ha d      blond       hair,      medium       in    le ngth.             I

think        he was          wearing       a denim             jacket.             I c a n ’t r e a l l y      say m u c h more

about        him.        I only          saw    the       back        of    his     head.         While       I was       trying          to

push     this       young       lad       up,       I heard another                    m a n u/ho w a s      standing           just          to

the     back       of    me    and       to my       right        hand        side,       shouting           something          like,

" H e ’s g o i n g       down."           This       made        me     turn my at te nt io n away                   from       the       lad
                                                                                                                                  P AGE


in f r o n t      of me.




I looked          over        my    r i ght      shoulder             and    I could          se e      a young       boy,    his      face

was    purple,           his       eyes      were       closed.             He    was     about         arms    length away            from

me    b e h i n d me         and    to m y       r i g ht     hand      s i de.         There        was    another        man    trying

to    lift       this        young       bo y    up.         I bent         backwards             and    with my        right     hand          I

g rabbed         ho 1d of          the      f ront      of    the      boy's          c 1 othi ng       below     his    neck     line.

I just          pulled and             he    came       out     of     the       crowd and           the    last      I s a w of       this

boy    he w a s         lying       on t o p       of    the      people          in the          crowd     in f r o n t     of me      and

just       to m y       right       hand        side.          I can't           say    if    I saw        this    young      boy m o v e

at    all.        Again         I cannot           say what            time       this       occurred,          I was      not    aware

of    the       game     kicking            off.




I ca n      only        describe            this      boy     as a w h i t e           male       aged     about      13 y e a r s .        I

think       he wa s          sli m .        I think          light      brown          to m o u s y      coloured        hair,        cut

short.           I think           he m a y      have        been wearing               denim        jeans      and     training

shoes       although            I c a n't        be     sure.




Just       after        we    had m a n a g e d         to     pull     this          young       boy    out,     I heard        someone

who    was       b e h i n d me        shouting,             "He's      down,          he's       down."        I looked         down

over       my    right        shoulder           down        onto      the       floor       and     I saw      someone      wa s

l y in g    on the           terraces,           I could          see       two       feet,       with     brown      leather         shoes

on.        I then        quickly            turned around               to       look     b e h i n d me       to m y    left     and       I

s a w an        old man         lying        face       up on         the    fl o o r .




It was          then     that       I realised               there      wa s      a    crush       barrier        immediately

behind          me.      I 1eant            over      the     crush         barrier          to    try and        pick     this       man

up.        He    wa s   an     old       guy,      his       fa c e   wa s       p u rple,        his    eyes     were     open and

his m o u t h         was     open.          I could          see      his       teeth,       hi s      face    appeared         to    be

bloated.              This     old       guy     looked         far     worse          than       the    young     lad who        had
                                                                                                                                      P AG E          6


also    gone          purple.            I think         the     young          lad m a y       have     passed         out      but     on

looking       at       this       ol d    guy,          I thought          he w a s      dead.         I leant          over       to    try

and    pick       him       up,    I grabbed             hold        of    him with          my    right         h a nd.      He      was      not

moving       at all,          he w a s        a dead           weight.           I had       to    let- go        of    him,,      he w a s

too    heavy.




On    our    side       of    the        barrier          it w a s        st ill      very      packed       but       on the         side       of

the    barrier          M/here         this       old    g u y was         lyi n g      a gap      had      formed around                the

old    guy's          body.                        I th i nk ,        had       got     under      the      barrier         a n d wa s         by

this    old       guy.        I went          around           the    barrier           I M/as s t a n d i n g         close       to    the

end    of    it.




This    old       guy was          lying          face     upwards           on the        steps       of    the       terraces          he

was    lying          with    his        head      towards           the     dividing           fence       of    pens      four a n d

five.        His       head was           under          the    crush        barrier         and    his      feet- w e r e         slightly

higher       up       the    terraces             towards        the       rear.




I got       around          the    barrier           and       joined                                    was      trying         to     e as e

the    old    guy's          head        back      to     open       his     mouth,        and     I felt         his      wrist        to

feel    for       a    pulse.            I couldn't             feel       anything.              I also         felt      his     che s t

but    I couldn't             feel        a heart          beat.           I haven't            had a n y        first      aid

training          but we          tried       to        resuscitate             this     ol d     guy,      I pressed            on     his

chest,       but       it    just        f el t    s ol i d .        I couldn't            even     hear         anything          like

wheezing.              There        was       just       no m o v e m e n t        or    reactions          to     our e f f o r t s .

I think       we       were        trying          to    revive           this     old     guy    for     I think about                 three

minutes       but       nothing           happened.,             We       had    been      joined        by a c o u p l e          of    other

supporters             and        one    of       these     took      over         f r o m me     pumping          the o l d       guy's

chest.        Whilst          I had         beenpumping               this       old     guy's      chest,         I       think

had    been       trying          to     give      him mouth              to m o u t h .
                                                                                                                                  PAGE


By    this     time       I was       becoming              very    worried about               what       may       have    happened

to m y      brother                        t o l d rne to          go a n d       look    for    the       others.

remained           with       this    old       guy




I would        describe          this        old      g u y as      a white          male      aged    about          60 years

stockily           built*        I don't           think        he was         very      tall.        He    had       grey    hair,        a

full     head       of    hai r .         I think           he w a s     clean       shaven.          I cannot             remember

much about              his    clothing.              I can        say    that       on M o n d a y    17th A p r i l         1989

(170489),           I saw a          photograph              being       shown       on a t e l e v i s i o n         programme          of

one    of     the       deceased          n a m e d as       John ANDERSON.                 I believe            that       the    old

guy    I h av e         referred          to a b o v e       was    John ANDERSON.




The    incidents              I have       described            above,         the      times    between             first    helping

the    young        blond       guy       immediately              in f r o n t      of me      and    then          the y o u n g    boy

and    then        the    old    guy who           I believe             was      John    A N D E R S O N , would           not    have

been more           than about             two m i n u t e s ,         the     sequence         of    events          happened        very

quickly.




I cannot           be    precise          about       the     times       of      the    occurrences,                but    I would

estimate           from my       time        of    entering            the     terraces         just       as    the       players

came     out       for    their       kick        about,        that      when       I first         saw    the       ol d g u y     l y ing

on    the     floor       the    game        had      still        not    kicked         off,    I would             estimate        the

time     to    be a b o u t      one       or     two       minutes       before         kick    off.




1 am a white              mal e ,     6    feet       tall,        I am      of    large       build,       although          not     fat.

On     page     2 of       this       statement          I have         referred         to a m o u n t e d           Policeman

pul 1 ing me          out    of       the       crush.        I would         like      to    say     that       prior         to    this

happening            the    crushing             in the       approach          to    the     outer        gates        had      got      very

severe,         because          of    this       I approached a Policeman                          who       was     standing

controlling            (opening             and       closing)         the    outer      perimeter              gates         leading          to

t he    terrace        turnstiles*                    I cannot         sa y w h i c h    g at e     at     this       time*          I was

outside         the    outer          gates       in L e p p i n g s      Ln.        There      was      a man        in f r o n t        of

me     with a young              boy    of a b o u t         eight      or    nine      years       of a g e         on his

shoulders.             This       man was             having     problems            keeping        on his           fe e t    because

of     the     pushing       and       shoving*              I was      afraid        that      the      young        boy w o u l d

f all    off     his       shoulders.




I approached               this       P o l i ce ma n who        was      holding        the      gate        closed,,           I

pointed         out    the       situation             with     this      young       bo y a n d a s k e d           him      to o p e n

the     gate     to    allow          the       man    and    t he     bo y   into      the     area       of    the       turnstile

approach         or    to    radio          into       the    ground and             to a s k     for      the       game      to    be

delayed         and    to a n n o u n c e         it    over     the      tannoys        to     s t o p all          the      pe op l e

pushing         at the      back*           This        P o l i c e m a n just        ignored         me,       he    just      stood

there.          He       coulddefinit ely                se e    that this            young       boy was            in d a n g er .           I

got     annoyed        at    this       and asked             him      for    his     number*            He     continued            to

ignore         me.          As    Ih a d    a s k e d for     t hi s    Policeman's             number          it w as        then

that     the     mounted           Policeman             p i c k e d me up      by      the     front         of m y       s h i r t * He

did     no t    do    this       to    h e l p me       but     because         I had asked              the     other         Policeman

for     his     number*




The     Policeman           controlling                the    g a t e , the      one w h o        ignored            me,      was

wearing         a helmet          and an          ordinary           uniform         jacket*          He      was     about         4 0 to

45 years         of ag e         with       a    round       plump      face.         I do      not      know        this O ff i c e r ' s

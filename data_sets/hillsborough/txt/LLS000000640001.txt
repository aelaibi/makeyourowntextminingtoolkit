 L ive rpo ol




 I am               years    o f age.              Date of birth                                    I was       born and          educated          in

 L i ve rp o ol       and     I    left        s ch oo l     at    the       age    of              years.           I am at present unemployed

 and       I    was       last     in        employment,          some       years       ago    with

 and I h a v e b e e n u n a b l e              to find           employment             since.




 I    am       single        and       reside        at     the    above           address          alone.            I    have       been      a   Liverpool

supporter             all     my        life,       and      I    am    a     season       ticket          holder           at    the       Kop     End       and       I

got        my       ticket        as     a    result         of    the       allocation              on    my    season           ticket        some      couple

o f w ee ks b e f o r e           the match.




Together             with    others,           I    went      down       to    Sheffield             on    Friday          14th       A p r i l as w e h i r e d

a mini          bus and together                    t h e r e w e r e a b o u t 9 o r 1 0 o f us,                    which       included my brother




                                   and        we     got     our       heads       down        on    the        snake       pass,        and      drove       in to

Sheffield at a b o u t 9 o'clock                            on the Saturday morning.




We     had          parked       up     near        a      supermarket,             a     Gateway          Supermarket                and      we   bought          a

football             in     the        shop     and        w e .p layed        football              all    morning,             and     we     even      had       a

match with some N o t t i n g h a m F orest supporters.




We    left          there    at        about       midday        and     the    police         told        us    were       to    park        the   v eh i cl e ,

the    pu bs         around        the       ground         were       all     shut      and        they    directed             us    to a pub          called

The    Fox,          which        is    about.       2     miles       from        the    ground.               We    walked          there.        We    had       2

pints          of    lager        and    we        le ft    the    pub        at    about       2     o'clock             and    walked        back      to    the
    ground,     and        I        arrived             outside           the         ground           at      about          10     p ast,          quarter           past    2,

wi tli

We     got      inside              the      ground              and     unlike             last       time,        when           there        had    been        stewards

on duty,            to d i r e c t        y o u w e r e to go,                 and there were no                         s t e w a r d s o n duty.




I     went     through              the      t un n el           and     to      my       surprise            the        enclosure             was     already           full,

and      there        were          people         coming          in     behind             us,    and        I    was       pushed           down    to        the    front,

and      I     was        about          1    foot           from        the         railings,              and      obviously                the     pressure           built

up     and      people              were      becoming                 distressed               and       people             started           to     try        and     climb

ou t     of    the        enclosure            and           people           were         trying         to       kick        the       door        open,       and     I saw

a police        officer spread                      e a g l e d a c r o s s the door,                       h o l d i n g p e o p l e b a c k in.




There         was     a    big       surge          in       the        crowd         and       the       door       burst          o pen,      and        I could          feel

myself         being       pushed             aw^ay      from           the      gate,          and       I was          pulled          over        the    edge       of     the

gate        with         one    h an d,        and           I    pulled             myself         through,                 and     I    was        dragged           through

to     the     next        enclosure               and       I walked             along          the      enclosure                and    I could           see        peoples

faces pushed              against            the r a i l i n g s a n d they w e r e o b v i o u s l y                              in agony.




I    was      screaming              to      the        police          to     do         s o m e t hi n g,        and       they        just       pushed        me     away,

I     went     through              to       the        next       enclosure                 and      I     saw                                            approach         the

players        to try          and t.ell t h e m to st op the game.




I     walked        along           the       enclosure                and       I     c ould       see        people          were        dead,           everyone         was

screaming            for       help          and        it       was     total            chaos       and      as        I    walked           towards           the    gate,

I    saw                                           on    his           b ac k,        I     thought           he    was        dead,           and

was    t r y i n g to h e l p p u l l m e out...




I    broke      down       in        tears         then          and      I      walked          into         the    ground              and    I     could        not      see

the    rest         of    my        friends.             I             had       his       hand      up     in      the       air,       he     was    reaching             for

me    and     asking           me    for      help,          I    t ri ed        to       scramble          up      on       the     fence       to        try    and    drag
  3,




 him,          and       everyone              round         him     was        d ead ,        t h e y all b a d             blue       faces.            He     was    gasping

 for       breath,            and      his     eyes      were       rolling,              his h a n d s t a r t e d                 to go down and he seemed

 to    faint            and     the      police         pulled          me      a way,         and     this          was          the    last           time     I seen       him,

 and       I    realise             that       my     brother             was       with       him,        and        I       could       see           the    bodies        piled

 up      and        I    thought, he           must        have      been           one     of       the        bodies,             I    was        walking        round       the

 pitch          in       a     daze, a n d       I      went       to      the        mainstand                to    fin d         my     father          to     tell       him

 I w a s a l i v e b u t I c o u l d n o t find him.




 I     went         back       and      saw                                         again        and       I        could          see    my. b r o t h e r           and

                         and     I knew         that         they       were        alive        and       I    did          not know about

 tol d         me       he    had      seen                  |g o i n g      down,        and        he        thought             he     was       definately              dead,

 and       we       all       broke        down         in     tears          and      we        tried          to       pull           ourselves             together        and

 we    saw          people        getting            carried            on      stretchers,                and           I    was       helping           together           wit h

                and                                          and    we       were         carrying              them          to        the    other           side     of    the

pitch          and      the police were                  saying,           get people                t h a t w e r e a liv e ,                l e a v e t h e dead.




This       went          on     for      %   hour-** % hour.                    I     went       up       to    the          hospital              to    fi nd    out       about

           and          I     took       his        details         down         and        his        description                      and    things            like       that.

                                    had      been        t ake n        to      hospital             by    this              time,       and        I    was      trying       to

find out which hospital                              h e had g o n e            to.




At     5   o'clock,              we     walked          back       and       went      to      the        transport                and        eventually           we       found

                at t h e h o s p i t a l         and he d i s c h a r g e d               h i m s e l f a n d w e c a m e h o m e to L i v e r p o o l .




Since          the       incident,             obviously             I       have      been          haunted                 by    the        memories           of    what       I

saw,       and       I have         not      been       able       to      sleep          or     eat      and        I       have       had        the m o s t terrible

experience               I     have      ever        had      in    my       life.             I     have           never          seen        a    de ad      body     in my

lif e b e f o r e t h i s             i n c id e nt .

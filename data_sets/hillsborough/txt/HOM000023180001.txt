  here in Glasgow recently, he mentioned th a t he would
  like to see a copy of the f e a s ib i li ty study which I
  put together in connection with the proposition th a t
  the Scottish F.A. and the Scottish League might be more
  closely united and might be served jo in tly by one Chief
  Executive.
                                                                                           i   Ia



  I am happy to enclose a copy of t h is document and I

             U nification of the Two Organisations



     For as long as anyone in te re ste d in the a f f a ir s
of Scottish foo tb all can remember i t has been a frequently
heard complaint th a t i t is im practical to have two bodies
appearing to control Scottish foo tb all and th a t i t is
uneconomical to have twoseparate o ffic e headquarters
and adm inistrations.

     The charge th a t there are two organisations seen
to control the game has no b a sis in fa c t. The Scottish
F.A. has never been slow to asse rt i t s dominant role
and the suggestion th a t i t i s in some way subservient
to the Scottish F.L. is made only by those commentators
who have no close understanding of the workings of
football in Scotland.    Neither can i t be said th a t the
Scottish League has ever seriously attempted to usurp
the A ssociation's authority.

          That there have been              many occasions during th e ir
long h is to r ie s when there has been f r ic t io n between the
two bodies is quite certain and i t would be surprising
were i t otherwise.              An examination of the differences
which have arisen from time to time would probably reveal
th a t they re fle c te d the lik e s , d is lik e s , jealo u sies and
other emotions of key individuals on both sides rather
than th a t they were caused by any insurmountable
 d i f f i c u lt ie s . This f r ic t io n i s not peculiar to Scotland
but is seen a l l over the world, both in those countries
where the Association and the League are seen as separate
 e n t i t i e s , as in Scotland, and in countries where the
 two bodies are more closely linked in one way or another,
under one roof.




                                -   1-
      I t would be wrong to make too much of these
differences.     For a re la tiv e ly long period of years now
there have been few occasions when the harmony of Scottish
football l i f e has been seriously disturbed, but having
said th at i t should be made clear th a t given the quite
differen t basic functions of the two bodies i t is
inevitable th a t there w ill be clashes of in te r e s t on
occasion.      To understand the situ a tio n c le a rly , these
basic functions have to be appreciated.

       The S.F.A. 's purpose in l i f e is to fo s te r the game
of football at a l l lev e ls, from the schools' playing
fie ld s and the amateur and other minor ranks up through
the semi-professional football of the Junior F.A. and
the 'non-league' clubs to the top professional level
represented by the S.F.L. clubs.             This fo ste rin g of the
game includes such things as youth coaching, the tra in in g
of coaches, the recruitment and tra in in g of referees,
maintaining d isc ip lin e throughout the game at both the
administrative       and    playing       lev els,   ensuring       and
controlling Scotland's involvement in                  in tern atio n al
competitions, and representing Scotland in the European
and World p o l it ic a l and le g is la tiv e arenas.      In short,
i t s function covers a l l aspects of fo o tb all and the
protection of i t s wellbeing, at every level.

       The S .F .L .'s function is , of course, much narrower,
in th at i t is lim ited to the in te re s ts of i t s 38 member
clubs, on whose behalf i t organises League Championship
and League Cup competitions. Within th a t framework i t s
problems and re s p o n s ib ilitie s are many and varied but
they a ll re la te to the welfare of the 38 clubs and do
not flow over into the more general                    areas of
re sp o n sib ility covered by the S.F.A.




                                -   2-
        I t is not   d i f f i c u l t , on occasion, for an outside
observer to form the impression th a t on the one hand
there stands the Association and on the other, poles
apart, there is the League and i t s 38 clubs, but t h i s
overlooks the fa c t th a t each of these clubs is i t s e l f
a f u l l member of the Association and th a t such membership
is a p rereq u isite for League membership.

      Another in te re s tin g feature of the h is to r ic a l
relationship between the two e n t i t i e s , and one th a t is
not always understood, is          th a t the League, as a body,
is not a member of the Association in the sense th a t,
to use names as examples, Partick T h istle F.C. or the
Scottish Junior F.A. are members. Instead, the S .F .A .'s
A rtic le s of Association confer upon i t the special
entitlem ent to send a representative to the           A.G.M. and
to appoint      the members of i t s Management Committee on
to the A ssociation's Council.              The curious situ atio n
p rev ails th a t despite being granted various other
entitlem ents and p riv ileg es throughout the A rticles of
Association       i t is not suggested anywhere th erein th at
the League is        a "member” ,a t i t l e conferred only upon
clubs and associations.

      T heoretically,    therefore,    and    excepting     the
p rivileges mentioned, the sta tu s of the S.F.L. v is -a -v is
the S.F.A.      is the same as, for example, the East of
Scotland League, the South of Scotland League, or the
Highland League.      The overwhelming difference to these
organisations, of course, i s th a t the S .F .L .'s membership
comprises the biggest clubs in terms of grounds and public
support, a fact which has enabled the League to be in
a financial position to maintain i t s own office
headquarters and i t s own f u l l time adm inistration, quite
separate from the S.F.A.        I t is the public perception



                               -   3-
of      these       separate    headquarters   and       separate
adm inistrations, each headed by a President and Secretary
who, h is to r ic a lly , have tended to have re la tiv e ly high
p ro file s , which has created the feelin g th a t there are
'two ruling b o d ies'.

     I t does seem th at so long as there is a S cottish
League    organisation     running    the   dominant    weekly
competition in Scottish foo tb all there is going to be
a high public awareness of i t s existence and a c t i v i t i e s ,
and the re s u lta n t confusion of i t s role with th a t of
the S.F.A.       No matter how close together the two
organisations may come, th at s itu a tio n w ill p re v a il,
but the public misconception is scarcely of paramount
importance provided th a t i t is only a public misconception
and th at those most closely involved do not confuse the
respective functions in th e ir minds.

     I f there are advantages to be gained by bringing
both organisations more closely together, these would
seem not to l i e in the area of public image or
understanding.

        Presumably there are two ways in which th ere could
be a coming together of the Association and the League.
F ir s tly , there could be a complete integ ratio n , with
the League becoming a department within the Association.
I t is probably something along these lin e s which is
envisaged by those whose voices are heard not
infrequently, c a llin g for an end to the present set-up.
Perhaps, however, they have not thought out a ll th a t
would be involved.

     As things stand, the League owns i t s own o ffice
headquarters in a prestigious and re la tiv e ly valuable



                                -   4-
c ity centre location.     I t has i t s own independent and
quite separate fin an cial stru c tu re , not linked to the
S.F.A. in any way.       For more than 30 years past i t s
principal source of funding has been the copyright fees
paid by the Pool Promoters' Association for the priv ileg e
of reproducing S cottish League fix tu re s on fo o tb all pool
coupons.    This source of revenue w ill continue to be
available in the years ahead but i t s prime position in
the funding ranks has now been taken over by the fees
paid by te le v isio n companies.   Sponsorships of varying
kinds and values represent another funding source.

     The League's policy over the years of passing on
almost i t s e n tire income to the member clubs without
retain in g   anything   of  significance   for      financial
consolidation purposes has meant th a t with the exception
of i t s o ffice building no su b stan tial c a p ita l assets
appear in the balance sheet.

        If integ ratio n with the S.F.A. were to mean th at
the League's fin an cial resources, both ex istin g and
anticipated, were to be submerged in the greater financial
reservoir of the S.F.A. i t is d i f f i c u l t to imagine th a t
the 38 clubs would view the idea with enthusiasm.              As
these clubs are a l l in f u l l membership of the S.F.A.
and are e n title d to share in a l l of the A ssociation's
fin ancial disbursements of whatever kind, in addition
to receiving various S.F.L. subsidies of one sort or
another, there i s no financial benefit fo r them in sinking
the League's resources in the S.F.A. Rather the reverse.
The only possible amalgamation acceptable to the 38 clubs
would be one which guaranteed the separate financial
in te g rity of the League's a ss e ts and resources and as
soon as th a t is admitted there is l i t t l e point in pursuing
the theory of in teg ratio n .



                                -   5-
        From the p o l i t i c a l and adm inistrative standpoints,
the idea of an amalgamation of both organisations would
appear to be fundamentally flawed.               The League is not
the Association and the Association is not the League.
The League is a p a rt of the Association and like a l l
of the other constituent p a rts i t is subject to the
A ssociation's rule.           If i t were not to have a separate
id e n tity but were instead to be an in te g ra l p a rt of the
Association, no more than an adm inistrative department,
how is the A ssociation's authority to be applied in cases
of dispute?       Is the Association to d isc ip lin e i t s e l f ?
The Association represents the la s t court of appeal in
Scottish fo o tb all. How is i t to s i t in judgment on League
m atters i f the League is the S.F.A? The concept is fa ls e .

        I t would seem then th a t from the fin a n c ia l, p o litic a l
and adm inistrative points of view the philosophy of
complete integ ratio n is i l l founded and th a t the separate
id e n tity of the two bodies should be maintained.

       A second, simpler method of developing a closer
relationship between the Association and the League would
be to have them housed under one roof, sharing various
common services.       Few would disagree th a t the present
system of separate o ffic e s, which inevitably leads to
a great deal of duplication of a number of adm inistrative
functions, is fin a n c ia lly wasteful and unnecessarily
burdensome on the member clubs who have to meet the
adm inistrative requirements of two bureaucracies.           The
physical d e ta ils of creating a new set-up where the two
bodies would operate side by side under the same roof,
w hilst each reta in in g i t s separate id e n tity , should be
re la tiv e ly simple but the b en efits would be considerable,
e.g. the following services and f a c i l i t i e s could be
shared:-

     (1)   Reception
     (2)   Switchboard
     (3)   Computer
     (4)   R egistration
     (5)   Printing and copying
     (6)   Mailing
     (7)   Refereeing Dept, work could be integrated
     (8)   Security Dept, work could include League a f f a i r s
     (9)   Commercial Dept, work could include League
            a f f a ir s
    (10)   Technical and Coaching Dept, work could include
            League a f f a ir s
    (11)   Meeting rooms would be used more frequently

       If the League adm inistration were moved to Park
Gardens, space to accommodate them could be created by
sh iftin g Scotball Travel and Leisure to West Regent
S treet.   Other S.F.A. departments may have to be moved
to West Regent S treet also but t h is would be the subject
of a separate study.      The advantages of having Scotball
situ ated nearer the c ity centre are obvious.

     There is l i t t l e purpose in elaborating on the
advantages to S cottish football generally i f both
organisations shared one roof.      That i t would be an
improvement on the ex istin g circumstances goes without
saying.

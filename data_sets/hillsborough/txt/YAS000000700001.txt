NAME:      Qualified Ambulanceman             - Parkway

VEHICLE:     S403

SHIFT:     Off-duty

DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:       Written Statement - 20/04/89



I saw the first television pictures at home as they began to lift fans up
into the upper terrace at Leppings Lane.           I then telephoned Control to ask
if they were aware that things were going wrong at Hillsborough.           I spoke
to the Superintendent who asked me to go down to the scene.


I quickly changed into my uniform and proceeded down to the Leppings Lane
end.     I arrived at Leppings Lane at approximately 1530 hours, where I
parked my car outside the gates.


As I alighted from my car I asked a Policeman where the Control point was,
he did not know.         I went in through the gates and saw approximately 10
bodies laid out by the fence on the right hand side.          I could not find any
Ambulance Officers,       but spotted an Ambulance with a crew just about to
leave for the hospital.        I asked them where everyone was working from but
they did not know.


A Policeman then gave me a young man aged about 14 or 15 years, who was not
breathing.     I tried to resuscitate the boy but it was no use and a doctor
said he was dead.       Another young man was brought to me with chest injuries
who I sat up, he was breathing ok, so I left him with a Policeman and
Policewoman.


I then made my way onto the pitch over the small wall in front of the South
Stand.     I was met by several people wanting help to revive their friends
who were obviously panicking and very upset.


                                                                         /continued

I picked on the nearest one.     I had five or six airways in my bag and
inserted an airway into the casualty and made sure that he was receiving
CPR by a Policeman.
All the bodies I saw were being worked on by either Police or members of
the public and I spent a few minutes giving airways and advice.


I then found out where the Casualty Clearing Point was and went through the
line of Police which was by this time stretched across the pitch.    Bodies
were being carried on boards over to the Gymnasium.    I could not find an
Officer so set about checking people who were sat up around the courtyard,
they all seemed very shocked but reasonably ok.


An Ambulance was parked outside the entrance to the Gymnasium with patients
on board and the attendant in the back and a policeman in the front.      I
radioed Control and told them that a Policeman was driving the vehicle.


After this I entered the Gymnasium itself and was shocked to see all the
bodies laid out along the side wall.   I tried to compose myself and think
what needed to be done.


Doctors and Ambulanceman were treating the injured but I still could not
see an Officer, so I made a quick check of how many people were ready to go
to hospital and went outside.   This is when I saw Station Officer ________
and asked him to get four stretchers into the Gymnasium as they were ready
to go.   This he did.




                                                                  /continued

I went back towards the Gymnasium but was asked to see to a young man who
was in a fit, I found the nearest Ambulance and asked him to take the
patient.    I was then asked to see a young man with abdominal injuries, he
had deep marks across his pelvis and a swelling in his abdomen.           I asked a
Policeman to get an Ambulance for this man as it was potentially very
serious. A doctor then arrived so I left the patient with him.


I re-entered the Gymnasium and spoke to Leading Ambulanceman j__________who
said we need three more stretchers.         I went back outside and informed
Station Officer             who was organising the Ambulances at the gate to
the Gymnasium.     I then assisted Qualified Ambulanceman               to bring a
stretcher   into   the   Gymnasium and   helped   him   to   splint   a man with   a
fractured femur.    He had a drip in his arm and was sobbing because he had
lost his little boy.      I tried to comfort him by saying he was only small
and it would be easier for him to escape the crush.


I helped to load the stretcher and them saw Mr Hopkins who told me to move
an Ambulance which was in the way.        I could not do this as the keys were
not in the vehicle and the crew could not be seen.            I believe it to have
been a Middlewood motor.      I told Mr Dale of this and he went to find the
crew.


I was then met by Ambulanceman             on S203, who had two stretcher cases
on board but had lost his attendant, he asked me to get in the back so that
we could get the casualties to hospital.




                                                                          /continued

I entered the Ambulance and made an examination of the two casualties one
had     rib-injuries    and     difficulty       breathing,     the      other     had       abdominal
injuries.     I noticed that               was having difficulty getting out of the
courtyard    because     Ambulances       were   parked    in   front      of    the     exit.      We
eventually     got     onto    Penistone     Road    and    had     to     cross       the     central
reservation, which we did not want to do in fear of ripping of the sump,
        managed to do this and we were picked up by a Police motor cycle and
taken through the very heavy traffic.


We arrived at the Royal Hallamshire and off-loaded both patients through
the normal fracture entrance.            We did not see any Ambulance Officers at the
Royal    Hallamshire     and    Ambulance     were   stopping       at   the     normal       casualty
entrance,    preventing        further    Ambulances      getting     through      to     the    Major
Incident Entrance.


I ran down to the Casualty entrance and told a Rotherham Crew where to go,
this allowed three Ambulances to unload their patients.


Things seemed to be calming down by this time and we were told to stand by
on Netherthorpe Way.           After 10 minutes or so I remembered that my car was
parked outside the gates at Leppings Lane.


I then asked Control if we could go to Leppings Lane to move my car as it
was a possible obstruction.              This I was allowed to do.              Just as I arrived
at Leppings Lane we were told by Control to report to the Hallamshire to
take a patient from           'B* Ward to King Edward's Hospital.                      I then asked
Control if I could drive my car back to the Hallamshire following 403 this
we did.




                                                                                          /continued

    I parked my car at the Royal Hallamshire and rejoined Ambulanceman           in
    S403.   We then arrived on    'B* road which was blocked by parked cars,
    Ambulances and a taxi.     We then reported to               who asked us to
    take two stretcher cases to King Edwards from Ward F2.    It took us at least
    30 minutes before 'B* road was sufficiently clear for     us to load our two
    patients.


    We conveyed our patients to King Edwards where we were met by a porter who
    had a list of patients and the ward they were for.


    After we unloaded our patients we contacted Control      and were thanked   for
    our efforts and told to return to base and contact Control by land line
    before we went off duty.


    We arrived back at base and cleaned our Ambulances.      I signed off duty at
    1900 hours.


    A point I would like to make is that patients were still being brought      out
    of the Leppings Lane end after I arrived, this was       at least 1530 hours.
    The line of bodies on the right hand      sideby the gate could have been
    brought over the small wall of the South Stand, but this is only a theory.

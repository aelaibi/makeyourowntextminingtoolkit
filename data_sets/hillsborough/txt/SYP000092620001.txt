            Orr~Saturday 13th April        1989 (150489)      I went to the semi final at

            Hillsborough Sheffieia'Nbe tween Livshcgpool and Nottingham Foest. I wen
                        Nf 1 1 0 3
            together with Mr CASE, James CASfc., and xobert SEPHTGN in Hr CASES car

            After     parking the car we got into the ground at around 1.45 pm <1345)

            to 2 oclock       (1400).    We went   in the Leppings Lane end of the ground

            througTT^^yie tunneiL^and into the pen on the right of the end of the

                         I now know tHis     is pen 3.

            He went ri^i^t to the front of the pen and together with James CASE'.

            I stood on the step behind the Perimeter Gate which we thought would

            give us a good view of the match.            Robert SEPHTON stood behind us and

            Mr CASE was to our left looking towards the pitch.                After a time the

            crush behind us got worse with the pressure getting more                intense.   It

            was after the kick off it got really bad and I was pushed really up
                                                                                      PAGE     2

         right against thiKaate and people were shouting to the Policeman who

         was standing on the VtjTj^r side of the gate to open the gate because

         they were being       crushed.     The Policeman didn't seem to know what to do

         and d i d n ’t tak« any action.         He was facing the crowd and just    looking

         at them but doing nothing else.

         Suddenly the gate burslHopen and me and James CASE fell forward onto

         the track.       The Policeman pushed us back with his hands          closing the
                      1           - ■-                    -
         gate at the sarne time.          The pressure was still    intense and by pushing

         us back we were back into the same situation of being               crushed against

         the gate.

         After being crushed for another            couple of minutes the gate sprung

         open again by the pressure against            it.   I am definate the policeman

         d i d n ’t open it.

         By this time there was another two or three Police Officers around the

         gate.     This tirne as we spilled out of the gate a lot of other

         supporters followed us out and we were directed to the outer               pen

         after sitting around the pitch for a snort time.

         I did not receive any injuries            in the crush.

             MINUTES OF A DIRECTORS MEETING HELD IN THE
          CLUB BOARD ROOM ON THURSDAY 29th NOVEMBER 1990


    A letter received from Mr & Mrs P Joynes, who had lost their son in the
    Hillsborough tragedy, asking the club to give the bereaved families moral
    support at the current time while the inquests are taking place in Sheffield,
    and also to finance a private prosecution by engaging a top barrister to
    represent the bereaved against those responsible for the tragedy if a verdict
    of unlawful killing (manslaughter) is returned, was considered. Mr Moss and
    the General Secretary reported on a meeting which they had held with Mr &
    Mrs Joynes, who are still very distressed and angry about the death of their
    son at Hillsborough. It was agreed that the General Secretary speak to Mr &
    Mrs Joynes on the telephone and advise them that, although the Directors are
    totally sympathetic to their situation they regret they are unable to agree to
    finance a private prosecution, which it is estimated would cost at least
    Â£ 1,000,000.00

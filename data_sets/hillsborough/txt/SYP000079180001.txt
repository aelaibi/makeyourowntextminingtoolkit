               I am                              the    licensee         of the H i g h g r e a V e Public Hse              in

               E c c l e sf i el d,    Sheffield-          The    pub    is about      sik miles          from the

               H i l l s b o r o u g h F oo tball    Ground.        I have       been a licensee             for eleven and a

               half      years      and have     spent      eight and a half years at the Highgreave.



               On S a t u r d a y     15 April      1989    (15041989)          I opened      the       pub as normal at

               1130 am       (1130).       This was         the day of the L iv erpool                   ver^tis N o t t i n g h a m

               Forest       semi      final.     On that         day we only had Not t i ng/Kam Forest                      fans   in

               the       pub and      the first      group a r r iv ed at opening o # l m e .                This    group was a

               group of older            tee na ge rs and they stop pe d for a couple                          of drinks and

               then m o ve d on.          There      were about          four    or six     of them.           The    pub

               g r a d u a l l y had about       fifty fans         during      the m o r ni ng         session.       These were

               m i d d l e a ged      people and       families         and they st ay ed all morn in g                until
                                                                                                             PAGE        ;
                                                                                                             S2344

              a bout 2 O ’clock         (1400).       The y were   drinking     s te ad il y and    I was    very

              pl ea se d wit h their          behaviour.     I had no     problems with the          fans,    no

              f ights     or damage      to my    pub.     My takings were          up by about £150.         Nobody

              a s k e d me where      they     could buy tickets.



              £11    of the fans        had    left   by 2 O ’clock    (1400)       and   I think they all         had

              pr ivate        cars.   One     or two fans a sk ed me how        long      it took   by car to get

              to the g ro un d and          I said about     10 m i n ut es   but    they might     have    problems

              trying       to   park.

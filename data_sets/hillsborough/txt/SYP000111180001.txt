                   could see at         this     time    the    crowd was      sparse.        However,       a number    of

                   Liverpool       supporters asked me              if I had any spare           tickets,       and at this

                   early     stage    I began thinking            that a large        number      of supporters appear

                   to be arriving without                tickets,

                   I remember seeing             two serials        of uniform officers            in Leppi n g s Lane

                   controlling        the main       road and superv i s i n g        supporters who were           being

                   humoured at this             stage,    however      I was    still       being a s k e d for spare

                  coaches and buses.                 At this       time a p p r o x i m a t e l y    11.45am the         turnstiles

                  were    open and a few supporters                      started       to enter       the ground.          Each

                  milling        ar o u n d outside     the ground.            A large number             of    these    supporters

                  did not        appear to be taking much notice                       of    the    requests      given by the

                  M o u n t e d Officers.           Traffic movem e n t          was    now getting            very heavy due to

                  s pecta tors       standing        around    in the          roadway.       Efforts          were    being made

                  by the uniform serials and the M o u n t e d Officer                               to   clear       them away.            I

                  At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   1.40pm     I moved my          position from the               chip shop back

                  up to the L e p p i n g s Lane            end.        The    crowd    now milling a r o u n d          in greater

                  Whilst       I was     talking      to supporters             I remember          one fan joined          in tne

crowd not     to    push because          fans at     the     front      of the t urnstiles were

being    crushed.         At    this    point    I saw     Inspector Bennet              standing        on the

see the dismay on their                 faces when they saw the queues                     of fans        still

was    now asking     the Mounted Officers                 to form a line              in the middle        of

            M U e y , and later in the morning DC Askew#

            On taking position at the Leppings Lane end by the blue railings I could see
            at this time the crowd was sparse, However a number of Liverpool supporters asked
            me if I had any spare tickets, and at this early stage I began thinking that a
            large number of supporters appear to be arriving without tickets.
            I remember seeing two serials of uniform officers in Leppings Lane controlling
            the rnain road, and supervising supporters who were being dropped off outside the
            gates. The majority of supporters were good humoured at this stage, however I
            was still being asked for spare tickets from large numbers of supporters who were
            alighting from the coaches and buses# At this time approximatly 11.45am the
            turnstyles were open and a few supporters started to enter the ground. Each
            turnstyle manned by numerous uniformed officers and supervised by Inspector
            Purdy.
            As the afternoon wore on the crowd outside Leppings Lane started to build up
            there was by this time thousands of fans lianging around autside the ground
            asking for spare tickets I was by this time being inandated with requests for
            spare tickets. Mounted officers patrolling Leppings Lane in an effort to move
            on supporters who were milling around outside the ground. A large number of
            these supporters did not appear to be talcing much notice of the requests given
            by the Mounted Officers. Traffic movement was now getting very heavy due to
            spectators standing around in the roadway . Efforts w e r e being made by the
            uniform serials and the Mounted Officers to clear thera away. I walked away
            along Leppings Lane towards Penistone Hoad and stopped outside a. chip shop
            which was full of supporters who were queing on the pavement. A large number
            where drinking beer and lager from cans some were becoming rowdy singing and
            shouting* Whilst I was stood in this position I was again inundated with
            requests for spare tickets.
            At ^pproximatly 1.40pm I moved my position from the chip shop back up to
            the Leppings Lane end. The crowd now milling aroung in greater numbers Mounted
            and Uniform serials now having great difficulty in keeping the road clear.
            Whilst stood in the crowd by the Leppings Lane end I was again inundated with
            requests for spare tickets. Whilst I was talking to supporters I remember one
            fan Joined in the conversation informing me and the other supporters around me
            that if theyofferred the gatemen a fiver they would gain entrance to the ground
            At approxoimatly 2.20pm the crowd in the Leppings Lane area became so dense that
            we had to abandon the pick pocket squad operation due to difficulty in gaining
            access to the crowd. At this a Police Landrover driven by PC Buxton managed to slowl;
            crawl through the crowd with siren activated. The vehicles P A system was used
            to inform the crowd not to push because fans at the front of the turnstyles were
            being crushed. At this point I saw Inspector Bennet standing on the roof of the
            turnstyles assisting young fans over the wall and into the ground* It appeared
            that these supporters were in distress. Other supporters were climbing onto the
            top of the iron railings to escape the crash, they were then walking along the
            railings to the brick wall and from there climbing over into the ground, again
            Inspector Bennet was assisting with this operation* The time now would be approx
            2.ifOpm and there was still thousands of fans coming towards the ground from both
            directions of Leppings Lane. I could see the dismay on their faces when they saw
            the queus of fans still trying to gain entrance to the ground. Y/hilst I was stood
            watching the situation fans still kept asking ne for apare tickets
      The Police Landrover P A system was being used all the time in an effort to stop fane
•pushing and I remember looking towards the entrance of the turnstyles and thinking to myself
.that no fans seem to be going through the turnsyles to ease the congestion* PC Buxton was
 new asking the Mounted officers to form a line in the middle of the crowd to try and stem
 the pushing, this was done however it did not seem to be very effective, the horses appeared
 in distress and one horse I believe ridden by a Mersyside Inspector was nearly pushed over.
At approximatly 2.55jm there was a roar from the crowd inside the ground which obviously
signalled that the teams had appeared on the pitch. It appeared that on hearing the noise the
fans outside became extremly anxious to get into the ground before the kick off. They were
shouting at the Police Landrover and the officer inside requesting admittance into the ground
A message was then heard over the PA system to the effect that the gates would be open
shortly to ease the crush and allow fans to &ee the match*
      At this point I then left the scene with other officers and went to the gymnasium
 situated in the North Statnd* Whilst in the Gymnasium a report came in that the pitch had
 been invaded and people load been hurt. Chief Inspector Beal came into the gym and instructed
 all people present to clear the area and make way for casualties. The area was cleared and
 bodies began to arrive on strtchers and advertising boards* I then assisted in placing the
 todies in I5.ncs and covering them with sheets c f paper* and making sure that uniform pfficers
 stayed with their respective casualties. Later we then assisted, in labelling and bagging the
 bodies* When the bodies had been bagged and labelled I vent with DI Towell and other officers
 back to Ilaianerton Boad Police Station where I assisted with friends and relatives end

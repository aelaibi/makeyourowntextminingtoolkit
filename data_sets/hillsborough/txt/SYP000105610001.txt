     area of Sheffield in a transit van and we would have the call sign 'Bango

     and here we recieved a briefing by senior officers and intelligence officers in relation

     to Mobile patrol ar approadaatly 10*50 a*nu

     On resuing to aobile patrol of the foxhill area of Sheffield I sat in the rear of a
     saall parked police transit van which consisted of two bench type seats that ran the
     length of the tan, there were windows on all sides of the tan and all of these could clearly
     be seen through*,' I w s aware that we were to sake a check of the public houses in the area
     to assess the situation regarding provisions aade far supporters attending due to problems !
     that arose the previous year* At this tiae aost of the public houses were either quiet or
     closed* A particular visit was Bade to the Foahill Public house which is situated on
     Foothill Road in its own grounds cod had problems with supporters last year, this public
     house was visited by my Inspector and a P«,C*
€feaving continued mobile patrol a short tine it was noticed that supporters were arriving in
  the area parking their cars «ad vans on side streets*

     At 11*30 a*a* The Foot Public house was checked and it was clearly seen from the van that it !
     was starting to fill up with Idverpool fans standing outside the pub still within the grounds
     drinking, vehicles were now parking on both sides of the roads and arriving fans were
     proceeding towards both the ground and to the public houses*
  At 12*30 p*at* We vere.directed by radio control to attend nearby Wilcox Hoad il^me’youths
  were reported to be acting in a disorderly manner and urinating in peoples front gardens,
  at the bottom of Vilcox Roadseveral police officers were spoken to regarding this Batter,

  of ilcooc Hoad they reported that they had heard then being abusive and seen then throw      j
  down beer cans but were to far away on foot to be able to approach them* The youths were
  stopped and spoken to, it was fcsnediatley obvious that the youths had all been drinking
  and were in a boisterous nood the youths were strongly advised and pointed in the directio n ■
  of the football ground, on returning to the transit the youths were watched dosesly and
  after travelling a short distance they boarded a South Yorkshire transport public bus
^^ihich Mas travelling in the direction of the football ground*

     full to capacity ancf^n^^Lso^tarfed to drin^f on the public footpaths surrounding The Fox

     consisted mainly of the age group 18 to 21*f several were already the worse for drink and
     cat calling as we paused to exaaine the crowd*
     At 1*00 p*Bo the White Horse public house on Halifax Road was checked and the scene was
     sinilar to that of The Fax with Liverpool fans congregating around the public house?

     the vehicle was folloped to the White Horse public house where it parked up just inside the [
     car park, after a short conversation with the occupants of the van P*C* 333 OQZLVIE who

        All of the suspects remained in the roar of the tan until they were requested by the * \>!-
        Custody Officer to go throgh the rear door at Bcclesfield Police station into the
        charge area, throughout the period that the suspects remained in the transit Tan I
        remained with them supervising their custody, it was whilst I was supervising the suspects
        that I had several conversations with thes and although they had initially appeared
        hostile they did cala down and talk quite freely to pass the tine whilst their:friends
        wore being docusentedo Several consents ware aade which only after the incident appear rel­
        evant to the Hillsborough disa£er« They had asked What wouLt happen if one of thea pleaded
        guilty aad would they be released to feo to the football Match, it was revealed that on
        the youths travelling to Sheffield that only two of thea had initially got tickets for
        the football Match, however one had exchanged his ticket for two enabling three of the
        six to see the gaaey all of the six youths ware aware that at last years football match
        supporters had been able to get into the football ground without tickets owing to the
        rush when the natch was starting*
        At            resuned to sobile patrol in the transit van along with the rest of sjr serial
        excluding P*c* OGILVIE who was dealing with the prisoners* On resuming to ftaxtiill area
        of Sheffield I could hoar that there bad now developed a problewwith fans around the "eppi-
^       ngs Lane end of the football ground and that other officers wore being deployed to the ares
w       I beard s$ Inspector, Inspector KOKEKSON use his personal radio and inform control that
        wo would be able to assist if they required our assistance at that tise we were infarsed
        that other officers were attending the location and we would not be required. We did
        sore closer to the ground around the area at the end of Mappings aae, the next radio
        seepage I hoard Which reported a serious problem was when I heard soseone say they are
        cosing ever the fence which appeared to se that the football ground was being invaded
        by suppo^rters.
        Our Serial then attested at Lappings Lane End of the football ground to find that the area
        was congested with both motor vehicles and supporters cooing away fros the ground there
        was poor reception on the radio and the Messages relayed were difficult understand*
        K" parged up near to the football ground just of the sain road Leppings "ane we waited then
        for our next instruction believing there had been sose sort of incident but not knowing
        the scale, 1 saw several fans as they case away fres the ground shout and swear at officers
        who ware on foot in the area sose wore shoved, the officers accepted sose of the shouts
        but restrained several fans who appeared the worse for drink holding then until they
        appeared calm enough to continue on their way and being advised accordingly*


•       I saw Inspector EOBQWSON leave the transit to find out what he could by visiting the control
        box he had only gone a few yards up the road when I saw his speak to a driver of a motarve-
        hicle Inspector BOBIRSON then got in the vehicle and Moved it to the side of the road
        the driver of the vehicle appeared to have been a doctor who made is way jmmediatly
        towards Ike football ground*
    "It oa» bj a &aall pudu>t~Tftdi5 that 1 Bad with ae listening to the local radio -station \
     when % figot learnt that~fana bad been killed*----
     On inspector BOBIRSON returning we were informed of the serious nature of the incident
     our transit was required as an ambulance and our services were required in the Mortuary
     area, we walked then towards the football ground walking through the rear of the North
     Stand to the gysnasius area there we were asked to form a cordon along with a serial from
     BaxtaOLey and to allow stretchers through with dead and injured as well as nurses,
                   ami other officials, throughout this period I saw sany confused fans, sose wen
     shouting and waving their anas about, others were crying ahd being comforted by what
     appeared their friends and sose other fans ware fighting amongst themselves*
     Several fans did sake very asertive attempts to gain «ntry to the gymnasium mostly the
     worse for drink these were restrained and when calmed dove explained the reasams for not all
     allowing entry they were th«n escorted away from the oatrance of the gymnasium without
     being arrested*

Meabers ofHr serial were asked to assist la asking a had-hoc casualty desk in front of
the gymasiua at the edge of the North Stand Here we obtained details and descriptions
of pissing fans and details of the people concerned they were then asked to cheek their
aotor vehicles and writing phone sabers an their hands of the casualty lines that were
being set up as well as the telephone nunber of ^unaertos Boad police Station regarding any
further developments. Whilst at this desk although aost of the fans cane upset and wc^rried
several were rery angry and agitated fiwiHwg the worse for drink, I recall a snail group
coning upto ae asking ae questions aad a young female in the group who was the worse for
drink asking me “BOW BIG 15 YOUR WILLIE" I was confustd by what she was saying and when
she again spoks to ae she tried to apoligise saying ”1M SORRI I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE LIGHT
OF IT" Later I saw her and her friends reunited with someone they har reported as Kissing

                                                            !^f2eci!O Si,,^ nSa»m

'rom what I can remember 'of the natch, everything went smoothly on the^ day, supprtelrs from ^
jiverpool came to the match in good spirit and in plenty of time to take their place _in the •
Jepping lane end. I cannot recall any situation where the gates were overcrowded|neither_ d x d ^ ^
  see an* attempts by Liverpool supporters to enter the ground by force through the metal gate#,
‘r climbing the walls. The majority of the crowd were well behaved and there were only a s m a l l ’*
 aumber arfivin* carrying intoxicating liquor, M EEk who were ref used entry to the ground. : ,
.hat did strike me on the day was the fact that a lot of the supporters who t_        ^
randered around for a -while and because of not knowing the area well, Public houseS wise, they
rent into the ground early.

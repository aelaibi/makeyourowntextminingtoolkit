             Further to my recollection dated 2nd May 1989 (020589),                                   I was not

              involved in any of the pre-planning for the Cup Semi-Final                                  to be held

             at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April                                1989 (150489).

             My first involvement was when I paraded for briefing at                                   10 am (1000)

             that day in the North Stand.                              This was    conducted by Chief

             Superintendent DUCKENFIELD and it followed the normal format for

             a match of this scale.                           He dealt with a number of issues including

             emergency evacuation procedure,                             ground regulations,       firm but fair

             policing and crowd safety.                              When I say crowd safety he dealt with the

             need to prevent supporters                             climbing fences    pylons,   barriers and up into

             the West Stand,                          he also mentioned about       inflateables and allowing them

             into the ground.                           I do not recall him mentioning specifically the need

             to monitor the crowd capacities around the ground,                                  but then it was an
all ticket game and there should not have been the need to do this,                                    the

ground being designed to hold the number of people to which tickets had

been sold.

Taking this a stage further,                      I had regularly performed duty on the

track,     at Hillsborough for a period of about two years as well as

performing duties                 in other      parts of the ground mainly at the Leppings

Lane end.             The majority of the Serial working with me were Community

Constables from Hammerton Road who also                          regularly performed duty on the

perimeter track for all games, although they were supplemented by five

other officers from Hammerton Road who had some experience of working

the area.             These officers by virtue of their experience and knowledge

of the ground are used to monitoring                          crowds of all sizes as a matter of

course and to respond accordingly where they noted any problem.                                   So

again I w o u l d n ’t expect Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD to have

addressed             the matter           in the briefing.

Following             completion of the briefing              I then spoke     to Inspector DARLING

and as a result of that conversation what had been said by Chief

Superintendent DUCKENFIELD at the briefing,                              my knowledge of the match

order and my previous experience,                       I briefed my serial        in regard to

their duties.             I have never previously been briefed myself at a

football match in regard to the need to m onitor supporters from an

overcrowding            point of view and consequently I did not brief my Serial

to that effect.              My briefing was more directed towards                  people climbing
V -                                                                 ..   '                  ...

into the West Stand,                 pitch invasions and preventing public disorder

generally             in order that the general           public can enjoy the          match.

Subsequent to that,                 I,had a conversation with one              of the   other

officers,       I cannot now recall who that was,                        but I am satisfied that it

w as an Inspector or above and he informed me during a g e n e ral

conversation that Superintendent GREENWOOD was not happy a b out the

         ground.                This was related to the fact that it was an all ticket match,

         the tickets had been sold and to move these supporters elsewhere was

         going to create overcrowding               in that area.   No mention was made of

         overcrowding that had occurred at the Cup Semi Final                in 1981   (000081).

                     I left home at about               10 .15am (1015)             on the 151h ApriI    1989 <150489)

                     for the Hillsborough match at Sheffield and I caught a ta;;i outside to

                     Lime Street Station on my own.



                     I support Liverpool F.C. and 1 got the ticket for the match from

                     Anfield I paid £8 for it for the season ticket holders at Liverpool

                     The ticket was for the Leppings Ln terrace at Sheffields Ground.



                     The tr<(iin I caught was an official supporters which was laid on as an

                     extra.                                 ,




                     The train was full and it arrivWi in Sheffield at about 2.00pm                                   (1400)

                     There were no fans drinking on the\train when I travelled down and

            w he n    I wa l k e d to the ground,



            I only saw a few               lads    drinking    but there was        no signs        of drunkeness.

            There      was    no disorder          or any fighting        from the        trains    to the ground.



            We were       escor                     ong    line of    police and     police        on horseback       that

            e s c o r t e d us from the           stat i o n to the ground,



            There was         no hold ups^ a n d we all             got   to the ground entrance at about
So,a.       2.10pm      (1410)       at the Lepplsjpgs Lri entrance.

 I—    L_

            All      the faiik were         queuing       in an orderly manner and there was               no

            crushing         or    push'N-tfg at    that    time.



            I left      the       police    escort at the bottom of the hill and there were                           only

            a few h u n d r e d fa n s q u e u :i.n y at that         tune.



            The      gates    to the outer          perimeter       of the grounds were open            (the blue

            iron      railings)       and there was only one               p o l iceman    I could see there

            u s h ering      the    people    t t u . r n s t i l e s .

            1 don't       recall      seeing any stewards             on duty outside         but    there may      have

            been«



            I wasn't         searc h e d but       I went    straight      through the stiles without any

            trouble.

                 The    police were             body sear ching most              of the       fans going    in and this

                 se e m e d to be making               the       crowds   get    bigger    outside    the ground.



                 When    I went        into      the    ground all          I could s e e N u ifront      of me was       the

                 I saw a policeman a n d w o m a n searching                          someone and a couple          of stewards

                 just    passed the t urnstiles                     selling some        programmes.



                 T he r e was     no one         giving          directions w hi c h way to go so            I went       straight

                 towards       the tunnel.



                 There    seemed to be a lot of                      people wan d e r i n g      around   inside    the ground

                 infront       of the stands at that                      time and     I don't     know whether       they were

                 look :i.ng about          f or direct ions where                to go,    but this seemed unusuai «



                 The    big    like w o o d en gates               to the    left as you went          through     in the

                 turnstiles,             into    the    terraces were            open and       I d i d n ’t notice any other

                 gates    open.



                 I c o u l d n ’t see anyone             climbing          over the walls at that            time or anyone

                 getting       in for       free



                 My ticket was t ^ken at                     the    stiles and        I went     down the tunnel

I remember        seeing a big           bloke     pushing    passed the     crowds at    this     time

an d    passed me.



He     seemed    to be panicking and he was shouting,                     "Please     let me out,

Please       let me out" and he must                have    come from the front        of the

terraces at Pen 3 where                   I was.



I. stopped about           h a l f - w a y down with the       railings     on my     left and the

crowds       started      building        up and up as the          time went   on.



I held onto the fence,                   face   on, with my     right    shoulder towards         the

p it c h .



3: saw the       players       coming      onto the    pitch and at this         time the       crowds

crush was        getting       very bad and         I was    pushed g r a d u a l l y towards    the

f r ont      of the    ter r a c e s .



One     lad grabbed me a ro u n d the              neck with his arm and         I had to       push him

off     to see    the match,         he was grabbing          the    railings with me and         I think

he was       trying     to push back to keep the               pressure     off his girlfriend.



Be f o r e   the m atch had star t e d           I could see a lot more          people    being

pushed        in the    pen    infront      of me at Pen 4 and all           of a sudden        it seemed

to     be solid and no one               could move.



Peo p l e were        shouting and screaming               just as    the m a t c h started.



There were        people       in the      crowds    shouting       "Get onto the Pitch".

I was     unable      to move,       and    I was       pushed hard against           the   railings and         I

hung    on for       dear    life.



If I had     let go of the            railings          I w ould have     been     pushed down to the

front and       I was       better    off    being      side    on to the        crowd.



I saw     people      infront    of me with 'their eyes                 closed and        passing    out.



I remember        seeing      one man behind me with                  his eyes     closed being        pushed

about w ith the         crowd and          he was       still   standing    up.



The man was a middle a ged man stocky build with short                                    hair    light    brown

in colour and he was wearing a grey w i n d c h e a t e r                        jacket.



I never     saw him a g a i n        but he may have gone               down with the         crowd or gone

u nder.

I w ould have         just stop p e d where             I was



There was a lot of scream ing                     from the      crowd arid panicking             I saw some

of the     lads standing         on the fencing             shouting      to the      people      to get    back

but    no one     could move,         it was       so    packed.



I c o u l d n ’t see what was          going       on at the front         of the terraces with the

fencing     but      I was    stuck    to the       fencing      until about 3. 4 0 p m          (1340)    until

I could move.           I remember          this    because      I was    looking      towards      a clock

at the     side      of the stands.

          I d o n ’t think      people      realised what was          going        on.



          The    only tannoy armmjcernentN I heard was                   that       saying       "Get off the

          what was " g o Y H ^ o n ,    and at that time          it was       no use because          people were

          not taking any notice              they were too afraid.



          I wal k e d    out through the ti*H{ie\, at about 3 . 4 0 p m                   (1540)   and w a l k e d   up

          into    the    stands    to    look what was going            on.     1 didn't          really know what

          was    happening at that           time and       I went     there    to see       if I could get a

          dr i rtk.



          At that       time,   it was      chaos      on the   pitch and       I saw the          line of    police

          a cross     the    pitch?     I remember seeing the amb u l a n c e               corning onto      the

          pitch and fans          running        over with hoarding           for    stretchers.



          I left      the g round thro u g h tha ground towards                     the e i t to the

          turnstiles.



          I saw one         lad being     carried out        towards     the stiles and he was                put down

          arid given heart mass a g e             by police officers.



          I saw a lot of a g g r e s s i o n          towards the Police as               I walked    from the

          g round and        I saw one s te w a r d grabbed           by a fan       in the stands.          There

          were    fans      spitting and         threatening     police       they seemed very a n g r y and

          were    shouting at them but                I d i d n ’t see any fights.



          When    the m atch was         stop p e d    it was just      chaos       for    sometime    the    police

          d i d n ’t know what was         going       on at first      even the Forest             fans   started

          chanting       but a f t e r wa rd s    they started        clapping       the    lads that were

               taking      down the h o a rdings and      carrying   the    people   off the    pitch,



               I think       that't'Kere w a r n 't enough Police     or Stewards      on duty    it was

               totally       badly o r ga ni se d and the Liverpool        fans were   given the wrong

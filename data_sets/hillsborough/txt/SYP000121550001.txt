            I am Trevor Higgins,

                       Rotherham.

            Until July 1983 (000788)          I was a Police Sergeant   in the South

            Yorkshire Police stationed at Wombwell,           of Barnsley Division.

            On Saturday 9 April          1988 (090488)   I was detailed.to supervise a

            serial    of constables      performing duty at Hillsborough Football

            Stadium.     The two football       teams taking part were Liverpool and

            Nottingham Forest.                     -

            The serial was delegated duty at the rear of the West Stand and in
                                     /
            particular to control         fans entering   pens 3 and 4, that is the centre

            pens of the stand.

            During the game and because of the amount of fans within pens 3 and

            4,   I received instructions        to close the gates to the entrance and

            thereafter direct fans to the two outer pens of the stand.               I cannot

            recall where the instruction came from.            Under normal   circumstances

            instruction came from a Serial          Inspector or via radio + rom control.

            I cannot say from which the instruction came.

            Bearing    in mind the time lapse and having attended several matches at

            Hillsborough,       it is difficult to relate detail      regarding this

        particular match.   *   .

I am writing on behalf of Lord Justice Taylor to thank you for
the warm welcome extended to us during our visit to Ibrox last
Saturday.

Lord Justice Taylor was particularly grateful for the opportunity
to discuss with you personally matters of interest, and for the
very informative briefing provided by Mr Dickson.   I know that he
found Mr Dickson's presence throughout the   day invaluable and I
should be grateful if you would pass on my   own personal thanks £ 0
him for setting aside so much of his time to accompany us and
answer our numerous questions. May I ask you to pass on our
thanks to Inspector Torrance Dempsey for ensuring our smooth
transfer to and from the airport.

Finally, I look forward to seeing you again on      our return to
Scotland next week.

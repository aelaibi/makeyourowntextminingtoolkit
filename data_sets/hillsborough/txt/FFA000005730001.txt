 2.     I was invited to attend at a meeting of the challenge
Cup Committee on Monday the 20th March at 11.30.a.m. to
decide the venues for this year's F.A. Cup Semi-Final.                        I
have attended at such meetings for nine years»

(likely v e n u e s » In my view there were only four venues worthy
of consideration^              These were Hillsborough and Villa Park
and Old Trafford and Maine Road in Manchester.                    In— my-id.ewr-

      5.        I spoke to Graham Kelly shortly before the meeting
      began.         I told him that in my personal view Villa Park and
      Hillsborough were the best suited grounds.                             It would not
      have been fair to make Norwich City travel to Hillsborough
      and so Villa Park was the obvious mid-way point between
      Everton and Norwich.                 If West Ham had beaten Norwich it
      would not have been fair to make West Ham travel to
      Hillsborough. jEhat left Liverpool and-Nottingham Forest.

      had exactly the same match the year before and the general
      opinion was that it was well organised- -{-Bid: you a L Leiid? IT"

               J —had als g. read a report from Ken Evans,                     (a security

      he was before his retirement, Assistant Chief Constable at
    ^fche West Midland's Police and had been personally

      8.       I had visited Hillsborough last                         year prior to the
     semi-final between the same teams as                              this year and had seen
     the police operations in the control                              room and had spoken in
     detail with the secretary as to how the arrangements would
     be carried out.              I did not take notes of my meetings but I
      left with a very favourable impression.                            I also toured the

s e c r e t a r y at the F.A. that the police were happy and that
tJ'nexe were two separate routes into each end of the ground
a t;      Hillsborough so that supporters could be kept apart.
T l^etre were no traffic problems last year and why alter a
gy s t e m that had worked so well?               Exactly the same teams had
^ e n       involved.


10 .        Ernest Brown the Chairman of the Challenge Cup
C o minittee and I were both agreed on the venues and it was a
joint: recommendation.              A quick vote was taken and there were
nQ        dissenters.


^     o     I was not aware at the time the decision was taken or
pr ior       to this, of any complaint from Liverpool®

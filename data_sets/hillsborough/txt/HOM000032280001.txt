HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY


Thank you for your letter of 27 May.

I note that you do not wish for your letters of 26 August and 3 December 1997 to Mr Bone,
Secretary to the scrutiny, to be released, and I can confirm that we shall not do so.

Your letter also refers to the transcript of your meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. The purpose
of my letter of 27 February was to inform you of the release of the transcript and to request your
agreement to the disclosure of the correspondence mentioned above. Consequently, the transcript of
your meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is among the material already placed in the House of
Commons Library. I apologise for any misunderstanding my earlier letter may have caused.

Yours sincerely




M J Pyne

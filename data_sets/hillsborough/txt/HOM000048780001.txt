 Paul

 I am not happy with the conclusion w e reached in our discussion yesterday.        You thought I should
 write to the BBC, as Secretary to the Scrutiny, to find out w h a t objection they would have to the Home
 Secretary publishing their tapes of the Hillsborough disaster.

  I have a number of problems with this. First, there is some nasty stuff on these tapes and albeit that
  some families w a n t, or say they w a n t, to see it the BBC are quite likely to be hammered if it ever gets
  into the public domain.     I have some sympathy with their desire that this should not happen. Th ey
  cooperated with us quite happily and I do not w a n t to be seen to be putting them under pressure on
) this.

 Second, the BBC tapes are not 'n e w evidence'. Taylor had them & so did the W est Midlands police
 investigators acting for the Coroner.     LJ S-S has seen parts of them (& I have seen them in full) but
 they will probably not be figuring at all in his report apart from one or tw o references to the parts of
 them which got into the compilation tape of the disaster.

 The Home Secretary said that he would publish 'all the evidence' which the Judge considers. But the
 Judge has for instance read the entire transcript of Lord Taylor's Inquiry and several months w orth of
 daily transcripts from the Coroners Court.      Are w e going to publish all that too?  Surely the position
 is that the Home Secretary will publish all the n e w (or allegedly new) evidence - this is the basis on
 which w e are proceeding.     If so there will be no need to publish the BBC material.

 Third, if the BBC tapes are published it will not be LJ S-S, or the 'Scrutiny', that does so but the Home
 Secretary.     I think th a t any letter to the BBC about their possible publication should come not from
 the Judge or me but from the Home Office.          The Judge shares this view .

 I attach a draft which you or Peter might care to send. There is also a rejigged version of the Judge's
 letter to Joe Benton M P on which I should be grateful for any further comment.

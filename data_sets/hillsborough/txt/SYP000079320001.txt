                I. have       read the    proof       of evidence of

                April     1989       190489 and       I agree and        co/cur with e verything         stated

                therein.            However,    I w ould add thatr I verily              believe that      the m aj or it y

                of the        people    i n vo lved   in the     crush outside         turnstile B to

                the Lep pi ngs Ln sect io n of the                    ound had tickets.           I saw no evidence

                of a ny s pectators            not having tickets.              In the    crush outside          turnstile

                8 I was f r i gh te ne d        particularly when my two friends                  had a l r ea d y got

                th ro ug h the turnstiles and entered the ground and I was                             crushed

                a ga in s t    the wall.       At     that   time    I was     fearful for my safety as               I was

                crushed up against              the wall and was having               d i ff ic ul ty breathing.          I
                                                                                                                   P AGE           2
                                                                                                                   S235S

w i s h e d to myself           that    the Police and/or               stewards         would open the gates

in order          to    relieve       the    crush.      I remember          that    the a nnouncer             over      the

loudspeaker was                requesting       the Liverpool            syuporters to stop              pushing.              I

was      hoping        that he w ou ld announce                that tjjne start of the game                   had been

de la ye d to a l 1ow the              spectators       into the ground safely.

Jhe      gate     I saw o pe ned was           immediately/to            the    right after           entering

turn st il e 8.           I saw the gate             being     apened by one             p o 1 i ceman and anot he r

person who             I b elieved to" be a”T                   t        e           ^         ^              of    peop!e

o utside        the gate and as              I feared    fa.    rush of people            I i mmediately went

towards         the tunnel        f o 11owing m ^ / f ri en d Mark D U C K W O R T H .              11 was a

natural         instinct        to head towards           the tunnel           because      that      is the first

ent ra nc e       that faces y ou after               entering         the turnstiles.              If for         reasons

that      I cannot        e xplain      1 said to the others                 to head to the

corner s ection of the ground.                         I mmediately after                entering      the g ro un d           I

was      relieved that           I had got out of the                  crush as      1 felt        fa in t,    my ribs

S h o r t l y after       the k i " k       off I n oticed that           the s pectators were                  c l i m b i ng

out of the             central    s ection of the Leppings Ln staynding area                                  into the

a dj ac en t areas.            The     next    thing    I noticed were              spectators         climbing

onto      the     pitch over          the fence       between the         ground and the              pitch.

I ni ti al ly the P olice were                 trying     to stop the s pe ct a t o r s             from getting

onto      the     pitch.       Later,        however,
                                                                         \ /

up onto the fences and helping                         peopie       climb up awer the fence a nd out

of the g round onto               the       pitch.     The      next    thing/I      remember         is a Police

O ff ic e r     running        onto    the    pitch and the game/was                 stopped.          There were,

however,          a lot of P ol ic e          standing ar ou nd .appearing to do nothing                             or

a ss is t     spectators         in any way at all. \ l/then noticed that a number                                        of

Po l ic e     e ntered the terracing.                  I then noticed            that bodies were

a c t u a l l y being man h an dl ed out of the ground and onto                                the     pitch.

T he y    looked        like    rag dolls.           I w i t n es se d a large           number     of spectators

lying        on the    pitch    including young            children               receiving      heart massage

and the kiss of             life.      I saw a number              of spectators               climbing    out      of

the g round walk onto the                 pitch where         they a pp e a r e d to collapse                  onto

the    pitch.         There a p p e a r e d   to be two different                         reactions   from the

Po li ce Officers.             Some Police Officers were                         obv io us ly aware       of the

u rg en c y of the s it uation and were                   rushing          to assist.            However,      other

O ff ic er s were me re ly standing watching                            not a ss isting at all.

I believe         the behaviour         of the supporters                  on the           pitch who were

as si s ti n g    in the     rescue deserve           credit.             It was the s pectators who

s t a r te d tearing        up the advert is in g          hoardings                to use as make        shift

st retchers arid not the Police                 or any of the other                          ernergency services.

I saw no evidence              of fighting      between the s pectators                         or the Police            or

any other e me rg en cy services.                    I saw no evidence                      of the spectators

pick     pocketing any of the victims                     or urinating                    on Police Officers.

I saw that         some s pectators were angry at the Police and were                                      trying         to

o rganise        them and make        them    react       to the sit ua ti on and assist                      the

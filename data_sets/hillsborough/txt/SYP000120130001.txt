                             At 12.10 pm that day as a serial w e w e r e deployed to the turnstiles

                             arrival into Penistone Road several Nottingham fans were gaining

                             entry into the ground (East terracing - Spion Kop ) .

initially.    During this period several fans were seen carrying ’4                                       i

packs'of alcohol and when informed of the facts that entry would not                                      j

The turnstiles which we.worked w«r« not particularly busy and whilst

speaking to fans lt*%as evident that some youths from Liverpool                             had           j

come t o ’the ground without tickets when asked why they had come                           to            j

the ground they said they wanted to buy tickets from ’touts’.                                             j

At about 2.55pm as a serial we were told to l e a v e t h e t u r n a t i l e g on                        j

Fenistone Road an4 go to the gymnasium.                   At this tim« there were very
few supporters trying to gain access into the Spion Kop and the

jPenlstohe Road end was clear.                                          “X T T                            j

On arrival at the gymnasium we were ^directed to the Leppings Lane end                                    |

of the ground.     We went there by walking in front of the North #tan4/                                  |

towards the Leppings Lane end.         As we approached that end                   pf the                 j
g^pund I sai|^eople climbing over           the   fencing and sitting              on theedge         j

of the pitch.     It appeared to be a 'pitch invasion'.                   I was not         in

if»#isessipn of a radio and did not know what was being said over                           the           j
■radio-.                                          .            :

The football match was still in play but as I got to the terracing

end we were told to form a cordon on the goal line to prevent fans

spilling onto the pitch.

During this time the football match was stopped and as more and more                                      !

fans climbed over the fencing it was apparent that something more                                         ,

serious than a pitch invasion was taking place.

The fans who were coming onto the pitch appeared slightly                          injured,               ,

some were limping others holding their bodies.                     The injured persons

were directed to an area onto the pitch in front of the North stand

where the first aid people were.

 At this time we were stood in front of pen 4 and then assistance was

 given to people climbing over the fence and through the gate in the

 fencing near to this pen.       As the crowd cleared it was apparent that

 some people had collapsed and I saw one male in thg ’^ l i v pf .the

 terracing, several officers were giving artificial respiration to, him

 and in an effort to get the body out of the terracing with other

 officers t commenced to kick down the fencing.

./As     wa s nearly complete an ambulance arrived and I with another

 officer went to the ambulance and got a stretcher.        The fifcale person

 was dead and could not be resuscitated.       He was placed on the

 streteh<&r and taken back to the ambulance.

 I returned to the fencing and saw several other bodies on the

 terracing in pen 3.   By this time the crowd had e i t h i f e c ^ e onto the

 pitch or moved back up the terracing.       Officers and civilians were

 bringing the bodies onto the pitch.       Some were being resuscitated and

 when it was apparent that they were dead I assisted with other

 officers and fans to carry the dead bodies to the gymnasium.

 On return when it was apparent that no further help was needed or

 required as the pitch was clear of bodies, I walked amongst the fans

 on the pitch giving help when needed but du§ to the shock of people

 there was not very much any person could do.

 After the match was abandoned I took some property to the kiosk on

 the Spion Kop, a bottle of spirits I had taken from a Nottingham fan

 on his entry to   the ground.

 On return again   with the serial I went to the area behind the Vest

 stand with other officers.

 We were then told to return to our vehicle and went on mobile patrol.

 My initial thoughts   on the matter were that by the time      our serial

 had attended at   the Leppings Lane end, the incident had      happened and

 the assistance we gave was what we thought was right.
              Aft^r the first order to make a cordon there was no supervisory

              orders fiveri, everyone did what he thought was right.                                                The shock of

              seeing dead bodies at a football match was overwhelming but as I have

               said after the initial shock everyone got on with giving what

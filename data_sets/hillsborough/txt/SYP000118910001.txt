Inspector             Purdy.

Th e     pre-match Police                   briefing          was       given      in the N o r t h S t a n d             (Kop end)

Immediately                following            the    briefing,             I sought         out all       the a b o v e        na m e d

I spoke          to    each        of     the    Inspectors             and mentioned               points       which      I

considered             to     be     of    particular             importance            as    far   as     their      own area          of

As         pe op l e    started         to     e n t er    the       stadium          1 c o u l d see           the      u s ua l       mixture

of         supporters.               They were            in g o o d       spirits           and    obviously               looking

forward               to w h a t     had      been    forecast             as    an    interesting                 g am e     between                the

tw o           teams.

Shortly after                   2.15         p.m.    I visited Leppings                       Lane where               I spoke            to

Inspector               Sykes.          There        was       a contingent              of L i v e r p o o l          supporters

standing               in L e p p i n g s      Lane       on the       opposite              side     of th e          road         to the

stadium.                We     discussed            the m e r i t      of       encouraging              these         people           across

the            road    to     queue     for     entry          to    the    stadium.               Many       of      these        were

openly             drinking          from      cans       of    beer       and     lager;          they were             not       at     this

time            causing        any    trouble.             After       d i s c u s s i o n we a g r e e d              that         such a

course             of a c t i o n wa s         not     necessary            as    there was              a    reasonable                quantity

of         supporters            already         forming            queues       outside           the       turnstiles.

Furthermore,                   it w a s       considered             that       to m o v e     these          people          at     this

stage            may     inflame        the      crowd.

apparent          that       a    l a rg e     number         of L i v e r p o o l        supporters           were        sti ll

outside        the      ground           in L e p p i n g s        Lane       and     in the      queues         to    the

turnstiles.                 I n o t i c e d at          this       t im e     that     the      proportion            of    supporters

who    ha d    obviously               been       drinking             increased.            T h e y we re,       however,             at

this     time       only         a minority             and were             not     causing any          distruption.                 Many

of    the     f a ns    who       arrived were                unsure          of    the    geographical               layout        of      the

turnstiles             which        g av e     admittance               to    the    North       St an d,      the L e p p i n g s          Lane

terraces          and       elevated           section and                the W e s t      Stand.         T he    signs          above

the    turnstiles                were       not    clea r         and m a n y       fans     were     c o n f u s e d , a specific

example        of      this       w as      the a l p h a b e t i c          character          displayed above                  the

turnstile           and      the a l p h a b e t i c          character              shown      on the      ticket          as    the

gangway        to      be    used        for a c c e s s          to    the    West       Stand were           in a p p a r e n t

conflict.              It    wa s      necessary             for       Police        O f f i c e r s to   give        constant

assistance?            in    t hi s      r e sp ec t.

At    approximately                2.30        p.m.      I could             see    that     difficulties              were       being

experienced             in the           build      up to          the       turnstiles         which were             allocated              to

the    N o r t h S t a n d , the W e s t                Stand and             the    Leppings         Lane       turnstiles              --

all    these        three         locations             are       fed     from Leppings             L a ne .      From       this

point       until       after          3.00       p.m.       I continued             to m o n i t o r     and     supervise              the

Leppings          Lane       end       of    the    ground          on the          outside.

I w as      with       Inspector             Sykes       when        he        caused       the f l o w           of       traffic            to       stop

in L e p p i n g s      Lane        in o r d e r        to    facilitate             more       opportunity            for       the     ever

increasing             pedestrian              traffic            to m a k e       progress.

I h av e      considerable                  experience             of P o l i c i n g      this     particular              area and               I

case     and      there          appeared          to    be       larger       numbers.           The     o p e r a t i o n was

frustrated more                   so     by the         presence             of a    considerable              number        of     fans

entitled           them admission                      to    the S p i o n K o p           and attempted                 to    s ee k

legitimate              tick^Ts^ far               that       area.

The      situation               outside          the       turnstiles,              particularly                 those       leading          to

th e L e p p i n g s         Lane       terraces,             was     such          that       toy a p p r o x i m a t e l y       2.40       p.m.

a situation                 ha d a r i s e n w h e r e b y           there          was    a    l arge       crowd       of    supporters

who      w e r e all         pushing          towards          the        turnstiles                but     the    turnstiles             could

not      accept         them       quickly             enough        to       permit       entry          to the      ground.             The

mood      of      this       crowd was             changing           from a good                   natured        crowd       to a

frustrated              crowd who             could          perhaps           see     that         they had        little          chance          of

gaining           access          prior       to       the    start           of    the m a t c h .          The    proportion                of

spectators              who      had     been          drinking           i n c r e a s e d as         time       progressed            but

they were              outnumbered                by    pe o p l e    wh o         d i d not        exhibit        any    signs         of     dr i n k

Within         this         crowd       there          were    at     l e as t       two       or    three        Police       horses          wh o

were      attempting               to    stop          the    pu s h i n g .         It    has       always        b e e n my

experience              t ha t     horses          are       able     to       control          such a situation,                    but       it

was      obvious            in t hi s        instance          that           t hi s w a s      not       the     case.

A F’o^^l^c^ C o n s t a b l e                was       allocated              to    the    outside           of    each       of    the

turnstiles              for       the L e p p i n g s         Lane        terraces.                 These       officers           were       given

the      task      of       preventing             supporters                 entering          the       ground      in p o s s e s s i o n

of w e a p o n s ,          banners,          alcohol          etc.            This       searching             action        did    not

im p e d e     the      rate       of    flow          of    spectators              through           the      turnstiles.

Because           of    the       intense          pressure           from          the    surging           crowd,       it was

necessary              to w i t h d r a w         those       officers              from       that       position?           a decision

taken        by    Inspector             Pu r d y ,         which     I fully             supported.

With a view                 to    reducing             the    area        covered          by       the P o l i c e      horses,          I

instructed              officers             to    cl o s e    the        gates        w h i c h are         situated away                from

the      turnstiles               next       to    the       river        -    I did       this        because        fans         were       using

t hi s    gate         to    get       around          the    h or se s.

T he     c r u sh w i t h i n         the      crowd was          such        that        people were             suffering              and

there       was       the       possibility              of   severe          injuries           taking          place.            I sa w       two

or     three      bodies             of y o u n g     persons           passed        over       the    head        of m e m b e r s           of

the      crowd,        these          people         either       had,        or w e r e        close       to    fainting.

At     approximately                  2.45      p.m.       I rejoined              Inspector           Sykes        in L e p p i n g s

Lane      a n d we         adopted a strategy                     of     farming           a    line    of P o l i c e            horses        at

the      rear     of       the       crowd with a view                   to     preventing             the       queues           at    the

turnstiles             becoming             larger.           This       took       s om e      time    to a r r a n g e .              There

were      gaps        between           one     Police        horse       and       the        next    one       and     I attempted

to a r r a n g e       for a P o l i c e             Officer        to     'piug * e a c h gap.                   Many        supporters

approached             t hi s        line      and    forced        their way              t h r o ug h , despite                 firm

advice         not     to       do    so.       I even        saw a su pporter                   crawl       under           the       belly        of

a, h o r s e    in o r d e r          to    breach        the     line.

I could         see        that       s om e    people        were       climbing              over    the       to p    of       the

turnstiles             in o r d e r         to g a i n a d m i t t a n c e          to     the    stadium and                 at       one

point       I rec a ll           seeing         Inspector           Bennett           ("F*       Division)              on    t o p of         the

wall      above        the       turnstiles              serving         th e      Leppings           Lane       terraces.

Some      minutes           l ater         I attempted            to     contact           Police       Control              by    r ad i o     but

could       not       do    so?       there      appeared           to    foe a f a u l t         w it h my         particular                 radio

could       not       transmit.                I approached              Police           Constable          Buxton           who       wa s    at

t hi s    time        in a F o l i ce L a n d r o v e r .                This       vehicle           was    parked           in L e p p i n g s

Lane      and     the       officer            was    giving        instructions                 to    the       supporters              by

means       of a       public           address          sy s t e m .     He       wa s    urging       the       spectators                 not

to     push     forward.                I requested             Police          Constable             Buxton       to        suggest           to

' c o n c e r t i n a ’ gates,            k n o w n as      ’A',      ’B ’ a n d        " C ’ , had        been        opened           and

t h at   a     lar ge        proportion          of    the      crowd        surged       forward            through             these

g at e s .        These       gates       were    only         opened       for     a    short        period           of      time        and    1

could        see     officers/stewards                    at    the       rear    of     the     gates           apparently

struggling              to    close       them,       which         they    were        subsequently                  able       to     do.

It     is m y      impression             that    gate         'C * r e m a i n e d      open        for     a    longer            period

than     the       others.           As    a    result         of    this     action          the     pressure              on      the

turnstiles              reduced       although            supporters             were     s t i ll      arriving               at     the

g ro u n d .       This       action       clearly          ha d     the     result       of     easing           the       tension

outside           the    turnstiles             although            the     crowd       there        were        still         pushing

forward.

A short           time       later,       I would         estimate          just        after        3.00        p.m.       there          w as   a

request           for    all    officers          to a t t e n d          inside        the     ground           to    d ea l       w i t h an

apparent           invasion          of    the    surface            playing        a r e a.         I did        not       hear        the

specific           ra d i o    transmission               but       I did    hear        officers            around            me     saying

words        to    the       effect       of    "all      officers           inside       -     pitch        invasion".

I immediately                 attended          inside         the    ground        and went            to       the     rear         of    the

goal     at       the L e p p i n g s      Lane       end      of    th e   stadium.             I could              see      t ha t

people         were      trapped          and    t ha t     the      gates       from     the        centre           p en s     were       open

and      people         were    coming          through         them.         There       was        considerable

c o n f u s io n .       Some       supporters            we r e c 1 imbi ng            ov er    th e      f e n c e s , t h ey w e r e

assisted           in the       general          activity            of     lifting       injured and a pparently

dead      people         from       the    Leppings            Lane       terraces        onto        the        playing            area.         I

wa s     present         at    this       location          prior         to a     'private*            ambulance

arriving.               I gave       instructions               to    some       officers            in a n a t t e m p t             to

co-ordinate              what       was    happening.                I can       r ec a l l     in    particular

             A   s h o rt    time      later       I attended       at    the    gymnasium       situated        inside      the

             stadium.             I was    there        concerned        in the     organisation         of a t e m p o r a r y

             mortuary.            My    primary         tasks    were     ensuring       that    each    victim       brought

             inside         was   examined         by a d o c t o r      to    confirm       death,    and    to a l l o c a t e   an

             which     would        fo l l o w .

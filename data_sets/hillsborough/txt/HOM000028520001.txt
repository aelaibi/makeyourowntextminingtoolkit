         BEHAVIOUR OF EVERTON SUPPORTERS AT THE SEMI-FINAL ON 15 APRIL 1989

         You will recall that I mentioned to yourself and   Lord Justice Taylor that
         I was on duty, in uniform, on horse back, at the   above semi-final. I
         expressed my concern about aspects of that event   which reflected
         similar behaviour to the Liverpool supporters at   Hillsborough.

         I have asked my senior officers who attended that match to supply me
         with appropriate statements on their observations of what occurred.
         Enclosed are three statements which make interesting reading. I was
         positioned in Witton Lane, Aston from 1430 hours onwards and vouch for
         the accounts given by my three officers. I would only add that, in my
         opinion, I had not previously experienced dealing with supporters in
         such great number who had consumed so much alcohol. Consequently the
         accounts that I have read on Liverpool supporters behaviour at
         Hillsborough show some remarkable coincidences which may indicate some
         Liverpool characteristic.

         I forward herewith information and relevant statements.

          I am Chief Inspector Turner Officer in Charge of the West Midlands Police

          Mounted Branch. On Saturday 15th April 1989, I was on duty at Villa Park

          Football Ground, Birmingham as the Officer in Charge of a contingent of

          20 Mounted Officers sent to assist police the football Semi Final between

          Everton and Norwich. The Mounted Officers were posted around the ground

          as follows, six Officers to "K" Block turnstiles, Trinity Road, six

          Officers to "LM Block turnstiles, Witton Lane and six Officers to "R&S"

          Block, Witton Lane. Norwich Supporters used the 16 turnstiles at "K"

          Block and Everton Supporters used the 10 turnstiles at "L" Block and all

          the turnstiles at R&S Block situated in V/itton Lane. While the queues

          at the various turnstiles were light the Mounted Officers were instructed

          to patrol in the near vicinity to their respective turnstiles and also

          escort supporters from Witton Station, Aston Station and the coach parks.

          Two Mounted Officers were also posted to patrol the perimeter of the

          ground to assess and report any large crowds or problems.

          All Officers on Mounted duty were on post at 1330 hours for a 1500 hours

          Kick Off. From 1330 hours a steady flow of Norwich Supporters were

          admitted to the ground through "K" Block, with no problems and at no

          time d i d a queue exceed 30 yards from the turnstile entrance.

 Continuation of statement of          DESMOND HENRY TURNER



At 1^50 hours I was present in Trinity Road when all the Norwich Supporters had

entered the ground and Trinity Road was clear of pedestrians. The mood of the Norwich

Supporters was jolly and co - operative. I then ordered two of the six Officers

posted to "K" Block to patrol Aston Park and with the other k Officers I moved from

"K" Block to "L" Block, V/here a request had been made for more Mounted Officers to

assist with the queue due to a large amount of Everton Supporters who had just arrived

    the turnstiles at "L" Block. Upon arrival at "Ln Block I found that all 10

turnstiles were being used and there was a queue some 60 yards in both directions

from the turnstiles along V;itton Lane. At 1500 hours when the Kick Off commenced

the crowd outside "L" Block surged towards the turnstiles and I ordered a wedge of

horses to be put into the crowd to relieve the pressure on the turnstiles and avoid

“ y in jury to any person in the queue. Many of the supporters at "L" Block had been

drinking and the smell of alcohol in the air from the crowd was strong. The Everton

supporters at "L" Block were unco - operative but they all gained access to the

ground by 1515 hours. I then made my way along Witton Lane to R&S Block turnstiles

and saw that the last of the Overton Supporters were just gaining access to the

ground by i-i&S turnstiles, at this time it was about 1520 hours. Upon my arrival at

 R&S" Block I v/as informed by the Mounted Officer in Charge at the turnstile, Police

Sergent ____ that the Everton Supporters who gained access at "R&S" turnstile had all

arrived in the 20 minutes before 1500 hours.

             I am Police Sergeant ___ , a mounted officer with the West Midlands
             Police. On Saturday 15th. April 1989 I was with other Mounted
             officers posted to Villa Park Football ground, Birmingham, to assist
             police the semi-final football match between Norwich and Everton.
             I was posted as the officer incharge of the mounted contingent
             required to control the supporters entering the ground via R and S
             block turnstiles and escorting the supporters from Witton Railway
             Station to che football ground, only Everton supporters were allowed
             access to the ground by R and S block. All Mounted officers were on
             post at R and S block by 1330 hours. Between 1330 hours and 1440 hours
             the supporters using R and S block arrived in small groups and there
             were no problems gaining access through the turnstiles. At about
             144-0 hours the crowd began to increase at R and S block and in order
             to prevent crushing on the steps, myself and two other Mounted officers
             blocked off the bottom of the steps and directed all supporters up
             an adjacent ramp which facilitated better queuing. By about 15^5 hours
             all the Everton supporters at R and S block had gained access to the
             football ground.I did not encounter any form of dissorder at R and S
             Block turnstiles while I was presento

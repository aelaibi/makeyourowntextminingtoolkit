very     boisterous             shouting          and       singing.

1 noticed           one y o u t h      in    particular             about         18-19 years               about      5*9"     tall,

heavily        built        wearing         Un io n Jack         shorts,              wa s    singing        l ou d e r    than

anyone        around        him.       He    definitely             appeared            worse         for    d ri n k .     Hi s   mates

appeared         to    be    telling         him       to    keep      quie t.           They       then move d           on d o w n     the

At    approximately              S . 00     pm the          train      earring               the s u p p o r t e r s    arrived,

On    leaving         station       arrangements               made         to    hold       them      together           outside        the

public        house      (name      not      known).            Th e    supporters               all     a ge   groups,         both

se x e s ,    were     v e r y w el l       behaved.           No      singing          or     chanting,          no      evidence        of

drink        made     their      way      from     off       the P l a t f o r m         d o w n the        steps.         We   were

then     joined        by two       mounted            officers,            I believe            from Sout h Yorkshire.

The    supporters            were      held       for       approximately               5 minutes            in the        small

triangular            area      outside         the     publi c h o u s e .

I noticed           that     two m e n at          the       rear      of    the       supporters            were       carrying         tea

urns.         We w e r e     then      instructed             to e s c o r t          the     supporters          to      the

football,        g ro u n d .      This      was       contrary         to       the     order        and also          it was

rather        unusual        considering               the    supporters               were      so    quiet      and      well

behaved.

We    escor^d          the      sh-pfporters           down     t^he m a i n          road,      arriving         outside          the

They     then made           their        way     to    the     queues           that        were     forming          outside      the

I seemed          to     recollect            earlier     hearing          a    r a di o    message            requesting

Public       Tranpsort           to      be    stopped        from    travelling                along       Leppings           Lane        but

I s aw      the      buses      were      still       moving      through            the    crowd,          forcing            them       over

towards        the      turnstiles             in the     bottleneck             area       outside            Leppings

     about       3-4    feet.           People            were          not    rushing            in,      it s e e m e d        as    if s o m e o n e

     still       surprised             to    see         it    open.

     I pointed          out      this        to      the       enquiring              Liverpool              supporter             and      he    started

At    thi s      t im e    I heard          from       other        officers        that       the       game       had      been

delayed          u ntil     3.13       pm.         I told ap pr oa ch in g               supporters              ’D o n ’t rush,             the

cl o s e    by said,           "W h a t ' s      that       then."         I replied           "Could          be    the      teams

come       out     ten minutes              before          start.         One     Liverpool             supporter            made      a

comment          t ha t    the    start          had     not    been       delayed and              that       I was         lying.

There       were     stil l       od d      supporters              asking        for    spare         tickets.              I s a w PC

Rose       having         problems          with       one y o u t h ,      apparently              he      didn't        have      a

ticket        a n d was        just        making        a general          nuisance           of      himself.              I then         saw

t ha t     the     lar ge      blue        gate     t ha t     had    been        opened       ear\ier           wa s     no w     c losed.

Then       about     eight        minutes           past       three       I received a                ra^io        message

something           to     the    effect           'All      serials         or    personnel             onto       the      pi t c h . '     No

I then        ran    through a              l a r ge     blue       gate    to     the    extreme              right      of     the

turnstile           area.         I ran          through        into       the     area       behind           the L e p p i n g s          Lane

left       I could         see    terracing              (extreme          right        hand      c or n e r     of L e p p i n g s

behind        the    Leppings              Lane     goal.           1 saw        several       supporters               running         on

         so              I looked for a steward to ask                                                                              if    I cou\d g a y i n       that end.

         However,                                I was                    unable                      to find one so                       I joined the mass of                people at

          I noticed about                                                      three                  or              four    police       officers        on horseback outside the

          I        was                gradua 11 y pushed                                                  towards                the tu.rnstiles,           comp 1 e t e 1y s urrounded

         was                 impossible                                   to turn back                                    because         of all     of the      people      behind me.

         I gave my ticket                                                         in at                   the            tyrrnstile.          The man       in the turnstile              didn't

         even                      look at                           it.                 I g o t \J,h r p u g h and w a i t e d                      for              and                 ana we

                made    our way through. / I was                        very eager           to get        u n X / f the    pens       because

                the    kick-off       was\ in/inent              and      could see          the     pitch as          I went      down the

                I d i d n ’t notice any               police         or stewards         in the tunnal                 area.      As    I

                By the       time we got             into      the     teKaces         it was about              two mi/futes after-

                three       o ’ clock and there was a crush of                               people.        I losjr sight              of

                crushed       for about            ten minutes,            my    limbs       c ompletely            pinned down,             and

                the    crowd was           swaying        from side          to side,,         I/then got              pinned

                a g a i n s t a barrier and tried                      to for c e \ m y s a / f      off    it. S u d d e n l y        there       was

                a lull       in the        crushing         so    I thought           that    I'd try and get under                         the

                barrier as          I thought            it w o u l d     be a lot       safer        the other            side.        As       I got

                under       the   barrier          the    crowd        closed up and           it took what                seemed       forever

                to    push myself           up.       I was at          p e o p l e ’s waist        height          for ages       fighting

                for breaths and                  panicking        to get        up.

                I e v e n t u a l ly got my s e l f            upright and was aware a g a i n of                          lots    of       people

                pushing       from behind.                I had no option other                     than to move             forward,             and

                as you m o v e d forward                 the     crush and        pressure          got m u c h greater.                    I was

                st r ugg 1 i ng ca n s t a n 1 1y for             br eath and          I was       s w e a t i ng    prof use 1y .

                As    I neared the               front    of the        pen I became aware                  of a white man age d                    in

                his    forties,       who         had dark        coloured hair              and was        overweight,            who was

next, to me on my                right.        He was     pinned between myself and a n o t h e r man

and     he had passed               out   his eyes were          closed and his head was                   rolling

loosely about, and                  it kept drop p e d onto my shoulder.                     The man

net      to him and mys elf t r :l.ed to stop him f r om f alii ng .                                 I was     ve ry

conscious           of not       letting myself           fall      because       I was scared of not

getting        back up again.

I had a l r e a d y had             one    taste    of being        down and       I was d e t e r m i n e d     that      I

wa s n ' t    going down           again. The          thought      t e r r i f i e d me.     I cannot

remember           what    h a pp en ed to the man who               passed out.            I eventually         got

pushed to the front                   of the      pen,    still      totally       crushed and          pinned      down.

I was aware              of a l i n e     of    police infront of the ^ p e r i m e t e r fence

the     fence.           I was also aware              of a bajra h\eadred         do   ! iceman to the          left      in

Eventually              I got    to the        front    of the      fence amd saw a gap                in the

.fencing and as              I neared the          gap s o me       p o Lee e o f f i c e r s p u lied rne t h r u u g h

it.     I think          there was        some    s upporters        pulling       people out as well               as

t n e p o 1 i ce .

O nce    through          the gap and onto              the   pitch     I began         coughing and wre n c h i n g

as    if to be sick.                I c o u l d n ’t stop being            sick    for about         five minutes.

A w om an      came       up to me and gave me a cup of tea                         in a plastic           cup.        She

a sk e d me        if    I had proper hold of the                   cup.     I said yes,            b u l/ o n c e she

released           the    cup    it slip p e d      through my hand.       I had no ystrength to

h old the          cup.      I was      t ot a l l y drained. I then went ovar to a gate in

the     fence and tried               yb hei p a main who was               in the\ fypn and whose               bottom

I tried to p u l l              the man out        but, I had        no strength.             The    police w o m a n

had a        lot    more     strength          than me and         could have       pulled him out.              I just
                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                      52117

gave      up then and           r e a l i s e d that       there was         lots    of dead        people at the

front,           I just      cracked up then and star t e d                     crying and wal k e d away,                       I

sat    down for a while a n d then                        1 began       looking      for                 and

I saw the bodies                being        laid out and            I was    scared       to     look    in case my

friends          had been killed.                 I carried on walk i n g            about        looking      for     them.

A f t e r a bout       half an hour               I m an a g e d    to fi                  a nd                 together.

I then went w ith them to sit                           in the N*Jr t h Stand.             I heard the
   P / V - n orrv/NrO V
loud s p a k e r announcernent ma                                       D A L G L E S H stating      that the

left      via     the N o r th S t a n d exiT.               E v e r y o n e about was          silent ajpra made            our

As a result             of this       incident          I received          numerous bruises              on my upper

arms,,     ribs and hips and                     on my back.         I d i d n ’t a t t e n ^ h o s p i t a l »

I feel      that        in view of what                happe n e d everythrlVj jfas handled                     by

e v e r y on e    concerned as              best as       it could have           been.

I think          a c on t r i b u t o r y    factor       in the deaths and               injuries        to    people       in

pens      three and four was                     the   perimeter        fence,      as    people     c o u l d n ’t escape

from      being       crushed.

I   believe         there      s h o u l d n ’t be      perimeter        fencing at football                   grounds       and

also,      because         of the      huge        numbers         of L i v erpool       fans     in comparison             to

N ot ts    fans,        there     sho u l d have          been a greater            ticket a l l o c a t i o n        for

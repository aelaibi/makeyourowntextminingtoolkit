Dear Sir Patrick


You wrote to Mr Moynihan on 25 April 1989

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss Bannister,
in her letter of 18 May 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the
Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylbr who has noted it.

Here is a letter from my constituent, Mr

He writes to me about his experience at the FA Cup Final
last May, when he experienced very great difficulties in
getting into the Stadium because of the number of spectators
trying to get. in at the same time, with inadequate, or
non-existent, queuing and filtering systems.   There was a
considerable crush, luckily without, the tragic consequences
of Hillsborough.

I would be most grateful if you could consider,                    and write to
me about Mr            letter.

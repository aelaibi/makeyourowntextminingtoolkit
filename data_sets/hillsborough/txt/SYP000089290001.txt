                I have been a Liverpool               supportfer since I was a young lad.                    I am a

                season ticket holder, and follow them almost everywhere.                                  I obtained a

                ticket from Anfield for the FA Semi Cup Final to be held at

                Hillsborough Stadium Sheffield on the IS April                                1989 (150489jK     The

                ticket was £6 and was for the Leppings Ln terrace standi tig7 area the

                area 8.       On the morning of Vne match my f r iend                                           came u

                the house to meet me as d i/a another friend

                                                             We were then waiting for another friend

                                                                , he was to pick us up but he was                late,

                so we all walked up t(je road t                                           public house for a

                while and then made our way back to my house and met up with

                In all there was eight of us to travel to the match in two vehicles.

         We arrived in Sheffield at about 1 pm (1300) and met up at the "Gate*

         public house which is not far from the ground-               The pub was

         effectively closed but we were invited to pay a pound to get into the

         pub to have a drink.         We had lunch in the pub and also a couple of

         pints of beer.    The pub was fairly packed,           the atmosphere was very

         friendly and there was no aggravation whatsoever.                I think we left the

         pub somewhere around about 2.15 pm (1415).Myself                      and

         I ’m   not sure but I think                       was with us as well, all walked

         towards the ground.          I had been to the same ground the year previous

         for a similar match and th^/refore I did not require any direction.

         When we got to the Leppirigs Ln end it was about 2,30 pm ( 14-3pj) there
So£.
 M l~    were thousands of fansyit was utter chaos,             there were n o ^ e u e s    I

         recollect seeing two police officers on horse back who/were attempting
fouc£-
  n-r    to block off access to the perimeter gate and there
   (—
         appeared to be some foot officers just standing abp'Cit. We joined the
                        "wr------------------ —------------ — --- 'T'
         mass of people in an effort to make our way to the turnstiles.    I
                                       far I T > H / / s / O y
         recollect a Police landrover arriving with a loud hailer on boajnia

         police officer was asking the fans to move back away from the/gates

         and the turnstiles and attempted to organise this manouvre >out to no

         avail.   All the time any body movement was by virtue of the crowd.

         Somehow or another I managed to free myself from the crowd and climb

         up onto the dividing wall between the West Stand and North Stand

         entrances which were marked A B C             there appeared to be letters missing

         from the turnstiles headings.

         I stayed on the wall for about ten minutes or so hoping the majority

         of people would drift         into the ground.      I then walked along the wall

         away from the turnstiles and climbed back down into the crowd just

         inside the perimeter gate.           I must add that I became separated from
                                                                                    PAGE     3
                                                                                    S3355

                     atid     when I climbed up onto the wall.     I waited in the crowd

              but it did not appear to be moving forward at all.        I was towards the

              back of the crowd and therefore did not feel any discomfort from the

              crowds at all, after a short time of being there the crowd seemed to

              go forward and I followed behind the crowd seem to lessen and there

              was no problems as I made my way forwards       I got to the turnstile and

              was able to go through very easily.        Once through I gathered from the

              noise of the crowd that the game had kicked off.

              I headed straight for the tunnel.      I had easy access to ySe tunnel,

              there were a few people milling around but nothing in excess.

              When I went through the tunnel there were fans half way down

              attempting to make their way onto the terraces.        I pushed my way

              through these people and got to the end of the tunnel.        T h e pressure

              was very tight at this point.      I managed to push my way to/the front
NJ£ST
< 5 - n W])   wall of the tunnel and move to the right.

              I coul dn ’t see the pitch at all,   it was very uncomfortable where I

              was,    so I decided to try and get back out and possibly get into the

              stand above.     I was unaware you could get to the terraces any other

              way.     Had there been any indication that there were other entrances I

              would have gone to the tunnel     in any event, as in this case the mat/h

              had started so it seemed the best place to go.        I made my way bacK to

              the tunnel,    there were still   people trying to push their way through

              it was still half full,    but there was no mad crush of people trying to
                                   /
              get through.     I managed to get back out with no problems.     Once I

              came out of the/tunnel    I turned left.     I saw that there was a

              stairway 1eadi/ng to the stand,    there was a steward on the stairs who

              then directejfi me around the side of the terraces.      I went into the

              first pen. / The front of the pen was empty,      but towards the back there

              was a normal amount of people for the match.

              As I took up position in that pen,     the players were leaving the pitch.

          I didn't know what was going on but it took me just a few minutes to

          realise what was happening and people appeared to be being crushed.                I

          saw a young lad being resuscitated by the corner flag.         It appeared

          that a member of the public was assisting.        I then saw the events that

          followed which   included fans ripping down the hoardings and the

          fencing behind   the goal.   I also saw another youth lying near the           line

          between the penalty line and      the goal   line he was wearing white

          trousers he had no shirt on.      He was being   resuscitated as well.         I

          then saw them putting a coat      over him   so I assumed he had died.     I

          also saw them rip the netting off the        goal mouth to make more room.

          I stayed where   I was and came down towards the front of     the pen I     was

          in.    It was here I could see     _____________ on the pitch side of the

          fence just in front of us.       He appeared to be okay.   He went to t/y

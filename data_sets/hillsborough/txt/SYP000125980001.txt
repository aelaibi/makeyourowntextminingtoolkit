EVENTUALLY THE GATES ONTO THE PITCH WERE OPEN AND PEOPLE WERE GOING THROUGH
ONE AT A TIME. WE WERE NEAR THE FRONT AND SO MANAGED TO GET THROUGH THE GATE.
WE WENT OVER TO A CORNER FLAG- THERE WERE THREE OF US, WE HAD LOST ONE AND IT
WAS ABOUT 2 HOURS LATER THAT WE FOUND HIM- HE'D MANAGED TO GET OUT THROUGH
THE BACK. THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE INSIDE AND THOSE
OUTSIDE.            ADDRESS NOT KNOWN,            I. ADDRESS NOT KNOWN AND

AT THIS TIME I STILL BELIEVED THE CROWD CRUSH WAS NORMAL. ON MOVING TO THE
RIGHT HAND SIDE OF SECTION B I REALISED THAT IT WAS STILL TOO CROWDED, SO I
HELD MY HAND UP AND THE SUPPORTERS IN THE SEATED SECTION LIFTED ME UP. I DID
NOT KNOW AT THIS TIME THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG. I ONLY WENT UP INTO THE
SEATED AREA TO ALLOW MORE ROOM AT THE FRONT OF THE TERRACES. AFTER A FEW
MINUTES I THEN REALISED THAT IT WAS MORE THAN THE USUAL CROWD .

              THERE WAS A TRAFFIC JAM AT THE END OF THE M63. WE ARRIVED AT THE
              GROUND AT ABOUT 15.50. THERE WERE AT LEAST 2000 PEOPLE OUTSIDE
              THE GROUND WAITING TO INTO THE LEPPINGS LANE END. IT WAS TOTAL
              CHAOS. THERE WERE NO DIRECTION SIGNS OR ORDERLY QUEUES. THERE

OUTSIDE THE GROUND. THERE COULD HAVE BEEN FANS KILLED OUTSIDE IF THE GATE HAD
NOT BEEN OPENED. WHEN THE GATE WAS OPENED I WAS ABOUT 30FEET FROM IT. THE
PRESSURE WAS JUST RELIEVED. I WAS TOWARDS THE BACK OF THE QUEUE AND WE WALKED
THROUGH INTO THE ENCLOSURE. THERE WERE NO SIGNS OR PEOPLE GIVING DIRECTIONS
TELLING US WHERE TO GO. WE WERE LUCKY. WE DIDNT GO THROUGH THE MAIN TUNNELL
IN FRONT OF US. WE WENT OFF TO THE LEFT AND GOT INTO THE TERRACES THERE. THE
LEFT WING THAT WE WENT IN WAS EMPTY. WE SAW THAT THE MIDDLE PENS WERE
O^ptCROWDED AND WE SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OUT AND BEING HELPED AND PULLED INTO
THE STAND ABOVE. ALL THIS WAS BEFORE THE KICK OFF.

INFO      » I GOT IN MY SEAT AT ABOUT 215PM AND COULD LOOK DOWN ONTO THE
 £           STANDING AREA. BEFORE THE KICK OFF I SAW FANS CLIMBING THE
 W           BARRIERS AT THE FRONT AND MY FI8RST IMPRESSION WAS OF A PITCH
              INVASION WHICH WAS ALSO THE REACTION OF THE POLICE ON THE PITCH
              WHO PUSHED THEM BACK UNTIL THEY OPENED THE GATE AT THE
              FRONT.THER4E SEEMED TO BE A LONG DELAY IN THE REACTION OF THE

IN MY OPPINION TIME WAS WAISTED WITH AMBULANCES TRYING TO GAIN ACCESS FROM
THE FAR LEFT HAND CORNER AND FROM INFRONT OF THE WEST STAND. I COUNTED ONLY 3
AMBULANCES UNTIL WE LEFT AT 345PM,THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS NOT USED TO
GIVE INFORMATION TO THE FANS AND WHEN WE LEFT WE WERE ATTACKED BY FORREST
FANS WHO OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT THAT LIVERPOOL FANS HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A FIGHT
A M THEY WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT HAD BEEN GOING ON. I SAW NO BISBEHAVIOUR OF
THE FANS. I HAVE READ OF FANS URINATING ON THE POLICE, ISAW FANS CARRIED OUT
OF THE ENCLOSURE EITHER UNCONCIOUS OR DEAD WHO HAD URINATED BUT THIS IS TO BE
EXPECTED IN ONE IN SHOCK. I BELIEVE THAT THE MAJOR PROBLEM IN FANS ARRIVING
LATE WAS DUE TO HOLDUPS ON THE ROAD. IT TOOK ME 30 MINUTES LONGER TO GET
THERE THAN IT DID LAST YEAR. THERE WAS NOT TRAFFIC CONTROL ON THE HOLDUPS ON
THE WAY ESPECIALLY ON THE M 602 AND THE HYDE ROUNABOUT

           >>
            AT THE GROUND AND THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE CONCENTRATED AWAY FROM
            THE GROUND. AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END WE WENT IN THROUGH THE
            TURNSTILES AND THERE WERE 2 OR 3 POLICE OFFICERS AT EACH
            TURNSTILE. WE WENT TO GO TO THE STAIRS TO GET TO THE SEATING, AND
            ON EACH ALLEYWAY TO THE STAIRS THERE WERE 3 OR 4 SHEFFIELD
            WEDNESDAY STEWARDS.

I WAS WITH MY WIFE      , WHO LIVES WITH ME, AND MY BROTHER IN LAW
                        |          LIVERPOOL. ALSO A FRIEND^
                             MERSEYSIDE   BUT HER BROTHER,                 WAS
KILLED RECENTLY, AND IT MAY BE BEST IF NO-ONE CONTACTS HER
THE STEWARDS RIPPED THE TICKETS, THEY COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DEPLOYED
ELSEWHERE I THINK.
    JND 2.40 PM MY BROTHER IN LAW SAW WHAT HE DESCRIBED AS BEDLAM THROUGH THE
LOO WINDOW IN LEPPINGS LANE, WHERE PEOPLE WHERE QUEUEING.
I SAW IN THE PENS IN FRONT OF ME EVEN AT ABOUT THIS TIME 2.40 THAT PEOPLE
WERE CLIMBING OUT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE PENS TO THE WING SECTIONS OF THE
LEPPING LANE TERRACES.
PEOPLE STARTED CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH, AND WE SAW PEOPLE
BEING PULLED UP FROM THE TERRACES UP THE STAND.
AS MORE PEOPLE CLIMBED OUT, IT BECAME CHAOTIC, AND THE POLICE DIDN'T SEEM TO
DO ANYTHING. WE THEN SAW BODIES, WE SAW CARDIAC MASSAGE BEING GIVEN.
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT IT WAS LACK OF POLICING ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE STAND.
THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACING IS NORMALLY THE AWAY SECTION, AND I FELT THAT THE
POLICE WERE NOT AWARE THAT THIS WAS NOT A NORMAL POLICING SITUATION AS SO
MANY LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE TURNING UP.

INFO      >>     I ARRIVED AT THE GROUND AT ABOUT 1220HRS AND THERE WAS JUST THE
                 NORMAL CROWD THAT YOUD EXPECT AT A FOOTBALL MATCH AT THAT TIME OF
                 DAY. I WAS WITH MY SON IN LAW WE WAITED BY THAT CORNER SHOP WHICH
                 HAS BEEN ON THE TV ALOT AND AT ABOUT 1300HRS WE WERE MOVED ON BY
                 THE POLICE. WE MOVED AWAY ABOUT 100 YARDS OR SO AND WAITEDUNTILL
                 ABOUT 1330HRS BEFORE GOING INTO THE GROUND. THE CROWD WAS AVERAGE
                 NOW.

WHEN WEW G OT INTO THE GROUND WE WENT STRAIGHT TO OUR SEATS WE WERE IN THE
SECOND ROW FROM THE FRONT ABOVE THE TERRACES IN LEPPINGS LANE. I KEPT LOOKING
OVER THE TERRACES AND SAW THAT THE CENTRE PART WAS FULL AND THE TWO SIDE
WINGS WERE EMPTY IN FACT AT ONE STAGE WE WENT DOWN AND SAT ON THE STEPS IN
THE SUN ADMIRING A YOUNG GIRL WHO HAD TAKEN HER JUMPER OFF. WHEN WE WENT BACK
TO OUR SEATS I DECIDED TO GO TO THE TOILETS AT ABOUT 1450HRS AND WHEN I WAS
IN THE TOILET I COULD SEE OUT OF THE WINDOW SLATS THAT THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE
GROUND WAS ENORNMOUS AND MY EXACT WORDS WERE "OH SHIT" I WATCHED AND I COULD
SE®)NLY A TRICKLE OF FANS GETTING THROUGH THE TURNSTYLES AT THE RATE OF
ABOUT ONE EVERY TEN TO FIFTEEN SECONDS.THE MATCH KICKED OF AT TWO MINUTES TO
THREE r TWO MINUTES EARLY AND WHEN BEARDSLEY HIT THE CROSS BAR WITH HIS SHOT
THE CROWD SURGED FORWARD AS THEY ALWAYS DO THINKING IT WAS A GOAL AND JUST
THEN WHICH WAS ABOUT FIVE PAST THREE THE GATE OUTSIDE MUST HAVE BEEN OPENED
AND THE CROWD RUSHED INTO THE CENTRE SECTION AND FOUND THAT THEY HAD NO WHERE
TO GO. PEOPLE STARTED SPILLING ONTO THE PITCH JUST LIKE A PITCH INVASION AND
WE SAID SORT OF GET OFF THE PITCH NOT REALLY KNOWING WHAT HAD HAPPENED. I SAW
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT I SAW THE BOBBI9E RUNNING TO THE REF TO
STOP THE MATCH. PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING UP ONTO THE STAND, NOT WHERE WE WERE
OVER THE OTHER SIDE . I WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE THIS AND MORE WHEN IM
INTERVIEWED TO MAKE A STATEMENT. I THINK THE FA WERE AT FAULT FOR NOT
ALLOCATING US THE BIGGER PART OF THE GROUND AND ALSO THE POLICE FOR NOT BEING
ABLE TO ORGANISE THE CROWD OUTSIDE. THERE WERE NO STEWARDS ANYWHERE DIRECTING
THE CROWD EITHER. THOSE POLICEMEN WHO STOOD ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE PITCH
COULD HAVE DON MORE BECAUSE THERE WAS A LINE OF POLICE DOGS BEHINMD THEM TO
KEEP THE FORREST FANS AT BAY THE OTHERS COULD HAVE BEEN TOLD TO TAKE THERE
TUNICS OFF AND GET STUCK IN. ONE POLICEMAN GOT ASSAULTED BY ONE FAN WHO HAD
JUST COME OUT FROM THE MIDDLE OF IT BECAUSE HE SAW THIS BOBBIE POUR HIMSELF A
CUP OF TEA OR WATER AND THIS FAN WAS SCREAMING AT HIM TO HELP OTHERS HAD TO
PULL THE FAN OFF THE BOBBIE ANYWAY I WILL PUT ALL THIS DOWN ON PAPER WHEN
THEY COME ROUND. I WAS WITH MY SON IN LAW WHO HAS ALREADY TELEPHONED HIS NAME
is
IF ANYONE    IS CALLING COULD THEY CALL BEFORE THE 10 MAY 89 AFTER THAT I WILL
ONjLY BE AVAILABLE ON A MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND AT ANY TIME OVER THE WEEKEND.

DIRECTED TO MY SEAT BY TWO STEWARDS WHO WERE LOCATED WITHIN THE SEATED
TERRACE AREA.I LOOKED OVER THE STAND INTO THE PEN DIRECTLY BEHIND THE GOAL
POSTS AND COULD SEE THE CRUSH OF PEOPLE WITHIN THIS AREA. PEOPLE WERE
CLAMBERING OVER THE FENCING AND WERE PUSHED BACK INTO THE CROWD BY POLICE
OFFICERS.I SAW A GATE OPENED WITHIN THE FENCING BEHIND THE GOALPOSTS AND
PEOPLE WERE DRAGGED OUT OF THIS PEN.
1.J WENT WITH MY SEVEN YEAR OLD SON TO THE GROUND, HIS NAME IS

2. IN MY OPINION THE STEWARDS WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER EMPLOYED DIRECTING FANS
OUTSIDE THE GROUND TO THE TURNSTILES WHERE THEIR RESPECTIVE TICKETS SHOULD
HAVE BEEN SHOWN,UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS COMPLETE AND UTTER CHAOS.

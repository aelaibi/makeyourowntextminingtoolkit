030.   HAVE YOU    ANY COMMENT TO   MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF     THE

THAT YOU KNEW SOMETHING WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AT HEISSEL            IT WAS

DRUNKEN HOOLIGANISM        HILLSBOROUGH W A S N ’T ANYTHING OF THE SORT.



(335.    IF YOU ATTENDED LAST YEARS SIMILAR MATCH WAS THERE ANYTHING

        SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTO

        TO THIS DISASTER?        (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)

G37,    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

        FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



             THE REALISATION WAS VERY SLOW TO COME FORWARD OF THE

ENORMITY OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING AMONGST EVERYONE AT THE GROUND.



             I THINK THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED - I FEEL

INFORMATION TO THE GROUND COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH SHARPER           IT WAS VERY

SLOW IN COMING FORWARD.

                    match between Liverpool and
                    Nottingham Forest in April 1989.

                    The judge at Leeds Crown Court
                    will decide on Wednesday
                    whether Mr Duckenfield will have
                    to face a retrial.

                    The jury spent 25 hours
                    deliberating the charges. They
                    were told a majority verdict,
                    rather than a unanimous one,
                    would be enough in the case.

                    Thousands of fans

                    The prosecution said that the tragedy happened after the
                    defendants allowed exit Gate C at the stadium to be
                    opened to relieve pressure on the turnstiles - without
                    diverting fans away from the overcrowded terraces.

                    Thousands of fans flooded into pens three and four
                    where many of the victims died.

                    The case was brought by the Hillsborough Families
                    Support Group and up to a hundred friends and relatives
                    of the victims packed the court during the 27-day hearing.

                tim e we may."

                The case, which was brought by the
                Hillsborough Family Support Group, was based
                on the officers' decision not to close a tunnel
                leading to two pens.

                The prosecution claimed the tragedy occurred
                after exit Gate C was opened to relieve
                pressure on the turnstiles, causing hundreds
                of people to flood into the pens.

                The 96 victim s of the tragedy died in the
                resulting crush in pens three and four.

                 Packed courtroom

                But Mr Murray's counsel, Michael Harrison,
                QC, argued th a t it was the situation which had
                led to football supporters being caged in pens,
                rather than the failures of the police.

                The judge, Mr Justice Hooper, warned
                members of the victim s' families who packed
                out the public gallery th a t they m ust not react
                when the verdict was announced as it would
                be a "serious contem pt of court".

                The courtroom remained hushed as the
                foreman of the ju ry read out the two not guilty
                verdicts for Mr Murray.

                 Mr Murray left the court im m ediately after the
                ju ry 's decision, escorted by police officers and
                 his legal advisers.

                Prosecuting Alun Jones
                told the ju ry at Leeds
                Crown Court th a t
                opening the gate while
                failing to close the
                tunnel was crim inally
                negligent and
                amounted to
                manslaughter.

                The ju ry had been
                Warned by Mr Justice David Duckenfield: Awaits
                Hooper not to make a the jury's verdicts
                decision based on
                sym pathy, either for victim s' families or for Mr
                Duckenfield and Mr Murray.

                The two men have since retired from South
                Yorkshire Police.

                 day of the trial.

                 Mr Murray had earlier told the court he was
                 haunted by the thought th a t if he had closed a
                 central tunnel to the Leppings Lane terrace,
                 lives may have been saved.

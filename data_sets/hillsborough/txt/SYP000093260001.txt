The    people were of all ages.                  Countless     numbers of them were

spitti ng and sw ea ri ng at us as they ran past                        into the terraces.

The    gates were      then closed but             people    still     continued to       climb over

the walls.

On seeing       the   crowds my          immediate    impre s s i o n was    that either there was

the    pitch.

It then became a p p a r e n t that a serious                  a c c i d e n t had occurred.

Tog et he r w i t h other officers               I climbed     onto     the a d v e r t i s i n g boards

was    on the boards         I sawX^ ,piie of bodies.

Th e y were blue       in the face and             lifeless.      I tried on numerous               at tem pts

Wi t h a number       of other          officers made a c h ^ n        from the ter ra ce s o n t o

the    pitch.       Under    the di r e c t i o n of a senior officer the chain was

             I heard a loud y ^ e r and saw Liverpool -fans racing across the pitch

             towards        the Notts Forest           fans.

             A cordon was          formed acroVa           the    pitch to    prevent any -further        incidents.

             By this time          I had been split              up from other members         of the Serial         and

             began to emerge.              I was     subj ected to      in s u l t -3, taunts and abuse        by

            At 9 . 0 0 a m     (0900)       on S a t u r d a y ,       15th A p r i l ,     1989       ( 1 5 048 9)   I commenced

            duty       at H a m m e r t o n R o a d     Police         Station,       my    duties        on t h at     being    one    of

            a    number       of C I D     officers,          who      were    to w o r k    under        the    direct    control        of

            D e t . Ins p.         T owe 11 as     part       of a P i c k p o c k e t      T e a m.

            At 9 . 4 5 a m     (0945)       that       same    day      I attended          the S h e f f i e l d     Wednesday

            Football          Ground and         together           with      other       officers        I was       briefed    in

            relation          to    the    forthcoming             Semi    Final      football          match     between

            At    11.30am          (1130)     that      same       day,    I commenced           observations            regarding

            the        pickpockets         in the       Leppings          Lane    turnstile            area     along    with    Det.

At    that    time        our       brief        was     to     identify            travelling               pickpockets               and    if

possible          to     carry       out     a surveillance                    on    those          pe r s o n s .

Due    to    this       Det.        Con.     Hal lam was               in    possession              of a w a l l e t           alarm,        and

the    remainder              of    the     team       were       to    be     in a       position            in o r d e r        to    respond

to a    signal          to     be    given         by DC H a 11am.

On    taking       u p our          positions            in the a r e a             of    the       Leppings           Lane       turnstile

and    paddock          a rea,       the     area        was     very        quiet        and       the      crowd      being          sparse.

Uniform Officers                    were     on     duty        in t h at       area,          officers           w e r e at       each

turnstile          entrance              gate,      and       officers          were          on d u t y at          a barricade              on

the    driveway           to       the     r ear    of    the       South       st an d .

Further       officers              were     on     d u t y as a            coach        reception            party       in the         area

immediately             in f r o n t        of     the    turnstiles.                    It a p p e a r e d       at    t ha t     time       the

number       of    uniformed               Police        officers            was     in the          region          of 40.

At    this    time        the       crowd        which        had      started           to    gather         was      mixed       with many

families          being        present.             The       behaviour             of    the       f a ns    was      good       humoured.

As    the    afternoon              wore     on     the       crowd         steadily           built         up a n d     the      mood

became       fairly           hostile,           because         numerous            fans          were      milling         around

without       tickets,              at     this     time        I lost         c o u nt       of    the      number       of      people        who

approached          me a n d a s k e d             whether          I had       either             tickets        to    sell       or    just

s pa r e .

I personally              saw a          number        of m e n        selling           tickets          with       l a rg e     groups        of

people       stood around                  them,       w ho    were         obviously              trying      to      buy      tickets         for

the    gam e.          Du e    to    this        the a r e a        around          the       corner         shop wh ic h          is

directly adjacent                    to     the     football           stadium            became          particularly

congested.

The    vehicular              traffic        along        Leppings             Lane       itself          appeared           to    grind        to

a h alt,      with       the        od d    vehicle           pa s s i n g ,    although             it      should       be      said       t ha t

numerous          coaches           and     Public        Service            Vehicles              came a l o n g       t hat      road

under       Police       motorcycle                escort        to    the      reception              a r e a.

The    uniformed              officers           in t ha t        location attende d                      those        vehicles          and a
                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                               S2822

search       of    persons          leaving           the    vehicles          was      undertaken.

I recall          seeing        two    coaches             arrive    at     the      same      time,       two     officers

approached          one       vehicle        and       the    remainder            of    the       serial       6 or 8 o f f i c e r s

approached          the       other        vehicle.           I reca ll         thinking            that    there        was       less

officers          in that        area,       than          there    ha d    been        in    previous          years.

However,          I must        say    that       I had       several          arrests         take     place         and     believe

that    this       may     have       drawn       strength away                from      the       reception          party.

At    this    time       there        were       no    problems          and    no      real       cause    for       concern

involving          public        disorder.

It s h o u l d     be    pointed           out    th at      Mounted        officers           were     operating             in the

Leppings          Lane     turnstile             and       paddock       a r ea,     the      number       of    officers           being

two    sergeants,             one     of    those          being    a South          Yorkshire         Officer,             fo ur

Police       Constables,              two    of       those       being     male        Merseyside          officers.               Th e

Merseyside          officers           operating             in the        area      directly         in f r o n t       of    the

Paddock       and       turnstiles.

At a r o u n d     1 . 1 5 pm    (1315)          together          with     the      other         members       of    the

Pickpocket          Te am,       I walked             along       Leppings         L a n e,    due    to    reports           of

pickpockets             operating           further          along       the    road,         at    this    t ime      numerous

people       just       hanging        about,          sat    on the        pavement           leaning          against        the

walls,       sat    on the          parapet           of    the    bridges,          many      of    these       people        were

drinking          from     cans a n d        bottles          of a s s o r t e d        intoxicants.

I even       recall        seeing          a very attractive                   young         lady w it h        two    friends,

drinking          from     cans       of    lag er.          In the        space        of a ppr o; <im ate ly           half       an

hour    I saw       this        one    g i rl         open and drink               four       cans    of lager.

At a r o u n d     1.30pm        (1 330),             together with            Det. Con.           Hal lam a n d       remainder

of    team,       I walked          down Leppings                 Lane     in the        direction          of     the

roundabout,             the     observations                went     as    far       as the        chip shop          situated           at

the    junction          of L e p p i n g s           Lane    a n d B i c k e r t o n R o a d,       at t hi s        location           we

loitered.           Th e      c r o w d at       this       time    was     quite        dense,       stil l       numerous          fans

approaching             people        including             myself       and    asking         to    buy    tickets,           many        of
                                                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                                                         S2822

the    fans        in the a r e a            the    worse       for     dri n k ,       quite       a    lot        of    litter          mainly

beer    cans.

Whilst       walking          ba ck      to    the      original         observation area                       in f r o n t         of       the

Paddock          a r ea ,    I identified              one      particular              f a n as        being        a ticket             tout,

I approached                him,    enquired            how m uch        he w a s         selling          the       tickets             at    to

which       he     replied         thirty          pounds.         I immediately approached                                Inspector

Sykes       and      informed           him    of     the    situation.                 I believe              that       that       m a n was

arrested.

Due    to    the       density          of    the     crowd,       observations                 regarding                pickpockets

became       centred          around          the     area      immediately              in f r o n t          of    the       metal

fencing          in f r o n t      of    the       Paddock        turnstile             a r e a.        Th e    observations                   team

loitering           around         the       corner       shop and           the    entrances              to        b a t h the N o r t h

Whilst       at     t his     location             I re c a l l    moving          numerous             bottles           of    both

alcohol          and     s of t    drinks          which     had       been    discarded                underneath              the

fencing          and     behind         in o r d e r      that     they would              be      out    of        harms       way.

The    Merseyside             Mounted          officers           together          with        one S o u t h            Yorkshire

officer          ( fe m a l e )    were       constantly moving                    the     crowd         on w h o         were       just

standing          about,          these       people        obviously          had       no     tickets.                 This       was

interferring                with    the       operation           to    catch       offenders             so         m u c h so that

several          likely       suspects             were     moved       on by the             officers.

At 2 . 2 0 p m      (1420)         or    thereabouts              the    crowd          became          very        dense,          so    much

so    that       the     observations               team     including             myself          was     forced          to m o v e          out

from    th e a r e a a d j a c e n t           to     the m e t a l      fencing           to a n a r e a            of    relative

calm    beneath             the    signs       on     the    metal       fencing           further             along       towards             the

entrances           to      the    West       stand.

Whilst       at     t hat     location             repeatedly asked                 for       spare        tickets             or    tickets

for    sale,        those         persons          obviously           now    getting           very worried                   about

seeing       the       football          match,        the m a j o r i t y         of    those          persons           having

enquired about                tickets,             moved     into       the    paddock             area and              towards

turnstiles             which       by     now      had      lar ge        queues.

At    the       present        location            I l i a i s e d w i t h Det.                Sgt.       McSloy,          who    reported

seeing          an Asian          wearing          glasses         and         sheepskin            coat       plus    one       othe r,

constantly             moving        in a n d         out    of    queues           in the          paddock          area.        It

appeared           that      these        men were            pickpockets,                 the      two    men       had    disappeared,

from      view        having       come        out     of    the      paddock            area,       therefore             it w as

suggested             that    the        entire        pickpocket               team would             split         up a n d     search

for    the       two m a l e s .

D e t . S g t . McSloy,              D Cs      Locking           and Askew moved                    off    from       the       area    which

we    had       now    taken       up,      which         was     directly adjacent                       to    the    roadway and                is

on a      lip whi ch a f f o r d s               a v i e w whi ch              is   siightly           e 1evated and              looks

down      on     the     heads       on     the       persons         queuing            to    gain       entrance          to    the

football           stadium.

After       a    short       t i m e , the        entire          observation                 team     re-j o i ne d        in the

a f o r e m e n t i o n e d area,           the       c r o w d at        t hi s    time       now     being         very       dense       and

it s e e m e d        that    from        the a r e a        n ea r       to    the      shop       some       considerable

distance           away      right        up     to    the       ground was              totally          blocked          by    people

moving          towards       the        ground.            By    t hi s       time      vehicular             traffic          had    ceased

and    the       entire       carr i a g e w a y w as             blocked           by    peo pl e.

Whilst          stood       with    DCs        Hal lam a n d Li 1 ley a n d                    looking          down       into       the

paddock          area       w hic h was          now      totally          f ul l     with       people        and     still          more

walking          towards          th e    ground,           I saw         groups         of y o u n g      men       pushing          into    the

crowd,          the m a j o r i t y       of     these       being         the      worse        for      drink,       I saw          several

carrying           and      drinking           from       large       2    litre         bottles          of    both       lager       and

be er .

At    this       time       I noted         t h at     the P o l i c e          horses         were       moving       amongst          the

My    impression             of    the      situation             was      that       the      crowd was             becoming

desperate             due    to    having         no      tickets          and      with       no    hope       of    getting

tickets,           also      the     fact        t ha t     the    o ne s      who       had     tickets         would          miss    the

to     th e    stadium.

I cannot             rec a l l    t he       time,        but     whilst      s t o o d at          this    location a Police

Landrover               came a l o n g        the L e p p i n g s        Lane,         with     blue       light       and       two     tone

horns         operating,              th e    vehicle           stopped       near        to w h e r e      we     were       st o o d .

I looked            both       down and            up L e p p i n g s       Lane       and     the a r e a       was     totally

blocked            in b o t h     directions                with      people       moving           towards        the      football

gr o u n d .

I was         now stood           to       one     s i de    the      Landrover           with       DCs    Hal lam a n d L i l l e y ,

and     whilst           there        we     were      joined         by a u n i f o r m        Inspector,             identity

unknown.

PC B u xt o n           the    driver         of      the    vehicle,         alighted and                 stood       on     the       body     of

the     vehicle             and whilst             doing        so    he was       using        the       vehicles          PA    system,

repeatedly               stating           âP l e a s e     stop      pushing          there        are    people        at      th e    front

being         crushed.'               I noted          several         l a rg e    groups           of y o u n g    Liverpool              fans,

who     were        pushing           into       the      crowd and making                    some     headway         towards           the

turnstiles,                 these      fans        pushing           others       out    of     the way.

I spoke            to    several           fans       saying         " D o n ât go      forward,           stay     back."              Many

ignored            this.

At     this        point       I saw         several         people         climbing           on    the    fences          around         the

paddock            a r ea.       Once        climbing           into     t h at    position            those       people         were        then

helping            others        up    onto        the      fence      tops.           I then        saw    one     fan       climb        over

into     the a c t u a l          ground,             he w a s       then    followed           by     others,         I then           saw

Inspector               Bennett        appear          on    the      roof    of       th e    turnstile           area.          I saw        the

officer            assist        several           f ans     to      climb    into       the        ground       a r e a.

It w a s       obvious           at    this        stage        that     many      people           were    being        c r u s h e d at

th e    turnstiles,               people           were      not      moving       through           the    actual          turnstiles

and     I r eca l l           thinking           that       I c o u l d n ât see         any Police              helmets          at     the

turnstiles.

EJoth PC           Buxton and              the     unknown           uniform       Inspector              were     now      using        the     PA

system,        repeatedly asking                      the        crowd    to       stop        pushing         and      that      there        was

people        being     crushed.                I rec all          one    of       th e    officers            stating           that       g ame

was     going    to     be      delayed.              The        people       s t i ll     approaching               the     ground and

turnstiles           were       taking          no    notice        whatsoever                 and were           continuing            to

push     forward.

The     Mounted       officers             strength               had    been increased, and saw                           that       those

officers        were       attempting                to    get     nearer           t he       t u r n s t i l e s to     enable        people

to     gain    entry       to    th e      ground.                Still       no one           taking any notice                 and        st ill

more     people       pushing           forwards.                  At     this time             t h e r e w a s no        other       obvious

Police        manpower          deployed             in t hat       ar ea.

I observed           the P o l i c e        Mounted              Inspector,          obviously                shouting           at    the

crowd,        I noted        t h at     hi s     horse           seemed       to    be     going         under       du e    to       the

people        pushing        against            it,       t he    front       of    the        horse        started         to    rise       with

th e    rear    end     disappearing                  from        view,       it a p p e a r e d         t h at     the     officer          was

falling        backwards,             however,             somehow        he       regained            hi s    footing.

The     mood    of    the       crowd       was       now        very    desperate               and     becoming           more       and

more     hostile.

The     anger    of     the      crowd          now       being     directed              at     the     uniformed           officers

present,        I noted          several             people        coining         towards            b o t h PC     Buxton           and    the

Inspector,           pushing          at    those          officers,           saying            do    something,            stop       the

pushing,        some       of    these          men were           crying          in w h a t         I believe           was

f r u s t r a t i o n at     the      situation.

PC     B ux t on who was           continually                   using    th e P A         system           then     directed           the

Mounted        officers          to     form a            line     in f r o n t      of        th e P a d d o c k       area,         this    was

partially        successful,                five          Police        horses        completing               the      line,         however

as     the    crowd     pushed          forward            the     horses          were        pushed         towards        th e      ground.

PC B u x t on    s t i ll       attempting                to     reassure          the     crowd         stating          that        they

w o u l d all    get       in a n d        to    stop          pushing.

I reca ll       seeing          Inspector             Bennett           who    was        stil l       on     the    roof        of    the

turnstiles           an d was         still          pulling        people          onto         the     roof.
By    now     I c o u l d n ât a c t u a l l y          see     t he      turnstiles              due     to    the    v ast      sea      of

people and             st ill       no    sign       of P o l i c e       helmets.            PC     Buxton       still

attempting             to    reassure           the     crowd.

Whilst        s t o o d at        that     location a               l a r ge     roar       from w it h in        the     ground,            it

appeared          to me        that       the       football         teams         had      come     onto       the    pi tc h,      this

being       around 2.55pm                 <1455)        the     mood       of      the      crowd        being    desperate,               more

and more          fans       pushing           forward,         still          many       carrying         both       cans     and

bottles        of      dr i n k .

Together          with       th e    other          officers         of    the       observation               team    knowing          that

we    c o u l d n ât h e l p        the    situation            I moved            of f     down Vere           R oad.

Whilst        walking          down       that       road a n o t h er           large       roar        from w it h i n       the

ground        was      h ea r d .        I noted        t hat       football          fans        were     running        up      t h at

road     in the         direction              of    the L e p p i n g s         Lane       end,     those       f ans    obviously

coming        from Liverpool.

Having        walked         down        that       r oad a n d      into        P e ni s t o n e    R oad,      I noted          tha t

there       was     very       few       spectators            in that           a r e a,    together          with      the      other-

off i cers        I then          went     into       the      gym.

At    3.05pm        (1505)          or    thereabouts               whilst         in th e        gym     having       meal,

i n f o r m a t i o n wa s        received           t ha t    the     crowd was             on     the    pitch and           t h at      all

available           uniform          personnel           to a t t e n d          that       area.         Together        with       both

D C âs L o c k i n g        and Askew           left      the       gym and         took      up a        position        near       to      the

entrance          to    th e      pit ch ,      however,            having        been       there        only a short             time,

together          with       the     other          officers         I was         instructed             to    return       to    the       gym

to a w a i t      casualties.

Whilst        in the         gym     I was          informed         t ha t      there       had     been       deaths       in the

grou nd and was                told       to    clear         the    g y m by C h i e f           Inspector           Beal     and      to

make     it    ready         to     receive          corpses.

The    bodies          then       began        to a r r i v e       within        t he      gym,     the       first     person

having        been       carried          i nt o     t h at    area       wa s     thought          to    be    dead     however           it

was    found        that       he w a s n ât d e a d a n d             therefore             was     moved       to    one     side.
The a r e a      within          the     gym was        now    ready       to    receive            the      bodies        and       those?

that    were       brought           in w e r e       blue    in t he      face,          many     obviously              dead,       s ome

of w h i c h w e r e        still        being        attended       by    first          aid     personnel.               1 noted

that    several            of    the     bodies        (deceased)          had       vomitted and                 soiled

themselves           and        I recall        seeing        one w h i c h      ha d      blood        co mi n g     from          his

head    body       orifices.

Al l   th e     deceased          which were            brought       into       the       gym were           accompanied                 by

Police        officers,           some      being       carried       in on m a k e s h i f t               stretchers              and

other    actually               being      carried.           I reca ll         seeing           one    female        Police

officer        and     s ome      spectators            struggling          with          t he    body       of a s m a l l          young

male,     I. w e n t       to    her     assistance           and    took       hold       of     the       boy a n d      carried

him    into      the m a i n         hall     and      placed       him    on    the       floor along               with       the       many

others,        the     female          officer         then    stayed       with          the     deceased.               Many       of    the

bodies        I saw ob v io u sl y            had      broken       limbs       and ma n y were               in s o m e        form       of

state    of      undress.

Together         with       other        officers           mainly CID F 1 personnel.                             I moved           amongst

the    bodies        and Po li c e          officers,          instructing                th e    officers           to    stay       with

the    deceased and               to     make     a    brief       description             of     the       body and           to    search

th e   body      for       both      personal          effects       and    ident ification,                      I handed           the

officers         plastic          b ag s    and       l abels.

Having        completed           this      ta sk,      again       together          with        o t h e r FI       CID

personnel,           I searched             several          bodies       placed          them     into       body        bags,

making        sure     that       th e     head       was    the    first       thing        to    be       seen     once       the       bag

was    opened,         the      bodies        were      then       lined    up       in    rows        of    twelve,           the

attending          officers            were     again        instructed          to       stay with           th e    deceased.                 I

cannot        r ec a l l    the      time     but      it w a s     some    considerable                    time     l at e r

             (210489)        I was       a member         of      the E x h i b i t s    Team        under        the      direction         of

At     that    time        our       brief         was     to    identify           travelling             pickpockets                and    if

to a      signal         to be        given          by DC H a 1Jkkm.

On     taking       up our           positions             inyche a r e a           of    the L e p p i n g s         Lane       turnstile

and     paddock          a r e a , th e        area        was    very       quiet        and       the    crowd being                sparse.

Uniform        Officers              were      on     duty       in t h at      area,          officers          were       at    each

turnstile           entrance              g a te ,    and       officers        were          on    d u t y at a b a r r i c a d e           on

the     driveway           to       the     rear      of    the S o u t h       s tan d .

Further        officers              were      on     duty as a           coach          reception           party      in the a r e a

immediately              in f r o n t         of     the    turnstiles.                  It a p p e a r e d at         that       time       the

number        of    uniformed Police                       officers          was     in the           region       of 40.

At     this    t im e      the       c r o w d whi ch h a d            started           to    gather       was       mixed       with many

families           being        present.              The       behaviour           of    the       fans    was       good       humoured.

As     the a f t e r n o o n w o r e           on     the       crowd     steadily             built       up a n d     the       mood

became        fairly           hostile,            because        numerous           fans          were    milling          around

without        tickets,              at    this       time       I lost        count          of    the    number       of       people       wh o

approached              me a n d a s k e d           whether       I had        either             tickets       to    sell       or    just

spare.

I p e r s o n a l ly s a w a              number         of m e n sell iny'jfi c k e t s                  with     l a rg e      groups       of

people        stood around                 them,         who     were^rfHtviausly                  trying     to      buy     tickets         for

t he    g a me.         Du e    to    this         the     are/around               the       corner       shop w h i ch          is

directly adjacent                     to      the     football          stadium           became          particularly

congested.

The     vehicular              traffic         along Leppings                  Lane       itself          appeared          to    grind       to

search       of      persons          leaving           th e    vehicles          was     undertaken.

I recall          seeing          two    coaches             arrive     at    the       same     time,         two     officers

approached            o ne      vehicle and              the     remainder           of    the       serial         6 or 8 o f f i c e r s

approached            the       other        vehicle.            I r eca l l       thinking           that      there        was       less

officers          in t ha t        a r e a,    than          there     had    been        in    previous            years.         However

I must       say      that        1 had       several           arrests       t ake       place and            be 1 i eve     that       this

may have          drawn         strength away                  from    the    reception              party.

At    this     t im e      there        were       no    problems           and    no     real       c a use    for       concern

involving            public        disorder.

It s h o u l d       be    pointed           out    that M o u n t e d        officers           were      operating              in the

Leppings          Lane       turnstile             and       paddock        are a,      the     number         of    officers          being

two    sergeants,               one     of    those          being a S o u th Y or ks h ir e              O f f i ce r , four

I even       recall          seeing          a very attractive                    young        lady wi th           two    friends,

Due     to    the    density          of    the    crowd,       observations              regarding                pickpockets

became        centred around                the are a       immediately             in f r o n t         of    the m e t a l

fencing        in f r o n t      of    the       Paddock     turnstile             area.           The    observations                 team

loitering around                 the       corner     shop and          the    entrances             to       both       the N o r t h

stand and           the    Leppings          Lane     end    standing          entrances.

Whilst        at    this    location             I recall       moving        numerous             bottles          of      both

alcohol        and    soft       drinks          which    had     been     discarded               underneath               the

about,        these       people       obviously          had     no    tickets.           This          was       interferring

with     the       operation          to    catch     offenders           so m u c h      so       that       several         likely

suspects           were    moved       on    by the       officers.

At     2.20pm       (1 420)      or    thereabouts           the       crowd       became          very       dense,         so m u c h

so     that    the    observations                team    including           myself       was       forced            to m o v e      out

from     the a r e a       adjacent          to    the    metal        fencing       to a n a r e a            of      relative

enquired           about    tickets,             moved    into      the    paddock         area          and       towards

football         stadium.

After       a short         time ,      the        entire         obvservation                 team      re-joined           in the

aforementioned               area,       the        c r o w d at          this      time       now     being      very       dense       and

it s e e m e d       that    from       the        area     near          to     the     shop     some        considerable

distance         away       right       up to         the       ground           was     totally         blocked        by    people

moving        towards        the       ground.             By     this         time      vehicular            traffic        had       ceased

and    the     entire        c a rr ia ge way was                 blocked           by    people.

Whilst        stood w i t h DCs              H a 11am and L i l l e y and                      looking         down     into       the

paddock area w h i c h was                     now       totally           full        with      people       and     s t ill      more

walking        towards           the    ground,            I saw groups                  of    young      men     pushing          into       th

crowd,        th e    majority          of     these        being          the      worse        for     drink,       I saw        several

carrying         and       drinking          from        large        2    litre         bottles         of    both     lager          and

beer.

At    this     time        I noted       that         the P o l i c e            horse s were moving                  amongst           the

My    impression            of    the    s i t u a t i o n was             that        the     crowd was          becoming

I spoke           to    several        f an s      saying         "Don't       go    forward,         stay       back."           Many

The    mood      of     the     crowd was             now very             desperate           and     becoming          more       and

that    were     brought           in w e r e        blue      in the        face,       many      obviously             dead,        some

of w h i c h w e r e       still      being          attended          by f i r s t      aid      personnel.               I noted

that    several        of    the      bodies           (deceased)            had    vomitted            and     soiled

themselves           and    I recall          seeing           o ne w h i c h      had    blood         coming          from      his

head    body     orifices.

All    the     deceasejdkiSfhich w e r e                brought                    the    gym were            ac c o m e ^ w f ^ d      by

others       actually        being         carried.             I re c a l l       seeing         one    female          Police

officers        and    some       spectators              struggling              with    th e     body       of a s m a l l          young

male,     1 went       to    her      assistance               and    took        hold    of      the    boy and           carried

him    i nto    the m a i n h a l l         and        placed        him     on t h e     floor         along       with       the m a n y

others,        the    female        officer            then     stayed with              the      deceased.

Many    of     the    bodies        I saw        obviously            had     broken         limbs and             many were            in

some    form     of    state        of     undress.

Together        w i t h other         officers            mainly CID F 1 personnel,                           I moved amongst

officers        plastic          bags      and       l ab e l s .

                I am a m a r r i e d woman l i v i n g              at    the    above a d d r e s s ,

               On S a t u r d a y       15t h A p r i l    1989     ( 1 5 0 4 8 9 ) I was home

               On t h i s        d a y I knew t h a t L i v e r p o o l         & Nottingham F o r e s t            football        teams

               were        due t o      play each oth er            a t S h e f f i e l d Wednesday g r o u n d a t

               Hillsborough               in the      sem i-final         of    the      FA C u p .

               As H i l l s b o r o u g h      f o o t b a l 1 ground                                                                     one

               set        of    f a n s would have         to walk        p a s t my h o u s e .

               On t h e         day in q u e s t i o n     the    fans       turned out          to   be L i v e r p o o l .     I knew

               house           in the     direction        of the        ground.          IVje-emld a l s o     see    that      they
                                                                                                       PAGE

               were either drinking from or carrying                  pa^s   of bee r .   H o w e v e r , I must

               admit that they were quiet & not toeiryq disorderly.

               As the morning went on I could see the re were more fans turning up to

               the g r o u n d .

               As would be expected there was / mixture of ages & sexes                       in the

               crowd.      However,      I could see/Xhat the majority of youths who appeared

               to be in the 17 to 20 a g e /d racket we re also drinking from bee r cans &

               carrying     packs of b e ^ r /         This   carried on throughout the morning

               into the afternoon.

               I would like to say that on previous occ^rtTmf when cup ties have

               been held at Hillsborough there has i*lways been a large Police

               presence along the Leppings Ln route to the g r o u n d .                  However on 13th

CAT            April    1989       (150489)    there didprt appear to be as many P'olice around

               as we have on a norma/1 Lea/ue match day & I feel there should have
C C > M M 6 s / f been a larger Police                 ience along the route the fans would take to

                     to the ground.
\ c>
               At about 2.45 pm (1445)                 I did see a group of about 50 or more youths

               run past my house singing & shouting.                  However,   they were not causing

               any trouble.

                                                                                          S Dawes SIGNED

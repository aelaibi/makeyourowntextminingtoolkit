“I only live up the road from the ground so I walked. It was a long walk, I can tell you - especially
when you’re hounded by the media. I don’t really like to comment or give my observations about
what happened but I just like to mention two points:-

1. Why didn’t we delay the kick-off?

2. When the crowd was let into the rear of Leppings Lane why wasn’t there any officers to guide the
fans to the sides o f the terraces where there was ample room and the middle section cordoned off?”
(Pp.286-287)

                  arise         in       different             areas       during       a    football             match.

that       day.

At    9.45       a.m.    the       day       in    question,             I    paraded             for       duty    at    the

Hillsborough             Ground,             North       Stand.              It   was     a       glorious', s u n n y          day       and       th

hundreds          of    other          officers          on       duty       were    in       a    happy,          expectant             mood.

I have       always       enjoyed             working             on    bis       occasions             like       this       and    enjoy

the    carnival          mood          the    semi-final                brings.           I       can       remember          locking          back

up    the    stand       seeing             fellow       officers             laughing             and       joking.           None       of       us

aware       of    the    disaster             that       was       lurking          around,             a    time    bomb       ready          to

ex p l o d s .

Shortly          after    Chief             Superintendent                   Duckenfield,                   who    I had       not       met

previously             officiated             the       initial          briefing.                 The       briefing          was       the

normal       speech       we       get       at    all       football             matches,             along       with       other

"goodies'          one    can          expect       at       a    football          match          of       this    scale.            I sat

and    listened          to       what       was    being          preached          and          knew       already          that       I was

to    be    allocated             to    serial          no.       1,    the       perimeter             track.           This       duty       I

have       performed          on       several'occasions                      over       the       last       two    years.              I am

therefore          very       experienced                and       knowledgable                   of    my    duties          and

requirements.                 I always             tried          to    position          myself             in    front       of     the

North       Stand       approximately                   20       yards       east    of       gate          number       7.     After          the

briefing          I ate       a    small          packed          meal       in    the    North             Stand,       together           with

Police       Constables                Erookes,          Smith,          Illingworth,                   Cooksan,          W P C *s N i c h a l

and    Marsden.           We       sat       chatting             and    discussing                various          things          to    pass

the    time       quickly.              After       meal          we    took       different                positions          on    t he

perimeter          track.              I always          stand          talking          to       Police          Constable          Ercokes

before       the       match,          as    he    is    positioned                next       to       me,    some       20    yards        down

the    North       Stand.

About       -!2.30      p.m.       (1230)          the       first       supporters                came       into       the    ground             at

Leppings          Lane    terraces.                 Police             Constables             Smith          and    Illingworth                were

positioned             directly             in f r o n t           of     gates         4     and       5    respectively.                      The

Leppings          Lane          and    North         Stands             would        contain                the    Liverpool

supporters.              Police            Constables                   Brookes             and     myself              remained           in    front

of    the    North       Stand             talking.

Around       about          1    p . m . (1300)               Police       Constable                   Illingworth                  came       over       to   m\

position          and    asked             if   I     could          keep      an       eye        cn       his        gate.         I agreed             to

do    this       and    took          up    his       position.                 There             were        plenty           of    officers             in

front       of    the    North             Stand          so       1 didn't          mind.              By        this    time        a    steady

stream       of    Liverpool                supporters                  had        congregated                    behind        the       goal       in     the

bottom       standing             terraces.                    I had          built          up    a    rapport           with           several          fans

and    stood       talking             to       them.              They       were       in       high        spirits           and       all

convinced          their          passage                to    the      final           was       awaiting              them.            The     fans

generally          were          impeccable                   in    their          behaviour.                     It    was     a    pleasure             to

work    in       that       section             of       the       ground.              At    some           stage        in    the       proceedings

I was       joined          by    Police             Constable                Helliwell.

About       1.45       p.m.           (1345)         I    realised             that          I had           not       taken        my    allocated

meal    and       together              with         Police             Constable             Brookes,                 I went        to    obtain           my

meal    ticket          from          Police             Sergeant             Chapman             at     the       players           tunnel.              We

then    proceeded                to     the      West          Yorkshire                canteen              wagon        situated             behind

the    North       Stand           next         to       the       gymnasium*                 When           we    got     there,          we        were

told    that          the       canteen          had.shut                for       20    minutes.                  We     therefore              went

back    to       our    original                positions                in    front          of        the       North        Stand.

About       2.20        p.m.          (1420)         Police             Constable             Brookes              went        for       his     meal

while       I covered              both         our       positions.                    By    now           the    ground           was     rilling            up

nicely.           I    thought             at    the          time       though             there           was    still        a    lot        of    people

yet    to    come        in      and       time          was       getting          on.           About           i.45-    p.m.          Police

Constable             Brookes           returned               and       I wsnt             for     a       quick        bite       to     eat.        I

returned          shortly              before            kick       off       to    my       position.                    By    now        the

atmosphere             was        electric.                   As    I walked                back        to    my       position,            the       game

started.              When        I arrived               at       my    point          I    stood           facing        the        crowd.           Then
                                                                                                                                                         PAGE

about    si;< y o u t h s             jumped             over       the       concrete            wall           and    onto          the       perimeter

track.           At       first       I       was       astonished.                 I    m a n a g e d "to g r a b               hold          of    one

youth.       I       asked          him       if    he    had       a    ticket          which          he       h a d n ’t,         so    I    escorted

him    down          the       perimeter                track          towards          the       Police          Room.              I took          his

details          and       ejected             him       out       of    the       ground             via       'O’ gate             situated             on'

Penistone             Road,,          near          the       Spion          Kop.        As       I turned             to       go    back          onto       the

track,       I       saw       several             Police          Officers             run       from          the    gymnasium                onto          the

perimeter             track.              I    could          hear       garbled             messages             over          my    personal

radio    to          the       effect          that       there          was       some       trouble             at    the          Leppings             Lane

end.     I quickly                   ran       after          them       onto       the       track.              As    I       entered             the

ground       between                the       Spion       Kop          and    North          Stand          I    looked          down          to    t he

Leppings             Lane       end.           I    could          see       several          Police             Officers             stood          between

gates    4 and             5    and       what          appeared             to    me    to       be    a       crowd       spillage                or    some

sort    of       pitch          invasion.                 I    ran       up       the    track          beside          the          North          Stand,

the    football                match          still       continuing.                    I    took          up    my    original                position

in    front          of    the       North          Stand          as    I    thought             the       situation                behind          the

goal    in       tne       Leppings                Lane       terraces             was       policed             adequately.                    I thought

it    best       to       stand       fast          where          I    was       with       my       serial          and       make       sure          no    cne

else    came          over          from       the       North^Stand.                    At       this          point       I    d i d n ’t         realise

the    extent             of    the       situation                developing.                    Having          already             ejected             one

person,          I    t h o u g h t *t h at             the    spillage             behind             the       goal       was       due       to       other

idiotic          fans          climbing             over       the       fencing.                 I    didn't          see       much          else       that

was    happening                behind             me    as    I    was       facing          the       supporters                   in    the       North

Stand.           I    think          play          was    stopped             by    now.              The       crowd       in       the       North

Stand    were             u p .out        of       their       seats          and       seemed          to       be    shouting                and

pointing             over       to    the          Leppings             Lane       terraces.                    Some    were          booing,

gesticulating                   to    the          fans       behind          the       goal.           Probably                because             they

thought,             like       I    did,          it    ws    some          sort       of    crowd             invasion.                 They

appeared             to    be       incensed             and       the       situation                started          to       get       out       of

hand.        Supporters                   jumped          over          from       the       North          Stand       and          onto       the

               people.            During            the        chaos        I helped             to     stretcher              of      several         injured

passage          was      clear.                We   then        put       him    onto        his       back       again          and    Police

Const-able          Brookes                gave       heart       massage           whilst             I gave          him       the     kiss       of

life.        The         youth          vomitted            into       my    mouth.            I was             nearly          sick     myself.

I kept          saying         to       myself          'corns       on     pull        yourself            toegether                 this        lad        is

dying,          i t ’s    only          vomit*.             We      cleared         him       up    and          cleared          his        air

passage.            At        this          stage       a   woman          appeared           and       knelt          down       beside           me.

She-said,           "Let           me       help*       I'm a        staff         nurse."             At    this       she       took        charge

and     continued                 to    give         heart       massage           whilst          I    continued                to     give       mouth

to    mouth.             He       vomitted            several          times        and       I felt             like       giving           up    but

the     staff        nurse             was      great,         she         encouraged          all          of    us    to        continue.                     I

can     remember              feeling             the       youth's          body       and    thinking                ’it's           still       warm,

he     c a n ’t    be     d e a d ’.            We    continued              what       appeared             at    the       time        to       be        an

eternity,            but          to       no   avail.           The        staff       nurse          finally          stopped              pumping,

she     said,        "He's             dead,         h e ’s    gone."             The    staff- nurse                  then        got       up    and

went.       I never               saw       her      again.            I    presume       she          went       to    help           others.              I

can     remember              feeling             very'angry,                I was       totally             shattered.                  I    shook

the     body       and        I    can          remember         saying,           "You       bastard,             you       bastard."                      I

d o n ’t    know         why,          I    probably           just         had    to    let        go.          I failed              him.        I was

really          angry         towards             him.         There         he    was    just          lying          there,           I don           t

know       what      I    really                felt.

Anyhow,           Police           Constables;                 Andy         ana    myself           stretchered                   this       youth              off

the     pitch.            As       we       carried           him    someone            put    something                over           his    tace.

can     remember              Andy          getting           annoyed         and       pulled          it       off.        He        was    right                 as

well,       we     d i d n ’t w a n t             the       otner          supporters          to       think          he    was        dead.               To

them       he     was     just             another          injured          person       being             carried              off.        We     took

him     into       the        gymnasium               and      there         we    were       greeted             by    other           de-ad

bodies.            Rows           of       them      with      stunned            Policemen             stood          e v e r . them         like

black       crows.                Others          were        lying         down    or    sitting                down.            We    placed              our

                                                                                           R385




body into one of the rows.                  then took a body off a Special who had just

come in.     He was in no fit state to deal with it.               The rest was pretty non-

important.     We documented the bodies etc, we seemed to stand over them for

hours until we were told to go to another part of the gymnasium.                    I found

'my' youth's details on some personal papers.                  I'll never forget his name:-

DAVID WILLIAM BIRTLE,    D . O . B . .O 6 O 566

                                                                 or his face NEVER.

It's quite ironic I thought that David would have been 23 years this next

month.     His birthday was to be the day after my own - life can be full of

daft little things like that, 23 years, what a waste.
                                                                      0
After that I sat in the gymnasium with the other Police Officers waiting

hours and hours to get them identified and took down to the mortuary.                       The

atmosphere was obviously strained.                We sat around in little groups and kept

going over and over what happened.                We all had   our own little stories      to

tell.It helped quite a lot talking together.                   We even managed    tolaugh,

let s face it it's better than crying.                As a Police Officer you get used to

switching off your emotions - you have a job to do and you do it.                       That's

what all the training and years of experience drums into you.                    You don't

forget   you just p ush it aside - life goes on.

I went   off duty at 2.00 a.m.        (0200) the next morning.

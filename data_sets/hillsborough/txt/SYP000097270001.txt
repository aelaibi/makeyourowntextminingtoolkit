        The perception of this problem appears to differ according to the standpoint

        those at the receiving end.

        This to be actioned urgently as part of the preparation for the proof of

        Copy of report to DCC from Supt Parker (Communications) dated 25.4.89 'UHF
        radio installation at Hillsborough 15.4.89' supplied to Chief Supt Wain'.
                               UHF RADIO INSTALLATION
                               HILLSBOROUGH - 15.4.89

1.       EQUIPMENT

1.1      There  is a permanent UHF      radio  scheme installed at the ground   for
          policing all football matches.   This scheme was used for the F. A.   Cup
          semi-final on 15th April 1989.

1.2      The   radio set is provided by the Directorate of Telecommunications and
          referred to as a ¥15U portable base station.    It  is   in fact a Pye
          Westminster Mobile    radio  adapted for use as a temporary fixed base
          station.   This type of installation is in frequent use at all  football
          grounds   in the Force    and by   most other forces    who have similar
          requirements.   The set is powered by mains electricity and  is  located
        ~ in the police control room.

1.3       The aerial for the Hillsborough installation is on the floodlight pylon
          at the side of the police control room.  The scheme provides cover  for
          a radius of approximately 1 mile.   The definitive area of cover can be'
          established by the Directorate if required.

2.       METHOD OF OPERATION

2.1      The ¥15U can be operated in either 'talk-thro' or 'non ta lk-thro1 mode
         by pressing or releasing a button on the radio set.  The choice is with
         the radio control operator.

2.2      The radio operator in the control room uses a handset with a 'press  to
         talk'  switch and a speaker for incoming messages.  The installation at
         Hillsborough has a 'tulip' microphone which stands on the desk in front
         of the controller and an in-car radio speaker, also desk mounted.

2.3      It is normal practice at Hillsborough to use the UHF radio scheme on
         talk-thro' and this was the case on the 15th April 1989.   Talk-thro' is
         also used at other grounds in. the force for policing football matches.

3.       EFFECT OF TALK-THRO' CHOICES

3.1      Talk-Thro'   on

3.1.1    Everyone with a radio, turned on to the appropriate channel,    can hear
         all transmissions by anyone else, including the control room.

3.1.2    If more than one radio  transmits  at any one time     all other   sets
         including the control room, get all the messages.   However, it becomes
         increasingly difficult to understand individual messages  when several
         officers are speaking.
If the   controller  is transmitting    on the handset     and one of the
personal radios transmits at the same time, then the control output    is
cut off.     All the users, including the controller, will receive the
message from the personal radio.     This  arrangement  is   electrically
built  into the equipment.       It can only be overcome by de-selecting
talk-thro.

T al k-Thro1 Off

If the controller transmit?, all sets switched on to that      channel   will
receive.

A message   transmitted   from   a   personal   radio   is only heard on the
controllers set.

Whilst the controller is transmitting any of the personal   radios  can
transmit and the message will be received on the controllers set.   The
transmitting personal radio will not receive the message being sent by
control.

EQUIPMENT OPERATION ON 15.4.89

The  scheme was   in operation    from the time of the briefing around
10.00a.m. on the day.  A member of communications  department  was  on
stand-by at the ground, in the gymnasium to assist with communication
problems should they arise.   He had a Pye PFX multi-channel     radio
switched on all the     time,   and was using an earpiece extension to
receive incoming messages.

The equipment worked without incident until about 2.15 p.m.     At this
time  it was noticed that messages from the controller were 'clipped.1
Whilst it was possible to understand what was said the  full   text was
not being transmitted.      Messages  passed by personal     radios, (on
talk-thro') were not affected.

At 2.30 p.m. the communication staff went to the control room to attend
to the   fault.  As a contingency at sejni-final matches a stand-by W15U
is provided in the control room, with battery back up in the   event  of
mains power failure.

The  first check made was to exchange the microphone between the set in
use and the stand-by, which did not clear the fault.

The stand-by set was then taken into use.  This  involved moving   the
aerial  connection  from one set to the other and connecting the mains
power supply by inserting the plug.
4.6   The new set continued to be         used on   talk-th.ro', but when  the
       communications  staff left the controller was using a Motorola portable
       set instead of the microphone provided.   This has the effect of making
       the controller equal to all other resources in respect of transmission
       and receipt of messages.  The microphone and speaker were connected  to
       the replacement W15U but not taken into use.

4.7   The UHF radio continued to operate without          incident from this time.

5.    RADIO CONTROL OPERATIONAL ORDER

5.1   Paragraph 4.11 of the operational        order deals with radio control on          the
       day and is produced below:-

      "4.11     COMMUNICATIONS

       4.11.1 All communications relevant         to    the   event   will   be    directed
              through Ground control.

       4.11.2 The  following UHF/VHF channels will be utilised in relation to'
              this operation:-

                (A)     UHF personal radio channel   25 will          be used by          all
                        supervisory officers,    both inside           and outside        the
                        ground.

                (B)     UHF personal radio channel 19 will be used by   all  CID
                        personnel   engaged on duties    in the Parson Cross and
                        Neepsend private parking areas.

                (C)     VHF radio channel 1 will be used by mobile patrols.

       4.11.3   'FI' Sub-Division's operational functions will continue              to   be
                transmitted on UHF personal radio channel 35.

       4.11.4 Personal  radios will be issued at the Administration Desk in
              the gymnasium to all supervisory officers.

       4.11.5 Strict radio discipline will be maintained at all         times.
              Messages  must be kept as short as possible and, where this is
              not the case, Ground Control has    the  overriding   option of
              cutting short any transmission, irrespective of rank.

       4.11.6 Ground    Control   can   also    be     contacted on internal extension
              3277."

5.2   In connection paragraph 4.11.5 of the Operational Order this                situation
      cannot prevail unless talk-thro' is de-selected.

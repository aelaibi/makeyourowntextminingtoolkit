   Dear Sirs,

    Hillsborough Disaster - 15th April 1989,

   I write to you as a Liverpool Football Club Season Ticket Holder and Shareholder,
   v*io was present in the North Stand at the ill-fated Semi-Final between Nottingham
   Forest and Liverpool.

   Hie first point that I wish to make is regarding the allocation of tickets for
   this match. As you are probably aware, Liverpool Football Club have an average
   attendance of 39,000 whereas Nottingham Forest have an average attendance of
   19,000/20,000. Therefore to give Liverpool Football Club 23,500 tickets and
   Nottingham Forest approximately 29,000 cannot make sense, and quite frankly, shows
   conteanpt by the Footballing Authorites for the Supporter who attends Liverpool
   matches each and every week and yet, was unable to obtain tickets for this najor
   match.

  It has been said that the reason for this discrepancy in the allocation was due to
  traffic control. It was stated that traffic fran Liverpool would cane along the
  M62 and dewn the Ml leaving at Junction 36 and then travel down the A61 and would
  park on roads off Halifax Road. Although quite a lot of traffic did cane along
  this rcutey many thousands of vehicles did travel fran Liverpool along "the snake"
  and "Woodhead Passes" and therefore parked along Penistone Road which is situate
  on the south/east side of the ground, and supporters leaving their cars would have
  to valk through the Nottingham Forest section to reach Leppings Lane. I
  respectfully submit that it is therefore nonsense to say that by allocating
  Liverpool the north and \rest sides of the ground, it would avoid meeting
  Nottingham Forest supporters.

  It is interesting to note, that prior to the match the atmosphere outside the
  ground was highly good natured and that there were no reports of any trouble
  between the various sets of fans.

                                                                            cont.........

       I would therefore like to add, that if the Football Association were insistent
       upon Hillsborough being a suitable venue for this match, there would not have
       taken much imagination/re-routing of traffic, to enable Liverpool Football Club to
       have the kop end (east end) terracing and Nottingham Forest to have the other
       side of the ground.

      Secondly, there is the matter of control inside and outside the ground, We
      arrived in our seats. North Stand (Rw 11 seats 68/71) at approximately 1.40 p.m.
      during which tine the ground was quite esnpty. As kick off approached, it was
      noticeable that the two centre sections of Lepping lane terracing vere becaning
      very full, but the two wing sections were in places sparsely populated. Fran
      newspaper and press reports, it appears that the oanputer informed the Police
      outside the stadium that there were still 3000 places available on the terracing
      and, I understand, that it is for this reason that the additional gate was cpend.
      One can only assure that the Police outside the stadium were not informed of the
      whereabouts of those 3000 spaces as, it appears that the gate which was opened,
      led directly into the centre terracing and it was not even possible for supporters
      who came through these gates to enter the wing sections. Obviously, being in my
      seat since 1.40 p.m. I cannot Garment on exactly what happened outside the
      stadium, I can only mate observation fran vhat I saw fran ny eeat and fron what I
      have seen and read since the event.

      Having watched football matches for many years, X have noticed Police procedure in
      controlling crowds and, in Merseyside and Greater Manchester crowds, when queues
      are about to form, the Police (usually on horseback) usually insist upori
      supporters standing in orderly queues to enter into the turnstiles Fran
      television pictures, it appears that there were cnly two police horses at the
      Lepping Lane turnstiles and this is always going to be inadequate to control
      approximately 4000 supporters waiting to enter the ground just prior to kick off.

      Notwithstanding all the above, I feel that there is one matter vfrich has not been
      stated by the media since the event and, which I believe to be totally fundamental
      to the disaster - namely the arrangements made for Liverpool supporters entering
      the Stadium, I have attended Sheffield Wednesday -v- Liverpool league matches at
      Hillsborough over a period of many years and until recently, have watched these
      games fran the North Stand, (this area is now an area reserved for Sheffield
      Wednesday members only). These matches were always well attended, but to my
      knowledge, there has never been a full house of 54,000 for a league match between
      these tvro sides. When entering the North Stand for these matches, cne enters the
      turnstiles especially designated for the North Stand vhich are at the east side of
                                                                  oont.

        the North Stand (near to the Kop entrance) and not at the Leppings Lane
        turnstiles. These turnstiles were not open for this match and it has been the
        policy not to cpen these turnstiles for semi-finals notwithstanding the fact that
        a capacity attendance is expected. In other words, 23,400 Liverpool supporters
        had to walk down Leppings Lane and all enter the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
        Approximately 10,000 of these supporters would then walk into the North Stand.

        If one looks at the entrance to the Leppings Lane turnstiles, one will notice that
        it refers specifically to Leppings Lane seating and’standing accomodation and no
        mention is made above these turnstiles regarding entrance to the North Stand. In
        other words, during normal matches, supporters who wish to sit in the North Stand,
        do not enter through these turnstiles. If the North Stand turnstiles had been
        opened, approximately 10,000 supporters would not have been required to enter
        through the Leppings Lane turnstiles and therefore, only approximately
        13,000/14,000 supporters would have entered the fifteen turnstiles in Leppings
        Lane and, queues would not have formed so quickly and it is therefore quite
        conceivable that at 2.45 p.m. there would have been under 2000 people waiting
        cutside Leppings lane and not the reported 4000 people.

        It will be stated that the reason for not opening the turnstiles in the North
        Stand was that these turnstiles were near the Forest supporters. Quite frankly,
        if the Police feared that there would be trouble between rival supporters, then it
        would not be too difficult , to have a small cordon of Police Officers outside the
        North Stand turnstiles to avoid any trouble which, the writer believes was not
        likely to happen because of the good natured humour of the crowd outside the
        stadium.

        I have attended seni-finals at Hillsborough in 1980 and 1987. In 1980 1 was
        sitting in the West Stand and left the ground at the Leppings Lane turnstile.
        Appraxirately 23,000 Liverpool supporters had to leave using the same turnstiles
        and the crush leaving the ground was frightening. In view of this experience, in
        1987 when I was sitting in the North Stand, at the end of the match I tried to
        leave the stadium using the North Stand turnstiles but, upon reaching the exit, I
        noted that the gates were locked and it was quite impossible for any supporters to
        leave through this exit and therefore, I had to leave along the back of the North
        Stand and out through Leppings Lane and again, the crush was unbearable.

        I can only assume that in semi-finals at Hillsborough when Liverpool were not
        involved, supporters using the Leppings Lane end of the ground had to endure
        similar difficulties. In view of these difficulties encountered over many send
        finals, one would believe that the relevant authorities would open as many
        turnstiles as possible, to avoid crushing at the beginning and end of the match,
        but it appears that is has taken a disaster like this for the lesson to be learnt.

       Finally, I would like to make a point regarding the wider issue of ticket
       allocation/overcrowding during Cup Finals at Wembley. As ycu are probably aware,
       until this season, 98,000 tickets are issued for the F.A. Cup Final at Wembley and
       25,000 tickets go to each of the carpeting finalists. In other words 48,000
       tickets are distributed throughout other clubs affiliated to the Football
       Association. During recent years, it has appeared increasingly evident that the
       issue of 25,000 tickets to the Clubs with large followings is far frcm sufficient.
       Many fans without tickets have been approaching the Wembley Stadium and this has
       been partly responsible for the crushing outside certain entrances prior to kick
       off. The scenes have turned ugly due to the desperation of supporters wishing to
       see the game and being unable to enter the Stadium.

       I feel that is merely good luck, and not good management that there has not been
       major disaster outside Wembley Stadium in the last few years.

       Clubs have stated that this problem can be avoided by giving the two carpeting
       clubs increased allocations - particularly to those clubs like Liverpool who have
       a very large following. The Football Association, in their vrisdan, have said this
       is not possible?that the F.A. Cup Final is "football's day" and not just a day for
       the supporters of the carpeting clubs. The F.A. state that people who spend many
       countless hours keeping local football clubs up and dcwn the Country afloat should
       be entitled to be given an opportunity to see a major showpiece of the season. I
       submit that in principal this sounds admirable but, in practice, many of the
       pecple to whan these tickets are issued do not utilise them themselves but sell
       them at ■ a vastly inflated price, through Agencies or otherwise to supporters who
       are desparate to see the match.

       Ihis obviously causes resentment and at last years F.A. Cup Final - for example,
       the sight of touts with wads of tickets in their possession was too nuch for sane
       supporters and the odd fracas ensued.

       Prior to the Hillsborough Disaster, it was announced that the capacity at Wembley
       Stadium for this years F.A. Cup Final would be reduced to 88,000 and that the
       carpeting clubs would only receive 22,500 tickets each. Hcwever, since the
       disaster, I understand the Football Association have announced that if the final
       takes place, then the carpeting clubs will be given a minimum of 35,000 tickets

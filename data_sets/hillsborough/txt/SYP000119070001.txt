           I commenced duty at 0800 am, Saturday,      15 April 1989, and paraded for

           briefing at Niagara Sports Club at 0900 am.        We were briefed for duty

           by Superintendent Marsh and Inspector Phenix.        My duties were to be

           OG20 in company with PC 2522 Shilitoe of Vest Yorkshire Police Dog

           Section.     We were to patrol Penistone Road North,    paying particular

           attention to the entrance to the South Stand car park at Highbridge,

           Parkside Road and Catchbar Lane, extending to Bradfield Road as

           required to assist OGS2      in that location.   (PS 2227 Dent)

           At 1000 am that date we commenced patrol.        In order to effectively

           cover our designated patrol areas it was neces sary to occasionally

           travel along Leppings Lane, Herries Road and Herries Road South,           as

           well as occasionally straying onto Middlewood Road.

           There was a steady build up of supporters throughout the mor ning with

           movement of fans towards the ground but also back towards city.            All

           was good natured.

           At about 1230 pm as a result of radio mess ages we began to monitor

           the Royal Hotel at the junction of Bradfield Road and Penistone

           Road.   A large number of Nottingham supporters were inside and an

           equally large number were outside on the footpaths,        drii     from

           glasses, bottles and cans.       Four P C ’s and a Sergeant w^|     ted
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          R268

across the road to monitor the situation although at that time,

alth ough boisterous,    all was good natured.

Numbers of fans moving along Penistone Road was increasing and it was

apparent that a large proportion of the crowd either had been,            or

indeed still were drinking.       Cans and bottles were being carried

op enly and groups were sat around drinking.         At about 1.35 p m   (1335)

a radio message was received to the effect that two Special Constables

were   in difficulty somewhere along Penistone Road towards Hillfoot

Bridge.     We patrolled along that road in search of the specials but

without success.      At least three other pubs in that area were open

and large numbers of boisterous Notts,        fans were drinking outside and

also apparently inside.       Having worked other big games at

Hillsborough in the past I was surprised by the number of pubs open

and serving fans.      It was also apparent that local off-licences

around Middlewood Road/Catchbar Lane and the ground area were serving

the fans with alcohol.

At 1.40 pm (1340) a radio message was received from the Sergeant

stationed at the Royal Hotel that the crowd outside were becoming

hostile and that one bottle had been thrown across the road towards

the Officers.     We attended within seconds and spoke with the Sergenat

who said that the Licensee had been outside to say that the fans

inside were    ’smashing the place u p ’ and he had requested further

assistance, and directed us to await their arrival.           I would estimate

there was at least 200 fans outside the Royal Hotel.           The area was

covered with glasses,     cans and bottles and other smaller groups were

across the road from the pub also drinking.          There was a great deal

of noise coming from within and the place was obviously packed to

bursting.     A large proportion of this number were s t ill d r A n k j n g from

cans and bottles.      On arrival of other Officers the pup ware q m p t ied

and the fans moved away towards the ground.          The pub I 'Ofewm, was
                                                                        PAGE
                                                                        R268

closed and staff began to clear up outside.     The fans were still on

the whole good natured.

We resumed patrolling our points at about 2.20 pm (1420) and the

vicinity of the ground was extremely busy.     Still    large numbers of

the Notts.   Fans were drinking on their way to the ground,     and there

was also movement of fans along Parkside Road onto Leppings Lane.

From the radio I was aware that at about 2.35 pm (1435)       Leppings Lane

was closed to traffic.

Catchbar Lane and Middle wood Road was heavy with fans,      a large

proportion of w h o m were drinking and just standing around in groups.

Numerous radio messages were being received in respect of the crush

taking place at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

At about 3 pm (1500) a radio message was received that all dog

sections were to enter the ground via gate 0.       We atte nded from

Parkside Road and were directed with dogs onto the tunnel between the

North Stand and the Spion Kop.    We were directed to remain there.            I

could see fans were running around the playing area.        We were being

spat on from the Notts,   fans above us in the Spion Kop.      Gradually

casualties were being brought off the pitch area via that tunnel and

we were directed to standby outside the ground with our vehicles.

We returned to Penistone Road North, Gate 0.     We assisted in holding

back fans who were attempting to enter the ground through gate 0 as

ambulances were being reversed into the ground.        At this point

PC Shilitoe and I became separated.    I believe he returned into the

ground to assist Ambulance Staff, without his dog, and I remained

outside the ground.

At about 3.30 pm (1530) we were directed by radio back onto the pitch

with dogs.   Myself and a number of other Dog Section Officers were

deployed by Chief Superintendent Nesbit in a line beh            i   Spion

Kop goal.    Some fighting broke out in the North                    the half
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         R268

way line and a number of dogs were re-directed to move to the

perimeter track facing that stand.      I remained behind the Spion Kop

goal.

At about 4.30 pm (1630) we were directed back to our phase three

points,    ours being Parkside Road/Penistone Road.     We took that

position and monitored the crowd leaving, which in the whole was

subdued and quiet.

At about 4.45 pm (1645) a radio message was received of fighting in

Hillsborough Park.     We attended on foot with dogs,     but were overtaken

by Mounted Officers.     The fight was at the Middlewood Road end of the

park and was broken up by Mounted.

At 5.05 pm (1705) we were re-called to fighting in the park.            Again

it appeared to be at the Middlewood Road end of the park and we could

play no part.     We continued duties with other Officers,      directing

traffic and attempting to clear a way through for Hospital staff and

emergency service vehicles.

At about 6.30 pm (1830)    traffic had cleared and we were called to

Niagara.     Enroute PC Shilitoe visited the Hillsborough Gym with a

personal cassette handed to him having been found on the pitch.               We

were on standby at Niagara until stood down at 7.30 pm (1930) and

went of duty at 8 pm (2000)

I have been present at other    ’Big M a t c h e s ’ at Hillsborough in the

past both as Dog Section and Uniform.       In general the Policing       of the

game appeared to be as the normal plan.       However, I was amazed       at the

drinking taking place amongst the fans, most of which that I was

involved with being Notts,    fans.   In the past local pubs have

remained closed,    or merely admitted regulars via rear doors, but on

this date many seemed open as usual and indeed packed o u I l L o c a l

off-licences appeared to be serving to fans,       and I c a nnnr. irfectail ever

           Further to my previous report; whilst on standby outside       ’Gate O ’ in

           Penistone Road,    I assisted in gaining access into the ground by

           ambulances.     As soon as the gates were opened by ground staff a

           number of small groups were attempting to enter the ground,

           effectively blocking access to the ambulances.        With other officers I

           kept the gates clear for ambulances to enter and leave the ground,

           whilst other officers cleared traffic whilst the ambulance vehicles

           manoeuvred in order to reverse into the ground.        I remained on that

           duty for several minutes until Dog Section were directed back into

           the ground and onto the pitch.

           Due to the nature of the incident I am unable to give an exact time

           for the above duty, although it was approximately between 3.10pm

           (1510) and 3.30pm (1530).

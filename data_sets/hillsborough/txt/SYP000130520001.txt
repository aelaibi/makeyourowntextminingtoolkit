After Mr D U C K E N F I E L D ' S briefing w h i c h was an open forum,                                                                                                               we    split

into two groups,                                        I believe                         those                 inside,                     and those                           outside     the ground.

Be f o r e Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D U C K E N F I E L D had concluded his address,

comments were made                                             or q u e stions were a s k e d by other                                                                           officers.           I cannot

Once             the two groups                                   had been split up,                                                 we were                       briefed by Supt

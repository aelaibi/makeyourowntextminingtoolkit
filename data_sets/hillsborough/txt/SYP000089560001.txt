subs eq ue nt     escort     to Hillsborough.



F rom early on it became              very     c 1 ear    that    very few Liverpool          fans      had

made    their way to S h e f f i e l d       in this manner.



Most of the        fans who a r r iv ed were             quiet.     Some   had to be spoken to

s ternly and an assor tm en t              of tins,       cans etc    including a few beer                cans

had to be taken from them.



Many of the        early arrivals           did not wis h to go directly to the ground,

wi shing    instead to go           into town.           As was   normal    procedure        for such a

large m atch they were              not    permitted to do so.             Some    fans who arrived

had been drinking           but those who          I saw did not yappear d r u n k .              However,

'Many of these       fans were young            teenagers,



Some    fans a rr iving at the station did not have m oney                           (£1)    to   pay for

the bus to the ground.                They were          forced to    pay with m oney borrowed

•from other       fans.

P y S .V . f ull to the grouiyr. When fans got onto thy? bus many

tried to avoid            paying for the service           trying     to    push their way on.

iiany were fetched back               to the driver and ordered              to   pay their     fare,



En    route      to the ground many of the fans were                  quiet.        One or two had to

be a d v i se d about        their    general    behaviour and when the driver                 checked

his    cash it was obvious               that despite     our attempts        some    fans    had still

s u cc ee de d    in getting       on without        paying.



The P .S .V . was         e sc orted via a p re -d et e r m i n e d   route.



O n getting        near    the    ground    I could see many fans           sitting about        in

public areas            in the v ic inity of off         licences and       pubs and near        feeding

houses.          The re did not appear          to be much      in the way of trouble.



On    reaching         the ground the fans were met            by other       officers.       They were

escorted         off    the bus and       pointed towards       the L ep pings Lane          entrance.

H o w e v e r , they were        being    told by Police Officers - Go over                  there -

                           our    bus PC H AR DWICK and myself             remained on the bus and

returned to the station.                   Radio messages       s ug gested that       not

The    conge stion      in the Leppi ng s Lane area had grown worse.                       As

ground.        To my knowledge        none were       successful.



We made    our way through the             crowd         the LeDpi nos bane            end and gained

entry to the ground.              I heliev          is was a r o u n d / H .HO    pm    (1420),       I was

Whilst we wa it ed here many fans passed                        who    had been arrested,             Many

of these were          o b v i ou sl y drunk and rrijamy were also abusive.                Some were

Liverpool       fans.

I recall       going     to a large sliding             gate    (believed to be Gate A)             in

order    to get outside          the ground.            O ff icers   looked through a small

w in do w and      it was    decided        it was     unsafe   to open     it because       of the

crush outside.            This   gate was ma nn ed by a steward.



We then made         our way to another              gate   inside    the ground.



W he n we     passed behind the turnstiles                   I could see     people    sitting

against       the wall      who were        gasping     for breath.        People ^ s r e    screaming

a nd shouting as          they   came       through the turnsti 1 es/<fiouting              it was

fact    one    senior     gentlemans         language wasrso         bad   I felt   I should advise

him.     I did so but he persisted w h ic h then made me more aware                             of the

problems w hich          I realised may have             existed outside.

The Gate C let us out of the ground                         into the side      road near      the    river.

I cannot       recall     whether       or not the gate was           closed behind us         - but

no-one      came    through      it as we went out.             I can only      recall      a few of our

serial      outside with me.

 teeing any othe j/'of f i ce r s at this           point.



I believe we made           our way      in front    of the turnstiles and stopped

people       running    towards       them.    A tt empts were made        to stop    people

climbing       over    the wall       - but without much success.              An officer      on

h orseback was also          unable      to    reach them.



                               Later     I recall    an    Inspector      standing
                                                                           of the t urnstiles

stopping       people    c Limbing      in.



At this    point the p r e s syfe s eemed to have eased and I saw t h a ^ s o m e h o w

the    perimeter g a tesy^ k d b een closed w ith at least one moffffted o f f i c e r

As the       c o ng es ti on e ased    in this are a there were           still    some    people

crushing ag ai ns t        the turnstiles.          Ar ou nd this     time   I made my w ay to

the hand       r a il /c ra sh barrier a n d the side         of turnsl        e G.       I saw that

To the best of my k nowledge                  the flow of fans       through that         gate was

quite    light      only being        those who queued to go through the                  turnstiles



Many fans despite           being      crushed    refused to enter         the ground this way

and    continued to        push and shove          to get through the turnstiles



V i r t u a l l y ^ f those      I directed thro ug h the Gate C had their                    tick

their h-atfds.        I could not see          if stewards       or Police      officers ^5e re

I ran back        into   the ground and met            up w ith other officers.               Because    of

c ongestion       instead      of going d ir ectly onto          the terrace       I led officers

a ro un d   past the Police         control.



When    passj^TgN through the gate             under    the    control   we    e x p e r ie nc ed a delay

of 2 0 - 3 0 f    mis    was     because    the steward manning          the gate had m i s p la ce d

his key or someone             else had      it.   Whe n the     lock was      undone we had to

pull    someone      off the top of this gate              to allow      it to open.



I then ran through the S o ut h Stand and down the first a i s 1s_ towards

the    pitch.



Whe n running        down this       I had to      push 5-6 stewards          out of my way who

were    standing      looking      towards Leppi ng s Lane           terrace.



I vaulted over           the wall     and    ran towards       the   terrace,      I cannot      recall

if players were           on the    pitch or not.

unsure      of what       to do at     this    point and felt          inadequate at being           unable

to    reach those who            needed help,



The      south t erracing was          not as     congested but          there were       no Police

     Whilst      no-one        came over       1 gestured           to fans    to move       back.     This was to

     keep the terracing                near    the front           clear.     One y outh      in particular          I

The    bodies were           passed thj^tgugh the gate at          chest     height    for treatment

- we made       no attempt              treat anyone         on the terraces.



When    no more bodies           were    being      passed out    I realised that         the    pressure

had eased       in the        central    pen and officers were able             to get     into that

area to help.           I also       noticed that some of^the wire              fencing had been

ripped open.          I then w m t          and

Once out on the              pitch   I looked ar ou nd for        persons     needing     first aid.

S ee in g no-one      in obvious         need I tried to comfort            survivors and tried

to ask    those who were able                to move    to in front of the south stand so

as there was more              room to treat         those ser io us ly     injured.



Some   time     later        I became aware        of Liverpool      fans    running    towards      the

K op end and the Nottingharri fans,                     I tried to    calm them and at one

point had to go into                 the stand to pull         out two fans who        had been

g es ti c ul a ti n g at the         Liverpool fans.          They were s tr ongly      a d v is ed and

m o v ed away    - in different             c ir cumstances     they w o u« W have     been a r r e s t e d .

In spite of what              they had seen - m any w an t e d the m atch to start.



When    things     calmed down          I comforted         some young    probationers and         iater

As m e n t i on ed before        the fans were quiet             to start with,           livening up

nearer       the kick     off.     Many had been drinking                 en route      to the ground

and once at the ground or the v ic inity                       continued to drink.



Once       the disaster     had occur re d man y fans              not near enough to help were

evident        in the a r a a    in front     of the terraces             in front of the

turns ti le s a l t h o u g h they did man the gates.                    Some     took time         to get

gates opened and others              stood and w a t c h e d without              getting        i n v o 1v e d .   I

recall       hearing a steward           threat en in g     to take his stewards bib off                       as

he said they were           no use       and nobody was listening                 to t h e m .

R ad io s    continued to work throughou|/rthe incident — to the                                 best of       my

r ec ol le ct ion and without            any b l e a k s.     The air          traffic was fairly

congested but very              little    ijr the way of o rders or d irections were

given.



Little       or no use was made of the              public address              system and a proper

a n n ou nc e m en t   could have    helped ease          the s it uation         in the

terraces and           relieved tension a ro u n d the             rest of the ground by

informing        other    fans    of what was happening.



Throu gh o u t     the   incident    I felt      in no danger,            but    felt   inadequate           in

trying to save           others.

              A part         from those who were at the                  terracing    few seemed to       realise    the

              scale of the              problem.       Hence    the      considerable     delay    in ONE a mbulance

              coming to the t erracing                  being      careful    NOT to drive on the           pitch.



              F ro m early on 1 felt               trouble      could occur with so many              people   outside

              the       ground but as        1 said before            only    1000 fans    out of     18000-20000      came

              to the station,              so m any t ra velled on special              trains     or under    their    own

2.15 piti {iyT s )r . I arrived later in Sheffield than I expected due to

traffic congestion at the end of the M63 in Stockport and further

delays on the roads between Stockport and the start of the Wood Head

Pass.    I approached Sheffield via the Wood Head Pass which led on to

the A61 dual    carriageway. However the traffic was not congested in

this area at the time I arrived, and the traffic was m o v i n g .

After parking the car I headed straight f o r the gr oun d. I consumed no
                       <5©£ -                              j
alcohol and I reached the ground at ^ffproximately 2.30pm (1430). On

route to the ground there appeared to be no Police              control or checking

of tickets. I entered the Le ppi nj^s'Ln section of the ground through
  C * "        T      *
turnstile B . However the area immediately outside the turnstiles w a s

severely conge^fed. Although there were a small number of moiirjJ^d

Police   p res> m t,h g ^ were unable to control the crowd. Thet^eywas ]QO

formal queue>rf^ and the small ryafnber of Police          immediately outside the

turnstiles seemed to leave everyone to fend for w'femselves. I was                  in a

crush for approximately 15-20 minutes          immediately outside the

turnstiles 8.   I counted that there were 7 turnstiles and the

  pectators were entering the groujw slowly. Whilst I was in this

                                                     < y^K X
crush I noticed that the P o 1 i w e r e     allowing     people to climb into the

ground over a wall and\ovejr the turnstiles.           Whilst   I was   in the crush

I saw one spectator    pass out but the people I assumed to be with

him kept him in an upright position and eventually were able to

manhandle him through the       turnstile. Outside the ground immediately

before entering turnstile       B the loud speaker system was very faint.

The announcer was telling       people to be p a t i e n t ^ ^ t r h e r e was plenty of

 room inside the gr ou nd . I   eventually ^ c n ^ e d through the turnstiles            at

.-.approximately 2.40 (1440)~2.45pm (1^>45).       I had waited in the area

 immediately outside the turnstile        (i.e.   inside the ground)       until my

two friends entered the ground. We then immediately started Vo head

 for the terracing. However at this time          (approximately 2 . ^ 5 pm (1445)         I

noticed that Mne Police and/or steward opened a ga^K'Tmmediate ly to

our r i g h ^ .y^As we expected a rush of peopli\thj»migh the gate we ran

towards the standing area.               I immediately headed towards the tunnel

which I now understand led underneath the W Stand to the middle of

the Leppings Ln standing area. However my friends directed me in the

opposite direction to the corner of the ground between the W Stand and

the S Stand. On immediately entering the ground through the turntiles

the tunnel     is the first entrance you approach and there is a natural

instinct to enter the ground throuoiT that tunnel

There was no evidence of any stewards outside l*Ke tunnel or inside the

ground at all other than atr the gates and^Xfurnsti les on the inside of

the ground.
                              C/
I took my position i^'the wings of the Leppings Ln eptd of the ground

which happened            be adjacent to what           I believe^^fs the Police Control

Box.

I took up my /l anding          position at approximate ly 2. 4S pm             ) to

2.50pm ( ^ 6 0 )     and at that time there was            plenty of room in the section

in which I was standing.             There was no crush in that section

whatsoever.      Shortly a&ter the match kicked off I noticed severe

overcrowding in th;g central section of the Lepping^iln standing area.

I noticed that jreople were trying to climb o>er the barrier between

the ground \prya the pitch and that i i l l t ia^ly the Police were trying to

keep the spectator's within 4 l i e ^ ? o u ^ P 'However more and more people

were attempting to get out of the ground and onto the pitch and it

was obvious th^ir there was a major probiejjp-itv that area of the ground,

Eventually     js.             iceP'ran onto >fte pitch towards the

The scenes that f o l l o w ^ were horrific.              There apepared to be nq r e°~

ordination or c o n t r y o L   by             Police. It seemed to be an age before any

assistance was given to the spectators trying to escape from that

centre section of the q^tfund.

1' saw a large number of spectators             lying on the pitch with Police

Officers, St Jq^ns Ambulance Q ffJ ? i? e rs and Fire Officers at va^<fous

times attermjafting to give h^art massage and/or the ki^s o x life.

However the whole thi no/was haphazard and nobody seeffred to in control

or in charge of t in s / s it ua t io n . For example when an ambulance       came into

the ground instead of driving across              the pitch right to the area

in question it proceeded slowly around the side of the ground,

apparently unaware of the urgency.

I noticed that from the Police          control     room both a photographer was

taking still      photographs of the happenings and also they were recorded

on video.

l'n addition to the Police, Firemen and St. Johns Ambulance many of the                       j


spectators joined in the rescue operation. At one time Police                                 j


Officers were assisting the spectators              in breaking down the fence

between the pitch and the ground on the N side of the Leppings Ln

section.     The spectators tore down advertising hoardings and used them

as makeshift stretchers.        I saw no violence between the spectators and
                                                                                              j

the Police or any of the services.             The only things    I witnessed were

angry verbal attacks against the Police for failing to help and assist                        i

in the rescue operation and in failing to control                the crowd.   I also          ■

saw anger directed to press photographers who were morbidly taking

photosofthedeadandinjured.

During the whole of the time I did not witness any of the spectators                          ,
                                                                                              i

I left the ground at approxi                  y 4.QQpm (1&QQ) and on my way back to

the car I witnessed v a r i o u ^ a n g r y    confrontations between spectators

and Police.      The s pe ctato rs we re all blami ng the Police for failing to

control the crowd and obviously blamed them for the events that had

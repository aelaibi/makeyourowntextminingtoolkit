                 Po l i c e Station,           Sheffield.

                 My     past    experience           of    duties at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Footbal l              Club has

                 Jbeen lim i t e d i n        recent       times    to outside          Tran s i t     van    patrols.          I was

                  e n g a g e d on this        duty for the Semi              Final       of    1988 w i t h a re s p o n s i b i l i t y

                  for    the are a       of M i d d l e w o o d and Wisewood.                  My   r e c o l l e c t i o n of that        day

                  is that we were              d i r e c t e d to three       public        houses.          These     were     the Park

                 Hotel      where      there     had been a disturbance,                       The Horse and J o c k e y where

                  flases       had been        br o k e n and the W e d s l e y Jack where                   i n f o r m a t i o n had

                 been       received         that Notts Forest             s u p p o r t e r s were     expected        to visit.

                 None       of the     calls     resulted          in police       action.           Nothing       I saw on that

                 day gave any            cause       for    concern and          the movem e n t        of fans        towards the

                 ground appeared               timely and well             o r d e r e d and was        nothing        like     the

                 scenes        I experienced              on the    15 April       1989 which           I will        describe        in

                 detail        at a later        stage.

briefing           as    to the       inte l l i g e n c e aspect         and we then divi d e d               into

secti o n s        to    be b r i e f e d by       individual         commanders.

As a result              of    large       scale     pickpocketing             at the      previous years m at c h

a team of offic e r s                 wfiich included my s e l f               had been d e l e g a t e d          the task

of a c t i n g as a pickp o c k e t                squad whose a i m was               to arrest any

off e n d e r s who           came    to    light.         As a part       of this         s t r a t e g y DC Hal lam

was to act              as a     "target"         for    o f fenders      outside         the t u r n s t i l e s    at the

Leppings           Lane are a         of    the    ground.         I was       to supervise a number                   of

officers w h o r k i n g             wit h DC Hal lam in this area.                        Following          the briefing

we went           to    the G y m n a s i u m where we a q u a i n t e d            ourselves         w ith

descriptions               and    p hotographs           of known        pickpockets.

At   11.30am that                day together            w ith DC Locking,             DC Lawrence,            DC Hal lam

I went        to       the are a      outside        the    turn s t i l e s    at the L e p p i n g s Lane            end of

the ground.                At this         time    the     crowd was       very sparse and                I recall

seeing a            number       of    police      officers in this area.                    O f f icers      w hich        come

to mind are               Inspector         P urdy      (Training)        and     Inspector Sykes              (F2>

t ogether w i t h a number                   of s e rveants and PC's.                     At this       time and for

the fol l o w i n g           half    hour    the       number     of u n i f o r m e d     police      officers

outweighed              the    number       of s upporters          and    it beacme             i n c r e asingly

di f f i c u l t       to m a i n t a i n any      covert       status.         There were           v i r t u a l l y no

groups        of       people     in w h i c h DC H a l l a m       could adopt            his     intended         role at

this     stage and we                posit i o n e d o u rselves          at    different          locations         in the

hope     of       i d e n t ifying     known       pickpockets.            It was         during      this     time that

it became              clear     that a large            number     of    fans      had t r a v e l l e d     to

Sheffield without                    tickets as myself              and my        colleagues were              constantly

being a p p r o a c h e d by fans who were as k i n g                          if we      had any tickets              to

sell.         I     was a p p r o a c h e d       by one man who was               in his        early twenties who

asked      if       I had a ticket             to sell        on    receiving         a negative           reply he went

a nd stood             nearby.        He    struck       up a    conversation with another .

supporter,              a man     in his      thirties who was                 obv i o u s l y    in the      same
position.           They     spoke about          the     l i k e l y h o o d of obtaining a ticket and

t h e n went on t£> say that                  if they      could not         get a ticket           then they

intended going             to the        turnstile and trying                to obtain a d m i s s i o n by

saying       that     they      had     lost their        tickets,

I was a p p r o a c h e d by          Inspector S ykes who                informed me that           two    ticket

touts     had been seen,                one at either           side    of the     t u r nstile area a short

distance        from the         gr o u n d and     I    d e p u t e d DC Lawrence and DC Lcoking                     to

go an d      review       the    situation         in    r e l a t i o n to them.

Coac h e s    star t e d     to arr i v e anj d they were met                    by the Police         coach

r ec e p t i o n as    is the         case at all         matches.         Supporters      were       leaving          the

coaches and           going      towards       the turnstiles.              There were         no    real    queues

forming       at    this     time and many of              the      s upporters      on seeing        that       there

were    no queues          se e m e d    to wander a r o u n d         the area      rather     than going

into     the ground.             We were       then jo i n e d       by a number       of m o u n t e d officers

who were        continually             patrolling        tha a rea        in front    of the wrought                 iron

gates a d v i s i n g      fans       to either         go into     the     ground    if they had tickets

or to move a w a y           from       the a rea       if they hadn't,            I remember         one of the

o f f icers was a female                 S outh Y o r k s h i r e    officer      and anot h e r      was a male

Merseyside          officer.            The actions of          these      officers     somewhat           thwarted

our    o p e r a t i o n and     it     was decided that            the    best    place   for DC Hal lam

to stand was           outside          the   sweet      shop    near     to the     turnstiles.            Still

there a p p e a r e d      to    be     little    congestion around               the tur n s t i l e area and
                                      /V Z&H?            /V^cxs:               u .a^r
we were       joined       by DS Smith,           DC L i n d s a y and      DC Li 1 ley    who      had been on

a similar          operation          inside     the     turnstiles.          It was a p p a r e n t       that,

there     had been         little        or no    congestion           in their area and            they had

come    to see        if we      ne e d e d any assistance.

It was       decided       that       in view of         the    fact      that    there were     no    crowds at

the    tu rns t i l e s    the    fans must         be somewhere           else    in the a r e a and            it

f o l l o w e d that w h e r e v e r      there was a large               gathering     then that           is

where     the      pick    pockets        w ould be operating.                Wit h this      in mind myself

                Lane    towards        Penistone          Road.        The   time w o u l d be appro:-: imat e ly i .30 pm

                an d at this          time    there was a steady                by light        stream of       people

                walk i n g -plong the          f o otpaths        on      both sides         of the road.'      A g a i n we           ;

                were    constantly asked              if    we had any           tickets       to sell     and by this         time

                the m a j o r i t y    of fans were          drink i n g       beer    from     cans.     We went       as far

                as B i c k e r t o n R o a d w here we found a c o n g r e g a t i o n of                people     outside

                the Fish and C h i p           shop.        This       seemed a likely            location and DC

                Hal lam went          amongst       the    crowd.        This     met w ith a negative            result and

                after about           13 m i n u t e s we made          our way       back    to the     t u r nstil e area

                of L e p pings        Lane,        On arrival          there    it could be seen that               crowds

                were    starting        to    build up but             the   queues      for the t u r n s t i l e s were

                still     not    reaching          the wrought            iron gates,

                DC Hal lam a ga i n went and stood near to the sweet shop and I was
                                      //
                speaking w i t h D.I. Towell as to the a c t i v i t i e s of the day. The

•St       'tf/v/ m o u nted o f f i c e r s were      still       p a trolling        the area outside           the

                turnstiles.            We made       them aware          of our       duties and        it was agreed

                that    to some        extent we w ould be                left alone         near to the        sweet    shop,

                I was    standing        wit h D.I.         Towell       whe n we were          told that all          crowds

                w o u l d have    to be m o v e d         because       of the arrival            of the Special

                train.       I would         e s t imate    that       the time w o u l d be a r o u n d 2 , Opm,

                I saw the        escorted          fans arrive          at   the ground and this             naturally-

                started      to swell         the    numbers       a c t u a l l y queuing       at the     turnstiles,

                The    queues were           now    reaching       the wrou g h t        iron gates       but    things

                seemed quite           orderly.           I cannot       say w h e t h e r    or not     u n i f o r m e d officers

                were    present        amongst       the queues          as my a t t e n t i o n was      taken up       in the

                main    by w a t c h i n g DC Hal lam as the                 l i k e l y h o o d of   p ickpockets      operating

                go to the o p p o s i t e          side    of the       road to the          t u rnstiles an d saw

length of Leppin<|s Lane..

Ha v i n g   reached        the     garage w ith no gain we tu r n e d and w a l k e d back

along L ep p i n g s        Lane       towards       the groud.           As we were        doing       so    I saw PC

Eluxton      <F "I PC 1863)         driving a L and Rover                 in the       same direction.               He

was forced to drive                    on the wrong          side     of the       road and had the

headl i g h t s    on an d was            sounding       the    horn      continuously.               As we    neared

Leppi n g s Lane T u r n s t i l e s          I could see that               the    crowd had swelled

enormously         c o m pared         to w hen we       had    left      some     15 m i n u t e s    earlier.           We

returned       to the         raised area near               to the       roadway       from w here          I could

see    that    serious          problems were aris i n g               the    crowd was muc h            larger and

more     tightly       packed.            PC Bux t o n      via the P.A.           system     r e p e a t e d l y a sked

the    su pp o r t e r s    to ease        back      from    the    turn s t i l e s    explaining           that

people were          being        s q u ashed at the front.                  These      requests        met with no

response at all              and       people were          c o ntinuing      to walk        into      the

ov e r c r o w d e d area.          My    immediate         reaction was           that we as a body had

lost     control       of     the      crowd.        I could see m o u n t e d officers                 in the       crowd

but these were              unable        to have any          real    effect as         they seemed           to be

marooned       individually               in the      crowd.        I was     standing        by the         side of

the Lan d Rover             and from my           p o s ition      could not        see PC Buxton.              It was

obvious       however        that a n o t h e r       officer       had taken hold of the

microphone         and was          trying      to    placate       the     crowd by telling             them that

attempts would              be made        to open further             t u rnstiles and to              postpone

the kick       off.         A ga i n     this was met w i t h          no    response.         The     officer

then    called       for m o u n t e d officers              to form a line,             presumably           to hold

the    crowd back.             I saw our m o u n t e d          officers         in the     crowd a l t h o u g h         I

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 1 0 p m    I. savg two youths who                  I had seen earlier

hanging a r o u n d        groups     of     people and who                 given DC Hal lam some

attention approach                the queues at               the     turnstiles.              I would    describe

the men as          follows:

1.      A sian half          caste appearance,                 23 to 3 0 y r s , dark            hair    receeding at

        the temples,           thining           on the       back     of    his head,         wearing a

         distinctive          sheepskin           coat and a bright                 blue       jumper.     He was

        wearing        sunglasses           with       blue    top p e d frames.

2.      Not    so- d i s t i nctive,         white male 20 to 23 yrs                       fresh faced,          wearing

        a black        leather       jacket.

I kept      the men        under     o b s e r v a t i o n and          saw them c o n t i n u a l l y join queues

walk almost          to the t u r n s t i l e s         and     then walk           out of the      queue        to

r e j o i n i t at     the    back .        The       volume    of the           crowd    out s i cle the

turns t i l e s was        such that         they had           no d i f f i c u l t y in w a l k i n g     from the

front     of the queue            back      to    rejoin        the queue.               I located DC Lilley and

pointed out          the     two men and              i n s t r u c t e d him to keep them under-

o b s e r v a t i o n whilst      I went         to    locate DC Ha l l a m           and tell him of their

activities          in the     hope        that we       could          position him near to              them.        At

this    time       I was     s t a nding     on the        raised area near                to the       edge    of the

r oadway and         had no       difficulty            in keeping           the men under          observations,

1 located DC Hal lam and                    returned          to the        raised area.           I couldn't          see

either      the men        or DC Lilley and was                     jo i n e d    by him a short          time

later.        He    i n f ormed me         that the men had w a l k e d                  off along Leppings

Lane    towards       Penistone            Road.        By this        time all          the   officers        in the

s quad were         t o g ether    and we d e c i d e d that DC L_.il ley together with one

group     should      remain       in the tur n s t i l e a rea whilst myself,                           DC Askew,          DC

L o c k i n g and    1 believe DC L a w r e n c e w o u l d walk along L e p p i n g s Lane to

see    if we       could     locate        the men.

                was    having        extreme        difficulty         in mo v i n g      his    horse       in the       crowd.           At

                one    point      I thought            that    he was       going    to    be unseated.              I also          recall

                s eeing a u n i f o r m e d         officer a t t e m p t i n g      to    close one          of the wrought

                iron gates.

                I    looked back           d own L e p p i n g s Lane        and    could see          no end to          the    body of

                s upporters          that       were    approaching          the ground.              As    the    fans    reached the

                 ::rowd outside            the    t u rnstiles        they    did not appear                to be    part i c u l a r l y

                 rushing at          the     back      but just       c o n t i n u e d walking        into the          enclosed

                 area.        My own thought             at the       time was       that       one way to ease             the

           /// s i t u a t i o n w o u l d      have    been to       place    some       form of          cordons       across

l4 ~   ^
                turnstiles.             I then         thought       of the    numbers          that w ould         be    required to

                do this and           the       s peed with w h i c h        it w o u l d have         to be done and quickly

f               rf
                 e alised that             it was       not a viable          solution

                The    s i t u a t i o n was      now becoming             critical       and    I could well             imagine          that

                at    least serious              injury and at             the w orst a death w ould                 result          from

                the    crush that was               forming       outside      the     turnstiles.                I then saw that

                a number        of s u p p o r t e r s       had star t e d    to    climb up the             outside       of the

                turnstiles           and onto          the    roof    of the       building.           At    first       I thought

                that     this was          to gain entry to the                club but          it then          became    apparent

                that     it was       to escape          the     crush at      the     front.          I saw one y o u t h get

                onto     the    roof who was             so near       to    collapse       that       he almost          fell       back

                into the        crowd.           l w a t c h e d the y o u t h      until       he    r e covered and           having

                done     so    I saw him throw his                   ticket    back       down       into    the    crowd,       a

                m e t h o d of gaining            e ntry w hich        I    have    in the       past seen used             to gain

                access        from    the L e p p i n g s      Lane T e r r a c e    into the West Stand.                       As    I

                watched        I saw a number                of fans       doing    the    same wit h their               tickets

        us to try and assist                    in any form of             crowd    control       would       only have

        made m a t t e r s worse.               Our    brief at Kick Off             time was to move                through

        the      turnstiles           into     the area of the             toilets     behind the L e p p i n g s Lane

        Terrace       to     check       for    pickpockets          dropping       the    remains       of their

        plUndef       in this area-                  It was    quite       clear that we          could not          pass',      >

        through       the       crowd an d          it was also       obvious       that     the a rea we were              to

        patrol       would       be    far     too    busy to a l l o w any         pickpockets          to drop the

        property.            I therefore             decided that          close    to 3 .0pm we w o u l d           go round

        the      outside        of the       ground,,       enter    thro u g h the       police       e n t r a n c e and take

        a short meal             by w h i c h time          things    inside       the turns t i l e s w o u l d have

        q u i e t e n e d down.

        Just      before we           left L e p p i n g s Lane,.      I should estimate                the    time at

        about 2 . 3 5 p m a           loud     cheer    came    from w i t h i n     the ground,             I assu m e d     that

        this was          the    teams       coming     out    onto    the      field.      This       cheer     had the

        effect       of     causing       some       surging    in the       crowd outside             the    turnstiles

        as    they    r e a lised        that       the Kick Off was            not to be delayed..                 Together

        w it h    other      officers          in my squad at 3 . 0 p m            I wa l k e d along Vere Road and

        whilst       going along             that     road    I heard anot h e r          loud    cheer       from    inside

        the      ground.        I thought           at the    time    that a cheer           like that w ould have

        made      things        even w orse          outside    the    turnstiles.,           Infact a small            number

        of fans who were                walk i n g     along Vere Roa d towards                  the    turnstiles

        s t a r t e d to     run on hearing             it.
A ffO
        We    reached        the      g y m n a s i u m and started        to   take      our meal       w h e n Ch.

        I nspector Beal               came     in and ordered          that     the area         be    cleared to be

        used as a m o rtuary.                   No sooner       had he said that              than a         continuous

        stream of bodies                began to arrive.               They were          being       carried       by Police

        officers and             fans.         Some were       on s t retcher and           some were          on the

        advertising             boards.         liost of the         bodies     were a g r ey/blue             in colour

        a l t h o u g h there were             no    real    signs    of   injuries        to them.           Any    persons

        who were          not o b v i o u s l y      dead were       transferred          to anot h e r       section of

END OF R E P O R T
Keith Saylor ilcSLCY   D.S. 457


I am a Detective Sergeant currently stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station,
Sheffield.

My past experience of duties at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has been limited in
recent tines to outside Transit van patrols. I was engaged on this duty for the Semi
Final of 1988 v/ith a responsibility for the area of Midulewood and Wisewood. My
recollection of that day is that we were directed to three public houses. These were
the Park Hotel where there had been a disturbance, The Horse and Jockey where galsses
had been broken and the Wadsley Jack where information had been received that Notts
Forest supporters were expected tovisit. None of the calls resulted in police action.
Nothing I saw on that day gave any cause for concern and the movement of fans towards
the ground appeared timely and well ordered and was nothing like the scenes I experienced
on the 15 April 1989 which I will describe in detail at a later stage.

At 9*Oam Saturday 15 April 1989 X reported for duty at Hammerton Road Police Station
C.I.D. office and attended a briefing at the ground at approximately 9*45am that day.
A general briefing for the whole operation was given by Ch. Supt. Duckenfield. DS
Charelsworth gave a briefing as to the intelligence aspect and we then divided into
sections to be briefed by individual commanders.

As a result of large scale pickpocketing at the previous years match a team of officers
which included myself had been delegated the task of acting as a pick pocket squad
whose aim was toarrest any offenders who came to light.    As a part of this strategy
DC Hallarn was to act as a ’target’ for offenders outside the turnstiles at the Leppings
lane area of the ground.   I was to supervise a number of officers working with DC
Hallara in this area. Following the briefing we went to the Gymnasium where we
aquainted ourselves with descriptions and photographs of known pickpockets.

At 11.30am that day together with DC Locking, DC Lawrence, DC Hallara I went to the
area outside the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. At this time
the crowd was very sparse and I recall seeing a number of police officers in this
 area. Oxricer» which come to mind are Inspector Purdy (Training; and Inspector
Sykes (F2) together with a number of sergeants and PC's. At ;this time and for the
following half hour the number of uniformed police officers outweighed the number of
supporters and it became increasingly difficult to maintain any covert status. There
were virtually no groups of people in which DC Hallam could adopt his intended role at
this stage and we positioned ourselves at different locations in the hope of identifying
known pickpockets. It was during this time that it became clear that a large number of
fans had travelled to Sheffield without tickets as myself and my colleagues were
constantly being approached by fans who were asking if we had any tickets to sell.
I was approached by one man who was in his early twenties who asked if I had a ticket
to sell on receiving a ne ative reply he went and stood nearby. He struck up a
conversation with another supporter, a man in his thirties who was obviously in the
same position. They spoke abput the likleyhood of obtaining a ticket and then went
on to say that if they could not get a ticket then they intended going to the turnstile
and trying to obtain admission by saying tiiat othey had lost their tickets.

I was approached by Inspector Sykes who informed me that two ticket touts had been
seen, one at either side of the turnstile area a short distance from the ground and
I deputed DC Lawrence and DC Locking to go and review the situation In relation to
them.

Coaches started t© arrive and they were met by the Police coach reception as is the
case at all matches. Supporters were leaving the coaches and going towards the
turnstiles. There were no real queues forming at this time and many of the supporters
on seeing that there were no queues seemed to wander around the area rather than
going into the ground. We were then joined by a number of mounted officers who were
continuallly patrolling the area infront of the wrought iron gates advising fans to
either go into the ground if they had tickets or to move awqy from the area if they
hadn’t. I remember one of the officers was a femal South Yorkshire officer and
another was a male Herseyside officer.                               p*
                                                                                 /^I7 ?

The actions of these officers somewhat thwarted our operation and it was decided
that the bast place for DC Hallara to   stand was outside the sweet shop near to the
turnstiles. Still there appeared to be little congestion around the turnstile area
e^nd we were joined by DS Smith, DC Lindsay and DC Lilley who had been on a similar
operation inside the turnstiles. Itwas apparent that there had been little or no
congestion in their area and they had corne to see if we needed any assistance.

It was decided that in view of the fact that there ?/ere no crowds at'the turnstiles
the fans must be somewhere else in the area and it followed that wherever there was
a large gathering then that is where the pick pockets would be operating. With this
in mind myself and all the other officers on pick pocket duty walked along Leppings
Lane towards Penistone Road. The time would be approximately 1.30pm and at this time
there was a steady but light stream of people walking along the footpaths on both sides
of the road. Again we were constantly asked if we had any tickets to sell and by this
time the majority of fans were drinking beer fitom cans. We went as far as Bickerton
Road where we found a congregation of people outside the Pish and Chip shop. This
seemed a likely location and DC Hallarn went amongst the crowd. This met with a negative
result and after about 15 minutes we made our way back to the turnstile area at Leppings
Lane. On arrival there it could be seen that crowds were starting to build up but the
queues for the turnstiles were still not reaching the wrought iron gates.

DC Hallara again went and stood near to the sweet shop ana I was speaking witft D.I.
Towell as to the activities of the uay. The mounted officers were still patrolling
 the area outside the turnstiles. We made them aware of our duties an d it was agreed
 t h a t t o some e x t e n t we would be left alone near to the sweet shop.  I was standing
with D.I. Towell when we were told that all crowds would have to be moved because of
 the arrival of the Special train.            I would estimate that the time would be around
 2.Opm.
I saw the escorted fans arrive at the ground and this naturally started to swell the
numbers actually queuing at the turnstiles. The queues were now reaching the wrought
iron gates but things seemed quite orderly. I cannot say whether or not uniformed
 officers were present amongst the queues as my attention was taken up in the main by
watching DC Hallam as the likleyhood of pickpockets operating was increased by the
volume of the crowd. At one stage however I did go to the opposite side of the road
 to the turnstiles and saw officers meeting the SY Transport buses carrying Liverpool
fans.
At approximately 2.10pm I saw two youths who I had seen earlier hanging around groups
of people and who had given DC Hallam some attention approach the queues at the
turnstiles. I would describe the men as follows:
 1. Asian half caste appearance, 25 to 30yrs, dark hair receeding at the temples, thining
        on the back of his head, wearing a distinctive sheepskin coat and a bright blue
        jumper. lie was wearing sunglasses with blue topped frames.
2. Hot so distinctive, white male 20 to 25 yrs fresh faced, rearing a black leather
        jacket.
I kept the men under observations and saw them continually join queues walk almost to
the turnstiles and then walk out of the queue to rejoin it at the back. The volume of the
crowd outside the turnstiles was such that they had no difficulty in walking from the
front of the queue back to rejoin the queue. I located DC Lilley and pointed out the
two men End instructed him to keep them under observation whilst I went to locate DC
iiallam end tell him of their activities in the hope that we could position him near to
them.        At this time I was standing on the raised area near to the edge of the roadway
and had no difficulty in keeping the men under observations.             I located DC iiallam and
returned to the raised area. I couldn't see either the men or DC Lilley and was joined by
him a short time later. He informed me that the man had walked off along Leppings Lane
towards Penistons Road. By this time all the officers in the squad were together and
we decided that DC Lilley together with one group should remain in the turnstile area
whilst myself,DC Askew,DC Locking and I believe DC Lawrence would walk along Leppings Lane
to see if we could locate the men.
V/e walked as far as Law Bros. Garage with no gain. On walking along Leppings Lane we
were met by a flood of supporters stretching the full width of Leppings Lane both on
the roadway and on the footpaths. Some were still asking for tickets and many had
obviously been drinking although I would not describe their condition as drunk. V/e
were confronted by fans in such numbers along the full length of Leppings Lane.
                                   3


Having reached the garage with no gain we turned and walked back along Leppings Lane
towards the ground.    As v/e were doing so I saw PC Buxton (FI PC 1863) driving a
Land Rover in the same direction. He was forced to drive on the wrong side of the
road and had the headlights on and was sounding the horn continuously. As we
neared Leppings Lane Turnstiles 1 could see that the crowd had swelled enormously
compared to when we had left some 15 minutes earlier. V/e returned to the raised
area near the roadway from where I could see that serious problems were arising,
the crowd was much larger and more tightly packed. PC 3uxton via the P.A. system
repeatedly asked the supporters to ease back from the turnstiles explaining that
people were being squashed at the front. These requests met with no response at
all and people were continuing to walk into the overcrowded area. My immediate
reaction was that we &s a body had lost control of the crowd. I could see mounted
officers in the crowd but these were unable to have any real effect as they seemed to
be marooned individually in the crowd. I was standing by the side of the Land Rover
and from my position could not see PC Buxton. It was obvious however that another
officer ted taken hold of the microphone and was trying to placate the crov/d by
telling them that attempts would be made to open further turnstiles and to postpone
the kick off. Again this met with no response. The officer then called for mounted
officers to form a line, presumably to hold the crowd back. I saw four mounted
officers in the crowd although I could only identify Inspector Hand Davis of South
Yorkshire. This was no doubt because my attention was focused on this officer who
was having extreme difficulty in moving his horse in the crowdt, At one point I thought
that, he was going to be unseated. I also recall seeing a uniformed officer attempting
to close one of the wrought iron gates.

I looked back down Leppings Lane and could see no end to the body of supporters that
were approaching the ground. As the fans reached the crowd outside the turnstiles
they did not appear to be particularly pushing at the back but just continued
walking into the enclosed area.   My own thought at the time was that one way, to
eas§ the situation would have been to place some form of cordons across Leppings Lane
to reduce the flow of supporters arriving at the turnstiles. I then thought of the
numbers that would be required to do this and the speed with which it would have to
be aone and quickly realised that it was not a viable solution,

The situation vr.n now b^.-or.uning critical and I could well imagine that at least
serious injury ana at the wor«t a death would result from the- crush thpt was forming
outside the turnstiles. I then saw that a numb“‘** of supporters had started to climb
up the outside of the turnstiles and onto the roof of the building. At first I
thought that this was to gain entry to the club but it then became apparent that
it was to escape the crush at the front. I saw one youth get onto the roof who was
so near to collapse that he almost fell back into the crowd. I watched the youth
until he recovered and having done so I saw him throw his ticket back down into the
crowd, a method of gaining entry which I have in the past seen used to gain access
from the Leppings Lane Terrace into the West Stand. As I watched I saw a number of
fans doing the same with their tickets once they had reached the roof of the
turnstiles.

As we were dressed in casual civillian clotiling I accepted that for us to try and
assist in any form of crowd control would only have made matters worse.
Our brief at Kick Off time was to move through the turnstiles into the area of
the toilets behind the Leppings Lane Terrace to check for pickpockets dropping the
remains of their plunder in this area. It was quite clear that we could not pass
through the crov/d and it was also obvious that the area we were to patrol would be
far too busy to allow any pickpockets to drop the property. I therefore decided
that close to 3.0pm we would go round the outside of the ground, enter through the
police entrance and take a short meal by which time tilings inside the turnstiles
would have quietened down.

Just before v/e left Leppings Lane, I should estimate the time at about 2,55pra a loud
cheer came from within the ground, I assumed that this was the teams comming out
onto the field. This cheer ted the effect of causing some surging in the crowd
outside the turnstile as they realised that the Kick Off was not to be delayed.
Together with other officers in my squad at 3.0pm I walked along Vere Road and
whilst going along that road I heard another loud cheer from inside the ground. I
                                                                              £ l 7 &

thought at the time that a cheer like that would have made tilings even worse outside the
 turnstiles. Infact a small number of fans who were walking along Vere Road towards
 the turnstiles started to run on hearing it.

We reached the gymnasium and started to take our meal when Ch. Inspector Beal cane in
and ordered that the area be cleared to be used as a mortuary. Ho sooner had he said
that than a continuous stream of bodies began to arrive. They were being carried by
Police officers and fans. Some were on stretchers ans some were on the advertising boards.
Most of the bodies were a grey/blue in colour although there were no real signs of
injuries to them.   Any persons who were not obviously dead were transferred to another
section of the Gymnasium where they received medical attention.

A number of doctors attended in the gymnasium and certified life extinct.
As bodies were brought into the Gymnasium it soon became clear that difficulties may
arise if officers who had brought bodies to the Gymnasium returned to the scene of the
problem. I therefore attempted to ensure an officer stayed with each body thf.t was
brought in.

My duties from that point were concerned with the identification,labelling and disposal
of bodies to the medico legal centre.

I recall at the start of the duties at Hillsborough I was walking along the corridor
on the lower level at the back of the northstand and as I was passing a room from
which Stewards tabbards were being issued I heard someone sa^ to the waiting stewards
that they would have to wait until everything was sorted out because there weren't
enough tabbards for every Steward. I did not see who made this co/iient.

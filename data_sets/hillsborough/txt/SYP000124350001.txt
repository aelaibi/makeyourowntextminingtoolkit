 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY V IEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT WAS A SHAMBLES. WHILE           I WAS TRAPPED        IN PEN 4 I SAW

 POLICEMEN ACTUALLY KICKING          IN THE FRONT FENCE AT THE TIME.          OTHER

 POLICEMEN WERE STANDING ABOUT DOING NOTHING,                WHILST THE FANS WERE:

 DYING OR TRYING 'T'0 ESCAPE.        THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF ORGANISATION-

 CO-ORDINATION AMONGST          THE POLICE.     THEY APPEARED TO BE WITHOUT           CjO H M ,

 LEADERSHIP.     THE OVERALL MANAGEMENT BY THE POLICE AND F O O T B A L L

 CLUB OFFICIALS SEEMED TO BE AT A LOSS.



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL                   IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE POLICEMAN WHO OPENED THE GATE TO ALLOW THE FANS INTO THE GROUND

 WAS NOT TO BLAME IN ANY WAY.           THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE GROUND SHOULD NOT

 HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO GROUP          INTO A LARGE MASS.       IT SHOULD HAVE HAD

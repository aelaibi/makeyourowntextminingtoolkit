SOLICITOR GENERAL

You are to attend H Committee on Monday which will discuss,
inter alia, a proposal by the Home Secretary to implement the
recommendation of the report by Lord Justice Taylor into the
Hillsborough disaster by creating four new criminal offences
which would outlaw the activities of ticket touts in relation
to football matches, the throwing of missiles at football
matches, the chanting of obscene or racialist abuse at
football matches and going on to a football pitch without
reasonable excuse.     A paper by the Home Secretary is beneath
this note.


There has been an exchange of correspondence between the Home
Secretary and colleagues.     The Home Secretary's letter of 20th
August is at flag A and the Attorney General's response of
10th September is at flag B.     You will note that the Attorney
General has expressed himself as content that there should be
legislation in the manner proposed.     Only two matters require
specific mention:


(a)   The Attorney General took the view that the proposal
      relating to ticket sales seemed justified although some
      care would be necessary to ensure that the provisions -
      which could be justified on public order grounds - did
      not become extended in the Parliamentary passage of the
      legislation to embrace other forms of perceived
      profiteering.    Finding a suitable demarcation line would
      thereafter be difficult.    The proposals are about public
      order and football and not about the iniquities of the
      street trader!


(b)   The Attorney General was keen to put down a marker in
      relation to the racial chanting provision that he did not
      wish this offence, unlike other race relations
r   *   -




                 legislation, should attract an Attorney General's consent
                 provision as a prerequisite of prosecution.


            Other items of correspondence relating to this issue are:


            1.   Letter from the Home Secretary to the Secretary of State
                 for Employment dated 18th September.   Flag C.


            2.   Letter from Secretary of State for Scotland to Lord
                 President dated 25th September.


            3.   Letter from the Home Secretary to Norman Lamont MP.


            Conclusion

            In the light of the above, you may wish to support the Home
            Secretary's proposals taking note of the points already made
            by the Attorney General.

TAYLOR REPORT: NEW OFFENCES


Thank you for copying to me your letter of the 20th August
1990 to the Lord President about the proposal which Lord
Justice Taylor made for new criminal offences.


I am content that we should legislate in the manner you
propose.       There may be some calls for the extension of the
provision relating to ticket touting to cover other forms of
unacceptable profiteering but I believe that we should remain
firm in confining it to football matches where the football
order consequences provide a sound justification; otherwise it
will be difficult to find another acceptable boundary.


As regards resource implications, there can be no reliable
forecast so far as the CPS is concerned.       I would not wish to
go further than to say that they will be directly related to
the level of police enforcement.


I take the opportunity to mention one point of direct concern
to myself.      The majority of offences associated with racial
incitement attract an Attorney General's consent provision
because of their perceived implications for free speech.          I do
not think that such considerations arise with the sort of
offence you now propose and would not wish there to be such a
provision; quite apart from the number of cases which might be
    involved, such a requirement would be likely to inhibit swift
    and effective enforcement.   If any concern does emerge during
    the Parliamentary progress of the legislation, some thought
    could be given to a DPP consent for the provision which would
    effectively restrict the institution of proceedings to the
    police and CPS.


    Finally, I agree that we should legislate at the earliest
    suitable opportunity.   Whilst it is desirable that the
W   Government should take the credit for implementation of the
    Taylor Report, I doubt whether.we ought to pass over the
    opportunity if a Member successful in the ballot were
    interested in taking forward these measures.   There would be
    significant political disadvantage in having appeared to defer
    legislation without good reason.

Thank you for your letter of 7 September about Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendations for new criminal offences welcoming my
proposal for introducing legislation at the earliest opportunity.

Turning to your more detailed comments, you made the point that
the touting offence, in the terms expressed by Taylor, might not
prevent touts from selling tickets at neutral grounds. This is
an eventuality which we shall wish to cover if we legislate.

As you recognise,    football touts need controlling in the
interests of safety and order. I believe a clear and justifiable
distinction can be made between football and other touts which
will enable us to resist any attempts to widen the scope of the
proposed touting offence.

I share your concern that the proposed new offence of running
onto the pitch should include exceptions for safety purposes.
My officials will consult yours about the details of the
proposals.

I am copying this letter to members of QL and H Committees,
Sir Robin Butler and First Parliamentary Counsel.

Thank you for your letter of 21 September in response to mine
of 20 August about Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations for
new criminal offences.

You asked for an estimate of the costs which would fall to
local authorities.  For the police the level of activity
generated by the proposed new touting offence is expected to
be absorbed within their existing and planned resources.   The
police are already actively engaged in the control of touts at
football grounds: what Taylor has proposed is a specific
offence of touting which will make the law more adequate to
deal with this mischief rather than impose any significant
additional burden on the police or the courts.

As for the o£her three proposed new offences, the number of
prosecutions will not be high since the new offences will only
apply at football matches. It is estimated that the three
offences together are unlikely to produce more than 1,000
cases a year - there were only 2,734 arrests for all offences
in grounds in the 1989/90 season - and, working on the basis
that each case will cost the police an average of £180 to
process, it is unlikely to cost in excess of £180,000\ There
is also some prospect of unquantifiable off-setting savings in
that enabling the police to deal more quickly and easily with
offenders will reduce the damage and disorder which they might
otherwise have gone on to cause.

It is expected that these cases will  be dealt with summarily.
The cost to magistrates' courts is therefore unlikely to
exceed £64,000 per annum, based on the estimate that such a
case in a magistrates' court would cost £64.

Thank you for your letter of 7 September about Lord Justice
Taylor's recommendations for new criminal offences welcoming my
proposal for introducing legislation at the earliest opportunity.

Turning to your more detailed comments, you made the point that
the touting offence, in the terms expressed by Taylor, might not
prevent touts from selling tickets at neutral grounds. This is
an eventuality which we shall wish to cover if we legislate.

As you recognise, football touts need controlling in the
interests of safety and order. I believe a clear and justifiable
distinction can be made between football and other touts which
will enable us to resist any attempts to widen the scope of the
proposed touting offence.

I share your concern that the proposed new offence of running
onto the pitch should include exceptions for safety purposes.
My officials will consult yours about the details of the
proposals.

I am copying this letter to members of QL and H Committees,
Sir Robin Butler and First Parliamentary Counsel.

TAYLOR REPORT; NEW OFFENCES

Thank you for copying to me your letter of the 20th August
1990 to the Lord President about the proposal which Lord
Justice Taylor made for new criminal offences.


I am content that we should legislate in the manner you
propose.       There may be some calls for the extension of the
provision relating to ticket touting to cover other forms of
unacceptable profiteering but I believe that we should remain
firm in confining it to football matches where the football
order consequences provide a sound justification; otherwise it
will be difficult to find another acceptable boundary.


As regards resource implications, there can be no reliable
forecast so far as the CPS is concerned.       I would not wish to
go further than to say that they will be directly related to
the level of police enforcement.


I take the opportunity to mention one point of direct concern
to myself.       The majority of offences associated with racial
incitement attract an Attorney General's consent provision
because of their perceived implications for free speech.             I do
not think that such considerations arise with the sort of
offence you now propose and would not wish there to be such a
provision; quite apart from the number of cases which might be
involved, such a requirement would be likely to inhibit swift
and effective enforcement.   If any concern does emerge during
the Parliamentary progress of the legislation, some thought
could be given to a DPP consent for the provision which would
effectively restrict the institution of proceedings to the
police and CPS.


Finally, I agree that we should legislate at the earliest
suitable opportunity.   Whilst it is desirable that the
Government should take the credit for implementation of the
Taylor Report, I doubt whether we ought to pass over the
opportunity if a Member successful in the ballot were
interested in taking forward these measures.   There would be
significant political disadvantage in having appeared to defer
legislation without good reason.


Copes of this letter go to members of QL and H Committees,
First Parliamentary Counsel and Sir Robin Butler.

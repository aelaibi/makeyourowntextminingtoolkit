HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

I write following a recent meeting of Liverpool City Council to
inform you that the Council unanimously resolved that I should
write to congratulate you on your decision to appoint Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith to investigate the new evidence which has emerged
about the Hillsborough Disaster.

As you know the City Council has for many years supported the
justice campaign of the families of the victims through its
Hillsborough Disaster Working Party and all Members are therefore
extremely satisfied that at last there is to be an re-examination
of an issue which has caused immense pain here on Merseyside.


Yours sincerely

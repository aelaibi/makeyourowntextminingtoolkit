THE FANS WERE MAKING GESTURES AT THE FORREST FANS. THE FANS WERE THEN
ARRESTED BY THE POLICE. THE NEXT THING WE KNEW WAS THAT THE FANS WERE
CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES ONTO THE PITCH AND THEY STARTED CARRYING BODIES OUT
OF THE STAND. AT THIS STAGE NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON. THERE WAS NO
INFORMATION AT ALL FOR ANY OF THE FORREST FANS. I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH 3

CONTD.
I WAS APPROACHED ON NUMEROUS TIMES BY LIVERPOOL FANS WANTING TO BUY MY
TICKET•
I WENT INTO THE GROUND AND THE ONLY STEWARDS I SAW WERE BY THE PLAYERS
ENTRANCE.
THERE WERE LOTS OF VIP COACHES ARRIVING AT THE GROUND AND BEING ALLOWED NEAR
TO THE GROUND AND POLICE WERE BEING TAKEN UP WITH THESE DUTIES.
I WENT INTO THE GROUND AND AT ABOUT 2:30PM I NOTICED THAT THE WEST STAND WAS
ONLY FULL IN THE MIDDLE WHICH WAS STRANGE.
AT FIRST I THOUGHT THERE WAS A PITCH INVASION. THE PEOPLE WERE COMING OVER
THE FENCE AND THEN JUST WOUNDERING AROUND THE PITCH, REALLY THE POLICE COULD
NOT HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
I^ENT TO THE GAME LAST YEAR AND THEN THERE WERE PEOPLE WERE BEING LIFTED UP
T ® * H E SEATS ABOVE THE WEST STAND
I DID NOT SEE THIS BUT THE LADY NEXT TO ME HAD SEEN A LIVERPOOL FAN WITH A
WAD OF TICKETS TO SELL. THERE ARE NO WATERMARKS ON THE TICKETS AND SO EASY TO
FORGE.
THERE GENERAL LACK OF STEWARDS TO DIRECT PEOPLE TO THE RIGHT PLACE
THE POLICE SEEMED TO BE CONFUSED AS TO WHAT TO DO. THERE SEEMED TO BE NO ONE
IN CONTROL. THERE WAS A LIVERPOOL FAN WHO RAN UP TO THE NOTTS END STOOD ON
THE HALFWAY LINE AND GESTERED TO THE NOTTS FANS. THIS COULD HAVE CAUSED A
RIOT
THERE WAS NO ANNOUNCEMENT AS TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING.
THE POLICE THEN DID A CORDEN.
THERE WAS NO-ONE EVEN WITH A LOUDHAILERD

ON THE TERRACES WAS A TRUE YORKSHIRE AIR BUT AT 2.30PM, IT WAS MORE LIKE A
"SECOND HAND ALE".
THE IDEA OF KEEPING THE FANS AWAY FROM EACH OTHER BY GIVING THEM TICKETS TO
THE STANDS NEAR TO THEIR OWN MOTORWAYS WAS A VERY GOOD IDEA ,WE DIDN'T COME
IN TOUCH WITH ANY OF THE OTHER PEOPLE.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH MY WIFE,THE COACH WAS HIRED FRON THE NATIONAL

QUARTER HOURS. THE FIRST THING I NOTICED WERE THOUSANDS OF BEER CANS BY THE
HYDE ROAD ISLAND WHERE THE M57 TERMINATES, THAT WAS THE FIRST OBVIOUS SIGN.
THE SECOND THING WAS AT 1.30PM I STOPPED ON THE A628 FOR TEA AT A CARAVAN ON
THE ROAD SIDE, AND WAS THERE UNTIL 2PM. I COMMENTED TO MY WIFE ABOUT THE
AMOUNT OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS STREAMING ALONG THE ROAD. KNOWING THIS AREA
VERY WELL AND HAVING BEEN TO CUP MATCHES BEFORE I KNEW THAT THE MAJORITY OF
THSEE FANS WOULD NOT GET TO SHEFFIELD BEFORE THE MATCH STARTED BECAUSE ONCE
TlSI ARRIVE PARKING IS VERY LIMITED IT A CASE OF PARKING IN THE SIDE ROADS
WHERE YOU CAN. THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY GOOD AND I
FELL THEY ARE HAVING TOO MUCH CRITICISM. I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS HAPPENED IT
IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TRAFFIC HOLD UPS WERE THE INITIAL CAUSE, BUT FOR
WHATEVER REASON A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE LATE FOR
THE MATCH.  I AM SORRY BUT I FEEL THAT I HAD TO TELL YOU HOW I FEEL.

INFO      »      WE HAD NO PROBLEMS GETTING INTO THE GROUND. AFTER WE HAD TAKEN
                 OUR SEATS WE SAW PEOPLE IN THE WEST END SPILLING ONTO THE PITCH.
                 WE THOUGHT THAT ONE OF THE GATES HAD BROKEN OR SOMETHING, WE
                 DIDN'T REALISE HOW SERIOUS IT WAS. I SAW A COUPLE OF FANS GO
                 OVER TO THE REFEREE APPARENTLY TRYING TO GET HIM TO STOP THE
                 MATCH.

                 THAT THE CLOSE CIRCUIT CAMERAS DID NOT DETECT THE TROUBLE BEFORE
                 IT AROSE. ALSO, THERE WERE LOADS OF POLICE AT THE FOREST END

ACTUALLY SEE ANY OF THE CRUSHING TAKING PLACE BUT DID SEE PEOPLE CLIMBING

EMPTY CAGES WHEN THE OTHER TWO WERE ALREADY FULL.

TANNOY WAS VERY BAD     UNABLE TO HEAR IT PROPERLY. I SAW A LITTLE BOY BOUGHT
OUT FROM LEPPINGS LANE END AND TWO POLICE GAVE HIM MOUTH TO MOUTH AND TWO
LADIES WERE THUMPING HIS CHEST. ONLY THEN DID I RELISE SOMETHING BAD WAS
HAPPENING AND YOU COULD SEE PEOPLE WERE DEAD. I SAW A FAN RUN THE LENGTH OF
THE PITCH TO THE PENALTY AREA FROM THE LEPPINGS LANE END AND BAIT THE NOTTS
FORREST FANS WHEN HIS MATES WERE DYING. THEN I HEARD ON A PORTIBLE RADIO THAT
6 PEOPLE HAD BEEN KILLED AND LEFT THE GROUND ABOUT 15.45HRS.....

CONT FROM PG 2    A LOT MORE THAN LAST YEAR. ..THERE WAS A CRUSH OUTSIDE THE
TURNSTYLES BECAUSE THERE WAS NO QUEUE....PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER A FENCE TO
GET ONTO THE ROOF OF THE TURNSTYLES, THE POLICE WERE HELPING THEM OVER...THEN
A POLICE LAND ROVER TURNED UP AND THE OFFICER ASKED OVER A LOUD HAILER FOR
THE LIVERPOOL FANS TO COME BACK AS THERE WASN'T ROOM FOR EVERYONE TO GET
IN...THIS WAS AT ABOUT 2.50PM...THE POLICE REQUESTED THIS SEVERAL TIMES AND
THE POLICE HORSES REMAINED AS THEY WERE     HE ALSO SAID THAT THEY WERE
TRYING TO GET THE START OF THE MATCH DELAYED...THIS HAD NO EFFECT ON THE
F A ...THEN I SAW THE BIG BLUE CONCERTENA GATES OPENED FROM INSIDE, AS THEY
OPENED I SAW A NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE AND THEN A LOT OF FANS BEGAN
TO GO QUICKLY THROUGH THE OPEN GATE, THIS WAS THE LEFT GATE...I JUMPED OFF
THE WALL AND WENT PAST THE HORSES AND UP TO THE GATES...I COULD HAVE EASILY
WALKED THROUGH THE GATES AT THAT STAGE     I REALISED THAT I HAD BEEN SPILT
UP FROM MY FATHER AND WENT BACK TO GET HIM     I FOUND HIM AND WENT BACK TO
THE GATES AND THEY WERE JUST BEING CLOSED BY THE POLICE     MY POINT IS THAT
ALTHOUGH I DIDN'T HAVE A TICKET I COULD EASILY HAVE GOT INTO THE GROUND...AND
I KNOW THAT ALOT OF PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE TICKETS DID IN FACT GET IN     IT
IS NORMAL FOR A SEMI FINAL FOR PEOPLE TO TURN UP WITHOUT TICKETS AND THEN BUY
THEM OUTSIDE THE GROUND AT INFLATED PRICES ANYTHING UP TO THIRTY POUNDS...

CONT FROM PG 2 ...AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS I LOOKED DOWN AND SAW A MASS OF
PEOPLE BELOW THEY WERE ALL CRAMMED INTO THE MIDDLE, THE LEFT AND RIGHT PENS
WERE VIRTUALLY EMPTY     I REMAINED IN PLACE UP UNTIL ABOUT 3.35PM...I COULD
SEE THAT EVEN BEFORE THE MATCH KICKED OFF THAT THE MIDDLE PEN WAS FAR TOO
FULL...... I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT THERE WAS JUST A TOTAL LACK OF
CO-ORDINATION, THERE WERE NO STEWARDS TELLING ANYONE WHERE TO GO, AND VERY
FEW POLICE OFFICERS...I WENT TO THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR AND ON THAT OCCASION
THERE WERE STEWARDS DIRECTING EVERYONE AND IT WAS MUCH BETTER.....

...THEN PEOPLE STARTED TO CLIMB THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH..THEN A POLICE
OFFICER CAME ONTO THE PITCH AND STOPPED THE MATCH...PEOPLE WERE PULLING THE
FANS UP FROM THE TERRACES INTO THE STANDS...THE POLICE WERE TELLING THEM TO
GET DOWN OFF THE FENCE...BY ABOUT 3.10/3.15 THE PITCH WAS FLOODED WITH
PEOPLE. ..1 SAW A CHAP WHO HAD HAD HIS WRIST COMPLETELY SNAPPED. ..AN AMBULANCE
CAME ONTO THE PITCH AND STARTED TO HELP SOME OF THE CASUALITIES.

THE THING THAT GETS ME IS THAT SOME OF THE POLICE JUST STOOD AROUND DOING
NOTI NG WHILST OTHERS WERE IN SHIRT SLEEVES SEEING TO PEOPLE INJURED.

AFTER 3.30 WE STARTED TO SEE PEOPLE BEING BROUGHT ONTO THE PITCH ON
STRETCHERS WITH COATS OVER THEIR HEAD...THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY DEAD.
WE LEFT THE GROUND AT ABOUT 3.45/3.50 OUTSIDE THERE SEEMED TO BE ALOT OF
TENSION WITH THE FANS TOWARDS THE POLICE.

...THERE WAS A CRUSH BUT IT DIDN'T SEEM AS BAD AS EVERYBODY MADE OUT TO
BE...I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD AT THIS TIME...ALL THE POLICE WERE AT
THE FRONT TELLING EVERYBODY TO MOVE BACK BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH
INVASION...WHEN EVERYONE HAD MOVED BACK SLIGHTLY A SMALL PASSAGE WAY OPENED
UP.. I PICKED SOMEONE UP OF THE FLOOR WITH THREE OTHER LADS AND CARRIED HIM
THROUGH THE TUNNEL WHERE I'D COME FROM, THE LAD APPEARED TO BE COMMING ROUND
I THINK HE WAS UNCONSIOUS AT THE TIME I FOUND HIM. A POLICE WOMAN CAME OVER
T O ^ S AND START TO HELP HIM. THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER BODIES LYING ON THE
FLOTR AND OTHER POLICE OFFICERS WERE TRYING TO REVIVE THEM...I THEN WENT BACK
INTO THE GROUND TO LOOK FOR SOME OF THE LADS I'D COME WITH BUT I COULDN'T
FIND THEM..BY THIS TIME IT LOOKED AS THOUGH THE POLICE HAD TAKEN SOME KIND OF
CONTROL... SO I SAT ON THE TERRACES GETTING MY BREATH... I LEFT THE GROUND AT
ABOUT 4.30.

THE INJURIES I SUSTAINED WERE BRUISED RIBS AND BRUISING TO THE LEGS.

I DIDN'T KNOW THE LADS I'D COME WITH THEY JUST OFFERED ME A LIFT IN THE
CAR.

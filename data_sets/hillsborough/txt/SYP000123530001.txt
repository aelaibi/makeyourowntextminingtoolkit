                       sufficient details of the parents obtained to enter on
                       a Form GEN/28.

3*                    When parents have been informed and identity verified
                       the juvenile should be reported on summons for the
                       offence disclosed and released from custody, or, if
                       necessary, detained to await collection by parents.
                       This will be done only with the consent of the Officer
                       in Charge of the Station. The Reporting Officer will
                       also complete a pro-forma statement to prove reporting
                       the juvenile and the form CTS/1.

                      The above instructions will not apply in the case
                      of a juvenile arrested jointly with an adult in so far as
                      it relates to reporting on summons. In those
                      circumstances he will be jointly charged with the
                      offence and bailed to Court at the same time as the
                      adult. It will be necessary under such circumstances
                      for close liaison to be maintained with the Officers
                      at the Charge Office in order that the charge may be
                      uniform for both/all parties and the date to be bailed
                      to Court is the same. Due to the fact that juveniles
                      will be detained at Hammerton Road Police Station, the
                      charges, although joint, will of necessity have to be
                      made at separate Stations.
NOTE

These instructions will apply to all persons except - (a) Persons
detained in ground for Breach of Ground Regulations who will have details
recorded and then be ejected from ground, and, (b) persons arrested for
criminal offences who will be interviewed by a C.I.D. Officer - with
arresting PC - prior to transfer to Charge Office.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH - C h i e f Superintendent David DUCKENFIELD

I reply to your letter dated 31 August 1990 which was addressed to the
Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.

You are correct when you say that the DPP has decided that there is
insufficient evidence to prosecute your client for any criminal offence
arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy.    It is also correct to say that
the disciplinary issues now have to be considered by South Yorkshire Police
in consultation with the Police Complaints Authority.

I believe you are also aware that there are outstanding civil actions being
brought by various parties with an interest in the matter, and that there
are 95 Coroner’s Inquests to be reconvened.

I am aware that at the interview on 3 July 1990 your client intimated that
once the DPP had made his decision in respect of the criminal issues, he
would consider being interviewed in respect of any disciplinary matters.
if that is still his wish then I am ready to conduct that interview but it
•sust be understood that the disciplinary matters are very closely related
to the criminal issues, so any interview would have to be conducted under a
Police and Criminal Evidence Act caution, and the transcript of the
questions and answers would have to be sent to the DPP for further
consideration of the criminal matters.
That is the position in respect^          ^
comes to light, for examp ,                   ^   ^   advise you or your client
as ^ h w ^ r o r ^ V ^ i l d   proceed, but it seems to me that you should be
aware of the foregoing information.
If i can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

Yours faithfully




Chief Constable

Dear Sirs

Hillsborough - Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

Thank you for your letter of 31 August 1990 which has been passed to me as
disciplinary authority for the Force. You will appreciate that matters
touching on the investigation of possible disciplinary offences are the
responsibility of the investigating officer. If Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield wishes to make a statement respecting the disciplinary aspects
the way ahead would be for him to contact Mr Sharp, the investigating officer,
so that an interview can take place.

Once any statement made by Mr Duckenfield has been considered and any
consequent investigation has been completed I would expect the evidence to
feature in Mr Sharp's report which will fall eventually for my consideration.

When I have made my decision as to disciplinary matters it will be for the
Police Complaints Authority to decide whether they agree with me. At this
stage the number of imponderables makes it impossible to draw up a timetable
but be assured that the need to proceed with all reasonable dispatch is well
recognised.

I will forward a copy of this correspondence to Mr Sharp for his information.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

Hillsborough - Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

As you will be aware,      we are instructed by Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield with regard to his position in relation to the criminal and
disciplinary aspects arising out of the Hillsborough case.

Now that the decision has been taken by the DPP that no criminal charges
are to be pursued against our client, there remains outstanding, the
question of disciplinary proceedings. In this regard, we trust that you
were advised by Mr L Sharp, that when Chief Superintendent Duckenfield
attended Sheffield on 3rd July for interview, he reserved his position as
to the making of any statement in response to the alleged breaches of
discipline regulations, until such time as the decision of the DPP was
known. As that time has now come^ it is likely that Chief Superintendent
Duckenfield may wish to make such a statement.

In the circumstances,     therefore,   can you please advise how the
disciplinary matters are to proceed. It would be helpful if you could
provide the anticipated timetable of events in relation to the
disciplinary matters to assist us in advising our client.

The writer Mr Coughlin looks forward to your early reply.




                                                                             n       L/X.           -j '

        Dear Sir

        Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield

        Your request to interview Chief Superintendent Duckenfield has now been
        considered. Whilst Chief Superintendent Duckenfield would wish to assist
        the inquiry team and to answer the complaints made pursuant to the Police
        Discipline Regulations 1985, he has been firmly advised by his Solicitors
        and Counsel that in view of the possibility of prosecution, which has yet
        to be decided,    he should not do so at the present time.          Chief
        Superintendent Duckenfield has reluctantly accepted that advice.

        We trust this makes the position clear.

             Dear Sir

             On 1st April 1990 I was appointed to take over the Hillsborough Disaster
             Inquiry following the appointment of Mr 6 Dear to the post of Her Majesty's
             Inspector of Constabulary. Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, is
             overseeing the Coronal aspects on behalf of the Coroner Dr Stefan Popper
             and I shall take charge of the Criminal Investigation and matters relating
             to complaints against the Police.

             I now enclose for your information copies of the video and photographic
             material you requested when you met Detective Chief Superintendent Foster
             at Furnival House.

             We are now in a position to commence the interviews of your client at your
             earliest convenience. To assist this if you contact Detective Chief
             Superintendent Foster direct on 021 359 1742 the necessary arrangements can
             be made.

CHIEF CONSTABLE MR P WRIGHT 15.4.89

Cannot say what was cause of surge.

Enquiry going on - to identify all witnesses.

Major pressure on turnstiles - Leppings Lane entrance.

Incident outside on Leppings Lane.

Only ones seeking entry - ONLY those with tickets.

Don't know what capacity is but believe there was room for 2,000 more.

WHO OPENED THE GATE? - "I do not wish to comment".

IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT THE GATE COULD HAVE BEEN OPENED WITHOUT POLICE
PERMISSION?

"No".

The gate was opened at police direction.

Not aware of connection between opening of gate and surge on terrace.

Gate was opened because there was danger to life outside fromcrushing,
(outside the turnstiles at Leppings Lane).

HOW DID THE SITUATION GET THAT BAD?

"By the late arrival of people".

At least 15 mounted and 40 uniformed officers outside.

3   to 4,000 people outside Leppings Lane stand.

The gate was shut (the one before the turnstiles) - torestrict   crush
on turnstiles.

This was forced open and crush continued.

DO YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY INJURY AT ALL OUTSIDE THE GROUND?

Only know 200 people injured where they were I cannot say.

HOW MANY FATALITIES OUTSIDE THE GROUND?

I cannot say.

WERE THOSE OUTSIDE SIMPLY ALLOWED TO COME IN?

I do not know, the tickets are still being checked.

The fans have been showing tickets.



                                                                 pto
♦




    People were let through to save their lives, it wouldn't have been
    possible to tear their tickets at the same time.

    Command to close gate would come from senior officer close to gate.

    "We are at this stage conducting a coroner's enquiry"

    Interested in film any television cameras have outside the ground.

    COMPLAINTS ABOUT BEING CRUSHED AGAINST THE GATES BY POLICE HORSES DO
    YOU KNOW IF THAT IS CORRECT?

    "No"

    About 800 officers involved in policing the match.
7.15 pm - 15.4.89



PRESS CONFERENCE HEADED BY CHIEF CONSTABLE PETER WRIGHT



93 dead.    At least 200 injured (figures so far ).   83 injured to one

hospital.   Major tragedy happened as a result of major surge of fans at

Leppings Lane end when many were trapped and injured.     CANNOT say what

caused surge.   An inquiry is being conducted.



I understand there was more on the turnstiles when 3000 to 4000 people

arrived at the ground within five to ten minutes, trying to get inside.



I am not in position to say whether there was any connection with reports

that a gate was opened and the surge.



Leppings Lane was not full - there was room for more fans.



(It would be wrong to discuss details at this stage in case I give the

wrong impression. )



The gate was opened at police direction.



15 mounted officers and 40 officers outside Leppings Lane.



Cannot say where deaths occurred.



The coroner has been informed.

SECOND PRESS CONFERENCE
10 AM SUNDAY 16 APRIL 1989

Headed by Superintendent Tony Pratt (Community Liaison)

                        FA CUP SEMI-FINAL TRAGEDY

                             QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

My colleague with me today from the Central Office of information is Tony
Poole.

What we will be doing is giving a short prepared statement. After both
of us have made a prepared statement we will try to absorb some of the
questions that you may like to ask.

The first is that Mr Peter Wright the Chief Constable of the Force regrets
not being with you this morning.   He has personally taken command of the
major enquiry that the coroner will require of him, so he's doing that
at this very moment in time.

Yesterday, whatever happend at Hillsborough, there was a demand for police
action and action was taken.

Nothing will be said today that will pre-empt any enquiry that takes place
into our actions or anyone elses actions.     That will not be subject to
any discussion.

One of the many things I witnessed yesterday at Hillsborough, having
arrived late and throughout yesterday, throughout late in the evening,
throughout late last night and throughout this morning is the deep shock
by the officers who were there.   They really are going through some pains
and agonies and I know they would wish me to pass on their condolences
to the people of Liverpool, of Nottingham and really to the Nation
generally who felt so distressed at what happened yesterday.

Can I clear the figures with you?

Those horrendous figures yesterday, as being the ones that we have agreed
at this time, as being the most correct figures.     We are talking about
casualties of 263, we are talking about 93 dead, and 170 injured.      Of
those hospitalised 34 of them are at the Royal Hallamshire of which 6
are in intensive care and 37 are presently in the Northern General
Hospital - 11 of them are in intensive care.

Gentlemen, that ends my short s t a t e m e n t , w o u l d like to tell
you of some of the events that are happening today.      Can simply I say
that we will be back here again, or I will be available to you, at      4
o' clock this afternoon.    I hope at 4 o'clock this afternoon to have a
list of people of whom we are able to confirm were fatally injured in
yesterday's incident at Hillsborough.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could say that     what I have to tell you at the
moment is for operational use only and not    for use until the actual visits
take place. A number of you will know, or      have heard from number 10 that
the Prime Minister is to visit the ground      today and she will also go to
the Northern General Hospital and the Royal    Hallamshire Hospital.

The information about her visit is not for use until her time of arrival
at the ground, time of arrival at the Norther General Hospital in the
case of her visit there and her time of arrival at the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital in the case of there.   I am laying that fairly firmly - there
are three embargoes.

The PM we believe, and     may confirm this, will be accompanied by the
Home Secretary and as I understand it, he will be with her throughout.

"yes"

There will be a press facility at the ground for the arrival of the PM
and the Home Secretary and we have yet actually to work that out but we
hope it will be at a suitable vantage point, inside the ground near to
the west stand.

We would suggest those who are covering should        go directly there from
this venue and rendevous with us.

"If they rendevous with us outside the director's entrance".

So as soon as we have fininshed here - outside the director's entrance
- we will have gone on ahead and hopefully sorted out the facility.

I suggest, I have no firm information, Bernard Ingram will be accompanying
the PM and I suggest that if the PM is to say anything to you it will
be at that point.

"What time is she likely to arrive?"

She is likely to arrive at 12.30 pm.

After visiting the football ground, which will last about half an hour,
I understand, the PM and the Home Secretary will go onto the Northern
General Hospital.

Now there is limited space inside, and for other obvious reasons this
will have to be on a rota pooled basis, and the same goes for the visit
to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

 "Who is organising that?"

 I will give you the details in a moment.




                                   - 2 -
The rota party in each case, obviously you are entitled to wait outside
the hospital to see her arrive and depart. The rota parties in each case
for coverage inside a ward subject to the hospital agreeing and the
patients agreeing will be as follows: —

1 TV - of cameras, lights, sound, only no reporter, I did argue on your
behalf but the answer was very firmly no and I gather that Brenda
Griffiths has very kindly sorted out the split.

In addition there will be 2 photographers and 2 reporters - no local radio
reporter, I am sorry again I did argue on your behalf but the answer again
was a very firm no.

"Any radio reporters?"

No you should be able to go in afterwards, but otherwise it will be a
matter of picking up the feed from TV and a report from reporters.

The split is as follows:-

At the Northern General your contacts are John Short and Paul Shaw from
my office and Liz Diamond from the Trent Regional Health Authority.
The rota composition there is 1 crewe from ITN - camera, lights, sound
- no reporter.

Photographers from The Star (Sheffield) and PA or a National.        Can you
sort that out and let me know the outcome.

A reporter from The Star (Sheffield), Liverpool Echo and PA or a National.

No additions to the number.

At the Royal Hallamshire - BBC TV - camera, lights, sound no reporter,
photographers from Liverpool Post or Echo and PA or a National.

"PA"

Reporters from Liverpool, Daily Post or Echo and PA or a National.

SUPERINTENDENT PRATT

I do not intend to do interviews after this particular briefing.

Q   There has been criticism of the way in which the emergency services
    reacted during the incident not realising it was so serious, have you
    any comment on that please?

A   We can understand people criticising any aspect and every aspect where
    a major tragedy happens. In due course of time we will find a balanced
    view of where those criticisms should be directed.
Q   Superintendent, would you acknowledge that there was a lack of policing
    inside the ground, bearing in mind the criticism, that although the
    crowd were allowed in, there were no officers inside dispersing them.

A   The only thing I will do is confirm that there was a demand for police
    action - action was taken and Mr Wright responded to that yesterday.

    There was a need for police action and it was taken and we could play
    table tennis with this one all day and go back and forward.

Q    Was it within accordance   of the act covering the safety of sports
    guide?

A   Everything that was done at Hillsborough was in accordance with well
    tried and tested methods of policing at an FA Cup semi-final

Q    Do the police here accept that the opening    of    that   door was   the
    eventual precipitation of the tragedy?

A   Theview of Mr Wright is exactly as it was last night.

Q   Have the police expressed concern that the design of the crash barriers
    could contribute to the type of tragedy that happened?

A   The type of crash barrier that is at Hillsborough is the type that
    has been there for semi-final after semi-final and has the approval
    of everyone historically. What the future will hold, I do not know.

I refuse to speculate on what others are experts at.

Q   How many emergency gates are there?

A   I do not have that detail and if you are at Hillsborough today you
    will be able to count them yourself.

Q   Is the opening of the gates within the accepted practice?

A   The demand for police action in opening gates is something that takes
    place on any number of occasions.

Q   Can you explain, in more detail what happened outside the ground?

A   No.

Q   Was anyone injured outside the ground?

A   Not that we are aware of.

We have now got to the end of the 10 o'clock briefing.




                                   - 4 -
The planning and the operational decisions of South Yorkshire Police

officers will form a major aspect of the enquiry to be held into the

events which led to the tragedy at the Sheffield Wednesday football

ground on 15 April.



The Chief Constable Mr Peter Wright judges it essential that the

gathering and assessment of evidence in relation to these matters

should be carried out by officers from another Force.   He has

therefore asked Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of West Midlands, to

nominate a senior officer to lead the enquiry.
                                                                              c:-£- '




Specific request to interview Supt. Marshall         (as the     officer who gave
the instruction to open the gate).

To interview Ch.Supt Duckenfield as officer in overall command (because
he has only just taken over at the Division and relative to changes he
might have made in the operational order).

What liaison has the Force had with Social Services in planning for major
disasters and questions regarding counselling of police officers in the
aftermath of the disaster.

Comments on newspaper reports( The Star, Sheffield) that the outside
wall was about to collapse, the gate had started to buckle under the
pressure and people were about to die outside the ground.

Comments on an officer asking for the match to           be delayed for about 15
minutes to ease the congestion outside, but was           ignored. The media are
speculating that Supt. Roger Marshall asked for          a fifteen minute delay,
thought he had got permission, but that this             was turned down by the
organisers.

Two reports received by one local radio station that 4 people were dead
in the crush outside the ground and another one that people had died
outside the ground.

Why were 700 supporters held back at Wadsley Bridge station until half
an hour before the match kicked off.

Why did police officers form a solid line across the           grounds to separate
the supporters.

Why weren't the   Liverpool    supporters   put   into   the   kop   end   (Penistone
Road North).

How many officers were on duty at last year's semi final.

Brian Mole's office has been approached for interview as to further
details of his personal career, in particular why he left Hammerton Road.

The majority of the reporters wisb to analyse the policing operation
as a whole and specifically in depth about the disaster.         The Press
Office have confirmed that no comments can be made regarding the
operational element of policing as the investigating force will be dealing
with this.

Were fans urinating   over    the   stretchers that came       in near the police
room.

Yorkshire Post, Monday April 17th


The six key questions which the Force refused to answer last night:-

Why was a life threatening crush allowed to develop outside the ground
as thousands of Liverpool fans arrived late?
<r




     Did Police deliberately delay Liverpool supporters' coaches      until    the
     last minute in an attempt to avoid trouble outside the ground.

     Were Police and stewards inside the ground warned before the 16ft outer
     gate was opened

     Why were fans not directed to the sides of the terrace instead of being
     left to pour into the central tunnel where many of them died

     Why was the kick off not delayed to allow all the fans in more slowly
     and safely.

     Why was a gate in the pitch side perimeter fence - a vital escape route
     - not unlocked sooner.

     The investigation will also focus on the actions of Ch.Supt. David
     Duckenfield, the officer in charge of crowd control at Hillsborough.
     He is understood to have approved the full order to open the Leppings
     Lane gate."

     This morning the Yorkshire Post were also asking     for   confirmation    of
     Supt. Marshall giving the order to open the gates.

CHIEF COKSTBLE'S INTERVIEW
HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION


17.4.89



It is a very difficult time for everyone.                There has been a major tragedy
and    immense   speculation      in    the media.       The Police      will not      speculate
and we are not in a position to reveal the nature of the events which
took place because this will prejudice any enquiry.                       I am here to tell
my    officers   that     I think      they did   a good job before        and during           that
terrible      situation    they   were      faced with    as a result      of    tbe     tragedy.
I am here to share with them and express my confidence in them.


Anybody who looks at the nature of events that those officers were faced
with    and   now   starts questioning         the    decisions   that    were    taken,        with
knowledge, will view it differently.


Officers have seen nothing in the Press but criticism and I want to tell
them I know a little about of what has                   taken place     and that I do not
share those criticisms.                It is proper to ask questions because answers
need to be given,         not least to relatives of people who were killed in
the tragedy, but apportioning blame at this stage is pointless and coming
to     immediate    conclusions        is   equally    pointless.        Let     there     be     an
independent enquiry where all the evidence can be heard and then judge
what happened.
                Transcript of Press Conference held at

   POLICE HEADQUARTERS, SHEFFIELD at 10.45am TUESDAY 18 APRIL 1989


              (Lord Justice Taylor and Mr Geoffrey Dear)


Taylor L J :
"... but today, my object is simply to listen and to look and to
make such arrangements as can be made for a speedy start. It s far
too early for me to say anything about what recommendations might
be made and I would respectfully say to all those who are disposed
to comment on this terrible disaster that it would be better that
we should wait to ascertain the facts before proposing solutions."

Question from Yorkshire Telivision reporter -
"What will be the scope of your enquiry?"

 Taylor L J:
 "Well the terms of reference were indicated yesterday by the Home
 Secretary to enquire into the events of the Sheffield (sic), at
Sheffield)
 Wednesday Football ground   onthe 15th of April and to make
 recommendations about theneeds of crowd control and safety at sports
 grounds so they are very wide terms of reference."

Inaudible question about the governments plans to continue the
introduction of ID cards and whether it would interfere with the
enquiry.

Taylor L J:
"The enquiry has a very full range and I shall be able to make
recommendations in regard   tothat matter as well as all others and
I hope that that will be reflected in what course of action is taken
afterwards."

Reporter -
"What was your immediate personal reaction when you witnessed the
scenes on television like many others?"

 Taylor L J :
 "Horrible of course."

 Reporter -
 "Can you elaborate a bit more on that?"

 Taylor L J:
 "Why should I, it's quite clear."

 Inaudible question.

 Taylor L J:
 II
    Certainly, I know that it's hopedfchat an interim report can be
provided in time to take steps before next season begins and I shall
certainly aim to do that and I'm sure with the help of Mr Dear and
his force we'll get this enquiry going as quickly as we can. If
some recommendations/lpi^rge at an early^«tage which can be usefully
acted upon then thatSrfll be done beforej^fii^al report."

Inaudible question from BBC Television, Leeds.

Taylor L J:                   ^
"I have not considered anybodys) roll in the enquiry as yet but of
course we will do      earliest."

Inaudible question.

Taylor L J:
"We'll be hearing evidence in public in regard to the events of the
day and indeed we will hope to hold all of the enquiry in public
so far as it relates to what happened. When it comes to other
representations from interested bodies, people who have useful
comments to make, we would invite them to make comments in writing
and possibly to make visits and informally discuss the matter with
me at a later stage but the principal enquiry will be in public in
order to enquire into what happened."

Question from BBC Radio -
"Will you need any more help from the police force, do you envisage
other bodies being involved?"

Taylor L J:
"Well I'm going to have the assistance of the Chief Constable of
Lancashire as an assessor since obviously police involvement is an
important aspect of this enquiry and it may well be that another
assessor to deal with another aspect of it may be appointed too but
that has not Q)et been decided."
             /
Reporter -
"Will the form be the same as with the Clapham enquiry?"

Taylor L J:
"Well we have to decide the precise form. Each enquiry obviously
has its own needs and will have to adapt to whatever seem to be the
needs of this particular enquiry."

Inaudible question from ITN .

Taylor L J:
A'Without making any statement as to whether those recommendations
were or not acted upon obviously one conducts an enquiry of this
kind and makes recommendations, one would hope that they would at
any rate be seriously considered and acted upon if that was thought
to be right."

Reporter -
"What do you say about them taking the fences down now?"
Taylor L J :
"I say nothing about that."

Reporter -
"Chief Constable, can I just ask, are we giving talks to any of the
police officers?"

Chief Constable:
"No we haven't spoken to any of the police officers at all other
than in the station here but obviously we shall do within the next
few days."

Reporter -
"It's been said that there was no leadership and what leadership
there was, was inept. If police officers have shown to have been
inept, what would have happened?"

Chief Constable:
"Well I don't know, I think you're jumping a lot of hurdles
simultaneously there. I've come to it with a pretty open mind as
indeed Sir Peter Taylor has and I think it's far too soon to come
to conclusions like that."

Taylor L J :
"Can I just say that Mr Dear and I met for the first time a very
few minutes ago. Some part of today we hope to have together in
order to decide how best to collate the evidence swiftly, but beyond
that it's very difficult to make any statements at the moment."

Reporter -
"Have you got a message for the bereaved families?"

Taylor L J:
"The same message that's been given by people all over the country,
extreme sympathy and a resolution to see that this kind of thing
doesn't happen again."

Inaudible question.

Taylor L J :
"If it were necessary to be considered we'll consider it and refer
it to the necessary authorities."

Reporter -
"When do you expect your enquiry to start?"

Taylor L J :
"Well that's what we want to discuss today, obviously as soon as
possible. The immediate need is for the West Midlands force and
Mr Dear to set about getting the evidence which he tells me I think
he'll be able to start doing tomorrow so we would hope that it won't
be long before we can start the enquiry in public. I don't know
whether Mr Dear would like to say anything on that."

Mr Dear:
"I think you will appreciate that with an enquiry of this size and
complexity, these days you're very wise to use computers and we would
want a person putting in a computer back up so that everything that
is taken is readily retreavable. I would have thought at a guess
that it would probably on the grounds of getting the enquiry within
2 days."

Reporter -
"By the end of this week?"

Mr Dear:
"Yes, by the end of this week."

Inaudible question about how many men are with him.

Mr Dear:
"There are 3 officers with me today, Mr Mirvin Jones the Assistant
Chief Constable and 2 Chief Superintendents. The question posed
yesterday was what did we think the enquiry would entail and we said
we didn't know and indeed I still don't know and it was put to me
that could it be as high as 150 and I said it could be something
in that context."

Inaudible question.

Mr Dear:
"Oh no, it could be a large number but not necessarily."

Taylor L J :
"Can I just clarify that I think Mr Dear meant when he said the
enquiry could start within the next couple of days, this enquiry,
not a public enquiry."

Inaudible question.

Mr Dear:
"I'm grateful to you because half the press has got hold of the wrong
end of the stick. Let me make it absolutely clear. If there was
no question mark over the South Yorkshire Police they wouldn't be
preparing evidence and putting it through to this enquiry. Because
they are central to the issue and they are dubbed as yet unresolved,
Mr Peter Wright quite properly stood bacfe^>roi9-»that-and asked for
another force to come in. I was asked bpfcihe Home Secretary to make
my force and myself available and indeed "I have" done so. South
Yorkshire therefore take no part in the enquiry. My recommendations,
all those that I gather with my team will go direct to the enquiry
that the Judge is holding."

Reporter -
"So your recommendations will be to the public enquiry?"

Mr Dear:
"Solely to this public enquiry and this is the only enquiry taking
place."
Reporter^-
"What i0Vou felt there was a breach of criminal law, would you be
able to prosecute?"

Taylor L J:                                             ,
"Well I think again you're jumping hurdles. If there were a breach
of the law-^ if there jwere a >Reach in the disapline regulations,
then the Jbibector of $u)Dlic foiosecutions should have an interest
and so too/should the-'-policev’^

Inaudible question.

Taylor L J:
"I would have to ask them but I would expect to find them watching
points closely and standing as it were on the sidelines but certainly
only one enquiry direct to the judge."

Reporter -
"But you feel your main job with regard to the police enquiry is
just to find out what happened and present that with your
recommendations to this enquiry?"

Taylor L J:
"To this enquiry, yes."

Reporter -
"Could you Summarise the focus of your enquiries?"

Taylor L J:                         la|c|
"The focus of the enquiry will be         down as the terms of reference
to find out what happened and to make recommendations as to how this
situation could be avoided in the future."

Inaudible question.

Taylor L J :
"No I think it would be premature, I think it's a big mistake to
say at this stage what are going to be the most important issues
and one must wait to have the evidence. I'm here really to listen,
not to talk today."

Inaudible question.

Taylor L J:
"We shall be looking at all aspects, including that."

Reporter -
"Chief Constable can I just ask you, people of Sheffield feel terrible
about this disaster and some police may feel guilty anyway just for
the fact that they were policing in this situation and it happened
while they were on duty. What do you say to that and what do you
say to these police officers?"

Chief Constable:
"Well, if what you said is true, I could understand it and I can
underhand that Sheffield itself must feel if not a sense of guilt,
certainly extreme distress at it happening and all that I can say
to you is really that this enquiry is seeking the truth to cut away
a certain amount of mythology which is beginning to grow and it s
the truth that we're seekingand It's the truth that   will come out
of the enquiry, I'm quite sure."

Inaudible question.

Taylor L J:
"Well we hope that in the       very near future that there will be
appointed counsel for the enquiry.     Clearly it's not going to be
desirable or helpful to have evidence from everybody who was there
and saw something.    What will be done, is with the assistance of
Mr Dear and his team and counsel to the enquiry to make sure that
the evidence which is given in public fairly represents all the news
and all the factual comment and content that we can      need in order
to arrive at what happened and make recommendations, but it doesn't
mean that everybody will necessarily be called in public."

Inaudible question about advice on safety of the public outside the
ground.

Taylor L J:
"Well obviously we'll have to consider at the enquiry not only what
happened in the ground but what happened leading up to the ground
if I could put it that way.    That may involve questions of ticket
allocation, questions of transport to the ground and other matters
of that sort but all that is within the terms of reference and we'll
look at it."

Inaudible question.

Taylor L J:
"Then again it applies for the streets but we'll certainly look at
the affect and    conditions  of  the  grounds  of   certificates."

    should be carried out by officers from another Force. He has
    therefore asked Mr Geoffrey Dear, C.C. of West Midlands, to nominate
    a senior officer to lead the enquiry.'

MONDAY 17 APRIL 1989

Call at 10pm Sunday 16 April from Mike Woodcock Yorkshire Post making

questions regarding the policing of the match. Insp.Walton took the call
at home and responded that the request was out of the question .

The calls during the day were in the main regarding the list of those DEAD
and INJURED. The liost of fatalities was the prior one and this proved
difficult because of some discepencies with addresses etc. The list was
finally available around Noon and was sent by Fax to Press Association.
Copy to the Merseyside Police press office, GMP. etc. A full list was being
sent by Ops Room to all UK forces.

Many requests received to interview :-
SUPT. MARSHALL (as the press believed he had given the order to open gate)

Ch.Supt. DUCKENFIELD as the new Divisional Commander who had only been in
charge for three weeks. The impression was that he may have made operation
-al changes to the plan which may have weakened it and contributed to the
disaster.

Requests to clarify questions which were raised in a Yorkshire Post article
today:
Why was a life threateneing crush allowed to develop outside the ground as thousands
of Liverpool fans arrived late.
Did police deliberatly delay Liverpool supporters coaches until the last
minute in an attempt to aviod trouble outside the ground
Were the police and stewards inside the ground warned before the 16ft
outer gate was opened.
Why were fans not directed to the sides of the tertace instead of being left
to pour into the central tunnel where many of them died.
Why was the kick off not delayed to allow all the fans in more slowly and safely,
why was a gate in the pitch perimeter fence, a vital escape route not unlocked
sooner.
The investigation will also focus on the actions of Ch.Supt. David Duckenfield
the officer in charge of crowd control tBXBpBHXxxxx&BppiHgsx&aiiBxgatBX at Hillsborou
He is understood to have approved the full order to open the Leppings Lane gate.

Yorshire Post also asking to confirm that Supt. Marshall gave the order to open the
gate.
Social Work Today—   1. What liaison has the force had with the local Social Services
regarding such disasters and the planning arraNGEMENTS WHICH ACCOMPY THEM.
REPLY: There is a whole range of palnning which has been undertaken between
the two services This covers disasters, evacuation, housing feeding etc.
No details of last excercise either kniown or given.
(2) There have been reports of police officers being counselled since
the event can you confirm.: REPLY. Yes officers have been counselled and I do hnow
that some were off work on the Sunday, current state not known. Access to
Welfare Officer declined.

FROM WEST MIDS. PRESS OFFICE:    The confderence sceduled for 11am at West Mids.
has now been put back to 4pm     (later put back to 4.30pm)

Radio Hallam:   Two reports have come in from relatives of police officers
who were onduty outside the Leppings Lane end 1. says that 4 people were
dead in the crush outside the ground the other says that some
people had died outside the ground. Can we confirm.
WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION TO CONFIRM OR DENY. The positions of some of the
dead etc will obviously form part of the enquiry into the incident.


Yorkshire T.V.   reports have been received that 700 Liverpool fans were
held back at Wadsley Bridge station mntil just before kick-off WHY
2. why were the police lined up across the ground after the incident. WHY
Both put on the list and to be discussed by Supt.Pratt with the
Chief Constable.

Why weren't the Liverpool supporters put into the Kop end (Penistone
Road North)

How many officers were on duty at Last Years semi-final   (between same clubs)

CH.SUPT. MOLE's office have been approached for interview as to further details
of his career and the reasons he left Hammerton Road.

NUMEROUS REQUESTS concern the whole police operation, first the planning
of the game, variations from previous semis, location of certain officers,
and specifically an in-depth analysis of the dissaster (timetable of events
locality of the bodies etc. )(just what the Enquiry will want'.!!!

RESPONSES to those requests have been that no comments can be made as all those questi
will be answered and required to the enquiry which is the proper place for
such rersponses.



SUPT.MAWSON: West Yorkshire Police I/C of operations at the Bradford
Fire. He has been approached to appear on a special YTV programme between 6-7pm
this evening to discus the problems faced by the police in such events. As these
two incidents are not the same he has not yet decided whether to appear of not. He had
allready discussed the likely respopnse to questions should he appear. He woukld
stay clear of any comment on operational matter which might have a bearing
on our game. He will ring back when he has made his decision.

Radio Spain from Barcelona rang and recorded a interview which mainly dealt
with the number of deaths and injured. Some of the questioins concerned
widers issues such as Bristish clubs playing in europe. Did not
stray into that area and stuck with the response to the enquiry (Insp.WaltyHn )


Bob Westerda^e rang re the articvle the Star Sheffield would be carrying concerning
nameing Supt. Ridger Marshgall as the man who gave the order to open the gate.
Basically he said the article was piro police and no doubt had come from his
own police sources.  (Martin Boss news editor of the Star had allready discussed
this with Supt.Pratt.)

WESTERDALE made a specific request to interview Supt.Marshal1. REFUSED.
His other main question was there had been an appeal over police radio to delay
the start of the mtach by 15 minutes to assist in getting the crowd into the
ground. Why was this not allowed.

SUPT.MARSHALL contacted the office, he had directly been approached by WHITES
freelance agency of Shewffield to talk about the match. He had referred them to
the Press Office.

                Today: Sheffield Wednesday had mucked up (her words) the
printing of the ticvkets and had printed and issued too many. They had told
the police in advance of the game that there could be a problem. Can we confirm.

No we cannot confirm, we have no knowledge of this.

police in general and SYP in particular.

 suggestions we have received: a) That police were urinated upon while they
 were removing the bodies b)coins and other items were being thrown at them,
 c)pockets were being rifled (looting) and d) many officers have been
.treated for stress.
 REPLY Most of those questions will no doubt be covered in the far ranigning enquirie
 currently under way. Yes officers have been counselled for stress and so have
 the nurses and hospital staff.

From Supt. Torr, Cas. bur. One more person has died during the night. He is
Lee Nicholl, 14 yrs in the NGH. Before you release it to the press would you
confirm with the mortuary that he has been formally identified as the parents
were with him during the night but formal i.d. needs to be done.
Check with Norman Thompson, coroners officer. The situation is that the division
has been asked to do the foramlitiesbut there might be some problems because
the parents have given permission for the organs to be used for other patients.

Checked above with F2 who are doing the i.d. which was later completed. However,
from Supt.Torr at Cas Bur. Request we do not release id of Nicholl as a request
has been received from             from the N.G. not to.

TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JESS NADIN 11.00am to 11.25am on
Wednesday 19 April 1989 in Chief Superintendent Mole's Office.

Q        Just give me your name and title
A        Chief Superintendent Brian Mole, I'm the Chairman of the
          Superintendents Association for England and Wales, the
          South Yorkshire Branch.
Q        As your role as Chairman for the Association,       what is
          your view of the part played by Roger Marshall and David
          Duckenfield?
A        I think the Officers carried out their duty in a first
          class manner.     They had to make decisions and those
          decisions were made in the circumstances which they were
          facing.
Q        I understand you are not actually in a position to
          comment actually comment on whether or not it was right
          to open the gate, but with your experience do you think
          that was something which was very understandable, a
          decision had to be made on the spur of the moment.
A        I think like every operation, an Officer who is in charge
          of certain areas has to make decisions. Mr Marshall made
          his decision and that now will be subject to the Judicial
          review to examine the rights or wrongs of those decisions
          that were made.
Q        What sort of pressures do you high ranking Police
          Officers face in situations like this?
A        I think high ranking Police Officers, and all Police
          Officers,    face tremendous pressures because they're
          constantly aware of the difficulties they face and they
          have to react to those situations, but on this occasions
           the pressure afterwards has been horrendous on Mr
          Marshall and Mr Duckenfield and that they really need
           support and I hope that the public will realise that they
          have made decisions at the time under the circumstances
           they   faced and    they  are  now being haranged and
          pressurised by the media for something which I think it
           is wrong to pre-judge an issue and they do need support
           like all the Officers who were present at the time need
           support.
Q        The whole Force, of the South Yorkshire Police Force,
           seems to have come under a lot of criticism.      Related
           this morning the Liverpool fans are furious at the
           actions they were drunk and disorderly outside the ground
           before the game began.
A        It is a sad fact of life that there are always instant
           experts after an event of this nature.    Anyone who has
           any common sense of knowledge of football, or any other
           matter where the public are involved, know that there are
           tremendous amount of good honest to goodness people who
           are there to enjoy the event. There are also an element
           of people who are intent on causing trouble and disorder
           and to say that they weren't there I believe is wrong.
           There are those elements at all factions, that's why
           we've had so many problems in the past with football
           hooliganism.
Q        Do you accept though criticism though that the Police are
trying to alleviate some of the blame which is being
centred on them at the moment?
I think the point you make about blame to give blame at
this stage is wrong.   That will be tested and looked at.
People are making comments, sweeping comments, which are
unfair and unjustified.       I don't think there's any
attempt to justify Police action. The comments that have
been made are being made in the understanding that there
are two sides to every problem and we must look at that.
What we must care about are the people involved, the
families, the friends, the relatives, who are being
exposed to a tremendous pressure from the media, from the
papers, and also my Officers who are being exposed to
that same problem.     We really need to care and use a
little bit of human kindness for all those people who
have been tragically effected by the events last weekend.
How are the Officers holding up under the pressure?
They are holding up.     There are some Officers who are
worse than others, but are really under considerable
pressure and stress and it's showing and we need to help
and support those, as we need to help and support the
families and friends of those vicitims.
Before you were moved to Barnsley, Hillsborough and games
at Hillsborough were under your jurisdiction. With your
expertise of the area, do you think that the operation
which was carried out last Saturday was normal and the
kind of operation you would expect for a game of that
 importance.
As I've said, I cannot comment on the nature of the
 event, but looking at it across the board it was a semi
 final played at Hillsbrough, a ground which has staged
 those before and you can never cater for those types of
 events which have variances and different degrees and
Officers have to respond to what they see at the time and
 I believe that is the case on this occasion.
This time last Saturday, one of the problems people are
 talking about is that so many fans arrived at the last
 minute without tickets.     Doesn't that usually happen
 anyway, that you get a rush at the last minute?
 I think at all big events people do come late. I don't
 know the circumstances on this occasion and it would be
 wrong of me to comment, but yes there is an element who
 persistently come late to matches.
 Do you think there was enough Police cover there at the
 time, knowing that this very often happens.
 I'm satisfied from my knowledge that all the plans that
were made were right.    I wouldn't comment on whether or
 not there was enough or too few, or what, I don't know
 and it would be wrong of me to take on the mantel that
 others are doing now and to judge.     There is a review
 being carried out and that will look at the whole issue
 and I am sure that the answer will be forthcoming at that
 time.
 Finally, on the night of the disaster, you actually took
 over from the Police Officer in charge at the time. Why
 was that?
I merely responded to the ground following a call for
Officers to help.    The fact that I have a knowledge of
the Ground from past experience certainly helped to
settle the matter down and deal with the tragedy that had
occurred.   I merely assisted my colleagues who clearly
were under a lot of pressure.
Just to clear the matter up, there is no question of
people being removed from duty.
Absolutely not.   There is no suggestion of that at all,
never has been and never should be. The Officers did an
excellent job in carrying out their role and were faced
with a situation on which they had to make decisions and
had to respond to. They now need support and help, like
everybody else, who was faced with-this tragic event.

on the more contraversial elements of slanging matches between Merseyside

                           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
            CHIEF CONSTABLE’S STATEMENT TO THE POLICE AUTHORITY

Members will be aware of the major tragedy which occurred at Hillsborough
Football Ground on Saturday 15 April 1989, as a result of which 95 people
died, 140 were treated at local hospitals and five are still in intensive
care.

Because this Force has a responsibility for law and order in the area and
assisted the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club with the control of the event,
it would have been wrong for the South Yorkshire Police to have gathered the
evidence and come to conclusions about the cause. Therefore I asked
Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of West Midlands, to carry out this task and
he agreed.

The Home Secretary has announced that there will be an Inquiry led by Lord
Justice Taylor. The terms of reference are:-


          ’to inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday
          Football Ground on 15 April 1989 and to malce
          recommendations about the needs of crowd control and
          safety at sports events’.


Mr Geoffrey Dear will be submitting the evidence he gathers to the hearings to
be held by Lord Justice Taylor. The South Yorkshire Police will give all
information in their possession to those conducting the Inquiry.

I can inform members that the planning preparatory to the event was on the
basis of that applied to previous similar matches. The number of police
officers on duty in connection with the event both inside and outside the
ground was 1,111 of whom 257 were    the ground.

It is understandable that this event has attracted immense media attention and
I must inform members that much of what has been said by the media is
incorrect.

Attention has been focused on the actions and decisions of individual
officers. Those involved at the matfch found themselves facing the possibility
of a disaster outside the ground and took action which they considered
appropriate to resolve that situation.

 I must say that those officers were appointed by me to make those
 decisions and it follows that I accept full responsibility for the police
 action connected with the event.

 I welcome the Inquiry which is about to take place and which will undoubtedly
 reveal the true nature and cause of this terrible tragedy. I believe that
 when it is completed the actions of the South Yorkshire Police will be seen in
 a very different light.

 I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the tremendous support
 and assistance provided during and after this terrible tragedy by churchmen,
 the statutory and voluntary agencies and members of the public to the victims,
 the families of the victims and to the police.
     CHIEF CONSTBLE'S INTERVIEW

     HAMMERTON ROAD POLICE STATION



     17.4.89


     It is a very difficult time for everyone.                  There has been a major tragedy
     and    immense     speculation    in    the media.         The Police will not           speculate
     and we are not in a position to reveal the nature of the events which
     took place because this will prejudice any enquiry.                         I am here to tell
     my    officers     that   I think      they did a good job before            and during          that
••




     terrible      situation    they    were     faced   with    as   a result    of    the     tragedy.
     I am here to share with them and express my confidence in them.


     Anybody who looks at the nature of events that those officers were faced
     with    and   now    starts   questioning      the    decisions     that    were    taken,       with
     knowledge, will view it differently.


     Officers have seen nothing in the Press but criticism and I want to tell
     them I know a little about of what has taken place and that I do not
     share those criticisms.                It is proper to ask questions because answers
     need to be given,         not least to relatives of people who were killed in
     the tragedy, but apportioning blame at this stage is pointless and coming
••




     to     immediate     conclusions       is   equally    pointless.          Let     there    be     an
     independent enquiry where all the evidence can be heard and then judge
     what happened.
TRANSCRIPT OF INTERVIEW WITH JESS NADIN 11.00am to 11.25am       on
Wednesday 19 April 1989 in Chief Superintendent Mole's Office.

          Just give me your name and title
a <

          Chief Superintendent Brian Mole, I'm the Chairman of the
          Superintendents Association for England and Wales, the
          South Yorkshire Branch.
Q         As your role as Chairman for the Association, what is
          your view of the part played by Roger Marshall and David
          Duckenfield?
A         I think the Officers parried out their duty in a first
          class manner.     They had to make decisions and those
          decisions were made in the circumstances which they were
          facing.
 Q "      I understand you are not actually in a position to
          comment actually comment on whether or not it was right
           to open the gate, but with your experience do you think
           that was something which was very understandable, a
          decision had to be made on the spur of the moment.
 A        I think like every operation, an Officer who is in charge
          of certain areas has to make decisions. Mr Marshall made
          his decision and that now will be subject to the judicial
          review to examine the rights or wrongs of those decisions
           that were made.
 Q        What sort of pressures do you high ranking Police
          Officers face in situations like this?
 A        I think high ranking Police Officers, and all Police
          Officers, face     tremendous pressures because they're
           constantly aware of the difficulties they face and they
           have to react to those situations, but on this occasions
           the pressure afterwards     has been horrendous on Mr
          Marshall and Mr Duckenfield and that they really need
           support and I hope that the public will realise that they
           have made decisions at the time under the circumstances
           they   faced and    they are   now being haranged and
           pressurised by the media for something which I t m n k it
           is wrong to pre-judge an issue and they do need support
           like all the Officers who were present at the time need
           support.
 Q        The whole Force, of the South Yorkshire Police Force,
           seems to have come under a lot of criticism.      Related
           this morning the Liverpool fans are furious at the
           actions they were drunk and disorderly outside the ground
           before the game began.
 A        It is a sad fact of life that there are always instant
           experts after an event of this nature.     Anyone who has
           any common sense of knowledge of football, or any other
          matter where the public are involved, know that there are
           tremendous amount of good honest to goodness people who
           are there to enjoy the event. There are also an element
           of people who are intent on causing trouble and disorder
           and to say that they weren't there I believe is wrong.
          There sire those elements at all factions, that's why
           we've had so many problems in the past with football
           hooliganism.
 Q        Do you accept though criticism though that the Police are
trying to alleviate some of the blame which is being
centred on them at the moment?
I think the point you make about blame to give blame at
this stage is wrong.    That will be tested and looked at.
People are making comments, sweeping comments, which are
unfair and unjustified.        I don’t think there's any
attempt to justify Police action. The comments that have
been made are being made in the understanding that there
are two sides to every problem and we must look at that.
What we must care about are the people involved, the
families, the friends, the relatives, who are being
exposed to a tremendous pressure from the media, from the
papers, and also my Officers who are being exposed to
that same problem.     We really need to care and use a
little bit of human kindness for all those people who
have been tragically affected by the events last weekend.
How are the Officers holding up under the pressure?
They sire holding up.     There sire some Officers who are
worse than others, but are really under considerable
pressure and stress and it's showing and we need to help
and support those, as we need to help and support the
families and friends of those vicitims.
Before you were moved to Barnsley, Hillsborough and games
at Hillsborough were under your jurisdiction.     With your
expertise of the area, do you think that the operation
which was carried out last Saturday was normal and the
kind of operation you would expect for a game of that
importance.
As I've said, I cannot comment on the nature of the
event, but looking at it across the board it was a semi
final played at Hillsbrough, a ground which has staged
those before and you can never cater for those types of
events which have variances and different degrees and
Officers have to respond to what they see at the time and
I believe that is the case on this occasion.
This time last Saturday, one of the problems people are
talking about is that so many fans arrived at the last
minute without tickets.       Doesn’t that usually happen
anyway, that you get a rush at the last minute?
I think at all big events people do come late. I don't
know the circumstances on this occasion and it would be
wrong of me to comment, but yes there is an element who
persistently come late to matches.
Do you think there was enough Police cover there at the
time, knowing that this very often happens.
I'm satisfied from my knowledge that all the plans that
were made were right.     I wouldn't comment on whether or
not there was enough or too few, or what, I don’t know
and it would be wrong of me to take on the mantel that
others are doing now and to judge.       There is a review
being carried out and that will look at the whole issue
and I am sure that the answer will be forthcoming at that
time.
Finally, on the night of the disaster, you actually took
over from the Police Officer in charge at the time. Why
was that?
V



    A   I m e r e l y responded to the ground following a call for
        Officers to help.        The fact that I have a knowledge of
         the Ground from past experience certainly helped to
         settle the matter down and deal with the tragedy that had
         occurred.      I cerely assisted my' colleagues who clearly
        were under a lot of pressure.
    Q   Just to clear the matter up, there is no question of
         people being removed from duty.
    A   Absolutely not.       There is no suggestion of that at all,
        never has been and never should be. The Officers did an
         excellent job in carrying out their role and were faced
         with a situation cr. which they had to make decisions and
         had to respond to. They now need support and help, like
         everybody else, who was faced with-this tragic event.

               duty of          liaison officer.

               Du r i n g   this       period          it became appar e n t                that    despite     stewards        being

               em p l o y e d     by the        club man y were               failing          to do anything        other      than

               a t t e n d at       the ground and                 disappear           if problems arose - m any failed to

               wear      their        tabbards         and others were                   physi c a l l y   incapable     of     carrying

                out     their       duty.        It was also a p p a r e n t                that m a n y of the       stewards         had no

               real      idea what            they should d o .                 One    of the       problems     on m a t c h days was

                that     the      club had no overall                     m an a g e m e n t    of their     stewards.

In August        1981        <000081)         I remember          that       I received a m e m o r a n d u m from

stewards at S h e f f i e l d             Wednesday Football                   Club.

I brought Mr H E R O L D ’s               comments,          and further            views       of my own,         to the

these     points         in all        the    informal          and formal         d iscussions          I have        held

wi t h S t e w a r d s     and    the     club since            that    time.

The    situation           improved w ith            the a p p o i n t m e n t     of Mr LOCK as secur i t y

personal        radio s y s t e m         to m a i n t a i n     contact         with their chief            stewards              in

various        areas       of the       ground.

Over     the    period        I was       liaison         officer       I had frequent and various

contact with             club o f f icials                the    secretaries            usually,        when      I pointed

out    problems          with stewards              - this       included         the    clubs      r e s p o n s i b i 1 ities

for    s p ectators         on the       terraces as well                as     in the stands.               I am aware

this    theme was           frequently          repeated          by senior          officers.           I also made

this    comment          to the        c l u b ’s s e c u r i t y officer          on several           occasions.               .1.

explained         by club staff.

In 1984        (000084)             I (and other         officers)           realised that after S h e f f i e l d

gr o u n d filled to             capacity.         The    only       problem was C o v e n t r y fans

arriving          late     because        of traffic        on M l .       The    kick off       time was

delayed.           To     the    best     of my kno w l e d g e         there was no       pitch    invasion.

T h e r e was,       however,          a pitch      invasion         in 1981       (000081)      Semi    Final    Spurs

v Wolves.           This was           caused;

I    by the Spurs               fans    purchasing Wolves                tickets     to the Kop terraces

     then being a l l o w e d             into L e p p i n g s     Lane    terrace and

£     late arrival              of S pu rs     fans who       rushed       onto     terrace      shor t l y after

     kick off            causing       surge

We   took this            into a c c o u n t     this year an d           last    by ensuring       that      fans who

had tickets              for the Ko p who were              not N otts Forest             fans were       not

t r a n s f e r r e d to other          ends of ground             so    capacity w ould be exceeded

they were held on s e g r e g a t e d a r e a of Kop.

It should be noted                  that      in 1980      (000080)        Semi Final. Arsenal            v

terrace was at              that       game o c c u p i e d by Liv e r p o o l       supporters).

On    15 April           1989    (130489),         I. came on duty at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

T was     on the S p i o n Kop at 3pm                    (1500)     wit h the       serials       I had detailed

to sup e r v i s e     the area           containing         the L i v erpool         supporters.         An

apparent        pitch      invasion shor t l y               after    kick      off      created a s i tuation

which     incensed the Notts                   Forest        fans and the actions             of some      of them

t owards      the Liverpool,              group of suppo r t e r s           s u g g e s t e d there w ould       be a

location w ith my                serials         until    the ground         cleared.         I took    no      part   in

t,h e eve n t s on the L e p p i n g s L a n e               ter- race.

My    briefing       to S t e w a r d s was         for      those    on Kop only - also             S e rgeants

T h e y were     told     to keep aisles                 clear as      possible

The    emergency         procedures            were      e x p l a i n e d — all    should     be aware         of own

The    senior      s t e w a r d was       present - he was             told       if he had any        problems          to

speak     to me

The    stewards were              told not         to    leave    until      ground       clear

I knew      the senior           steward.           I had      carried out annual              briefing         several

             On       15 April      1989,      I came       on duty at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y       football

              ground, at 9.30 a.m.                  and a t t e n d e d    briefing.           I was    reponsible         for two

              serials       on the S pion Kop.                 Following          brief i n g and       refreshments            I took

              tooth s e r ia 1s o nt o the S p i o n Kop terraces at about                              11 a.m.       an d b r ief e d

              them.        I also        brie f e d the stewards              a l l o c a t e d to the S p i o n Kop at

             ab o u t    11.30 a.m.            The      t urnstiles        opened at about             this    time.

              It had been a n t i c i p a t e d            that L i verpool            supporters       would enter            the

             S p i o n Kop wit h           tickets a l l o c a t e d       to the Notts Forest                fans.       To

              contain them an are a a d j acent                     to the N orth Stand had been                      set aside

              for     them.       This a s s u m p t i o n     proved, correct and by 3 p.m.                     about 500

             L i v erpool       s u p p o r t e r s were      in the area under                close Police

             su p e r vision.            The m aj o r i t y were          not,    from their accounts,                from

             Merseyside,,             Those        from M er s e y s i d e    n u m bered 200+,         some    said they had

             obtained         tickets        from friends           in Nottingham,              others     said from touts

             both       in Liv e r p o o l     and a r o u n d    the      ground.

             D ri n k    in excess was              evident      in a c o n s i derable           number      of supporters,

             both Liverpool                and Notts Forest.                 This      included those          in a drunken

              c o n d i t i o n and      in p o s s e s s i o n of drink.              The   extent was        such that         I gave

             inst r u c t i o n s     that     only those         in an extreme              state w o u l d be a r r e s t e d       in

             order       not to deplete manpower.

        At about 2 »45            p.m.      it became a p p a r e n t          there was a fault             on the          radio.

        Transmissions             from       control      were      b e c oming   broken,       although         still

       audible.          I informed           control          of this.

        I was        on the S p i o n K o p at 3 p.m.                wit h the        serials     I had d e t a i l e d to

        incensed the Notts F o r e s t                  fans and the acti o n s              of some of them

        location w ith my serials                      until      the    ground       cleared.        I took       no    part       in

        the events           on the L a p p i n g s Lane            terrace.

        connection with               this      I made         various    suggestions          in regards          to the

        ap p arent at          games w i t h       large        crowds    of away       supporters.            This

1987 SEMI          FINAL.      L E E D S UlD.       V. C O V E N T R Y

Leeds       on L e p pings Lane T e r races              — played         on    S u n d a y w ith 1 unchtitne

kick     off.       I was     on duty outside             the gr o u n d        before kick off.             Desp i t e

time     numerous drunks            arrived.          In planning          this m atch we had?              because

of Leeds Utd            reputation,          gone    to great        pains       to:

•1„                prevent     fans a r r i v i n g with o u t           tickets.

2.                 taken steps       to      contain those L eeds               fans who a r r i v e d with o u t

In the event            there were        no    problems        at L e p pings         Lane     that    end of

gr o u n d filled to          capacity.          The     only    problem was C o v e n t r y          fans

arriving         late    because      of traffic           on Ml     - kick       off    time delayed.

To    the    best    of my kno w l e d g e       there was         no     pitch     invasion.

T here      was,    however,      a pitch        invasion         in 1981 Semi           Final.      Spurs    v.

W o 1ves .       Thi s was     caused:

            From        1979 to       late     1987     I was     responsible           for    liaison and          in

             o r g a n i s a t i o n of     (in c o n s u l t a t i o n w ith senior           officers)          police

             fun c t i o n s at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Footb a l l          Club.           Prior    to this         the

             task was          u nd e r t a k e n    on an ad hoc       basis,      usua l l y by a shift                inspector

             or sub divisional                 chief     inspector.          Following             the    pu b l i c a t i o n of the

             Standing          I n s t r uctions       on policing        football        matches          I took     over        the

             duty of          liaison officer.

             Du r i n g    this      period         it became a p p arent         that    despite          stewards       being

             e m p l o y e d by the         club man y were          failing       to do anything                other    than

             a t t e n d at     the     ground and disappear                if    problems arose ••••• many failed                       to

            wear        their       tabbards        and others were          physically             incapable       of    carrying

             out       their    duty.        It was      also a p p a r e n t     that many of the stewards                        had

             no    real       idea what        they should do.              One    of    the       problems       on match days

            was        that    the    club had no overall               management            of    their     stewards.

             In Au g u s t      1981       I. remember      that     I received a m e m o r a n d u m from then

            Chief         Superintendent              Herald    concerning         the    i n e f f e c tiveness         of

            Stewards         and the          club since        that    time.

           The      situation          i m p r o v e d with the a p p o i n t m e n t         of Mr Lock as           security

            officer         ( i n 1985        I. t h i n k ) who    on mat ch days a cted as the                     c l u b ’s ' l i n k ’

           man for          their      s t e wards and the           subse q u e n t a d o p t i o n of a personal

            areas      of the         ground.

            Over      the    period         I was     liaison       officer       1   had frequent            and various

            out     problems          wit h    stewards - this included the                       clubs      respo n s i b i l i t i e s

^          for s p e c t a t o r s      on the       terraces as           well    as    in the          stands.      I am aware

            this      theme was            frequently        repeated         by senior        officers        both to the

            secretaries            and     the      club's    s e c u r i t y officer         on several

            occasions.             I gai n e d the          impr e s s i o n that       the    club b e l ieved           that

            because,         out      of necessity,           the    police       o c c a s io n a l l y    performed

            the f u n c t i o n       of    crowd     packing,       they had no need to show                       interest

            or    r e s p o n s b i 1 ity for        the standing          crowds.

            For     several        years       to    1987    I attended         the annual           meeting        of the

            stewards,         usua l l y       shor t l y before        the     start      of the season..                During    the

            course       of rny p r e s e n t a t i o n      I o u t l i n e d what      the     police       f u n c t i o n and

)          responsibilities                 were,     what     their       duties were          in relation to the

            crowd      (including             on the terraces) and what                    the safety          procedures          were.

            Prior      to    commencing             my briefing - in           (1984 or         1985       I think)       1

            o b t a i n e d a copy         of the      club     i n s t r uctions       to stewards           w h i c h was

this    theme      was f r e q u e n t l y    repeated by senior                    officers.          I     also made

course     of my        presentation          I o u t lined what              the    police      f u n ction and

responsibilities             were,      what      their         duties    were       in relation to the                      crowd

It should        be noted           that      in 1980 Semi Final              Arsenal       vLiverpool          that

capacity was           e x c e e d e d on L e p pings Lane             terraces       by at     least    1000 due

that     game    o cc u p i e d    by Liverpool           supporters).

On    13 April,        1989       (150489)        I came       on duty at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

football        ground at 9 . 3 0 a m            (0930)       and a t t e n d e d briefing.         I was

•11 am    (1100)       and    b r i e f e d them.         1    also    briefed the          stewards a l l o c a t e d

to the S p i o n Kop at about                    1 1.30am      (1130).        The    t u rnstiles      opened at

a bout    this    time.           It had been a n t i c i p a t e d        that Liverpool           supporters

would     enter     the S p i o n Kop with tickets                     allocated        to the Notts.          Forest

fans.      To    contain them an area a d j a c e n t                   to the N o r t h S t a n d had been

set aside        for    them.          This a s s u m p t i o n      proved    correct an d        by 3pm      (1500)

about 500 Liv e r p o o l            s upporters were             in the area under             close Police

supervision.            The m a j o r i t y were          not,       from their accents,            from

Merseyside.            Those       from M e r s e y s i d e     n u m b e r e d 200+,    some    said they had

  At about 2 . 4 5 p m           (-1445)    it became a p p a r e n t       there was a fault            on the

  radio.         Transmissions             from    control       were   becoming        broken,    although

  still    audible.              I i n f ormed     control       of this.        The    radio    fault     can best

  be d e s c r i b e d as a w a r b l i n g / c l i c k i n g - m i s s i n g      out, one w o r d      in three.

  I was     on the S p i o n K o p at Spin (1500)                  w i t h the serials          I had detailed

  to s u p ervise        the a r e a       containing        the Liv e r p o o l    supporters.          An

  apparent        pitch         invas i o n shor t l y after        kick     off    created a sit u a t i o n

  which     incensed            the Notts.        Forest     fans and       the actions         of some of them

  towards        the L i v e r p o o l     group of s u p p o r t e r s     s u g g e s t e d there w ould      be a

  public d i s order             s i t u a t i o n on the Kop.          I therefore        remained at this

  l ocation w i t h my seria ls                until      the g r o u n d   cleared.        I took       no part      in

  the events          on the L e p p i n g s       Lane    terrace.

  My briefing          to s t e w a r d s was       for    those    on Kop only - also Se r g e a n t s

  present and           identified.

  I a sked       if w o r k e d Kop        before         yes.

  T h e y were      told to keep aisles                clear as         possible.

  The    emergency         proce d u r e s were        e x p l a i n e d — all     should be aware            of own

  res pons   i   b i 1 it y .

  The    senior       steward was           present — he was             told    :i.f he had any         problems

  to speak        to me.

  The    stewards were             told not to         leave      until     ground      clear.

  I knew the         senior        steward.         I had carr i e d out annual              briefing         several

  times and knew others                    by sight.

  To the     best      of my k n o w l e d g e      stewards       on Kop did job.

  I cannot        say where          they n o r mally worked.

             On 7 August          1985    (070885)        I a t t e n d e d a meet i n g at H i l l s b o r o u g h

              Football       Ground      of   the O f f icers       Working P a r t y           in relation       to Sa f e t y

              in Sports       Grounds.

              At   this m e e t i n g    various matt e r s were              dis c u s s e d    including       the    new

             secondary          radial    fence Em from the                 existing       radial     fence,      dividing

              the North from the Central                    pens.

             At this       time    it was       ag reed that        the gate at the               perimeter       fence

              (number 5) w o u l d        still      be a v a i l a b l e    for    use for       eme r g e n c y agress       by

             fans.        These w o u l d     be d i r e c t e d   by the        police      officer who        had     control

              of the      gates.

              I explained         that    our    control       of the        gate was        only    exe r c i s e d when      the

             gates were          closed to effect            segregation.              If the       gates    in the       radial

             fences       remained open and f a s t e n e d back,                   then s e g r e g a t i o n was      no

             longer an          issue and a police             presence was            not      required.       This was

             a l r e a d y our    practice       at the existing              gates      in the      radial     fence - no

             o b j e c t i o n was made       by any     person       present.

             At    this    time    there was        no    common key and             the     practice       e m p l o y e d was

             for     gates    in radial         fences w hen        closed,         to be bolted but            not     locked,.

             The     i n t r o d u c t i o n of a common key was              to    f acilitate       ease     of access          for

             supervisory          police      officers and          club o f ficials            to all      parts      of the
                                                                                              PAGE

  ground.    The    gates   in radial        fences     still    remain      closed but not

  locked on m a t c h   days w h e n s e g r e g a t i o n   is an   issue    or small   crowds

  attend.

               16 June       1989.

               I gave evidence             to L ord Just i c e T a y l o r ' s         enqu i r y on S3 June             1989.

               I have      exami n e d 3 items            of   copy    cor r e s p o n d e n c e    from the       s ubmissions

               to the enquiry             by S h e f f i e l d City Council,             as follows:

               1.       Copy       letter 2 . 3 . 8 5 - SYCC          to E a s t w o o d and Partners.

              2.        Letter 8 . 5 . 8 5 -- E a s t w o o d s        to SYCC.

              3.      Copy       letter    10.5.85 - SYCC             to E a s t w o o d and Partners,,

               In      the first          letter    (1) above,          a proposal for new                radial fences,

              mention        is made       of two gates           to be      installed,            and    second gat.es      to be

               ins t a l l e d    in exist i n g        fences.

               In the      letter,        item    (E)     this    suggestion         is resisted on grounds                  of

              expense        of s t e w a r d i n g .

               In the      letter      item      <3) SYCC        say that         "The Police are               prepared    to

              concede        the    request      for      two gates       per     radial      fence".           There   is a note

              handwritten           on this      copy as         follows:         "Agreed over            the    phone with

              Cl Clive Calvert".

              At    this     time a       c o n s i derable      number      of    changes were            being

              cons i d e r e d     by the     club.        The    idea of extra gates                    in the    radial    fences
                                                                                                                          PAG E
                                                                                                                          R53F

         was    only a small             part    of the whole.

         The Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         ’F" D i v i s i o n at the          time was Mr Brian

         Moseley,          who    died    in 1986.          He was     very       inter e s t e d    in ground

         improvements,             and    I w o u l d say that         it was        very m uch his          personal

         d e c i s i o n as      to what      took     place.        The extra        radial        fence   gates were

         his    idea.         He t o o k ' c o n t r o l   at the gr o u n d on all major matches,                        and

         w o r k e d from the          control       room o v e r l o o k i n g    the L e p pings Lane

         terraces.            He was      t h e refore       familiar     w ith the         problems        that arose

         the r e .

         I was       the    liaison officer,                but on most matt e r s             I w ould     consult Mr

         Moseley,          and on a q u e s t i o n         like this     the      police w o u l d       present a

         single       policy,        over w h i c h Mr M o s e l e y was           the     controlling        influence.

         To my       recollection,            I was        contacted     by Mr V a u g h a n        of SYCC about          the

         club's       o b j e c t i o n to the       radial     fence     gates,         and     I consulted Mr

         Moseley,          before      replying        to him that        the      police were w i l l i n g         to

         concede       this       point.        There were        other     requests w h i c h were            thought          to

         have    greater          priority.

         The    reason for           originally            requesting     gates       to    be   installed        lower down

         the    terrace,          adjacent       to the       perimeter       fence,       was      two fold.        First        to

         allow       better access            by the        police    to the       front       of the     terraces        to

^        sort    out       crowd trouble?            second,      to a l l o w     easier movement           of

         s p ectator        between       pens.        In my opin i o n the           first      of these      two

         reasons was most                important         to the     police at          that    time.

        copinq well               but       I thought at                   this        time     it should have             been       easing       off,

        Dear Sir,

        Amendment to Safety Certificat

        I refer to my letter of 18tj/August and to the enclosed Notice of
        Amendment to your Club's General Safety Certificate.

        I notice in fact that tjfe total crowd capacity as listed in Appendix 1 of
        the amendment of the Notice of Amendment should in fact read 43,542 and
        not 43,724 as shown in the document. I therefore enclose a revised
        Appendix 1 with the/correct figure inserted.
i...    Yours faithfully




       ^Act^ng Head of Department.

Which was really to o v e r s e e the crime side, the detective
side of this which, I think, b a sically or largely in the
crowds was p i c k - p o c k e t s , is that correct? A.      Pick-pockets
and we w ere e x p e c t i n g     motor vehicle crime as well.

And m otor vehicle crimes - that is people breaking into ---
A.    B r e a k i n g into cars and stealing, yes, sir.

In 1988 I think you were in the Leppings Lane turnstile
area at about twenty to three, twenty minutes before kick-
off?    A.        Yes, perhaps a little earlier than that and
if I may add, it was in fact Grand National Day and the
Grand N a t i o n a l was held on that afternoon.

My r e c o l l e c t i o n is that that is about 3.20,    is it not?
A.     I don't know the            exact time, sir.

It is c e r t a i n l y quite plain that     you could      not do both.
A.   That's right, sir.

Were you aware of a b u i ld-up of numbers last year towards
the latter stages st the tu r n s t i l e s ?          A.    Yes, that's
right.          Let me make it plain that I do not attend football
matc h e s normally.             This year's match was the first match
that I have a t t ended since last year's match, and I am no
expert on public order.                    Last year I stood by the wrought-
iron gates which perh a p s could be called the perimeter
fence, near the bridge there, on the footpath in, in fact,
L e p p i n g s Lane and I stood there throughout until about
ten past three when most of the supporters were in.                      There
was a huge build - u p around ten minutes to three when many,
many L i v e r p o o l s u p p o r t e r s came at that time.    They had
been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a
s i z e a b l e c r u s h built up - sizeable queue.

Queue or crush?          A.   C o m p a c t e d queue, built up in the
area by the turns t i l e s which I believe are marked A-G.
That c rowd reached back almost to the gates.                 It never cot
any bi g g e r than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
freely and they dealt with that crowd.                  Fans were still
a r r i v i n g at about ten past three but by then the

This c r o w d that you have des c r i b e d of the late arrivals
at about ten to - was it an orderly crowd?              A.  Oh no.
No.        The o r d e r l y crowd had gone in, and when I say they
were not an orderly crowd, obviously mixed amongst those
p e o p l e wer e ---

Of course, but taking it generally.                 A.  But by and large
they ha d taken a lot of drink on board and they were in
such n u m b e r s that e x c l u d i n g them from the ground was
c o m p l e t e l y out of the question.

Were they s t a n d i n g in an orderly queue or was there some
p u s h i n g and s h o v i n g ? A. There was a lot of pushing and
shoving.         There was an urgency to get into the ground.

Q. But fortunately it does not appear to have been in nearly
   such numbers as this year.   A.   It wasn't. ,

Q        Let us come to this year.    I think you, in fact, yourself
         took Dart on the Friday in a phone-in programme in which
         the message was sent across the air, "Don't come, it is all­
         ticket" - that is don't come unless you have got a ticket.
         A.    That was part of the message.    I took part in a
         radio phone-in programme with Radio Merseyside when I
         spoke regarding aspects of crime and pick-pockets, and
         that was one of the things I spoke about, asking people
          if they didn't have tickets not to come.

Q        I am not going to ask you about your patrols before we
         net to the Leppings Lane end where I think you arrived
         again some time at about twenty to three;  is that correct.
         A.   I would think perhaps earlier than that.

         A little earlier.   A.   I left the gymnasium about quarter
Q.
         nast two, made my way across the back of the gosl where the
         Spion Kop is and then up the service road.   Perhaps in the
         region of 25 past 2, half past two.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: At Leppings Lane?      A.   At
    Q.
          Leppings Lane, sir, yes.

               MR  COLLINS:   When yougot there at   about this time,
    Q.
          what Z s  the state of affairs as you saw it? A.     There
          was much more congestion at that time than had ever been
          the case at its worst the year before.    I couldn t under­
          stand the reason for it.   Last year's policing arrangements
          had been such a success that it made sense to use exactly
          the same policing arrangements and I couldn't understand
          why there was this huge press of people in the area.     I
          stood for most of the time in the vicinity of Gate C,
          mainly because that was a relatively safe area.    On one
          occasion I did venture into the crowd looking for one of
          the pick-pocket teams but frightened myself a little bit
          and came back out.

    Q          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you say looking for one
          of your pick-pocket teams - you had a pick-pocket team
          of Officers in amongst the crowd there?   A.   There was
          at least one, yes.

    Q. In plain clothes?       A.    In plain clothes,   yes.

     Q. How many Officers did that inv olve?  A.   Well, there
        were eiqht Officers plus Inspector Towell involved m
        Dick-pocket activities.   We had arranged that they were
        SDlit into two teams and, because we had been so unsuccessful
        in preventing pick-pockets last year, we decided that we
        would put someone on offer and that, in fact

     Q     Someone what?   A.   We would put someone there who would
           loiter about and have a wallet waiting to be picked and

he would be watched.

                MR. COLLINS:   A stooge.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I see, on offer you said.

     THE WITNESS:   And that was the situation.                In the
event I never made contact with that team.

                rnLLINS:

                                              G.   McKAY


- A. When I first arrived my attention was drawn mainly to the
people who were waiting to get into turnstiles A-G, and I can
only really comment on that section and the area of the crowd
and the crowd up to the gates, because everything beyond that
was beyond my sight.  It was really packed tight in there to
the extent where the turnstiles did not seem to be operating
properly.  The turnstiles are geared to accept one person at
a time, and when people are pressed up at the turnstiles in
such numbers it appeared that the people wishing to use the
turnstiles did not have freedom to get in properly.

But how would you describe the attitude of the crowd itself,
of the people waiting? - A. The people who were in that area
were wanting to get in quite urgently.  It was obviously quite
uncomfortable in there.  They had got tickets, they were
entitled to get in and one can understand their frustration at
not being able to get freely through the turnstiles.   As the
minutes went by the crowd swelled considerably in numbers.
The Officers on horseback were having difficulty controlling
the crowds.  There was one Officer who I believe was a
Merseyside Officer, at one stage a can of drink with drink
spilling from it was thrown at him.  There appeared to be
a deliberate attempt by some members of the crowd to
unseat that rider.  That was my perception of it, and the
horse started prancing about in fright.  They were
engulfed in the crowd. As a result you could not see
people and Police Officers properly.

     At some stage, perhaps around 20-to-3, I saw
Superintendent Marshall, and I heard part of a conversation
between him and a man I know as Inspector Purdy, when
Inspector Purdy suggested that the gates ought to be opened.
I did not hear Mr. Marshall’s response to it.  I d o n ’t think
at that stage he was prepared to take that option.    Mr.
Marshall went into the crowd and was lost to my sight.     I did
not see Mr. Marshall again, but I was later to learn that he
was in fact only yards from me all the time.  When a person
went into the crowd on foot he was engulfed and soon lost to
sight.

Did the mood of the crowd change at all as the minutes wore on
towards kick-off? - A. Yes, it did.   Quite obviously they
wanted to get in.   I would have thought most of the crowd
would have been prepared to wait patiently and take their turn
in the turnstiles, but there were other members of the crowd
who wanted to get in more urgently.   There were some members
of" the crowd who wanted to get in quite desperately, and there
were other members of the crowd who were going to get into
that ground come what may.   Terrific pressure built up from
the Leppings Lane area.   Those wrought iron perimeter gates
were closed at one stage in an attempt to relieve this
pressure, this continual pressure on the crowd in this little
penned in area behind the barrier leading towards the
turnstiles.   It did not appear to work, and it seemed only a
couple of minutes or so before those gates were burst open,
before even the turnstiles had time to produce some space for
the people this side of them.

    A
                At one stage a young boy climbed out of the crowd on top
           of the w a l l , presumably with a view to going straight over the
           top.  He was about 12 years old, and I was dismayed at that
           stage to realise there were such small kids in that crowd.      It
           was apparent that the pressure, the crush in there was quite
           severe, and at some stage, not long after Mr. Purdy had spoken
    B      to Mr. Marshall I spoke to Mr. Purdy and said that I agree
           with him that the gates really ought to be opened.

        Q. Indeed, shortly after that they were opened.      I say shortly
           after thai.      We know when they were opened. - A. There were
           other events.      Other Officers arrived on horseback up the
           service r o a d .

        Q. I d o n ’t think I need ask you to give details of those because;
           the picture has been painted by others and I am only concerned
           with your overall impression of the situation.     Can I now come
           on to after the disaster occurred.     I think you went into the
           ground, did you not, after the match had begun? - A. I did.      ]
           made my way again....

        Q. You went round to the gymnasium? - A. The back of the goal.
    D      As I cross the back of the goal at the Leppings Lane end I
           could see what appeared from that distance to be crowd
           spilling on to the track.  There were Police Officers making
           their way underground in front of the West Stand ;up to that
           area.

        Q. I am sorry "passed the goal’’. Did you go past the Leppings
           Lane goal or the other end? - A. No, the Spion Kop.   I did noi
    E      give it a great deal of thought.

        Q. The only bit I want to ask you about is this.  I think you
%          spoke to your Chief Superintendent Addis at about quarter-
           past-3 when it was realised there were likely to be deaths? -
           A. Yes.
                                                                             I
        Q. Because you had to think in terms of setting up an incident
    F      room and a casualty bureau? - A. Yes.

        Q. I am not going to ask you details of time scales because I
           imagine that is not easy now, but in fact were you responsibl
           for setting up the gymnasium as it were a temporary mortuary?
           - A. In the initial stages?

        Q. In the initial stages, yes. - A. I arrived back in the
    G      gymnasium as Chief Inspector Beal arrived back.  I had spoken
           to a Detective Sergeant earlier who had come from the back of
           Leppings Lane corner, and he said there were about 20 dead in
           the crowd.  I had been desperately hoping he was wrong.

        Q. Forgive me, I d o n ’t think we need the reasons why. It is jus
           the factual matters as to setting up the mortuary, if you
           would? - A- My arrival there coincided with that of Chief
    H      Inspector Beal, and he shouted, "Clear the tables out of the
           way.  We are going to make this into a temporary mortuary".

A
         you had not been able to verify or what? - a . That is right.
         I would not want, for instance, to say there are so many
         numbers of bodies or what have you, and for this to become
         immediately available to the press and for it to turn out to
         be misinformation or whatever.  If I am going to speak senior
         Officers I want it to be in confidence until such times as we
         decide exactly what we are going to tell the press.
B
    Q.        MR. COLLINS:     Would this be fair then from what you have
         told u s , that any people who were in that gymnasium in the
         first half-hour or so after it was set up might well feel
         there was a semblance of chaos“and might well have been
         distressed over and above their natural distress at perhaps
         of losing a friend? - A. Oh, yes.

    Q. As a result of the situation.    It does not sound as if the
       situation was by any means ideal? - A. No.     In fact, it turnec
       out to be in terms of efficiency I d o n ’t think we could have
       improved upon it.   But I don't know of any other way it could
       have been done or accomplished.    It was a scene that could not
       be planned for.   I have been a Police Officer now in this
       country and in Australia for nearly 30 years, and in common
       with Police Officers with this length of service I have seen
D      my share of bizarre death and violent death.      In fact, that is
       mainly, I   suppose, what I do for a living.    Nothing Ihave
       ever seen   in my service prepared me for that.

              I heard earlier today, this gentleman was talking about
         shock.  I   know how that scene affected me in spite o f ...

    Q. If I may say so, it has   been obvious from the you have been
       giving your evidence a few moments ago. - A. I heard Mr.
       Greenwood say that he did not think that any of the Police
       Officers were in shock.   I would have been very surprised if
       they had not been.   I saw one particular Officer sitting in
       the Police room when I went in there to use the 'phone. He
       was dishevelled.   He was obviously very hot.  He must have
       been working very hard.   He had got a huge tear in his
       trousers and he was sat there weeping.   Yes, I would be
       surprised if Police Officers had not been stunned by the
       enormity of what had happened.   It was a colossal afront to
       your sensibility.

    Q. I think in fairness to you as well you had an added thing on
       your mind which was that your young son was somewhere among
       the crowd at the ground.   Is that right? You had obvious
       concern.  I am glad to say he was not caught up in it, was he'
       - A. He was OK.  In fact, he took two distressed Liverpool
       fans to my home and they stayed with us overnight.

    Q. I think it was about the time Mr. Dalglish made his
       announcement that you handed over to Chief Superintendent
       Addis? - A. That is true, sir.

    Q. We can time that.  We know that announcement was made at 3.56.
H      So it was just over half-an-hour, 40 minutes or so, after you
       had first started to set up the mortuary? - A. Yes, sir.
                                                           G.    McKAY



I think later on things calmed down, in the sense that you
were able, between you, to achieve a much greater order in
the gymnasium.  Bodies were properly certified and laid
out and proper identification was able to be achieved*? -
A.  Yes.

     ME. C O L L I N S • I think that is all I need ask you in
relation to your evidence about this matter.        Thank you
very much.

     ME.     HYTNEE:     J   have only two questions of this
Officer.       -

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I just see - again not any
pressure at all ~ but is there more than a question or two
for this witness?  If there is, we will deal with it
tomorrow.

       ME.   WOODWAED:       There may be more than a question or
two.

     LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:    Yes, I think probably ue had
better - are you in difficulties tomorrow?

       ME.   HYTNEE:     Oh, no.

     LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:   Well then,         I think ue will
have cross-examination tomorrow.

      Tomorrow morning, as I said yesterday, there is
available the facility of looking at the Control Box at
the ground.   I do not know whether Counsel will avail
th emselves of that, but if they are, then I think it is
available from half-past eight onwards.   I would propose
that we sit tomorrow - or, put it this way, the Inquiry
will be ready to sit at 10 o ’clock.  If the traffic causes
those who have been there to be a minute or two later
after that, obviously ue will make allowances, but ue uill
aim to sit as soon after 10 as we can.

         So far as any other timings tomorrow are concerned, I
am going to see what the effect of the Milk Cup tomorrow
is likely to be and I do not at the moment know precisely
what we are going to do about the latter part of
t o m o r r o w ’s sitting, but I will decide that in a feu
minutes.

       ME. HYTNEE:     I wonder if I might make a plea for
those who need to get away from Sheffield by car and, if
there are going to be any road blocks, we are given an
op po rtu nit y to get away.

     LOED JUSTICE TAYLOE:    You do not wish to be a
prisoner on the wrong side of the Pennines!

                             ME. HYTNEE:   For once, it is not the other side of
                        the Pennines I am going to, sir.

                             LOED JU STICE TAYLOE:   Well, it is a factor
                        obviously we will take into account.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   ?ir. Hytner, the arrangements for
    today as everybody will have noticed, the Milk Race is
    beinc?'prepared for outside.    I understand that by sone tine
    af+’^r 1 o'clock we isight have a great deal of noise. Vvhat
    I propose is that we sit until the noise becomes intolerable
    cr half-past-i, whichever is the soonest, and after that we
    will xise for today.
          :.»?>        And if you sir see Counsel or Solicitors
    disappearingfroa 12.30 onwards, it is because they hr.ve coac
    by car; their cars are trapped at 1 o'clock and we are
    leavinc in order to avoid tne trap.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: lie 11 I would not imagine that
    thev v/erc going out to compete.  (Laughter)

           MR. rlYTHZR*.    I-iot at some of our ages anyway.

            5-*r, can I just say this: I indicated yestercay I
    ■iust had one question for Hr. McKay.   I have since ascertained
    iro'ii kr. Collins that he does not propose to call, unless
    absolutely necessary, any further witnesses in relation to ^
    what happened in the mortuary and 1 have therefore incicatec.
    to Hr. Collins, and I think Mr. McKay is aware or
    I therefore propose to pat just a few questions co nr. :.C;\c.y
         relation to those lfiatters.

           LORD JUSTICE T A Y L O R :     Yes, certainly.

G    Hr. KcKav, can I just ask you one question about events
     outside the ground.  Your suggestion or your theory taat
     some of the crowd were trying to unseat a noun ted O. n c e r .
     Do"you recall that? - A. Yes, that is true.

o    Fhat you saw of course was equally consistent with tne crowd
     round the horse being crushed fron the rear and being crusiied
     into the horse? - A. No, that is not what I saw at all.^
     That sort of situation existed throughout.  That sort c:
     situation was inevitable under those circumstances and
     in fact I recall at least two people who complained oz
     having been trodden on by the horse.

O    I am sorrv? - A. Trodden on by horses.  The Mounted Crricers
     were completelv engulfed in the crowd.  I am talking about
     what I perceive to be a deliberate attempt to grab hold of
     the rider and take him from the horse and the horse dancing

sure that their belongings were not mixed up and a host of
other problems. The scene in the gymnasium when bc'dies
started arriving, Police Officers shocked, white, sweating,
carrving bodies in, carrying people in on beards, on stretchers,
and arriving in such numbers.   I spoke to. the Officers who
brought the first body in.   I knew that one of the Officers
had to stay with that body for questions of identification
and hopefully to prove where that body had come from.     I
was .not to know at that time that that body may have been
moved several times before that Officer brought it in, but
in any event my initial reaction to it v/as to make sure that
there was a Police Officer with every body.    I was in civilian
clothes and as a body was brought in I grabbed a Policc Officer
and said:   "I am Detective Superintendent i-lcKav. This body
is yours.   You are responsible throughout for that becy. Do
not leave it.   Do not allow anyone else to interfere with
that body or his possessions.   Do you understand?" By the
time I had said that other bodies were being placed down
and if you weren't smart enough they were going.     Tuey v;ere
very difficult to describe and I find that in describing it
  I sometimes become distressed and forgive me if I do.




                    /Q. Mr. McKay, please I
                                       G.   McKAY


Mr. McKay, please, I do not want you, if it is not
necessary, to go into that sort of detail;  do you"
follow?   A.   Yes.

Can I just ask you this, from what you have said.   Was
it very warm inside the gymansium?   A. * Yes, it was.
I remember I had my raincoat on and it was several minutes
before I realised I would be better off without it and
I threw it to one -sidie.

Is there, from your own experience as a Police Officer,
every possibility that bodies which were, in fact, dead
would have their temperatures artificially raised because
of the heat in the gymnasium?    A.   I would have thought
that _____   Idon't know about the temperatures raised,
I would certainly ---

Maintained, I am sorry.     Maintained. A.   I would have
expected that the temperatures would have been maintained
for l o n g e r , y e s . .

That is right.    So can you give some reassurance to those
bereaved who felt that the bodies were warm that that
warmth was not due to recent death but due to the temperature
in the gymnasium?    A.   Yes.  The priority was to make
sure that people who were being classified as dead were,
in fact, dead

That I am coming to.   From your experiences that day,
seeing the doctors going around and seeing how things were
managed, can you give reasonable reassurance to the bereaved
that nobody was classified dead until they had been actually
medically certified as dead.    A.   Absolutely.   In fact,
it was rather the other way, that there were groups of
people trying to resuscitate what to me were obviously dead
bodies, but I certainly did not stop them.

There are only two other matters.   The first arises out
of your observation that some of the spectators and ethers
in the mortuary and later the relatives were both angry
and I think- one fight developed or fights developed.
A.   I saw several scuffles and blows being struck.

Can I ask you this.    Is it right that at some stage
photographs were being taken of the bodies?    A.   I don't
remember photographs being taken but it might well have
been-true.   At some stage members of our Underwater Search
Unit came to me.    They are used on such occasions with
hand-held videos.    They came to me and complained   that
they had been instructed to video the scene outside and
had been assaulted on two occasions, and I recognised
that there would be a need for evidence gathering even
in the gymnasium and asked them to start filming events
in the gymnasium.    There were other civilian photographers
there - Police photographers but civilians - who might
well have been mistaken for members of the press.

                                              C.   McKAY



0        That is what I was asking you.   A.   To the best of my
        knowledge there were no members of the press in the
        gymnasium but I cannot be absolutely certain in those
        initial stages.

n       ran I ask you this so that this is absolutely clear to
        the bereaved.   In order to spare the distress of the
        bereaved in having to.view 90 bodies before they identified
         their own ---      A.   Yes.

0         Was it the practice to photograph the bodies and then have
        -the b e r e a v e d look at the photographs and then they might
         only have to identify one body, that is their own relative.
         A.   Yes.
Q. So that photographs had to be taken for that reason.
         A.    Yes.
    D    Then there was the evidence gathering ordered by the
         Police       Did you know that there had been intense anger
         on t h e "pitch itself when fans had turned on the press
         photographers who had been photographing the deceased.
         A      I didn't know that they had turned on press photographers.
         I *did know that they had turned on Police photographers,
         believing them to be press photographers.      It might well
         have been that they turned on press photographers, too.

    D    So that this matter can be clarified and perhaps anger
    -    riis«?ioated, it is very possible that some anger was
    '                 and some temper was generated in the mortuary
          because of people's reasonable belief that press pno ographers
          were photographing the carnage.       A.   Yes, I think thot
          is fair comment.     When I spoke of the skirmishes in the
          qymnasium, let me say that my perception of it was that
          they were all related to g r i e f rather than drink, quite
          understandably.

    Q A number of relatives felt that they were dealt with -in
    * a n   insensitive fashion by Police Officers in the gymnasium
        and its surroundings.        From your experience of tne state
        nf the Police Officers in the mortuary and the surrounding
         rooms, would you put that down to, as it w e r e , disregard
         of feelings or to something else?        A.   I would put it
         down to something else.       I was fortunate in that I never
         sooke to any of the relations.        There were in the hall
         at the time many grieving relatives and friends;       there
         w e r e -some drunks, and once the Controller had been establishes
          nn the door the people who were outside were not allowed
          inside but it would have been folly at that stage to try
          and separate the grieving relatives and friends from the
          bodies inside the gymnasium.       But I recognised also that
          at some stage that was going to have to be done.        As I
          said     you could not deal with the bodies on an ad hoc basis.
          It was vital that no mistake should be made in identification
          no mistake should be made in relation to property that
          belonged to the bodies and it was vital that a very exact
                                        G.   McKAY



and strict procedure was adhered to -in relation to those
bodies.   It was equally vital that friends and relatives
should not be present when they saw their loved ones being
searched and cleaned up and photographed- and for that reason
at some stage friends and relatives had to be separated
from the bodies.    I was not there when that was done but
I can imagine that that must have been a very difficult
time, for everyone"concerned

Would that be the reason - again this is really the lest
matter that people have commented on - was that the reason
why those who had already identified bodies and were
stunned with grief were mixing with those who had not
yet ide ntified bodies and were still hoping for their
loved ones to be alive?    A.   I didn't know that that
situation existed.    I can quite understand ---   I can
quite understand it if it did,yes.

In a perfect world it would be better for that not to
happen;  would you agree?    A.  In a perfect world, none
of this would have happened.

I think that is probably right.   I think the bereaved
will be very grateful to you, Mr. McKsy, for the very frank
way in which you have given your evidence.   A.  Thank you.

               Cross-examined by MR. JACKSON:

Mr. McKay, I shall be asking you no questions at all
about the events afterwards.   May I turn to the events
at the outset.   Have you been present during any psrt
of the Inquiry?   A.   No.   I was fortunate - the day
the Inquiry commenced I commenced annual leave.   I csme
back yesterday morning and was asked to report here.

 Perhaps it will be necessary for me just to mention that
 we have had very little evidence of any difference between
 1988 and 1989.    You, yesterday afternoon, very modestly
 said you were not an expert on crowd control but I understand
 from your statement and your evidence that you can explain
 one very important difference between the two years, and
 that is this.    Am I correct that when you first arrived
 at the turnstiles in 1989 it was immediately apparent
 that the flow through the turnstiles was less efficient
 than the year before?     Can I remind you of your statement?
 A.    Yes, I understand the question and let me think that
 through.    At that time, comparing that time with that
 time the year before, yes, that is quite true.     The
 efficiency of the turnstiles in 1988 became reduced for
 a small period.    That period commenced about ten minutes
 to three when these drunks - and when I say drunks, I am
  talking not of drunk and incapable people but of people
 who have taken drink to such an extent that their standards
  of behaviour deteriorate and they become selfish.     At
  that stage large numbers of those sort of people started

Q       I do not want to st op you, Hr. HcKay, but what I am
        s eek ing is this:       that at about 20-past two, when the
        crowd was exa ctly as you had expected, with the odd person
        who    had been drinking, the odd incident - nothing unusual
        at all - at that stage it was apparent-they were not
        copi ng e ff ic ie n tl y with the crowd and the crowd was
        growing? - A.         Ho, you are putting'words intp my mouth.
        Let me d e s c r i b e the .scene to you at 20—past two. At
        20 -pa st two it was completely different to at any time
        durin g the pr evious year.

Q       Hr      HcKay, may I just remind you of the comments in your
        s t a te me nt ?   Page 5, sir.   You used this sentence to
        d e s c r i b e the crowd and the scene as you arrived at the
        Lepp ing s Lane end some time after quarter-past two.       You
        say:
               "It was apparent          the turnstiles were not coping
               e f fi ci en tl y with    the crowd, which was suelling by the
               m i n u t e .“

        Then you go on to say:

               "Throughout the next 30 minutes or so I remained"?

         A. Yes.

    Q    The point I am t r y i n g to establish is this:       that, for
         rea sons that ue may discover later, at a time uhen no one
         co u ld be ac cu se d of arriving too late, the croud uas
         gr ow in g bec aus e the turnstiles uere working inefficiently?
         - A. The c r o w d was growing because the turnstiles uere not
         cop in g with the numbers of people efficiently.           It uas my
         pe r c e p t i o n - and it may well be that my perception is
         wrong - it was my perception that the turnstiles uere not
         wo rk in g ef fi ci e n t l y because of the pressure upon them.    I
         said y e s t e r d a y t h a t . ...

    0            L O B D J U S T I C E TAYLOB:    It was a vicious circle? - A.
         A vircious circle, yes.              I do not know why.  It might uell
         be that there are other reasons for the turnstiles not
         w or kin g e f f i c i e n t l y and, in my capacity as investigating
         Officer, albeit in a caretaking capacity, in the week
         fo l l o w i n g this, it came to my notice that there might uell
         have       b e e n other reasons, but my perception at that time
         uas that the turnsti les were not working because of the
         p r es s u r e upon them and because there uas not room to
         ma no eu vr e into the turnstile itself.

    q               HE. J A C K S O N : Hr. HcKay, we are going to hear from
          O f f i c e r s who were stopping and searching and we may have
          to c o n s i d e r the flows through for that reason, but that is
          at a later stage.     The final matter I want to ask then is
          this:  w h e n you saw Gate C eventually opened, it uas at a
                                                                                        G.   HcKAY




            time, was it not, when there was no pressure at all being
            put upon it by the fans? - A. Yes.

«           twj             +Viprefore feel some surprise when you heard
"   •       ?   a   t  that the gate had been forced?
                        e   r                             A, Yes  until -


            y es t e r d a y I was not convinced that that gate had teen
            forced.

                there.  Can I say that I uas not at the gate continually.

        Q                            HE.    JACKSON*-   I remind you of your statement, Hr.
                    HcKay.                 It says:
                                     "I should say at this point that these gates had
                                     never been under severe pressure as the croud had
                                     r e c o g n i s e d that there uas no probability of entering
                                     th rough that g a t e . "

                    T+ ra + her     as it uere, ends the suspicion that people uere
                    d e U b w U i l y at Gate C, knowing, hoping and intending that
                    it be op en e d because of their pressure? - A. Can I qualify
                        that?
            D           C e r t a i n l y 0 - A. Hy perception uas that I spent most of my
                        +         a + Gate C      There uere tuo or three occasions uhen I
                        VeA       Gate C and ualked doun the service road to the

                        but cer t ai nl y most of my time uas spent in that area,
                        exactly because it uas not under pressure.            I had no
                        desire           in civilian clothes, to be mixed in uith that
                        throng!           When the gate uas finally opened, there uas no
                                                                  G. McKAY



     rush down there initially.  There «as just a trickle
 of people for the first 30 or 40 seconds.  That trickle of
 people increased as people realised that there was going
 to be entry from that gate and people uere brought under
 the barrier from where the pressure uas greatest on the
 turnstiles and fed through that gate.

    When you say "brought", by the Police? - A. Yes,
    encouraged to cone that uay, to relieve that pressure.

    Can I assist by asking you to confirm the impression you
    want to create is that there was never any perception - -
    nerhaps it is an unfortunate phrase at this Tribunal - you
    never had the feeling that there was a deliberate attempt
    ?o force that gate? - A. Can I take the impression I want
    to create?    I do not like that.   I am here to tell the
    truth    good or bad.  Host of the time at that gate, I did
    not see that gate under any severe pressure.     I saw it
     opened several times to allow injured people in. ™ e r e
     was a child carried in there.    There was one of these
     who had been trodden on by a horse.    There was someone
     else who looked to be on the point of collapse.     That
     would not have been possible if that gate had been
     the sort of pressure as Gate 2 had been continually under,
     but there were a lot of people standing round and I
     wondered at the time whether they were frightened to j o m
     that severe crush - and that would be understandable
     whether they were waiting for people, or whether, in fact,
      they were opportunists, but the gate itself uas not under
      pressure, in my sight.

     right-hand side, under the Kop Stand, did you.       A.   do
     not know.  It does not ring a bell, I am sorry.      It might
     well have been. -I am not saying it was not.

O    I understand, Hr. HcKay.  At some stage you introduced
     Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Hobkins to Hr. Addis.
     That is right.
O    I think that was sometime about four o ’clock. Would that
     be about right? - A. i would have thought so, yes.

 Q. And, prior to that, you had contacted Hr. Addis yourself
                                                    G.   McKAY




at about 3.15? - A. Yes.

That uas from the Police room underneath the North Stand?
- A. Yes.

Did Mr. Addis say anything to you during that telephone
call, that he uas looking for an Ambulance Officer or
senior Ambulance Officer? - A. No, ue had not reached that
stage.  We did not knou what had happened.  The
information that I had got uas from a Detective Sergeant
uho uas returning from the   area of the fence.

That is Mr. Linley? - A. Sergeant Linley, and he called
out to me - I uas going over to the fence - he called out
to me, "There is about 20 dead in there."   I uas very
reluctant to believe that.   I had hoped it uas an
exaggeration and certainly   uhen I spoke to Mr. Addis I did
not tell him that there uere 20 dead.   I said that there
uere casualties and there might uell be deaths.    I do not
remember the question of ambulances being discussed
betueen myself and Mr. Addis and certainly I uould have
expected that side of the operation to be undertaken by
uniformed Officers directly.   Our problem uas not, as I
say, unfortunately, concerned uith the living.    Our
problem uas concerned uith the dead.




                               Q. I understand.

Q. I understand, Mr. McKay.  When you spoke to Mr. Addis he was
   then in the Police control box, was he? - A. Oh, no, Mr. Addis
   was at Police Headquarters in town.

Q. In town? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. To assist with the-anxieties that relatives may have, Mr.
   McKay, can you help me with this, too.    In addition to there
   being a medical team*in the gymnasium who were making sure
   those who were classified as dead were dead, prior to them
   being brought into the gymnasium I think all the casualties
   were assessed outside in the assembly area where the vehicles
   were parked and the ambulances were then taking casualties to
   the hospital.    Can you assist on that? - A. I am afraid I
   c a n ’t. Initially people were also being brought into the
   gymnasium and were being directed to the far end of the
   gymnasium.

Q. Thank you, Mr. McKay.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. McKay, in relation to the events afterwards, if I may deal
   with that shortly.  Is your evidence this, that when
   matters were arranged in the gymnasium then, in effect the
   presumption was that people were alive and the endeavour
   was strenuously to ensure that was the case? - A. I am not
   sure I understand that.

Q. Mr. Hytner asked you about a priority.      You follow? - a . Yes.

Q. And you spoke of individuals who were notwithstanding your
   observation of the plight of the victim that their efforts anc
   endeavours were to achieve life or not to give up? - A. Yes.

Q. And is that the picture one should have, that it was not a
   picture of giving up on the individuals that had been brought
   in but the endeavour was despite all odds to strive for life?
   - A. Yes.  I am not sure whether this is the place to relate
   this story, but it perhaps demonstrates somewhat.   There was ;
   Police Officer who brought in.a 12 year old boy, made
   strenuous efforts to revive that child, wouldn’t
   leave the child, kept going back to him, hour after
   hour, trying to revive that child, and finally had to
   be taken away from that child.  That perhaps
   illustrates the concern that was felt in relation to
   all of those victims.

 Q.    Is that typical of the endeavours and attitudes? - A. That is
      perhaps not typical, but it certainly demonstrates the
      atmosphere that was in there, yes.    No-one gave up on anyone.

 G.    I think you said in relation to deceased, you ensured that an
      Officer had the responsibility for and was with the body? - A
      Yes.

 Q. May I ask you now., and turn the clock back a little, please,

         to 1988.  You have told the Inquiry I think you are not an
         expert in crowd control? - A. True. -

Q. So you can only talk of your experience and what you observed?
   - A. Yes.
Q.        But in 1988 the Police operation that you observed at Leppings
         Lane, did it appear to you to be well organised? - A. Yes.          It
         was a good event.  It was a very successful operation.          There
         was just one incident of wounding.      There were comparatively
         few arrests   The crowd were well behaved, and it was in a way
         a rehearsal for this y e a r ’s Semi-Final.  This y e a r ’s Semi-
         Final should have been so much better.

q        Did there appear to you in 1988 to be any deficiencies in
         the planning or the execution of the Police work at the
         Leppings Lane end? - A. None.  If there had been obviously
         that would have been taken care of this time.  No-one likes
         trouble.  No-one likes disorder.

Q        Would it be right in the period following 1988 in the year
         that then went you had the opportunity and people had the
         opportunity to speak to you and to discuss the policing and
         what had happened at the Semi-Final? - A. Yes.  I d o n ’t want
         to be accused of being facetious, but perhaps it is pertinent
         that prior to this dreadful tragedy no-one, fans, press and i:
         I may say so, lawyers, no-one cam to us and said, "You have
         got this wrong.  This is how it should be next time” , but of
         course there have been plenty of such remarks since.

 O        You were, I think, involved, and this was only touched upon i
          vour evidence yesterday, in the advanced preparation and the
          giving of advice to people who might be intending to comev -
          A. That is true.
    Q     You were involved, were you in communications with the radio?
          - A. I took part in a radio ’phone-in programme aboutnoon or.
          the Friday with Radio Merseyside.  The main thrust of that
          conversation with the presenter of the programme was in
          relation to pickpockets and vehicle thefts, but
          certainly I emphasised that people who had not got
          tickets should not come.

    Q. Was that not the only theme but a fairly constant theme of tl
       communications? - A. Yes.

    0.     And advance     advice    that was being given tothose whomight b
          thinking of coming to the game? - A. Yes.

    Q.     Not to come unless they had tickets. To stay      away,   in other
          words? - A. Yes.

     q   . I think the same was done for Notts Forest? - A. Oh, yes, I
           spoke to Nottingham Radio.

     Q     May I come now to what you saw at the Leppings Lane end.   Of
           course, you did -not spend all your time at that point? - A.
                                      lfi


                                                              G.   McKAY



         NO.
O        YOU   had to concern yourself with the Forest end as well? - A.
         m     that is not quite accurate.    I had intended spending all
         of *n y time at thlt point with a pickpocket squad. Me were
         determined to catch some pickpockets, and that was the
         obvious place to catch.them.     There was another such squad
         at the Nottingham Forest end, but I having been at Leppings
         Lane the year before I determined that is where I was going
         to be this year.     When the crowd started swelling in such
         numbers and all the Police Officers on foot were engulfed in
          the crowd, I walked down to the other barrier where there
”         was a serial, and I saw Sergeant Hodgett there, and I as^®d
          him to post an Officer in view     of us on gate C in oraer that
          he could respond with Officers     on foot should the need
          arise     At that stage I was becoming concerned.   As the
          minutes wore on it became apparent that Officers on foot
          were going to be no use at all, if the situation got worse.

    3   . You have spoken of going down the side road.  That was down
          the side road by the Don you went, was it? - A. Yes, this
          service road, which was maintained as a sterile area.

    oIn your account of the openings   of gate C - it has been callec
       l l te C you may not have known of that;  that is the side
       late by the River Don - you spoke of it being opened on a
       number of occasions to allow injured people in people tc
       go in and out, but only individuals or one or two? - A.
             Yes.
    0. And then you speak of an opening shortly before 3 o'clock? -
             A. Yes.
    n        uhen a number of people went through.  Did you see another
             opening when a number of individuals went through? - A. No.

    0          You did not observe an opening of gate C on which occasion            a
             number of fans went through? - A. No.

        Q. Apart from the ones you described? - A. No.
             The crowd that was at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, of
        Q.
             course extended out to the perimeter gate and was being
             joined *by people coming over the bridge and from
             Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, it extended out of my sight. I
             am not sure how far it went.

              You have spoken of Police Officers being there.  Were Police
            ‘ Officers directing their attention only to people at thefron
                A    I c a n ’t say. The crowd was so dense it wasdifficult t
              seeanywhere except in the area where you were.
        0. Did   you hear messages coming over the             Tannoy, the loudspeake
           system, from Mr. Ryan? - A. Yes.

        o         what stage d id y ou hear that?      Do you remember? - A      I
               heard it on m o r e t h a n one occasion, and I c a n ’t honestly
                             17


                                                 G.   McKAY


     remember at what stage.  Certainly the nessages became more
     and more urgent as time progressed, and he was still
     broadcasting until shortly before the gates were opened,
     exhorting people not to push.

Q. These were messages coming over the public address system? -
   A . Yes.

Q. How do you know it was Mr. Ryan? - A. He used to work for me
   at one time.

Q. You recognised his voice, did you? - A. Yes.

Q. And those were a number of messages and exhortations. What
   was the message? - A. I can’t remember the exact words.

Q. The drift of it? - A. The drift of it was, ’’Please don't push.
   Stop pushing.   People are being injured at the front. Plenty*
   of room inside.   You will all get in eventually".

Q. Did you observe those messages having any effect? - A. They
   didn't have any effect.   No noticeable effect that I could see
   at that end of the crowd.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    The trouble is, I suppose, when
     you have a great crush of people, a lot of people, whether it
     is outside the turnstiles or in the pen, to say, "Move back"
     or "Don't push", it is very difficult to expect them to react
     to that, is not it?   If you have got a company of soldiers on
>    a parade ground you can say, ’’One step backwards, march", and
     they will all do it together, but if you have got people
     really touching each other all the way and jostling, it is
     very difficult to see how they are going to react and go
     backwards, is not it? - A. The remarks I presume were
     addressed at the people who were in fact pushing.   There were
     people pushing.  The remarks were addressed to the people
     pushing, telling them to stop pushing.

Q. When you say "pushing", what were they doing? Trying to
   squeeze themselves through the crowd to get further up or
   what? - A. There were plenty of queue jumpers, people fighting
   their way through and fighting under .the barrier into the area
   near the turnstiles, plenty of those, but the main thrust of
   the pressure was coming through those big gates.      I can only
   presume, because I d i d n ’t see it, I can only presume the
   crowd outside there were pushing to get in, were impatient
   to get in and were pushing.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   The purpose of the message was to reach
     which people? - A. The people who were pushing.

O.   The ones at the back? - A. Yes.

Q.   Where it starts? - A. That is right.

Q. Obviously it is common sense that the individuals at the front
   are powerless unless the pressure is relieved.  - a . It was to
                               1R


                                                     G.   McKAY



        help the people at the front that the     message    was givenout.

Q.        So did you observe any relief come to those at the front? - A.
        None.
Q. Did you perceive any letting off by those at the back? - A. I
   did not perceive any ,• n o .

a        ADart from the Tannoy messages did you observe, for example,
         amongst Officers Mr. Purdy? - A. yes.

o        What did you see Mr. Purdy trying to do to cause those at
         the front to be relieved by those further back giving off?
           a  Mr  Purdy at one stage stood precariously balanced on
         the'barrier with his back to the wall shouting to to the
         people towards the back of the crowd to stop pushing.

0       . Did that appear to bring any relief?    - A. It did not. It did
         not bring any.
    0. Are you aware of the Police Land Rover coining along? - A. Not
          at a l l .
          Did you observe any of the mounted Officers in their elevated
    Q                 trvine to secure those who were pushing that
          they should desist and give over? - A. It was difficult for m
          t o see the mounted Officers and what they were actually doing
          once they had gone into the crowd and were engulfed in the
          rrowd     Certainly a number of them were in the area ot the
          eat es   t h f plrimeter gates, what I refer to as the wrought
           iron
           iron gates.
                 gates      But I c a n ’t comment as to what they were
           actually doing.

       MR. WOODWARD:-     Thank you sir.


                   Re-Examined by MR. COLLINS;

Mr. McKay just I think one matter arising out of this scene
that you have described.
       Va* it vour imoression that the determination to get
 in at M y cos? increased as kick-off drew near? - A. Yes.

 So would you link it with the imminence of the kick-off?
   A. Yes. The determination to get in, the impatience v.o
 qet in.
            _ A The frustration of not being able to get in.
      l u r e that most of those people there had ticket..

 You said that at the beginning of your evidence. - A. Imagine
 v, H n r -‘-ravelled all the way from Liverpool anc getting
 « u a £ t up        crust, like that having expected to be able
 Sn walk into the ground and finding this. Yes, I can uncer-
  s t a n d that frustration on the part of the large majority

 of the people there.
  Did the possibility of persuading someone to think in terms
* of postponing kick-off cross your mind at any stage? - A.
  No, I would not have attempted to persuade anyone.

  Tt- was not I know your function at all? - A. Just as i
’ won id not try and persuade a mechanic how to repair »ay
  rlr    There were Officers in charge of policing arrangements,
  oSblic order arrangements who had see service during the
  niners' strike for instance; had certainly attended at
  football matches week in week out. I was a comparative
  npwroraer.    I don't attend football matches and it might
     ii have been that my perception at that time w a s complete y
  We     v* +- nevertheless I v/as frightened and to me it appeared
   to°bl that t h e only course of action was to open those gates.

           MR. COLLINS:    Yes, I am obliged.

                           (HORNING SESSION)

                          M A U R I C E KAY, called

                      E x a m i n e d by MR. COLLINS;

Mr. M au rice K s y , is that ri g h t ?      A.        Yes.

You are, I think, Queen's C ou nsel?               A.       Yes.

And you a t t e n d e d the m a t c h in q ue stion on 15th April last
wit h your 13 year old son.             A.     Yes.

You live in or     near Liverpool            A.        Ilive in C h e s h i r e ,
about 40 miles     from Liverpool

And are you a - I will not say a supporter but do you
attend Liverpool m a t c h e s from time to time? A. Reg ularl y.

With your son?       A.       Yes.

Had you been in 1988 to this same match?                       A.    Yes.

Where had you been in the ground in" 1588?                      A.    Seated
in the North S t a n d .

.Had you observed anything in any way that you considered
 to be amiss in 1988?         A.   No, theonly thing I can
 remember outside the ground in 1988 was difficulty of access
 on the r o a d s , because of roadworks - people were made late
 by t h a t .

Can you remember what time you got there in 1988?
A.   In 1988?

Yes.   A.   *At the last minute,           because of the roadworks -
about 3.o'clock.

What was the policing in Leppings Lane in 1988, can you
remember anything about it at all?   A.   Not r eally , n o .

Was there any crush of any sort at the turnstiles that you
can recall in 1988 when you arrived?   A.   Not that I can
recall.

Did you observe in any way the behaviour on the terraces in
1988, by which I mean were you aware of any sort of over­
crowding?   A.   No.

Although no doubt      they were full?            A.      Of c ourse .

On this o c c a s i o n , this y e a r , you had I think two tickets
but for separate parts of the g r o u n d .         A.   Yes.
                                                                                  ■•ger-aavM.



                              2


                                                                 H. KAY


Q. Your ticket was where?              A.     In the Leppings Lane standing
   area.

Q. And your son's?       A.       In the North Stand.

Q. What time did you arrive on this occasion, 1989?
   A.   We arrived at the ground at about 2 o'clock.

Q . Did you want to go in straight away or not?    A.   My son
    wanted to go in straight away.    I didn't want to go in
    straight away because I didn't want to be standing on a
    terrace for what might have been a very long time.

Q.   Did your son therefore       go in ahead of you?           A.     Yes.

CT. And as far as you are aware, presumably,                he went to his seat
    in the North Stand?   A.   Yes.

Q . What about yourself?   A.   I  wandered around outside the
    ground for about half an hour or so.

Q.   In the immediate vicinity or --- ?  A.   Yes, within a
     quarter of a mile or so of the approach from the Leppings
     Lane side.

Q r Were'you app'roached .at any time b'y .any 'Pol i cs iiitf.a.vtell ing_
    you to move on or asking what     you were up to? A.            I wasn't
    approached, no.   I saw Police    Officers moving people on *
    near to the ground.

Q. Did you hear why they were                moving them on?      A.      No.

Q. Did you see any people around obviously without tickets
   asking for tickets?    A.  Yes.

Q. Any idea of the sort o f numbers?  A.   Impossible to say.
   I saw perhaps two dozen or so but it is very difficult to
   recall precisely.

Q. Did y o u s e e any ticket touts about?             A.      No, which is
   unusual for that kind of game.

Q. How about, again - as you were an observer and saw people
   no doubt arriving as you were waiting - what comment do
   you have on the general behaviour of the Liverpool fans who
   were arriving at the matc h?      A.   The general behaviour
   in the time between 2.00 and 2.30 when I was wandering
   around outside the ground was not very different from what one
   would expect at any other football grou nd, that they were
   large in number, they were boisterous, some of them were
   singing and chanting and greeting friends that they saw
   approaching the ground.       I didn't see anything that was
   violent or in tim id ati ng or that I would categorise as
   serious misbehaviour.

Q. What about drinking?           A.        Some had clearly been drinking.
Q. Did you see any with cans actually drinking as they went
   past or as they wandered about?   A.   I think I saw some
   with cans.   I can't remember whether they were drinking
   from them at the time.                                  :

Q.   You came back intending to go in I think about half past
     two, is that right?   A.  Yes.

Q. And when you got back in order to go to the turnstiles,
   what was the state of affairs outside the turnstiles?
   A.   It was chaotic in the immediate vicinity of the
   turnstiles.

Q. What were the Police trying to do or apparently trying
   to do, if anything?     A.   It was difficult to tell what
 - the actual strategy was.   There were mounted Policemen
   near to the iron gates that come before the turnstiles
   and I think just inside the iron gates as well.     There
   were Police on foot a little further away and there
   may have been Police on foot in the immediate access area
   to the turnstiles but if there were I didn't come close
   to any.

 Q. Did the Police appear to be taking any steps to control
    people as they .arrived, coming down Leppings Lane before
' - t;hey' T-'BBChed; the ••p-erimeter -gates?''. -A . “ Well',^.T'-had- - j; ^ ~
    walked back to that ground down Leppings Lane.                 I don't
    recall having had to pass through any Police c h e c k ■ ■ • o f > ~ . r
    any sort.        The largest number of Police on foot than I
   /saw were on the right as you approached the Leppings Lane
    entrance close to where the bridge ends, I would say.

Q.    In fact, we have a photograph, if you would be good enough
     to look at what we call Composite Album No. 1   and I think
     it would be sensible if I took you to a photograph which
     was approximately 2.30 er just before.     Can I ask you to
     look at one which is MWL10/20A.    A.   I have that.

Q.   You can see What it shows.         A.    Yes.

Q.People arriving.      That, in fact, is timed at 2.25 or 2.26
   is on the pho tograph but we know that is a minute   out.
   A.    Yes.

Q . Which is about 5  minutes before you actually came down.
    Is that the sort of picture that accords with your recollection
    of the state of affairs when you arrived?    A.   When I
    first walked away from the ground, I walked off to the
    left-hand side of that photograph and when I returned at
    2.30 I therefore came in the direction that most of these
    fans seem to be coming in.    Yes, it broadly accords with
    my recollection except that I was more conscious of Police
    Officers a little more to the right of the photograph than
    the ones where the lady Officer is standing on that photograph
    but I wasn't inspecting the Constabulary, I had no cause to
    check.

                                                        M. K A Y

Q.   If you would like now to go on to MWL10/25A, which shows the
     scene in fact precisely at 2.30 outside Turnstiles A-G.
     A.   Yes.

Q. Those were the turnstiles you were aiming           for, were they
   not?   A.   Yes.

Q.   That is a picture, on the face of it, of no queue and of a
     large number of people waiting to get into that turnstile.
     A.   That is absolutely right.

Q.   That was the scene which presumably was precisely what you
     faced.   A.    Yes.    It was a mass of people, perhaps with
     some element of convergence but nothing that could be
     described as a queue.

Q.   One can see   a m o u n t e d Police Officer just by the wall or
     in front of   the wall in the middle of the photograph.
     A.    Yes.

Q.   And some uniformed Officers on the right, not actually in
     the crowd.    A.   Yes.    I never got that close to the
     turnstiles.    I retreated long before I got to a position
     where I might have seen them.

Q . In, :fsc;t ,^ ^seeing .^thatistate of. affairs,,: jvhat- Tlid^ot;-
      A.    Well, I joined the back of the group, I would have
      thought within, the. .outside gated area, between there-and..
      the turnstiles, and I stood in it for a while.                It wasn't
    .getting anywhere at all;          it was just a mass of people and it
   •’ was d a n g e r o u s .

Q.   It has been suggested that that sort of situation could
     not have arisen unless people at the back were pushing.
     You see, the point - that you can only get a mass of people
     jammed up together if people will come at the back and
     push and if people only did not push at the back it would
     not happen.    What do you say about that?   A.   Well,
     nobody was pushing to join the group when   Igot there;
     you merely became part of it at the back.    Once I was in
     it, it did move frighteningly at times and the slightest
     movement would precip ita te other movement, and I was at
     one time close to a Police Officer on a horse - I don't
     know whether the one in the photograph or not - and when
     the Police horse moved very slightly people would move
     involuntarily alongside it and it would cause a ripple
     of movement and since there were railings there it was
     that and just such a movement that caused me to decide to
     get out of it.



                                           /And we know from other.

                                                                     M. KAY

Q.    We know from other evidence that people in it were in
      distress and getting crushed?   A. Yes.  I didn't see
      any signs of terribly obvious distress at that time.
      I just thought it was better to get out of it.

Q.    What about the mood of the people who were stuck in this
      crowd? How would you describe that at. the time that you
      were in it?   A. I didn't see anything at that time by
      way of mood that would enable me to attribute a mood z.o
      the group of people.

Q.    Anyway you decided to get out. After how long, rouahly,
      trying to get through? A. It is very difficult to s^v.

Q.    You say in your statement five or ten minutes?                          A. Yes.

Q.    But as one appreciates, time passes more slowly than one
      realises?   A.   Yes.

Q.    Anyway, having decided to get out of it, what did you do?
      A.  I walked away from the ground at that time unsure
      as to whether I would even try to get in again, or tninking
      that if I did, I might leave it until substantially after
      the kick-off.  I walked in the opposite direction from
      the direction I had walked at 2 o'clock.

Q.    That would be over the bridge?              A. I walked over the
     ° bridge /' lyes/ rarid *i.'wa^lked^around---a-'ldrt-l^fanrttJS-ina5:v-r;>t*''ft,^'i''.*=•''
       short conversation with a police officer.

Q.     You time that in your statement at about 2.50?                        A. I would
     i say so, yes.

Q.    was that a policeman who had a radio?                     A.    Yes.

Q. And he told you, I think, something aboutthe postponement
    or possible postponement of the kick-off?   A. He was
    under the impression as a result of something he ha heard
    on the radio,  as I arrived, that the kick-off had been
    postponed until 3.15.

Q.   No doubt that did not surprise you?   A. No. I attended
      a semi-final in Birmingham, not involving Liverpool, two
      years previously where the kick-off had been postponed
      by about 15 or 20 minutes.

Q.   Having been told that, did you decide to go back to Leooings
      Lane?   A. Yes.

Q.   To the turnstile area.   When you arrived there, what did
      you see? What was the scene that faced you? A. It was
      very different from the previous occasion.   There seemed
      to be a cordon of police officers outside or somewhere
      near the blue-gated area.

Q.   That is the perimeter gate?    A. Yes, that was controlling
      the flow of people into the area outside tne turnstiles
     wnicn had been the problem area previously.

                                                     M. KAY

Were there a number of people outside the perimeter cate
who were against, as it were, the police cordon? A.^There
were a number of people waiting their turn to get into the
turnstile area, yes.

If you look at the photographs, going back to that same
bundle, MWL10-30A towards the end; I know it is difficult
to see because, of course, the photograph is taken from
inside.   A. Yes.

But perhaps it is a little clearer in 31A. You can see
towards the back of the photograph, just towards the right
of that bush, the perimeter gate which appears to be closed
Do you see that - the left-hand side of that photoarapn?
A. Yes.

There are some mounted police officers in the vicinitv’
A.   Yes.

And there is obviously a considerable crowd of people
outside?   A. Yes.

And, or course, also a very considerable crowd inside?
A. Yes.

You joined, did you, the people waiting outside? A. Yes,
but within a. very .snort space_.of time .J ..ana others were / . v j .
allowed 'into the tifrnstile/area;’            ^     ‘          ^-

You say "allowed in". Was your impression that the police
cordon deliberately moved to allow you in?   A. Y e s / My
impression at that time was that the police had becrun to
control a number of people getting inside the perimeter
gate.

Wnat about the crowd inside the gate? By the time you aot
through into the area within the perimeter gate, was there
a crowd there?   A. At"that time it was entirely orderly
inside the perimeter gates.  It was not particularly over­
crowded and people were proceeding through the turnstiles
in quite a normal manner.

We know, in fact, that Gate- C was opened at 2.52?            A. Yes.

Were you aware whether or not that gate was in fact ooen
when you came back on the second occasion?  A. No, I didn't
know anything about that at all. That must have been
while I was absent from the immediate area.

The picture you describe of the state of affairs witnin the
turnstile area is consistent witn the gate having been
opened by then?   A. Yes.

Would you agree with that?        A.   Yes.

I just want to ask you, if I may go back, about the crowd
outside when you arrived at Leppings Lane itself.  Tnis is
outside the perimeter gates.  We have heard some evidence
                          7

                                                 M. KAY

     in the course of the Inquiry that that crowd was very
     pushy, bad tempered and aggressive and effectively forced
     its way through those perimeter gates. Was that the mood
     that you recall when you arrived or not?   A. No. As I
     said before, it wasn't sufficient of a collective mood to
     be able to say it had any particular mood. When I was
     there, there were some people expressing impatience about
     the fact that the mass of people didn’t seem to be moving
     through the turnstiles, but this was at half-past-2 and I
     was well away from the area before the gate seems to have
     been opened.

Q.   I am sorry, it is my fault.  I was asking about the mood
     of the people outside in Leppings Lane when you arrived
     soon after 2.50. These are the people who were cordoned
     off by the police.  Was there any aggressive mood that you
     were aware of amongst that crowd?   A. No.   I found, on
     returning to the ground on that occasion, that everything
     seemed better controlled and more orderly and people were
     proceeding to do what they had gone there to do, get into
     the ground.

Q.   Anyway you went through one of the turnstiles?    A. Yes.

Q.   And having got in, what faced you was clearly the mouth
     of the tunnel ahead of you?   A. Yes.._

Q.   Were you aware that you could have gone round the outside?
     A.  I was not aware.                         ...........

Q. / Did you ask anyone where you should go?   A. Not as such,
     no. When you go through the tunnel, when you go through
     the turnstile, on the right I think there were some
     programme sellers where I bought some programmes, and
     then I saw a gate within the turnstile area with a steward
     on it, and he was opening the gate to let some other people
     in.

Q.   That is the gate at the back of the West Stand, I think?
     A.   Yes.

Q.   Which you now know to be the gate through which people
     were going up into the stand?   A. Yes. I had no wish to
     go to the area immediately behind the goal or down near
     the front, so I thought that that gate would take me to
     the rear of the standing area and so I approached it. I
     was told by the man on duty there that that was access
     to the seated area and that I should go, he gestured,
     towards the tunnel.

Q.   When you got into the ground, were you then aware whether
     or not Gate C was open or did you not really look? Gate
     C, of course, is tne gate which would, as you come into
     the ground, be immediately to your right- A. No, I didn't
     notice.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  When you were trying to get to
     the gate that actually led to the stand, somebody directed
     you, did they?    A.  Yes.

                                                        M. KAY

Q.   Towards the tunnel?   A. Yes, it was pointed out to me
     that my ticker wasn't for that area and that I should go
     to the tunnel.

Q.         Mr. COLLINS:    Did you in fact go to the central tunnel?
     A.   Yes.

Q.   Did you go down it?        A. Yes.

Q.   Were other people going down at the same time?          A. I think
      so, but not in especially large numbers.

Q.   Had the match in fact kicked off by then?         A.   Yes.

Q.   So it must have been a minute or two after3 o'clock?
      A. Yes.

Q.   When you got to the end of the tunnel, what faced you?
     A. A very large number of people in an area insufficient
      to accommodate them.

Q.   Did you manage to get into the crowd?         A. I was in it, at
     the back of it, yes.

Q.   Were you out of   the tunnel, actually on the terracing?
      A. Yes.

Q.   Can you remember which side of txie central barrier *yoa went,
      either Pen 3 or Pen 4? A. I don't know them by number but
      I would nave gone slightly to the left as you go through
     the tunnel.   It would be Pen 4.




                                     /Q.   How far down into the pen.

                                                   M. KAY


Q. How far down into the pen did you get? - A. Not very far.
   I could not be more specific than that.

O         Where you were how uncomfortable were you by the time you
         got into your position? - A. Well it was very very crowded
         and packed and within a very short space of time one was
         conscious of people jammed like sardines and swaying and
         not having any choice about their movements.

0. Could you see or were you aware of what we now know in fact
   was happening towards the front of the pens? - A. No, some
   of the movement was in a forward direction. Whether m a t
   was the result of pressure behind or whether it was the
   effect^of crush barriers giving way in front, I have no
   idea.
O'. Did you become aware of people going out through the front
    perimeter fence and trying to scale the front perimeter
    fence? — A. At some point, yes.

Q. And were you aware of the match being stopped? - A. Yes.

0         Did those two events roughly coincide as far as you can
         recall? - A. It is difficult to be specific but there was
         not much time between them, I don't think.

• b V Did yoii reaiisV7v / h y - . p e p p . l e w e r e / cl.ii^iRg ^put ;andjwhy the -
      match was stopped immediately? - A. I did not really
      realise no. Jt did not seem to me that it was a kind Oi
      Ditch invasion or anything of that sort, but 1^ did not
   ■' know the nature of what had happened down at- tne bot_tom.

 Q
         We     have seen the video and indeed have heard evidence
         of     Police Officers, not only Police Officers, getting on
         to     the fence at the back and making gestures for people
         to     go back? - A. Yes, I do remember that.

         Was it possible to comply with those? - A. Not at first,
    Q
         no.
    q.   w hy    not? - A. Because there were too many people behind.

    0    Did Deople around seem to appreciate why the Police were
         wanting them to go back? - A. People around were shouting
          back to the Police Officers that they could not move
          backwards, it was not possible.

    0    Did you eventually manage yourself to move back? - A. Yes,
         I moved first sideways and I think that took me to u . . e
         vertical fence that divides the two pens, I was standing
         close to that and then a short time afterwards I went
         back out through the tunnel.

    0. Mow as you went back out through the tunnel were you aware
       of any Police Officers? - A. I was aware Oo. some Police
       Officers coming on to the terraces through the tunnel as
                              10

                                           M. KAY


     I was going out.  I was aware of a slight altercation
     between some other people who were going out and the Police
     Officers who were coming in.

Q. Can you recall what was the nature of that altercation? -
   A. It was to do with comfort in the ground and crowd
   control.

Q. Did vou see any injured people or people apparently injured
   as you went out? - A. No, all I remember was that I saw
   two or three men carrying another chap who had clearly
   been injured, I think not terribly seriously, a leg injurv
   or something of that sort, and they were carrying him
   through the tunnel at about the time I was going through
   the tunnel.

Q. And you'got back out into the concourse behind the tunnel,
   did you? - A. Yes.

Q. I think you met up by chance with a friend of yours, an
   acquaintance? - A. A little later. Once I was back in
   the concourse area I had made no decision as to what I
   was going to do but some people started to move round to
   the right as you came out of the tunnel.          I did that
   and discovered for the first time that that was access
   to another part of the terraces which my .ticket would have
 ; entitled "rae -to -’
                      go-"t£’and-"that"is*:where."I.w e n f c " ' a n c r "'
   is where I met the person I knew.

Q. Could you see the pitch from there? - A. Yes.

Q. And you then presumably saw the unfolding events on the
   Ditch? - A. I saw a lot going on without a great deal
   of knowledge as to precisely what had happened or how
   serious it was.

Q. Did you hear any announcements over the Tannoy? - A. Not
   for a long time, no.

Q. Can you.recall what was the first announcement which you
   can recall hearing? - A. I remember a call at one point
   for medical people in the crowd.  I cannot remember
   precisely when it was but I think that was the first
   thing I heard.  The next thing I remember hearing in any
   detail was when the Liverpool Manager was speaking over
   the Tannoy, but that seemed to be quite a long tiiae after.

Q. It was, it was about 50 minutes after. - A. Yes.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Can you give any idea when
     you say you heard a call for medical people? - A. My
     Lord, I would have said it was in the region of 3.25 or
     so, 3.30, but I may well be wrong about that.

Qm         mr. COLLIMS: Certainly some significant time
     into the events as it were? - A. That I became aware of
     it, yes.

Q. I think shortly after Mr. Dalglish's announcements it was
   announced that the match had been abandoned? - A. Yes, I
   think one of the things he said was:   "Ke don't want any
   more fatalities" and up until that point I was completely
   unaware and the people who were standing around me v/ere
   completely unaware that things had   been as serious as that.

Q. I think you after the announcement   that the match had been
   abandoned and people began to leave, went round to meet
   your son at the exit point to the North Stand? - A. Yes.

Q. No doubt he had been somewhat worried? - A. He had indeed,
   yes, he had been watching things with a rather clearer
   view than I had and had seen people stretchered out and
   was fearful that I might have been injured since he knew
   that I was in that part of the ground.

Q. Did he indicate to you whether he had tried to find out
   any information about what was going on? - A. Yes, he said
   he had asked a person, I can't recall whether a Police
   Officer or a Steward, and he met with silence.

q   .      seems from what you nave told us thac there was precious
        little information given at any stage in the proceedings.
        Is that a fair comment? -A. Yes.

        •   ''t-m-. C'OI/L-INS-:- ••Yes, thank you, M r . Kay.-.


                         Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

Q. Mr. Kay, it may be said by some people that you are not an
   expert in policing procedures but have you been to a number
   of football grounds in the past? - A. I have been to a
   large number of football grounds, yes, but x am not an
   expert in policing.

Q. You have seen the Police controlling crowds at other grounds
   - A. Yes.
Q. At 2.30 was it your impression, having had experience of
   policing of crowds but without the training in Police^
   Drocedure, that the crowd at 2.30 was both chaotic and dis­
   organised? - A. Yes.

 Q. And that the efforts of the Police to control them were if
    anything counter-productive? - A. Yes.

 O. Without going into too much detail, was the broad thrust of
    the difficulty this:     that there v/ere large numbers of
    Policemen within the disorganised press of people but no^
    Policemen attempting to stop the crowds coming to join tfc^L
    press? - A. Save that I would not be able to agree with tne
    words'*'large numbers of Police Officers'* within the problem
    area.    I would agree with the rest of your statement.
Q. So such Policemen as there were were within the problem area
   and doing no good and no Policemen preventing people joining
   the press.  Is that broadly the problem? - A. it is something
   like that, yes.

Q. Have you been to grounds where there have been Police - if
   not cordons - there have been strings of Police with Tannoys
   or Public Address Systems filtering the flow of fans some
   little distance away from the ground? - A. I have not been
   aware of a positive filtering system in the way that you
   describe.  I have been aware on big matches and one big match
   in particular that I recall, of Police strung out at intervals
   over a very long approach to the ground.   I am talking about
   perhaps half or three-quarters of a mile and Police Officers
   standing every few yards.

q   : Doing what? - A. Keeping an eye on the crowd. I am bound
      to say at the time when I did see that and it was at a semi­
      final in Birmingham two years ago, my feeling at the time
      whether justified or not, was that they were too numerous.

Q. You see there are various things that may be said to be
   impractical.  What I am very anxious not to do is to
   make suggestions that the Police should have done something
   that no Police Force anywhere else could have done.

        . - --Have you. ‘:£or-example been to Old T r a f f o r ^ n d . s e & a -.a. .., ■
     the Police controlling the crowds crossing the main Manchester
     to Chester road? - A. Yes I have, many times.

Q. -That is what I want to ask you about. Is it right that
    massive crowds come up both from the Station at Y7arwick Road
    and the car park at the Cricket Ground, up not aiRinain road.
    They then meet the main Manchester to Chester road which
    has to be crossed to get to the ground? - A. Yes, they do
    it in two places. They do it first of all at Talbot Road
    by the Cricket Ground and then again at the main Chester
    Road much closer to the Football Ground.




                                       /Q. Is that done

                                                      M. KAY


Q. Is that done by simply having a line of Police Officers with a
   public address system who simply first tell the crowd when to
   stop and when to go, and the Police Officers turn round with
   their arms stretched or put their arms down and turn sideways?
   - A . Y e s , and I have, never seen it mismanaged.

Q. And never seen the crowd become unruly when they are properly
   organised? - A. No.

Q. Just one other thing which is of interest in what you say.
   You had been to the previous Semi-Final? - A. Yes.

Q. But nevertheless you were not familiar with the standing area
   because the previous year you had had a ticket? - A. I had
   tickets both years, but a seating ticket.

Q. I mean seating ticket.  I am sorry. That is an insensitive
   question.  It does not follow, does it, Mr. Kay, that because
   a spectator goes to a ground once a year he is necessarily
   familiar with the whole of the ground the following year? - A.
   It certainly does not follow, no, and I have been to
   Hillsborough, although a long time ago, on very many
   occasions, but I have never I think previously stood in the
   Leppings Lane e n d .

 Q. And the other thing I want to ask you is this, because things .
■■tv-may-bfe'said 'about/tipe :Spectators,'at the Leppxr^sr LaKelentf:- 'r;~:
      Was it your impression from having followed Liverpool on a
      number *of"occasions that a large number,- a large proportion'^-
      of the people attempting to get in at the Leppings Lane end
   /■ were people who usually are seated at Anfield but could not
      all be seated on this occasion? - A. I am sure that is true
      to some extent.   The basis o f.ticket allocation was such
      that a lot of people who had season tickets for seats at
      Anfield were only allocated standing tickets for the Semi-
      Final at Hillsborough, and I did see a number of people,
      not very many, a handful of people, at the Leppings Lane
      end standing whom I know normally sit down, people who sit
      near me at Anfield.

           MR. HYTNER:   Sir, there is a great deal more, but it
    is well ploughed ground, and I do n ’t propose to ask this
    witness the questions that have been already asked many times.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Kay, in 1988 when you arrived you had been delayed? - A.
   Yes.

Q. So you got to the ground at what time? - A. We got to our
   seats as the match was kicking off, and had no difficulty in
   getting from where we parked the car to our seats.

Q. On that occasion did you notice any Police around the approach
   to the Leppings Lane entrance? - A. No. Arriving later than
   we had intended to arrive because of the traffic difficulties,
   having parked the car, we merely proceeded as quickly as
                                14

                                                           M. KAY


     possible into the ground, and I have no recollection of the
     presence and distribution of Police Officers, the crowd or
     anything else.

Q. Would it be right in 1988 at that time on your approach to the
   ground you had a very free and clear way in? - A. I
   certainly d o n ’t remember any obstruction from parking the car
   to getting in the ground.

Q. By the time you got in obviously most of the people had gone
   in ahead of you? - A. Yes, but there were plenty of other
   delayed people.  I am afraid west-east transport is not
   terribly good.

Q.   In 1989 when you went to the game you arrived at the ground
     and you told us you came to the Leppings Lane entrance at
     about half-past-2? - A. Yes, the first time I had been there
     at 2 o ’clock.

Q. Between 2 o ’clock and 2.30 you had observed the people around
   you? - A. Yes, but most of that time I was some distance away
   from the ground.   I walked away from the   ground.

Q.   Because you did not want to stand upon apacked ‘terrace?                  - A.
     Yes.

vQ.- .Thd'sSiHere. :ybiir 'Vbrcfs X « > Y e s }£ 'did ~no't--went ^ro-ste’nd
     there for what could have been three hours.

Q.   So even at that time you anticipated that the terrace would be
     packed, did you, at about 2 o'clock? - A. I had no views as to
     how packed it might have been at 2 o ’clock, but I did not want
     to stand in a terrace that would certainly have soon become
     packed and remain there for three hours.

Q. When you came back to the crowd, to the gates, that would be
   about what time? - A. About half-past-2.

Q.    At that time are able to help us as to how far back from the
     turnstiles the crowd waiting to go in extended? Perhaps you
     will look at the pointer and be helped by the usher? - A.
     Well, it was really just a mass of people inside the
     perimeter gate, from there to the turnstile.

Q. Was there any clear space between the perimeter gates and the
   rear of the crowd? - A. I c a n ’t remember whereprecisely the
   rear of the crowd was when I joined it.

Q. Your recollection is it did not extent beyond the perimeter
   gates into Leppings Lane, did it? - A. If it it did it would
   not have extended by very much, I am sure of that.

Q. You could see the crowd ahead of you as you approached that
   place, and decided having stood in it for a short while to
   withdraw? - A. Yes.

Q. May we take it from what you           saw when you joined the back of
                                 15


                                                           M. KAY


      the   crowd you did not push in? - A. You may take that.

 Q.   And you at no stage were doing any pushing? - A. Absolutely
      right.

 Q. However, there came a point when you became reluctant to
    remain there? - A . Y e s .

 Q.   Was that because you were being pushed from behind? - A. I was
      being moved around in different directions. The main sway
      that I remember was in fact towards my right rather than from
      behind, so presumably it would have come from my left rather
      than behind, but there were just so many people there it was
      swirling around at that point. That is what I found dangerous
      and led me to believe that it was better to go.

 G. At that stage you were not aware of any mood on the part of
    the crowd, were you? - A. No, I find it very hard to say that
    there was a particular mood on the part of the crowd. There
    were a lot of people trying to get into a football ground.
    Some individuals were manifesting impatience at the time it
    was taking.

 Q. Here it was, half-past-2, and half-an-hour to go to the kick-
    off? - A. Yes.

:-Gr./'iWere youH-able'^to^-disx:«r«-'-vfhy -anybody should-'’t>e^'amxiGus"'at~>
      half-past-2 about getting in in time? - A. I was anxious about
      remaining in that-crowd as it was for however -long it was                 .
      going to take to get into the ground.            My view of that
    ; was to get out of the crowd, but some people who perhaps
      feel more passionately about these things than I do
      decided to stay in.

 Q. Had you been in a terrace         crowd before? - A. I have been in
    terrace crowds before.

 Q. When was the last occasion? - A. In the Wembley Cup Final
    of 1988.

 Q. In 1989' you went away from the crowd again? - A. Yes.

 Q. You have spoken of the activities of the Police, and you
    agreed with Mr. Hytner that their efforts seemed to be
    counter-productive? -A. yes.

 Q. What precisely do you mean by that? What was being done that
    was having an adverse effect? - A. Well, the only Police
    Officers that I was aware in close proximity to where I
    was in the problem area at half-past-2 were the mounted
    Police Officers.  I am not sure how many of them there
    were, but in that space, and there is not very much
    space there, even one mounted Police Officer takes up
    quite a lot of room, and when his horse moves slightly
    it causes movement in the crowd which precipitates the
    kind of involuntary movement I was describing before.
    That seemed to be happening and there to be a problem

     without there being any compensating benefit, because
     there was no improvement for the time I was there in the
     situation.  It was not going from a situation of
     disorganised mass of people into an organised access to
     the ground.  If anything, it was getting worse.

Q.    So when you accepted the generalisation that the efforts of
     the Police were counter-productive, you intended solely the
     presence and activity of the mounted Force.   Is that right? -
     A. In a positive sense, yes.

Q. You agreed with it being counter-productive. - A. Yes.

Q. Are you aware that the use of Police horses in a crowd is a
   fairly standard measure of controlling crowds? - A. of course.

Q: You havfe not had the advantage of hearing the evidence of the
   mounted Police in this case, have you? - A. No.

Q. Or considering it? - A. No, I saw very brief snatch in the
   press, but I am sure I did not see it all.

Q.   You have spoken of seeing the mounted Police and the behaviour
     of the crowd. Were you aware that various Officers of the
     mounted Police have spoken of their horses being hit and
 ^   struck-.by..members ,o.£. £he..crowd?.;- .A, .J,..didn’t know....... ...
-v   anything'' df^hat-=until -the -Police ..Officer hfhprcafine"         *':*■>
     my statement told me such allegations had been made.

Q. You did not see any of that? - A. No.

Q. When you spoke of mounted Police how many did you intend to
   describe? Just the one? - A. In that sort of situationyou
   are only really conscious of whatever is nearest to you. I
   was aware of more than one mounted Police Officer in the
   Leppings Lane area.  When I talk of a sudden movement
   precipitating movement in the crowd I am obviously
   talking about the one that was nearest to me at the
   time.

Q. It was really just one you are aware of? That is right, is
   it? - A. I d o n ’t know whether it is right or not.

Q. You are only aware of one? - A. I am only aware of one close
   to me having that effect.

Q. Thank you.  When you went into the ground you say you were
   directed by a steward? - A. Yes.

Q. That was a steward situated whereabouts? By a gate in the
   wall? - A. I d o n ’t know if that is the correct term for him.
   He was the person who obviously had responsibility for
   ensuring that people with seating tickets went up and through
   the gate to the seated area.

Q. It may be helpful to look at the pointer. Are you intending
   to describe the access to some stairs or gateway in the wall

    A        there? Do     you see? - A. I ca n ’t see it from here.          May I go
             across and    point it out?

        Q. Please. (Witness demonstrates on model) You are pointing to.
           the stairway? - A. The stairs where it says "Y-Z".

        Q.   You had had your ticket. May I ask you about your ticket.
             Would you have found it helpful to find some indication on the
    B        back of your ticket as to where the accesses to the terraces
             were? -A. I suppose so, yes.

        Q.   Did you experience any confusion in relation to the signing
             and the notices on the gates? - A. The gates within the
             ground, after passing through the turnstile?

        Q. At any stage? - A. As you approached down Leppings Lane itself
           it was "first of all not immediately obvious to me which
#   C      turnstiles    were for the seated people and which were forthe
           standing people, although it soon became obvious. Once you
           had passed through the turnstiles I saw no sign, advice or
           assistance at all as to where one should go. Bearing in mind
           the fact it turned out to be an area through which both
           standing and seating customers were to go I found in
           retrospect very surprising.

        Q. By that time had the game already started? - A .             Yes. -

        Q./ And you managed to take up a position? - A. Just about.

        Q. Did you at that time think of. coming out because if was too
           thronged? - A. Not immediately, no.

        Q. So is this the situation, that which confronted you was
           something you were prep'ared to tolerate? - A. I was asked
           before when I had last stood, and I said a year before at
           Wembley.   Apart from that I have not stood at a football
           ground for a great many years.   My experience when I did
           was that what seems to be an immediate crush inside an
           access point can very often disperse quite soon after you
           get there.

Q. So you were expecting that to happen?   A.   Yes, before
   I had a true appreciation of just how many people were
   there and what the options of anybody who was there had.

Q. Were you aware; apart from normal swaying or surging that
   one observes in a terrace crowd or may experience in a
   terrace crowd, of any particular movement in the crowd
   whilst you were there?   A.   No, I was aware of forward
   and sideways movements and I was aware, I can remember,
   at one time being pushed forward into a crush barrier
   and, along with others «ho were in the same situation,
   trying to ease myself to the side of that crush barrier.

Q. This was the experience of some potent surge or sway that
   did not give way, did not return?   A.   I am sorry, I do
   not understand the question.

     In your statement you speak of some irresistable weight
Q
     from behind.  A.   Yes.   Yes, clearly when I was pushed
     down into the crush barrier, that was.pressure from behind.

     You had been on the terrace for some minutes by that time,
Q
     had you?    A.  A very few minutes because it must all have
     taken place between my getting there at a couple of minutes
     past three and the game coming to an end at six minutes
     past three ..                        :^C.:

     Very well.   There came a point when you decided to come out
Q
     and you came 'down the tunnel. A.'  Yes.-

Q./At that stage there were Police Officers coming in the
   opposite direction.  A.    Yes.

Q. Are you aware of how many?        A.     Not many but they included
   a senior officer.

Q. And they were obviously on their way to do something.
   A.   Certainly, yes.

Q.   They had a mission.   A.     Yes.

                     Re-examined ty MR. C O L L I N S :

Q.   In the crush on the terraces, were you at anystage aware
     of the existence of a gate at the back of theradial fence
     which could have given you access to the next-door pen?
     A.   No.

Where did you find y our se lf? - A. I found myself queuing
in tiie entrance to turnstiles marked C.

That is the other side of         the wall from where you should
have been? - A. Yes.

Having realised you were the wrong side of the wall did
you try to alter your position? - A. Well, we looked at
the situa tio n and rea l is in g the magnitude of people there
it would have been im po ss ib le for us to get back to find
section 3.

So you carried on until you got to turnstile C? - A. We
did.

Once you arr ived at turnsti le C, what did you say, if
anything, to the steward, the person on the turnstile? -
A. On approa chi ng t urn st ile C there was a Policeman
outside who physically was unable to do anything.            The
friend I was travelling w i t h approached the turnstile
before me and was q u e s t i o n e d by the steward as to why he
was coming in turnstile C.            He said we were caught in
tne crowd heading towards th^re and we could not get back
and so he just let him.           I just followed through and I
phys ica lly tore my own ticket and passed it to him.

    Q. Y o u say there was a Po li c em an by the turnstile? -A. Yes.

    0. Why cou ld n 't that person do anything?            - A. Due to the
       size of the'crowd in that area.

       standing by the turnstile entrance, yes.

    3. So did you climb over?       A.    Yes.

    3. Did anyone try to stop you getting over at that stage?
       A.   No.
B    , Did anyone help you to get over?  A.   No.    Once I
       reached the top of the fence, I found I couldn't aet
       my leg over due to the nature of the fence c o m i n g b a c k
       on itself so the only way for me to get over was to
       throw myself forward, which I did, and there was a
       Policeman below there and I landed on top of him.

    3* I think after that you assisted with helping the injured?
      A.    Yes.
    3. And at some stage you were round in the gymnasium ares?
       A.   Yes, that is correct.

    3. Where doctors had gathere d?       A.      Yes.

      And were you present when one of the doctors looking after
D     a casualty asked for oxygen?   A.   I was.

      Was oxygen provided?   A.   There was firemen there
      bringing oxygen cylinders in and one was brought to the
      doctor and it was found to be empty.

      In your statement, sir, you say this on the last page,

      was very good."   A.   Yes.

      'It seemed to .be the first time anything had been organised
      pro perly.at all.    Certainly outside there was no obvious
       org anisation within the Police.       Nobody had taken charge
       of the Police as such and they did not seem to be doing"
       anything helpful at all."       I am sure you do not mean
      that in the sense of no help at all but was that the
      picture, of lack of organisation outside among the Police?
      A.     Yes, I would def ini te ly say ttfere was definitely
      lack of organisation, otherwise people lite myself would
      not have taken it upon themselves to stretcher them people
      across on hoardings, etc.         Otherwise, I know that some
      Police did administer mouth t*o mouth but there was a
      consid era ble amount of Police and I felt they should
      have taken the upper hand, myself.

        in particular that you were later last year and by  the
        time you got to the tunnel entrance Police blocked your
B       way and redirected you.   A.   Yes.

     Q.   I wanted to take you b ef ore that outside the ground
          last year.   Was there any check of your ticket before
          you arrived at the turnsti le or the ares before it?
          A.   I don't recall any check on tickets, no.

     Q. Do you remember making a statement about this matter?
        In your statement you say, "Last year    before we actually
       - got to the gates there were Police Officers stopping
        the fans and filtering everyone slowly through    towards
        the entrance   and the    turnstiles." A.*  Yes, I remember
        that.   At the turnstile you were stopped before goina
        into the turnstile, yes.     The Policeman on the turnstile,
        if you get what I mean.     There was nobody ---    Are
        you talking about outside the gate area?

D   Q. Outside in Leppings Lane itself,                      was there any check cn
       your ticket?    A. No, but when                       we got inside that
       gate area there, yes.

    Q. Where      the gentleman is pointing at this moment?                            A.    Yes.

    Q.     There was a check       there?      A.          Yes.

    Q.     How far from the turnstile would you say that was?
          A.    Well, there was a number of Police there and I would
          think possibly half way to quarter of the way, I couldn't --

    Q. Somewhere about half w a y between the perimeter gate and
       the turnstiles?   A.     Yes.

    Q.    You were checked by a casual Officer or by what apparently
          was a group of Officers carrying out that"task?
          A.    There was a number of Officers there that day.

    Q.     May I return you to this year and the use                     ofthe        A, B   C
          and where it took you?    A.   Yes.

          Your   ticket was marked       --- ?        A.    * B.

    Q. As you approached the turnstiles, did you know exactly
       where the B turnstiles were?_  A.   No.

    Q.    Did you see the letter        A?       A.        I did,yes.

    Q.     Did you make    any a s s um pt io n as to the position of turnstiles
          marked B in     relation to those marked A?          A.   Well, if
          I         It    is natural thinking in my way, anyway, that if
          A is there,     B follows, and this is the way that I naturally

                                                 T. B. M A T T H E W S

          assumed it.   It wasn't until we were in the position that
          we couldn't turn back that we found out that we were in
          Turnstile C.

    Q.    No doubt somebody somewhere does not follow A        by B but
B         you thought that was the natural thing to do?         A.    I
          would assume so, myself, yes.

    0. Having made that decision, what was the effect on jour
       journey towards the ground when you realised that
       the Turnstiles B were not next to Turnstiles A?    A.              Whst
       do you mean?   The nature of the journey?

£Q.        What did you do?    Did you stop, turn round?   A.  Well
         -you know, obviously there was a mass of people and vou
          can't just go rushing through but we turned and we noticed
          we could see that there was a mass of people behind us a n d ’
          to get out would have been an impossibility. I would have
          thought, without fighting your way out.

    Q.   ^ s ^ ^ f ai r to say that you were more slowly entering the
         ground than you would have done if you had aone straiaht
D        to Turnstile B?       A.   I don't ---

    3. Did you have to stop?    Did you check?    Did you speak
       to an Officer?    What did you try and do?    k.   We
       didn't speak to any Officers at all.    The Police were
       pa trolling the area outside, which I said in my statement
       on horses and generally they were adding mere to the chaos
       due to the mo vement of the horses because if a horse is
       backing towards you you move out of the way of it - well
       I do, anyway, you know.                                  ’

    3. I really meant in this sense:   when you realised that you
       had got a ticket marked Tor a turnstile to which you
       were not appro ac hin g — - A. Yes.

    J. What did you ac tually do?  A.    Well, we attempted to turn
       round and go back but we realised that the nature of the
       crowd, that we would be unable to get back to Turnstile B.
       We knew the lay-out of the ground and we knew that if
       we were allowed through that turrefcile that we could
       actually get into the area where B was.

         When you got to the turnstile with’ the wrong letter on
         your ticket, what h ap pe ne d? A.  As I said, the -lad
         who was with me, he gave his ticket to the turnstile
         collector and he said that, "You have got the wrong turnstile
         here" and he said, "Well, there is no wsy we can go back­
         wards, you know" and he said, "Oh, well, Q 0 through and oo
         right" and then I just chucked my ticket in afterwards and he
         accepted it.

                     LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:        I think we have had all this,
              Mr.   Jackson.

         3*        MR. JACKSON:          What I am seeking to enquire from you
              is that the fact of the tickets being wrongly numbered
     B        slowed the moveme nt s through the turnstiles themselves.
              You see, we have heard of the turnstiles, for a reason*
              no-one has y e t .e x p l a i n e d , it seems that Sheffield
              turnstiles on that day apparently worked more slowly
              than the formal.        I am seeking a reason for that.       Did
              you see any reason why-people were going through the
              turnstiles even r.ore slowly than they did normally?
              A.   No.     The only reason I can say that we went throuch
     C        slower than normal was because my mate was checked i n ”
              front of m e .   Myself, I moved through quicker than he
              did.   Yes, so ---

         3. As far as you are concerned, you can tell us that one
            reason - your friend in particular was more slowly
            through because of that particular reason?   A.    Yes.

                   MR. COLLINS:    If it helps - it may save a bit
     D        of time - there will be evidence as to why there was
              slowness of movement through the turnstiles in due course.
              I have only just seen it and my friends have not but
              there will be such evidence which explains to some extent,
              I think, why this happened.

                    MR. JACKSON:       Sir,     I apologise if I have taken
              unn ecessary time.

                     MR.   COLLINS:    No,    of course.

                                Cro ss -ex am ine d by MR. WOODWARD:

         3. Mr.     Matthews,   you are a long time supporter of Liverpool?
            A.       Yes.

         3. And you hsve been to many,many of their games,                    home and
            away, and you went to this Semi-Final i n -1988?                   A. I did.

         3. Did you enjcy the game?           A.      Yes, we won.

         3. I want to ask you a little bit about that.   The time you
            arrived last year, was it a little bit later than this*
            year?   A.   It was.

     G }• And last year when you arrived did everything seem to be
          well org an is e d and well run? A. In which respects?

         J. In order to get you into the ground?   A.                   On     the
            turnstiles, yes, I would think so, myself.

                }. You had your   ticket checked,       you say?        A.         I did.

                3. That was at the'actua l    approach to the turnstile entrance?
                   A.   Yes.

           B    . There was a policema n there asking you for your ticket and
                  you showed it and if you had got it you went in?    A.   Yes

                . I want to ask you how that compares with your experience on
                  this day in 1989.   First of all, the number of people that
                  were there.   This time you were a little bit earlier?
                  A.   Yes.

           C3-    How did the crowd that you saw present round the turnstiles
                  and in the entrance and approach to the gates compare with
                  what you found last year?   A.   I would say that there
                  were more people around that area this year than there was
                  lest year.

               ij. There were crowds more,      were there not?              A.      Yes.

                  And by the time you arrived on this occasion things had
           D      got very difficult.   A.   I would say so,yes.

               ij. Nothing like   that   occurred in 1988,       did it?            A.      No.

                  And the system that was working             in 1988 appeared           to be
                  coping well?   A.   Yes.

                 May I ask you about when you went inside    in 1989?    Having
                  gone through    the entrance gates in 1988 you say that there
                  was a cordon of --- . I beg your pardon, through the
                  turnstiles, there was a cordon across the mouth of the
                  tunnel?   A.     There was, yes.

               I|. Are you   sure about that?      A.         Well,    I saw a cordon there.

                  Can you describe to us what you   mean by that?   How many
                  Officers were there?   A.    I can't remember the number but
                  I would certainly put there was more than five at least.

                  And how were they st an di ng?         A.      Across the entrance
                  of the tunnel.

                  Shoulder to shoulder, side by side,            physically barring
                  the way?   Is that what you mean?              A.   Yes.

           G<     A solid line of Polic e me n    across the mouth of the tunnel?
                  A.   Yes.

                  You are quite sure about       that?                Well,       I saw that with
                  my eyes last year.

3* What time would that havs bssn last year?   A.   Well
   it must have been about five to three, 3 o'clock t i m e ’
   you know.                                                *

3. When you arrived at the ground last year, had the kick-off
   started or not?   A.   By the time we got on to the terrace
   the kick-off had just started, yes.                 terrace,

3«           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Where did you fetch up last
     year?      A.   Where did we end up, do you nean?

3. Yes.        A.      On the right-hand section as you look at the
   pitch.           That area, yes.

3.'The wedge at the corner?            A.    Yes.

3.        MR. WOODWARD:          You went   round the back,   did vou
     to get to it?   A.          Yes.                                     ’

3. This year when you came in and got to the terrace, that
   would be about what time when you came out of t h e ’tunnel
   to go on to the terrace?   A.   I would imagine it to be
   round about quarter to three.

 . At that stage, would  it be right to sav there             were   no
   players on the field?    A.    No.

 . There were no players?              A. Not that I noticed,    anyway.

.     At that stage, when you got through the tunnel, did you
     have any concern about the number of people?    A.   Yes.

. As you had gone along the tunnel, were you just walkino
  normally or were you rushing and running or'what?
  A.   We were walking down with some -- with a number of
  people behind us, yes.

.    You vere in a s t e a d y -- ?   A.    Flow,   yes.

.     Flow of people going along but it was not uncomfortable
     or difficult?     A.    I wouldn't say it was uncomfortably
     difficult, no.    There was room there.

. Is this the picture that you have,.that immediately you
  got to the tunnel exit on to the terrace, you could see
  that the crowd down in the area where you were thinking
  of going was very densely packed?   A.   It is normal
  in my experience when you go to a football ground and
  you are coming out on to the terracing, the section is
  normally packed round there anyway and you would have to
  push your way in there anyway.

. In the statement that you made at that time, were you
  intending to describe this time when you say, "It was

                                         T. B. MATTHEWS

     worse than anything I had ever been in before"?       A.      That
     was while I was on the terracing, that was, yes.

3.    Was that very shortly after you got in?    A.   On getting
     in, as I have said prior to that, I lost my mate and I was
     sent —    I went down forward and once I had got down a
     couple of the terraces, I ended up going down with the
     nature of the crowd, yes.

3. You make an observation about seeing that there were two
   lads trapped against a barrier.    A.   I did.

3.    Had the teams yet come out when you saw that?     A.  I
     would imagine they had done.   I can't honestly   remember
     t h a t , you k n o w .

3. You do not recall seeing any players on the field?
   A.   I was more conce rn ed with myself than what was hsopening
   on the pitch at the time.

3. Did you see the teams come out?       A.   I just   said that
   I didn't.

3. Did you see them at any time come out?      A.      I can't recall
   that, no.

     <j>. This situation that you describe was in the position that
          the Usher is indicating, round about the centre of Pen 4?
          - A. Somewhere round about there, I would imagine so, yes.

     <). Were you conscious of any sudden surge after that or not?
•d       - A. Yes, that is what took me past the barrier and well,
         probably saved my life.

     4). But was it before that surge occurred that you were already
         aware of people in difficulty? - A. Yes.

      . People trapped before the surge, as you described it,
        occurred? - A. Yes.

                MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.


                       Cross-Examined by HR. GLASGOW:

     2. Have you got a bundle of photographs in front of you there,
        the big fat one? - A. Yes.

     2. It is called West Midlands 2 on the outside.         Is that the
D       one? - A. Yes.

          Would you go to page 14 please? - A. Yes.

          When you came into the ground last year, did you come through
          the same turnstile? - A. No, 'B' turnstile.

     3.    So you v/ere approaching the scene that we see ir. Photograph 14
          from somewhere just on the left-hand side of the photograph?
          - A. Yes.

          And as soon as you got into that open area, which Mr. Poole
          is very kindly showing us on the plan there, when you got
          through the turnstiles .... A. This is talking about
          Turnstile B . now we are talking about?

          When you got inside the area can you remember was it very
          crowded? - A. There would be a number of people there but
          not packed.

     Q.   Nothing like this year? - A. Ho.

     Q.   On your left you saw the line of Policemen across the
          entrance that we can just see on the left of the photograph?
          - A. I did; yes.

          Was there already a stream of people walking away in front
          of you or could you see where to go yourself? - A. There
          was people already.  They realised we could not go there.
          They were heading for the corner.

     Q. It was very obvious that you could not go down the tunnel,
        they were standing shoulder to shoulder? - A. Yes.

    Q. If you look at the photograph, in the distance do you see
       the furthest corner post of the structure underneath the
       asbestos sheeting in the far right-hand corner? - A. Yes.

    Q. Do you see the white notice board two-thirds of the way up
       the exposed part of the stanchion? — A. Yes.
B
    Q. That notice in fact as we know says "Standing" on it.      Did
       you in fact see that? - A. No.

    Q. Did you even notice it this year? - A. Mo.

    Q. But that is the corner to which you went simply because
       other people were walking there? - A. That was last year.
C
    Q. It was fairly obvious, was it? - A. It was obvious tnere
       was no room there and we were directed that way.   I should

       assumed that from there we could have gone to behir.c the
       coal but it seems that we could not due to the ....

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You thought thej e would be
         no dividing fences? - A. No, we knew there was pens there
D        but we thought the top end would be open.but it wasn't.

    Q.         MR. GLASGOW:  It is quite a common structure in
         football grounds that at the terraced open end that you
         can approach the terrace either through a central tunnel
         or through ways round the sides? - A. Yes.

    Q. And that is the sort of design that almost any experienced
       football supporter would expect, isn't it? - A. I would
       imagine so, yes.

    Q. The difference I think that you are drawing our attention
       to here is that you did not anticipate until you sav/ it
       the first year the vertical pen fences? - A. Yes.

               MR. GLASGOW:   Yes, thank you very much indeed.    Thanh
         you sir.
               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank vou.   That is all.   Thank
         you very much.

                 Examined bv MR. PHILLIPS:             I

You are Police Constable Philip Hooson?    Is that right' - A.
That is correct, sir.

There are one or two matters out of your statement I want to
ask you about, mr. Hooson.  You were on duty at the match, and
part of your duty was to go to the Midland Station, was it
not? - A. That is correct, sir.

With a serial of other Officers to meet supporters off the
trains? — A. That is correct.

These would be the ordinary service trains at the Midland
Station, and they were supporters from both Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest? - A.. That is correct, yes.

When the supporters came off the trains at the station did you
and the rest of your serial have some method ofsearching and
filtering the fans? - A. We did, sir, yes.

What did you do with regard to the football supporters? How
did you filter them? - A. What do you mean? How, phvsicaily
or now did the arrangement work?

Yes. - A. How would you like me to explain it to you.-' What I
am trying to say is when they arrived at the exit it was like
a matter of depending on the identification with whatever
scarf they were wearing or what ticket they had on them. The
Nottingham Forest went down to the bottom end of the train
station and the Liverpool fans went to the top side.

 So you separated them into two groups effectively at the
 ticket barrier? - A. More or less, yes, sir.

 When you got them into the appropriate group what aid you
 do? Did you search each one? - A. No.  My serial did not
 search each o n e .
        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   How did you get them into the same
 group? I can see it if they are obviously wearing colours of
 the club, but otherwise what do you do? Liverpool on the
 left Nottingham on the right? How did you separate them off?
 - A . ’ That is basically it, sir.  British Transport Police,
 they have all the information as regards what trains what fans
 were using and which platform they were going to arrive at.
 and they basically did the segregation prior to them arriving
                                                           P. HOOSON


         to us   We just continued it, ensuring that the Nottingham
         Forest fans went down to their collection point and the
         Liverpool fans went to theirs, basically speaking.

G             MR. PHILLIPS:    So the Liverpool trains and the
         Nottingham trains arrived at different times, did they.' - «.
         As far as I am aware.
O        And you would get a batch of supporters all from the Liverpool
         train and another batch from the Nottingham train.' - A. That
         is right, sir.
o         Were vou concerned to know whether the people who came througn
          ■che barriers had tickets for the match? - A. What we aia wnen
          thev came through and if we had identified them as tootball
          supporters, we asked them where they were going. Our
          instructions were not to allow them into the city centre, so
          we searched them for a ticket, and 11 tney haa a ticket,
          dependent whether they came from Liverpool or Nottingnam.
          determined which end of the platform we sent them to.

Q         You say you searched them for a ticket.  Does that mean you
          searched everyone who appeared to be a tootball supporter tor
          a ticket? - A. Basically, yes, sir.

    G.     —    L&RI)'?"jtfSTiCE TAYLOR ; -' That ^really---means that those ,who   ^
          came without tickets had the advantage of going into the town
          that those who came with tickets did not have.' - A. That is
          it, basically, sir.
               MR PHILLIPS:     And it was only those with tickets you
    G.
          sent along to the buses that were going to the ground? - A.
          That is it, sir.  As far as I can remember, yes.

    Q       So if a person had said to    you he    wasgoing to the match but
           had not got a ticket with him you would not let him get on the
           bus? - A. If a person what, sir?

           Said that he was going to the football match but did not have
    Q
           a ticket with him when you searched him. you would not let him
           so to the appropriate bus to go to the ground? - A. I do n ’t
           know, sir.  I did not particularly come across that prooiem
           that I can remember.
    Q.     All of those who came.... - A. As far       as I can recollect, yes.

    0      Then I think you and your serial went off to the ground after
           you had finished dealing with the arrival 01 supporters at the
           station? — A. That is right, sir.
           And the bus you went on travelled along Middlewood Road, past
     Q.
           Hillsborough Park and down Leppings Lane from the Catch Bar
           Lane end? - A. That is right, sir.

     G.
           I think you had a journey along Leppings Lane. What time
           would it be when you were going down Leppings Lane.' - A.
           Roughly speaking it would be 20-to-3, quarter-to-3, rougnly.
                                                        P. HOOSON



About quarter—to— 3? — A. Roughly speaking, yes.

And how was your journey down Leppings Lane? - A. it was very
slow because there were quite a lot of people down there.

What sort of bus was it you were in? - A. A double decker.

A South Yorkshire Transport busr” - A. That is right, sir.

Had that bus been held up at the Catch Bar Lane end for any
time? - A. What do you mean by the Catch Bar Lane endv

At the Catch Bar Lane end of Leppings Lane.   We have heard
some evidence that there was a line of three buses held up by
a Police serial, and was eventually let down Leppings Lane' -
   j-£ did stop, sir, but the exact location I am not sure.
It was in Leppings Lane.
    you previously attended at football Semi-Finals at this
ground? - A. Yes. one or two over the years.

How did you consider the people in Leppings Lane;’

           MR. WOODWARD:     Sir, I do apologise for rising and
 int err up tin 0 -'but it -is-^.in rel^t-iQOptP /Mr_._^,i:3 ncl0 X'scn. ^.Tne _
 p u r p o s e of calling -him first this morning is that his
 attendance is required urgently elsewhere in relation to some
 matters that are happening in Barnsley.             Might he be released.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I was about to take an opportunity
 of saying that, because I have found what I wanted, which was
 something which confirmed what he had to say.  So I don’t
 think I need to ask him anything further about it.

      MR. WOODWARD:   He will be available should later
 information be required from him, but his attendance is
 required urgently elsewhere, sir.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Yes, he is free to go.

      MR PHILLIPS:    Did the situation in Leppings Lane seem
 to you to be unusual? - A. It did inasmuch that there were
 quite a lot of people there which I thought for that time 01
 day.
 And your bus had some trouble getting down Leppings Lane, did
 it? _ a . We did, sir. We had to travel very slowly.

 Were   the fans out on the road then as well as on the pavement?
 - A    From the Leppings Lane they were both sides, but in tne
 main   at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, but they were walking
 down   the road towards the turnstiles.

  2 think you. went to the gymnasium as you were expected to do
  and got there at about 5 -minutes-to- 3 ? - A. That would be
  approximately.

                    G. And you were to be kept in reserve in the gymnasium? -             a   . That
                       is right, sir.

                    G. For further duties if, required. You then got orders to go to
                       the Leppings Lane stand? - A. To the West Stand, yes, sir.

                    G. And did you go in fact on the pitch side or at the back of the
                B      North Stand? - A. We went on the pitch side, sir, on the
                       track.

                    G. What did you see as you were walking towards the stand? - A.
                       As I was walking up towards it I saw the ground was full, and
                       we neared the West Stand I could see that the West Stand was
                       quite full, but the section to the right as you walk towards
                       it did not seem quite as full.

                    Q. When talking about the West Stand I think we should say the
                       terraces, the Leppings Lane terraces, rather than the Stand.
                       The section to the extreme right you say was not very full? -
                       A. It did not appear to be so.

                    G.    Where did you     see the biggest concentration ofpeople? -A.
                         The most of the stadium appeared full, but to direct it

                    Q.    Did you come to gate 4? - A. I did, sir, yes.

                    Q.    Was that gate     open or closed when you got there?-A.         It was
                         ^closed, sir.

                         going on?

                    G.         MR. PHILLIPS:   What time was it when you got to or were
                         approaching gate 4? - A. I would not be quite sure to give you
                         an exact time.   As far as i can remember it was before 3
                         o ’clock, before the kick-off, because the players were warming
                         up on the pitch as we walked into the stadium.

                    Q. Did you see anything that happened on the pitch after you got
                       to the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. On the pitch, sir?

                    G. Yes? - A. No, not on the pitch.

                    G. You don't know whether the game had started or how long                it
                       went on? - A. Absolutely no idea, sir.

                    G. You say gate 4 was closed?          - A. That is right, sir.

                    G. What did you see in pen 4?   - A. I saw that there wasquite a
                       number of people crushed up to the fencing.    They seemed to be
                H      in quite a desperate situation.

                      Q. Thar, of course, would be the first of the two centre pens you
                         came to? - A. That is right, sir.

                      Q. Were there other Officers on duty outside pen 4? - a . As I
                         walked on the track as I can remember there were three Police
                         Officers standing on the track.

                      Q. Were they conscious or appear to be conscious of what was
                  B      going on in pen 4 ? - A. I c a n ’t say, sir. I really don’t
                         know.

                      G. Were they looking towards pen 4 or out towards the pitch? - A.
                         As far as I can remember they were not looking towards the
                         pitch.

                      G. When you got to pen a you found the gate closed, you saw
                         people crushed up against the fence. Did you take the
                         opportunity of looking along towards pen 3? -A. Not that I can
                         remember, sir.

                      G.   You c a n ’t say whether No. 3 gate was open or not? - A. What I
                           can say to you. when I walked on that track towards pen 4
                           there were no gates open.
                  D
                      G. None at all? - A. None at all, sir.

                      G. Were there spectators on the perimeter track? - A. no. sir.

                      G.   None at all? - A.   None atall. sir.

                      Q. What did you do then when you saw what you did see in pen 4 ? -
                         A. What I did. I realised there was something desperately
                         wrong, and of course understanding that the orders are that
                         nobody goes on to the track, I had to decide to openthe gate.
                         I told the Police Officer     there - I have no idea whohe is -
                         to inform the control room that we will need some assistance
                         and we would open the gate, and then I went and opened the
                         gate.

                      G. I think you debated a bit with yourself, did you, before doing
                         so? - A. I think so, sir, yes.

                      G. And we have the views or the thoughts you had in your
                         statement? - A. That is right, sir.

                      G.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     What was the thought? - A. I
                           think, "If I ’m wrong I ’m going to get a right bollocking for
                           this” .

                      G.       MR. PHILLIPS:    That tends to suggest that you had had it
                           clearly drummed into you not to open these gates.  Is that
                           right? - A. It is, sir.  Over the years of attending football
                           matches the practice is that nobody goes on to the track
                           except in exceptional circumstances, i.e. they are under
                           arrest or they are ill or in the wrong part of the football
                  H        stadium and consequently would be escorted to where they
                           wanted to go or taken to the Police room or whatever.

                             Basically they are not allowed freedom of movement on to the

                             Was that something that had been told to you that very day or
                             something you had heard previously? - A. It is something that
                             you know which is drummed into you, as you suggested, over the
                             years.   It is not something I was aware of-being told on that

                           I don't know, sir.  I did not necessarily wait for him.

                        O. We   heard evidence from a Constable Illingworth who said that
                           he   was the one who opened gate 4. Could you comment on that.
                           Do   you know him? - A. I have no idea, sir. I don't know who
                           he   is.

                        Q.   He would have been in position already before you arrived? -
                             A. I have no idea. sir.  I d o n ’t know who he is.

                    D   Q.   You did open the gate, did you? - A. I did, sir, yes.

                        G.   What did you do? What was the effect of opening the sate? -
                             A. I -opened the gate .and the. people who were., be hind .did not.,
                             move.   They were squashed and crushed, so much so that they
                             could not move.

                        Q .7 They could not get out through the gateway? - A. That is
                             right, sir.

 When you opened the gate did you have any difficulty
 opening it? - A. No, I had no difficulty.

 It did not spring open?- A. I mean, not that I can
 remember.  I just grabbed the gate, opened the gate,
 pulled it open and that is it. Whether there was any
 pressure behind it or not I did not recogn-ise it as
 such.

 Were you able to get any of the people out of the pen’
 - A. Yes.

 And did that seem to do any good? - A. Well, as soon as y
 pulled one out there was another one to take their place.
 It did not matter - it seemed at the time, initially, no
 matter how many you pulled out, and each one took a great
 deal of effort, there was another one to take their place

 The people you pulled out, did they appear to be to vou
 either injured or in physical distress? - A. Oh, yes', sir
 they were very distressed.

 Did they appear to be injured? - A. There were some app­
 eared to be injured.

? The^T^eB^yQuv-tflisk^QH^.weire'ablev to waifcaoac^once yoii--4i3d-
  extracted them.-from the., gateway, were they? - A. Yes
  Some ran off.

  Some ran off.   You of course had other Officers with vou
’ did not you? - A. That is right, sir.                 ' 5

 How many of you altogether do you think there were trying
 to get people out? - A. Well, initially there would be
 myself, P.C. Akred and Sergeant Swift, as far as I can
 remember. I was not taking particular notice at the time
 who was there.  Of course, as time went by

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR;        Sorry.  There was yourself,
 P.C. Akred and .... - A            Sergeant Swift, sir.

Swift. - A. And consequently we were joined by other
 Officers as time went by.

       MR. PHILLIPS:  And you three, I suppose, would be al
 busily engaged at the gateway itself?- A. Initially, sir,
 y es.

There would not really be much room for other Officers to
help there, would there? - A. No, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Were you all part of the same
serial? - A. That is correct.

      MR. PHILLIPS:      Were other efforts being made to get
                             22


                                                      P. HOOSON

     people out of that pen that you were aware of? - A. As
     time went by, from what I can recollect, Police Officers
     were trying to pull the fencing down with their hands and
     drag people out as best they could.

Q. You were not one of those? - A. No, sir.

Q. You stayed at the gateway, did you, for some time? - A. I
   stayed there.

Q. Can I just go back to one matter that I should have asked
   you about? When you got to the pen in the first place did
   you hear anything from the crowd itself? - A. Well,
   initially, it was just a lot of noise, a real lot of
   noise, that is not unusual for a match this size, you do
   not particularly take notice of, not knowing anything was
   wrong at this time.  But as I neared pen 4 it became°
   apparent these people were shouting and screaming and
   they were screaming for help.

Q. For help? - A. That is right,     sir.

Q. Can you remember anything that was said or is it impossible
   - A. It is difficult, sir.  It is difficult.

Q.    They 'clearly'wanted to get out -of where theywere? - A.
     Clearly.

Q. And then I think you have given us in your statement some
    examples of particular people that you helped to get out
  / of the pen.   I think there was one person with a broken
    arm, was there? - A. That     is right, sir.

Q.   This was a young boy? - A. About 16 I think he     was.

Q. How did you manage to get him out? - A. He seemed to have
   managed to pull himself up above other people and he was
   shouting to us. We leaned over, just grabbed over and
   dragged him out.

0. When you say leaned over do you mean over the top of the
   fence or through the gateway? - A. No, through thegate*;ay.
   Had to hold on to the side of the gate to grab hold of
   him ....

Q. Were the people then in the gateway standing up or were
   they on the ground? - A. They were standing up, sir, well,
   in a fashion.  They were not erect, as such, but standing,
   sir.

Q. From your position which was perhaps the closest into the
   pen that we have seen did you see any people on the ground?
   - A. There were some on the ground in front of the gate,
   sir.

                                                             P. HOOSON


Q. In front of the gate?- A. Yes.

Q        They would of course be difficult to see when you were at
        first taking peopleout, would not they? - A. They would,
        sir, yes.

Q.      Did you get to them eventually? - A.       We did,   sir.

Q.      Can you give us any idea how many people there were like
        that? - A. On the ground?

Q.      Yes. - A. From what I can remember,       probably four or five.

Q.      Four or five. - A. Yes.      They were,   kind of, stuck at the
        gate.

Q. Stuck at the gate. - A. On the floor, yes.

Q. All in the close proximity of the gate? - A. At that time,
   yes, sir.
Q       Did you see any way in which the pressure on these people
        at the front could be relieved? -A. The only way I could
        see it at that time was to perhaps get a serial into the
        back of this stand to start pulling people out from the
        back -tQ^.mi.k^ .t^^people a| the front^ or near the front   ^
        move back and relieve pressure ....                    - : •

Q.Did vou do anything about that? -          A. From what I can
     remember, there was an Inspector        present but at the
  :• time everything was very confused       and I cannot remember
    who it was.   No idea who it was.        And I asked him to get
     a serial in the back and do this.

 Q. Yes.  Were you able to observe from where you were any
    Officers getting into the back of the terrace? - A. Yes,
    sir.
    Q. Did they go into theback of the terrace? - A.          From what
       I can remember, they did go in the back end of         the
       terrace eventually.

    Q. And did that relieve some of the pressure that therewas
       at the front? - A. Eventually it did, when they had to work
       their way through these people.

    Q   How long do you say it was really before the pressure was
        relieved sufficiently for people to get out under their own
        steam?- A. It is hard to say.  Could be 20 minutes.

    0. As long as 20 minutes? - A. It is hard to say, sir.               Could
       be totally incorrect on my estimation.

    0. And that is starting from just before the match kicked off?
       - A. That is right, sir.
                                                    P. HOOSON

Yes. And then I think you went away from the gate and did
a lot to help those who had beentaken out on tothe Ditch?
- A. That   is right, sir.                          F

To see if   you could assist, along with many otherpeople?
- A. That   is right, sir.

     MR. PHILLIPS:      Yes.   Thank you very much.

                Cross-examined by HR. HYTNER:

In view of the thoughts you had to yourself on the dav I
can keep my questions very short.   The reason that you
thought you might get a bollocking if you made a mistake
is that the whole of your training was to the effect that
those gates were meant for Police use, to get somebodv out
who was under arrest or to allow a Policeman into the'
terrace to make an arrest or do something of that sort
- A. That is right, is it? - A. That is the basic under­
standing, sir.

Yes.  The one thing you were never trained in relation
to the gates was that they might be for use to get fans
out who were under pressure through crowd trouble, through
crowd pressure?- A. Well, it is not a matter of training
It is a matter of utilising what you have got at the f'Sfe
sir.    ' -*              - • - •: • •                     5

Common sense.     That is what you did. - A. Yes.

It was not due to anything that you had been taught? -A.
No, sir, it is common sense.

The next thing is this.  Going back in time, if I may.
Coming up Leppings Lane from Catch Bar Lane you were in
a prime position to see the back of the crowd that was
pressing into the turnstile area? - A. That is right, sir.

You skirted the     back of that crowd?- A. That is right, sir.

And there were still people coming down and up Leppin»s Lane
to join that throng?   - A. That is right, sir.      °

And all you saw, the   impression that you had,  havingyour
bus skirting just the edge of that mob or press, was of a
press of people, a mass of people, simply trying to get
into a football ground?- A. That is basically it, sir.

Nothing more.    Nothing less? - A. That is it, sir.

And coming forward in time again, can you tell us because
it may be important when you made your statement that we
are now going from?    Do you remember how soon  after the
incident?- A. It would be - the disaster happened onthe
                                                   P. HOOSON

Saturday, returned to work on the Monday, returned on night
- it would be some time during that week.

You see, the importance is this, that many things that are said
 now about what the Police should have done it may be said,
 well, this is all with the benefit of hindsight.       It was
 at the very time of this tragedy that you appreciated that
 it was no good asking people at the front of the terrace
 to push back, you needed a serial at the back to pull
 people backwards at the back? - A. That is how I saw it.

You actually made that suggestion to a Superior Officer at
the time? - A. That is correct, sir.

       MR. HYTNER:    Thank you.

              Cross-examined by MR. JACKSON:

Two matters, Mr. Hooson.      Would you look at this photo­
graph, please?

       MR. JACKSON:   My Lord, it is not one that is before
you:

Perhaps before I ask you questions would you hand it to
My                                   going ,to_ajsK .concer.n

densities of pens 6 and 7 and pens 3 and 4.

     MR. JACKSON:   This is the first witness, My Lord,
who has come from that side of the ground.  All the
others have come .... Each of my friends has seen the
photograph.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Sorry.   This is the first
witness who has come from?

       MR. JACKSON:    Has approached it that way round.

       MR. COLLINS:   That is not correct.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I do not think that is right.

     MR. COLLINS:   We have had about half-a-dozen who
came from that ....

       MR. JACKSON:    Since I had the photograph.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Since you had the photograph.

       MR. COLLINS:    Oh, since you had the photograph.

       MR. JACKSON:    I understand each of my friends has
                                                               P. HOOSON

       MR. COLLINS:             I have not.

       MR. WOODWARD:             Thatis not right.        I have notseen it.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I will pass it to you in a
moment, Mr. Woodward.  Is this, by any chance, one of a
series that appeared in the Liverpool evening paper?

       MR. JACKSON:             Yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I remember seeing.                   Taken by a
fan in the stand, is that right?

     MR. JACKSON:   I understand it to be from the paper
itself.  There are a number of other amateur photographers.
I understand this is the Liverpool evening paper.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:              Yes, I see.

        MR. JACKSON:              Iam told it is The Echo.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            That is an evening paper, is it?

        MR. JACKSON:_ I understand so.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            Was that on "the Friday after?

       MR. JACKSON:    I am receiving, as it were, information
  from my side.  I have the sequence. This is the earliest.
' I apologise to those of my learned friends who have not
  seen it.  I did think the ....

        LORD JUSTICE            TAYLOR: There is only one copy, is there?

      MR.   JACKSON: At this stage there are negatives and
 smaller copies available.

        MR.. COLLINS:           Does not appear to be timed.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:             It is.   2.59.

        MR.     COLLINS: I did         not see that./

      MR.  JACKSON: Yes.   As far as we can gather the match
 kicked off some 25 seconds before 3 o'clock.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:               Just see the goalkeeper on the
 left edge.

      MR. JACKSON:    Mr. Hooson, I want to ask you three
 questions about that. You told us when you arrived that
 there w e % no people on the track.
                                              P. HOOSON

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Sorry. Just forgive me a moment.
Has everybody not seen it? I think it should go along the
line iust before you go any further.  Then hope to get
another copy.   (Photograph shown)   I do not think either
of the Assessors have had a chance to see it yet either.

     MR. WOODWARD:   There is a timing on it, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes.    If I remember there is     a
whole series with the time on.

     MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Hooson, clearly, looking at things
from different angles can give different impressions, but
there we see a photograph that rather strikingly reveals
the difference in density between the pens on the extreme
right and the pens in the centre. Having seen what you
saw. does that photograph reflect the difference that you
perceived? — A. Basically ....

In fairness to all other witnesses, does that exaggerate
that which you saw or does it reflect pretty accurately
the difference between the two? - A. Well, when you are
stood on the ground you are looking at it from_different
angles.  You obviously get a different impression.

That is why I asked the question. - A. What I perceived
when I approached the West Stand was simply, that these
side pens did not seem as full as the centre pen's.

May I then move on to the next point?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I just wonder whether, because
we have seen something of the same on these photographs,
looking at these photographs one wondered whether part
of the°visual effect may be due to shadow and sun on the
front part and shadow further back but I am not sure. I
merely*raise that point for consideration.

                        Q.       HR. JACKSON: Sir, my u nd e rs tan di ng of the photograph
                             and my consideration of it came to the conclusion that the
                             shades between the front and the rear half of the fence was
                             not to be taken into consideration.        That seemed to me to
                             be the sum of it but that is only my assessment of it.         I
                             was relying only on the clear spaces in pen six and seven.

                                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes.

                B       q.       MR. JACKSON: May I n ext ask you about your evidence
                             when you said when you first arrived on the track there did
                             not appear to be any people.   Clearly on any track there are
                             a number of people, Police Officers. A. The usual personnel
                             Police Officers.

                        Q.   If we look at that p ho to gr ap h we see it timed at 1459 and
                             perhaps importantly we see gates three, four, and five, are
                             all open.  That means you must have arrived on the track
                             before that. A. Yes, Sir.

                        Q.   So that we can time your arrival prior to 2.49. A. Yes,
                             Sir .

                        Q.   And your ability to see what you saw. A. Yes,         Sir.

                             May I now move back some four or five hours to the railway
                        -•   station,' May,;I .preface mj qu-estion: by. emphasizing, I do not.
                             criticize at a 1'1 "biit I wonder w h y p e o“pTe are', prevented from'
                             going where they want to go and with what power.             If someone
                             takes an early train to Sheffield with a match ticket and
                             arrives in Sheffield at about 11 o'clock with what power do
                             you compel him to go to the ground? A. I am unable to answer
                             that.

                        Q.   Is it the position that he is taken to the area of the ground
                             and released? A. That is it.

                        Q.   I use the word deliberately.  Is he in fact in police
                             custody effectively from his arrival at the station to the
                             ground? A. That is a strong word to use but basically I
                             would say that.  He is under our control and direction.

                        Q.   May I say that events in the past have well justified a
                             great deal of control being extended.             In the future there
                             may be r e co mm en da t i o n s , I merely want to ask what went on
                             and not to criticize.             It is the position, for very good
                             reason, that these young men are effectively in c u s t o d y ?
                             A. That is right.

                        Q.   Ironically, as my Lord pointed out, if you claim to have no
                             ticket you could go into Sheffield centre. A. Basically,

                        Q.   Approximately around 11?        A.   It would be around that roughly.

    Cross-examined by MR. MULLER

Two minor matters, officer.  I want you to see if you can
help us a little about the position at gate four when you
had opened the gates, do you follow?  I think that you said
in your statement that eventually you assisted in hundreds
of people being taken out. A. That is right, Sir.

You cannot put a more precise figure on it than that?
A. There was a lot, Sir.

It may be very difficult for you to recall precisely but
you mentioned that there were four or five people on
the floor at the gate. A. That is right, Sir.

I ask you about that because in your statement you refer
specifically to two men being on the floor. A. Yes, Sir.

What is the position, is it two, or what is the position,
can you help us? A. This is like over a period of time.

When you first got there. A. When we first got there I
did not particularly look.            I just saw what was in front
of me but what I can recollect is during the time that we
stood at the gate whilst we managed to pull people out
from the bottom —       you see sometimes some people crawled
or cianSgfid l;o--get o n7~t li i i ..haods snci kngss to -try c c°^   ■
to the gate.      That is the best way I can explain to you:
and so they would appear all the time.              They would not
be   there all at once.

It  would not be a question of people jamming the bottom
of   the gate, it was a question of people crawling to that
position? A. They would appear there     and we would take
them out as best we could, Sir.

     Cross-examined    by MR.   GLASGOW

 Do you know that the situation that we see in the photograph
 at  1459 occurred before you arrived? A. You are saying that
 that occurred before I arrived?

 I am asking you.    A. No,   Sir,   it did not occur before I
 arrived .

 At the time when you arrived you had the impression that
 there were no spectators on the perimeter area. A. That
 is right, on the track.

 But there were some police officers, were there? A. That
 is right, three as best as I can recall.

 You are quite sure     that all the gates were shut? A. I am
 sure, Sir.

 Have you seen the video that has been compiled?

                   A         A. I have seen a video, Sir.

                             One that shows a compilation of different shots from different
                       Q.
                             angles, some in black and white and some in colour? A. That
                             is the one.

                       Q.    I think that there is probably only one of those.  We can
                             see, and perhaps I can remind you, that at the time when
                   B         this photograph was taken to the closest minute, at 1459,
                             we can see a stream of orderly people walking along the
                             perimeter and being shown into gate one. A. That is probably
                             how it was to begin with.  I cannot say, I was not looking
                             at people, basically.

                       Q.    No, but the first people who were allowed out of the gates
                             we'know walked perfectly normally along the front of the
                             perimeter gates and were shown into gate one. A. I do not
                             know where they went, Sir, but they did walk.

                       Q.    It appears that there must have come a time when all those
                             three gates that we see there open were sut again.           Can you
                             help us on that? A. No, Sir, I cannot.           All I can say to you
                             is that when I went on that track, which was before three
                             o'clock, all the gates were closed and there was no-one on
                   D         the track.          When I opened the gate I stayed there until
                             the 'p,e.n(.'.W3S.. empty;,, o.r thereabouts . _

                       Q.    When you opened the gate'there was no question of people
                             walking our normally and in an orderly stream  A. No.

                        Q. ; By that stage they were already in acute distress                A. That
                             is right.

                        Q.   Thank    you v e r y   much.

                        Q.   One matter only, officer.  Do I understand that as soon
                             as you cane in sight of the West Terrace you took in at
                             a glance that the centre was full but there was room at
                             the ends? A. It was not at a glance as such, it was as I
                             was walking along past the North Stand.

                        Q.    That did not require any detailed observation, it was
                              obvious to your eyes.  A. It appeared to be full, yes.

                        Q.    In the centre?        A. Yes.

                        Q.    With room at the ends?          A.   In the corner ends it did not seem
                              as full .

the North S t a n d ,beca us e that was the route you took,
were you first in line or were other officers preceding
you? A. There was P.C. Packer in front of me and I think
Sergeant Swift was in front of me as well at that time.

You think?   A. That   is right.

Where were you going, what was your destination? A. To
the track in front of the West Stand.

At that time were the team already out on the pitch? A. They
ygre out on the pitch warming up.

This would be the second warm-up, the immediately before
kick-off warm-up, would it? A. P o s s i b l y , I do not know.

The goal area at each end is an area where photographers
gather? A. Usually at a football match.

There are a number of individuals that one might expect to
be between the perim e te r fence and the back of the goal?
A . That is r i g h t , Sir .

Certainly at that sort of time.   As you walked towards the
West Stand end where were you when you first appreciated
that something might not be right? A. Actually walking on
the track in "front of the West Stand itself.

 It was not until you got up to the West Stand that anything
 struck you? A. That is right.

 In the course of the events of that afternoon is it right
 that there was a time when minutes hung and seemed like hours
 and other times when you looked at your watch and time had
 sped by? A. I did not look at my watch at all.

 Did you have an imp re s si on that times became confused? A. I
 have no concept of time whilst I was there.      It was only when
 we had been relieved and sat down that we appreciated
 that time had passed.

 There were already offic er s in the area of the gate that you
 have described opening? A. Yes, Sir.    There were three
 officers who were spread out on the track as far as I can
 remember.

 You cannot recall who they were, you do not know them?
 A. No, Sir, I do not know them.

 You are quite clear, are you, that you opened the gate?
 A. Sir, with respe ct that gate was shut and I opened that
 gate .

  Someone must have caused it to be opned but in the evidence
  that    have heard in this I n q u i r y , for example in relation

                                  the first down there, they were the only ones who were
                                  doing things.  Do you follow? A. I know, Sir.

                                  But your recollecti o n is clear of opening the gate?
                        Q.
                                  A. Absolutely.

                                  That is before              the kick-off? A. Before the kick-off,       Sir..
                B Q.
                                  From the moment that you opened it would it be right to say
                        Q.        that you were more or less by it? A. That is right.

                                  Until you had got out of that pen as many people as you
                        Q.
                                  could help? A. That is right.

                                  That would extend from some time before the kick-off to some
                        Q.        long time after the game had stopped? A. Yes.
   6
                                  Is it your recolle c t i o n that throughout that time the gate
                        Q.        in question remain ed open? A. It did, yes.

                                  As you had been walking along in front of the North Stand to
                        Q.        the West Stand are you aware of whether there had been^
                    D             or were any specta to rs walking along the front of the West
                                  Stand to go towards gate one? A. We were not aware of that,
                                   no .   ~ : - r':"

                                   You are not saying that was not happening? A. I am not saying
                                   that was not the case.  I am simply saying I do not remember
                                   seeing anyone .

                                   And if your evide nc e is correct and you have done your best
                                   to recall it from the moment that you perceived any problem
                                   you gave help by opening the gate and did all that you
                                   could until the problem in the pen had been resolved? A. That
                                   is right , S i r .

                                   When  you opened the gate first of all it is           i1: ’
                                   that people did not come flooding out of it. A. No, bir,
                                   they could n o t .

                                   They were           just    jammed   there? A. That is right.
                         Q.
                                   What   you had         to do was to get? A. Physically pull them out.
                         Q.
                             Q.    To drag them out? A. Yes.

                                    And     that is what you then occupied yourself                in doing for
                             Q.
                                    the     rest of that period? A. That is right.

                                    If what you   say is right as you approached the West Stand
                             Q.     you   did not see any gate open until you actually opened
                                    gate four? A. That is right.

                                                                    /Q.      You were the first,   so far as

                        Q. You were the first, so far as you recall it, to open any
                           gate?   A.   That's right, sir.

                        Q. Can you help as to w h eth er or not there was anybody by
                           Gate 3 at that time or do you just not recall?      A.    When
                           I got t o      As far as I can remember, when I got to
                           Gate 3 ---
               B        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Gate 3?    A. Gate 4, I am sorry.
                             P.C. Packer would be in front of me.    I    understand that
                             he went to Gate 3.    I couldn't say whether it was open or
                             closed.

                        Q.        MR. WOODWARD:     It would seem, from    what you have
                             described, by the time you got to Gate 4 Mr. Swift and
                C            Mr. Packer had already gone ahead of you.    A.   No, sir.
                             P.C. Packer had.   Sergeant Swift was by this time behind
                             me and I was accomp an ie d by P.C. Akred.

                        Q.   If we look at Photograph DB 17/14 in the South Yorkshire
                             Composite 2, there is a photograph fourth in the bundle
                             and in the backgrou nd one can see the advertising hoardings
                             for Henry Boots and Howarth Timber and a gate open - bottom
                D            right foreground.    A.   That's right, sir.

                        Q. And there are two Officers at least in that picture that
                           can be seen to the right.   Is that Sergeant Swift?
                           A.  That is Sergeant Swift.

                        Q. Do you recognise anybody        else there?      A.   And myself.

                    E   Q. Which one is you, b e c a u s e A.  I am bending down, sir.
                           My hair was slightly longer than it is now.

                        Q. You are bending   down?     A.      I am bending down at that point,
                           there.

                        Q.        LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:    Just in front of the figure in
                             the corner?   A.     That's right, sir.

                        Q.        MR. WOODWARD:    You recognise your helmet, do you?
                             A.   No, sir.    Sergeant Swift is the Sergeant with no hair.
                             That is Sergeant Swift.    But, yes, basically I recognise
                             my hsir.   It was quite a bit longer than it is now.

                        Q.   To his left or to his right?        A.      I am at his right.

                G       Q.   It may be you have got a slightly different print from
                             ours.   It is a different print from mine.    Yes, your hair
                             is longer.   So you were then occupied in dealing with
                             people at that gate throughout that time?   A.    That's
                             right, sir.

                        Q. You are quite sure that it was you that opened the gate,
                           are you?   A.   I am ab so lu te ly positive, sir.

     prior to my arrival and did what he did ---

Q.    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           That is what I was going to         ask
     you.   A.    I can't say,    sir.

Q. You were walking round the pitch, I take it, along the front
   of the North Stand?   A.   That's correct, my Lord.

Q. Can you say whether there were any people being shepherded
   along the front as you were doing that?   A.   I can't
   re c o l l e c t .

Q.     But by the time you got to the track in front   of the West
     terrace, there were not spectators out on the track?
     A.    No, sir, not at that stage.     Whether this has happened
     prior to me going there, I can't say.     I can only say what
     happened when I got there.

Q.            MR. WOODWARD: But it is likely, is it not, if as you
     walked along the front of the North Stand to go to the West
     Stand you had seen a gate in the perimeter fence open and
     a number of people come out, that is something you would
     have remarked upon because of your training?     A.   That's
     r i g h t , sir.

Q. And if it had happened .before your eyes, you are likely to
   have rem!e~mberr e*d-     ' -Yes , .s £ f i ' v-:-.-.. :.l~: - ; . - - _* •   v

          MR. HYTNER:   Sir, may I just say, before we go further,
     there seems to be a lot of difficulty encountered by people
     in relation to this.  Can I just say there has, of course,
     also been evidence from Mr. Grobbelaar ---

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have        it in mind.       In fact,
     I was about to ask a qiestion.

          MR. HYTNER:   Mr. Collins at some stage indicated that
     he might be actually going to submit that Mr. Grobbelaar
     was wrong.   Can I just say so there is no mystery so far
     as Mr. Woodward is concerned that I shall be making submissions
     based on the proposition that the evidence seems to suggest
     that Gate 4 at any rate was opened and shut, opened and shut,
     and that is consistent with all witnesses and it is also
     consistent with the evidence that we have heard very little
     of, for obvious reasons, that some fans were actually pushed
     back into the terraces once they had got out of the gate
     on to the pitch.

          LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:      Well,   Mr.   Hytner,   this is an
     address.

          MR. HYTNER:   No, it is not an address.   I am simply
     indicating what line I am taking in fairness to Mr. Woodward
     so he can meet it in questions.

            MR. COLLINS:   Sir, I do not think I ever sought to say
     Mr.   Grobbelaar was wrong except as to his timings.

                              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:                                   The question I was going to put
                         to this witness:

               Q. You say, as I understand it, from the time that you opened
                  Gate 4, it remained open for at any rate 20 minutes or so
                  whilst you were getting people out,  is that right?
                  A.   That is correct.

         B     Q. Not shut at all in that time?                                             A.      Not shut at all.

               Q. So if it was opened at all other than by you it must have
                  been opened before you got to the front of the track, is
                  that right?   A.   That is correct.

               Q. Was there ever a stage when fans were coming out as if
                  the top had been taken off a Coca-Cola bottle?   A.    No,
                  sir, no.

               Q. You were having to peel them out?                                                A.    We were having to
                  prize them out.

                   Q. Did that continue right through or did there come a stage
                      at which the pressure being relieved, people were walking
                      out?   A.   Later on, sir, but we still had to pull them
         D                   out.

                   43, By that- time ;the players were well                                         off the.   pitch, 1imagine?:
                       A.   I cannot remember.     No idea.

                                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:                               Yes,        thank you.    Well,   no
                             bollocking!   Thanks.

                                             (MORNING SESSION)


                                    INSPECTOR GORDON SYKES Called

                 B                     Examined by MR. COLLINS:

                     Q. Inspector Gordon Sykes, is that right? - A. Yes sir.

                     Q. You I think were the Inspector in charge together with
                        Mr. Purdy of 16-19 inclusive? - A. Yes sir.

                     Q. Have you got Tab 14 of the larger Police bundle please which
                        is the Operation Order.  If you could find Serial 16 onwards
                        which is about a third of the way through, the page headed
   #                    "Sub-sector 8 Inspector Sykes/Inspector Purdy". Nov/ you
                        were in charge between you of four serials; three of them
                        had specific duties in relation to Turnstiles A-G, 1-8 and
                        9-16 respectively? - A. Yes sir.

                     Q. And the third was a sort of spare.  Is that right? - A. That
                 D      was to use as coach reception, any coaches or buses that
                        came to the ground and just general duties as directed by
                        me.

                     Q. Now all these Serials, were they to be located outside the
                         turnstiles? - A. Yes sir, to supervise the fans coning
                       , through.

                     Q. You were under the control of the Ground Coinmander, is that
                        correct, that is Superintendent Greenwood? - A. Yes sir.

                     Q. When you instructed the Serials, 16, 17 and 18 were to
   m                    "prevent unlawful access and ensure queues would be formed".
                        Is that correct? - A. Yes sir, queues insomuch that people
                        went to the correct turnstiles.

                     Q. Was it part of   their duty as you understood it to marshal
                        people so that  they should stand in queues or didn'tit go
                        as far as that? - A. No, on a maximum gate at Hillsborough
                        it is impossible to have formal queues at individual turn­
                        stiles.  It is just a general queue to the general turnstiles.

                     Q. So what actually is their function in relation to the duty
                        which says:  "ensure orderly queues are formed"? r„That
                        actually can they do? - A. Ensure that people go to the
                        correct turnstiles and they search them as they go through
                        as best they can and try and prevent crushing or whatever
                        at the turnstiles.

                              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  It may be my fault. Hr. Collins,
                        but I have not  quite homed in on this.  It is Serial 16?
             H

                                      G. SYKES


Q. Mr. Sykes, what I was just exploring with you was precisely
   what in the light of a full house expected, what actually
   your Officers could do in relation to ensuring orderly
   queues were formed? - A. Orderly queues are quite impossible.
   If you are talking about one or two people on a turnstile
   then on a gate of maximum capacity it is impossible.

Q. So when the Operation Order says:  "They will ensure orderly
   queues are formed", you might as well forget about those
   last words because they are completely unenforceable.  Is
   that right? - A. "Orderly queues" it means people going to
   the general turnstile area, which they would.

Q. So are you saying that the words in the Operation Order
   "And ensure orderly queues are formed" might as well not
   be there? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Is that something you told your superiors that it really
   was a pointless part of the Operation Order? - A. No sir,
   we just accepted the order.

Q. You just accepted the order but realised that it was wholly
   unenforceable? - A. Yes sir.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: That is at the best of times,
   is it? I mean even on a league game? - A. On a league game
   it depends on the away supporters that are attending.  If
   there is only 100/150 then there is absolutely no problem,
   you can form a queue, but with the layout of the ground and
 / the capacity it is impossible.

Q.         MR. COLLINS: What you are saying is if there is going
     to be a full house that particular instruction is pointless?
     - A. Yes sir.

Q. What about the "maintaining of order". What does that
   involve? - A. That involves ensuring that people approach
   the turnstiles as best they can with tickets; no missiles;
   no banners; people were not too drunk and in the Officers'
   estiination would not cause a problem on entering the ground.

Q. That is 16-18.   19 had, I think as you put it, a roving
   coiamission as it were? - A. Yes sir. There are coaches
   which get through the road blocks and so forth or from
   the coach reception. They stop at the turnstiles and
   they ensure that the people get off the coaches and- go
   into the ground.

Q. What about monitoring people.   I think you expected, did you
   not, that a certain number of fans would turn up having
   had drink? - A. Yes sir, from my experience of semi-final
   day it is more of a carnival day and people turn out in
   large numbers and have been drinking.

Q. Is that something you raised with your Serials? - A. Yes sir,
   I made that particular point to my Serials, that normally

                                                                 G. SYKES


                           at Hillsborough anyone who has been drinking or shows any
                           sign of intoxication is hot allowed into the ground. I
                           told them on this particular day that people would be
                           arriving under the influence ofdrink and that we would have
                           to relax the rules slightly and    that theywould have to   be
                           extremely drunk to the state ofnot being able to look
                    B      after themselves or likely to cause trouble before we refused
                           admission.

                        Q. I suppose also one of the problems is that if you arrest
                            people for whatever, you deplete your manpower? - A. That
                           is particularly the purpose as to why I gave them that
                           instruction, sir.

                    C   Q. Did you give   any instructions as to what they should do in
                           relation to    the people turning up without tickets if they
    #                      came across
                           turned a%vay
                                          them? - A. Yes sir, that the people would be
                                          from the area the best that we could.

                        Q. Did you tell your Officers if there was a problem with
                           people crowding in at the turnstiles it would be the use
                           of Police horses which would endeavour to deal with that?
                    D      - A. Yes sir, I have done that in the past on occasions
                           like this where there is crushing at the turnstiles and
                           we put Police horses in there to try and restrict the
                           flow. I told them if that occurred on this occasion that
                           is what I would endeavour to do.

                        Q. I think you also provided, did you not, large oust bin
                          , bags in order to receive cans of whatever, drink and so
                    E       on? - A. Yes sir, there were black polythene sacks and
                            dust bins outside the turnstiles to put banners, bottles,
                            cans of beer and spirits which people bring to the turn­
                            stile and they put them straight into the receptacles
                            provided.
    #
                        Q. Are you aware at one stage of a problem involving ticket
                           touts? - A. Yes sir. I received a radio message froa
                    F      Ground Control that ticket touts were in fact operating
                           in Leppings Lane. I have no idea where it was and there
                           were some CID Officers nearby and I asked them to patrol
                           Leppings Lane to see if they could identify the touts.

                        Q. The upshot was, I think, that you had one of them arrested
                           for obstruction? - A. Yes sir. v;hen I identified the tout
                           I caused P.C. Roberts one of my Officers to arrest the
                    G      tout -for obstructing the pavement.

Q.   That is, is it not, one of the major problems of ticket-
     touts, that they do cause obstruction and they also
     encourage people to dome without tickets in the hope of
     getting tickets?   A.   Yes, sir, that is true.

Q    Which adds to the Police problems,   and indeed everyone's
     problems at or around the grounds.     A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   The reason I am putting that is that, as you know, there
     are some quarters who seem to think ticket-touting is a
     good application of market forces.    You »tould disagree
     profoundly with that, I take it?   A.    Well, it may be
     to them, sir, but it is a problem to me, trying to police
     a football ground.

Q.   I think as time wore on we know tnat problems began to
     arise and that by half past two the situation had got
     such that there was really a crowd and virtually an
     unmanageable crowd outside the turnstiles;  is that a
     fair --- ?  A.   Yes, sir, a large crowd had built up
     at the turnstiles.

Q    Could you see how that happened or why that happened?
     A.   I could only ---   I saw -----   I had been to the
     ground earlier and I had seen people jumping over the
     turnstiles without paying.

Q. That is nothing new, is it?     A.   Well, I have not seen
  , it before at Hillsborough.    And also coming under the
    legs of people who were in the turnstile, so this was, in
    fact, causing the flow rate through the turnstiles to
    slow down.

Q. And you think that the flow rate partly contributed to
   the build-up?   A.   Yes, sir, that is the impression I
   got, that the build-up outside was originally caused by
   the slow rate through the turnstiles.

Q-    Before I come back to that, can I ask you about one
     specific matter?    I think at one stage you went, having
     ejected some fan who had got in without paying, from
     Gate C, you had a word with the gateman, that is the
     Club gateman, at Gate C?    A.   Yes, sir.

Q    And he asked you about some particular problem, did he
     not?   A.   Yes, sir.  There was a crowd of people outside,
     roughly 30 in number.

Q*   30?   A.   30, yes.  They were all claiming to be stewards
     from Liverpool Football Club.  They had passes showing
     that they were, in fact, stewards of the Club.   The
     Sheffield Wednesday steward informed me that they had
     allowed a certain number of stewards in.   I understand
     there is an agreement between clubs that they allow
     stewards free entry into the ground, but the numbers
     were such that he did not believe that all of these people
                                              G.   S Y KE S


were,   in fact,   stewards.   He suspected ---

He thought they were trying it on?   A.   He suspected
that people were going in with the passes, someone else
was bringing them out and taking other people in, and
he sought my advice.

And you advised him not to let them in?   A.   I told
him, I said, "Don't let anyone else in on those grounds."

We have heard evidence about thie state of the crush outside
from others and I imagine from what you saw you would
agree that it got to such a stage where the gates effectively
had to be opened?   A.   At that stage, when the gates
were opened, yes, sir, the crush was so bad.

Can you help us about this:   what was your impression
of the demeanour or the approach of the crowd outside?
1 appreciate I am asking you to be general and obviously
individuals vary but give us, if you can, by the time
the gates had to be opened your impression of the state
of mind, as it were, of the crowd outside.    A.   From
2 o'clock onwards, the crowd who were turning up at
t- o'clock, in fact, a lot of them had been drinking.
They were not fighting drunk.    I would more call it
silly or stupid drunk where they were not taking advice
or you were telling them to do something and they were
doing completely the opposite.    From that point onwards
when the crush built up it got worse and worse and the
attitudes were changing.    People were coming who were
even more drunk and obviously they were seeing the crush
and they were adding to it and it was just impossible
to stop it.

I think you saw Gate A opened and you saw Gate C opened?
A.   No, sir.   I only saw Gate A opened.

Because you were on that side,    were you?        A.         I was
on that side, near the shops.

You weTe outside at that point?   A.   Outside, yes, and
from Gate A the position I was, you could not see either
Gate B or Gate C.

I think you went through the gate when it had been opened
and you saw Sergeant Higgins inside and he explained, did he
not, that he had opened the gate because of the danger of
people being killed, as he thought, by the crush outside?
A.   Yes, sir.

I think after the crowd had cleared you went into the ground
through Gate C, is that right?   A.   Yes, sir.  That
was after the call went up for all Officers to go into the
ground.

Yes, and did you go, first of all, round to the playing
area itself?   A.   No, sir, I didn't get that far.
                                        G.   SYKES


Where did you go?   A.   I went to the Police Control Box
to see what they wanted me personally to do.

Did you   go up to the box?   A.Yes, sir.

Did you   speak to anyone there?  A.    No, I got to the
top of the steps and I saw what    was happening onthe field.
I realised it wasn't a normal pitch invasion and that
people at the back were pushing and still crushing, you
know, the people at the front.

Can you help us - e*n you remember whether the game was
still being played when you went up and were standing
on the Control Box platform?   A.   I can't say, sir.
I didn't look that far.   I looked ---   From the top of
the steps I could see straight down on the fencing and
people being crushed and being helped over the top.

So when    you were seeing what you saw, what did you decide
to do? Where did you go?    A.       I ran back round the back
of the West Stand and collected Officers who were still
coming in through the gates and we went through the central
tunnel under the West Stand

What was the purpose of that? A.To clear people from
the tunnel, from the terracing, so that we could stop the
crushing at the front and evacuate people.    At that stage
obviously I didn't know that people were, in fact, dead.

Were you the first Officers into the tunnel?         A.   I was
one of them, yes, sir.

You and the ones you collected together,     that is?
A.   Yes, sir.

When you got into the tunnel were people already coming out
injured or not?    A.   Not at that stage, sir.   They were,
in fact, still pressing forward trying to see what was
happening.    They were totally unaware of what was happening
at the front.

That was the problem, as I understand it - those at the
back did not appreciate what was happening at the front.
A.   Yes, sir.

And were still coming in effectively to look at the
game..  A.   Yes, sir.

Were people still coining in through the turnstiles at
this stage?   A.   I couldn't see.    I never noticed at
that stage, sir.   I run straight through into the tunnel.

Did it take you a bit of time to get people to appreciate
at the back that ycu wanted them out and why you wanted
them out?   A.   Yes.    At first they didn't realise what
was happening and we had to be firm with them and literally
push some of the first ones out.
                                              G.   S YKE S


Eventually did you get people to move out of the back?
A.   Yes, sir.   We cleared a way through to the people
who were trapped towards   thefront of the fencing.

Did you go down into Pen      3? A.    No, si?,    I went to the
left-hand pen, Pen 4.

The left-hand one,   Pen 4.   A.      Yes, sir.

Can you help us about this:   was it clear to you that
there were people injured in Pen 4, the pen you went
into?  —A.     Yes, sir, there were people injured in Pen4.

What about dead people, can you help?   A.   I couldn't
say at that stage.  All I could see - people crushed up
against the fence and I couldn't tell if they were dead
at that stage or not.

You, I think, helped to assist to try to get people out of
 Pen 4?   A.   Yes, sir. There were three   Police Officers
struggling with a young girl and I got hold of her and ___

I do not think we need go into specific detail.   All I am
concerned ---   A.   We took her back in, up through the
tunnel back into the concourse area behind the West Stand
sir.                  .                                   *

In fact, we know that a number of people were taken out
the back, some dead, some still alive, and ambulances
eventually began to come to outside Gate C.   A.   That is
true,  sir, yes.

You were conce rned at that end, as it were, were  you,
going backwards and forwards through the tunnel?
A.   Yes, sir.    Obviously I realised that there was a
major disaster on our hands and I organised the evacuation
through the back and the ambulance and so forth to come
into the sterile area at the side of the South Stand.

Can you confirm one matter, and that is that it was clear
to you that no-one had actually been injured or had died
in the tunnel itself?   A.   That is true, sir.  No-one
was actually injured in the tunnel that I saw when we
went through.

It was a question.of people being brought out from terraces
out through the back.   A.  All the people were dead or
injured in Leppings Lane where people had been brought
from the front of the terracing through the tunnel.

               Cross-examined byMR.     HYTNER:

Mr. Sykes, your view is that once you get a big crowd
at the Leppings Lane end you cannot form individual queues
from the turnstiles?   A.   Yes, sir, with the maximum gate
                                                 p


                                                                 G.   SYKES


                          it is impossible to form individual queues at a turnstile.

                       Q. Hay I immediately say, of course, that I am not challenging
                          that at all.    What I want to ask you is this:   you have
                          not any partic ular expertise that enables you to see that-
                          it is as plain as a pikestaff, is it not, to anyone looking
                          at the configuration-of the gates?     A.   Very difficult
                          to answer that, sir.     I can only give my view of what I
                          saw and what I know from past experience at the ground.

Q. W h e t h e r you are a genius or not the fact is it has been
   plain from experience of past games? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I think you say in your statement:

           "By 2.00 pm the build-up of the fans was such there
           was pushing and shoving at the turnstiles and
           build-up occurred of fans trying to get into the
           ground.

     Is that right? - A. Yes, sir.    By 2.00 pm, when I say
     "build-up" that is the normal expected build-up, an hour
     b efore the kick-off, when people would be arriving at the
     ground.

Q.    Were you getting or, indeed, on any previous occasion
     when you have policed a semi-final, have you ever before
     received information during the build-up to the kick-off
     from Police control inside the ground, as to the state of
     the ground inside the grou nd to enable you to know how
     ma n y mor e are expected to come? - A. No, sir.

Q. That is not part of the arrangement? - A. I have not
   received information directed to me on the state of the
   crowding inside.   The only time you do know that is if
   you pick traffic up on the air when it has been related
   to either somebody in the ground or whatever.

Q . 'Have you ever heard that sort of traffic going through
     the air? - A. Yes, sir, on occasions I have at other
     matches.

Q. O b viously it does not matt er if you do not get the
   information direct, it is to a senior Officer? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. Of course, that sort of information is essential for you
   to be able to do some forward planning for the control of
   the crowd to come? - A. No.    I have worked down there
   eight years and we control the crowd the best we can
   outside, as to what is coming.     It is not the people
   inside I am worried about, it is people outside.

Q. What you ought to be w o r r i e d about are the numbers still
   to come, is that not right? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. We have not yet heard the precise evidence so what I am
   p utting to you may not, in the end, turn out to be
   accurate.    If it is right that at just before two
   o'clock, there were about 8,000 fewer in the Liverpool
   end, than there had been at the same time the previous
   year, that information would have started ringing warning
   bells? - A. If I was given that information, yes, sir.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: ‘ What could you do about it?
     - A. I could ask for more manpower to control the
     situation, more horses and even dogs if it came to that
     situation.

Q.         HR. HYTNER:    You also told us, which is linked to
     Lord Justice -Taylor's question, that if you saw a build­
     up at the turnstiles you would call for horses to relieve
     the crowds within the turnstile area? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Once that area - in fact it is two areas because it is
   divided by the stand wall - once those two arels become
   full of people, really control has virtually been lost? -
   A. No, sir.   As I have said before, on semi-final day
   this is a common occurrence.

Q. There is a jam, that is, the entire area enclosed by the
   turnstile wall, the radial wall, and the perimeter fence,
   all jammed? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I can see obviously how you can relieve that situation
   provided no further swarm comes down Leppings Lane behind
   it? - A. On this occasion, sir, the swarm was such that I
   considered we should close the road off and use that as a
   holding area, and this is what I attempted to do with the
   horses and closing the road off to vehicular traffic.

Q. You were hoping to use Leppings Lane as the holding area?
   - A. Yes, sir.   My intention, which I discussed with
  •Superintendent Marshall, was to give the fans all of
   Leppings Lane.

Q. That would clearly be sensible provided the newcomers
   were filtered coming into the perimeter fence? - A. That
   is what we were trying to do, sir.

Q. Once they reached the perimeter fence you got another
   crushing area? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. That is,   the perimeter fence itself? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. The one place where I am sure you did not want to see the
   Police horses, was enveloped in the crowd within the
   enclosure area or, indeed, behind it on the south stand
   road? - A. I have used the horses there before, sir.  I
   find them a great deterrent.   Personally I am terrified
   of them.   I keep well away from them and on normal
   occasions the football supporters do.   We have found
   that even in that enclosed area when people see the
   Police horses they do not push forward.

Q. What I am saying is that if you are trying to use
   Leppings Lane as the holding area to prevent further
   b uild-up at the perimeter gate, it is in Leppings Lane
                                            G.   S YKES



that the Police hors es are going to achieve a successful
operation? - A. There wer e Police horses across the mouth
of Leppings Lane on the roadway there * supplemented bv
Police Officers.

H ow many up the Lane keeping control of the' swarm coming
down? - A. I do not know of any outside my particular
location at the turnstiles, sir.   I had only control of
the turnstile area.

Anything that was being done, however willingly, in
whatever good faith by horse and fatttmen in the immediate
perimeter fence area, was being destroyed by the
continuing swarm joining the throng at the back down
Leppings Lane? - A. The re was quite a crush coming down
Leppings Lane, yes, sir.

Whilst one appreciates the observations you have made
about drink, the fund amental problem was the sheer
numbers?   That is right, is it not? - A. Sheer numbers,
sir, but drink was a big factor.     Normally when you tell
people to stop pushing and not to   crowd and they see what
the situation is, they do not.    On this occasion that
did not occur.   They just kept pushing forward and
forward.

They will, of course, continue to push forward if they
are being pushed from the back by sheer weight of
numbers? - A. Well, being pushed from the back, sir, by
sheer weight of numbers, of people under the influence of
drink, and that has a big bearing on it.

Mr. Sykes, so there is no doubt about this,   I am not
disputing that some peop le may have been drunk.    I am
not disputing that some people who may have been drunk
were more than average impatient, and that complicated
things.   However, the basic problem was the sheet weight
of numbers? - A. T he sheer weight of numbers, sir, which
was complicated by the influence of drink.    If they had
not been drunk and acted on Police advice they would not
have pushed forward.

      MR. HYTNER:    T h a n k you.

                    Cross-Examined bv MR. J a c k s o n -

Q. Mr. Sykes, on Thursday of last week the Officer in charge of
   this Police operation told me that one of the main tasks of
   Serials 16, 17 and 18 was to assist in the ensuring that
   orderly queues formed outside the turnstiles? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Do I now understand the position to be as far removed from as
   is possible, that it was never the intention of the Inspector
   in charge of those serials to take any part in the ensuring
   of orderly queues outside the turnstiles? - A. It is all a
   matter of interpretation, sir*, of what you mean by an orderly
   queue. I have already said if you mean an orderly queue of
   two or one or two people at best at each turnstile then that
   is far removed. That is impossible.

Q. Inspector, let me make it quite clear. I accept the entirety
   of your evidence.   I accept the   obvious natureof    the matters
   that caused you to come to thatconclusion. What concerns me
   is the Chief Superintendent did not know. - a . Well. I can't
   answer for the Chief Superintendent, sir. I can oniy tell you
   from my experience of what I have done in the past and what I
   interpret those instructions.

u. Let me ask you this then. If you receive an order for
   •Crisis 16. 17, 18 and 19 whichwould indicate to anyone
   looking at it that something over 40 men would be involved in
   assisting of the forming of orderly queues, when you receive
   that order and you know it is not going to happen do vou think
   you might have told your superior Officers that it was not
   going to happen? - A. No, sir, it is all a matter of
   interpretation on what you mean by queues, and that is what I
   have told you.

Q. What time would you assess your first realisation that the
   crowd outside was unmanageable, was being pushed, full of
   drunks? - A. Shortly after - I went in the ground at
   approximately 2 o clock, sir, to the best of my recollection
   as people were climbing over the gate, and it is when I came
   out after that that I could see people were pushing down the
   side towards gate C.

Q. Yes, I accept that you have said.         My question was, at what
   time? - A. Possibly 2.15.

O. Would you look, please, at composite album No. l. Would you
   lookj please, at photographs in particular MWN 25/A, taken we
   understand at 14.30.   Would you describe that crowd asyou see
   it in that photograph? - a . People queuing up to go through
   the turnstiles.

Q. Would you describe it as orderly, disorderly or how would you
   describe it? - A. At that stage pretty orderly.

Q.   That is at 2.30? - A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   I wondered about your    assessment of the crowd at 2.15.    Was it

                                        G. SYKES


really as you described it? - a . That is the impression I got
sir, that people were pushing forward. Prior to this we had
moved a lot of people out of this area.

That looks to be a pretty quiet crowd, does it not? - A. Yes,
reasonably. Not quiet but they are not causing trouble. They
are queuing up to go through the turnstiles.
At 2.30? - A. Yes, sir.

So it would be a little harsh, would it not, for your
description as to the crowd at 2.15 to be accepted? - A. no,
sir. I have already said in my statement when I came out of
the gate, which would probably be 2.15, there were people all
milling down this side which I had swept. It was when I went
outside that I saw the fans coming towards the gate that I
caused the traffic to be stopped.

Finally, M r . Sykes, can I ask you this. Would you consider
these factors. Firstly, people arriving the worse for drink
at Semi-Finals: would you accept that? - A. That was my
expectation, yes.

No orderly queues possible outside the turnstiles on Semi-
Final day because of the crowd? - A. My interpretation of an
orderly queue on this particular day is people, as that is.
photograph 25A, queuing up to go through the turnstiles.

That has been described by virtually everyone in it as a mass
of people. Would you not agree with that? - A. That to me on
Semi-Final day is normal, and that is the normal queue.

Would you therefore agree with me that in anticipation of
those factors alone, never mind A, C, B or tickets or the
like, you would anticipate a much slower throughput through
the turnstiles than on an average Sheffield Wednesday home
game? — A. No, sir. On Semi-Final day you expect people to so
through quicker because there is no exchange of money. It is
a straight ticket transaction. They tear the stub and away
they go.

I therefore will deal witfT those matters. Is it not the
position that you anticipated a number of people without
tickets? - A. Yes, sir.

Did you not anticipate a number of people therefore    would slow
the throughput of the turnstiles because they would    arrive
without tickets? - A. On my experience before, sir,    they have
never been down to the actual turnstiles. They have    ori"*y bccm
milling about outside asking for tickets.

Have you any idea of the time it would take to load, let us
say 3,000 people through the turnstiles A-G? - a. No, n.tr.

                B   Q. It is in relation to an inspection of the ground by Police
                       representatives, and particularly to have a look at the
                       revised segregation arrangements at the West terrace? - A. i

                       primary task, and I remember filling in at one meeting because
                       I was the only Officer available.                   _

                    Q. If you were filling in did you take any active part in that? -
                C      A. Not that I recollect, sir. I know I remember going to the
                       football ground and I seem to recollect it was concerning the
                       covering of the new Spion Kop. That is my recollection, sir.

                    Q. What I want to enquire about is this. In 1985 the club had
                       revised the segregation arrangements by putting in a new
                       central fence between pens 3 and 4, an additional fence next
                       to pen 4 and some revised fencing and walling in the concourse
                D      behind the West Stand. Do you recall that happening? - A.
                       Yes. sir, I do.

                    G. Do you recall at an Officer Working Party the Officer Working
                       Party that you attended, that there was any discussion about
                       the effectiveness of those revised arrangements? - a . No, sir.
                       As I say, I can only recollect going to one meeting, and I
                       have only recollection of discussing the covering of the Spion
                E      Kop and facilities for the disabled.

                    O. I will take it further with another witness.

                    0. Mr. Sykes, can you help me, please, with Serial 17.   I notice
                       in the Operational Orders that during the match their position
                F      is to be located in the central tunnel to the Leppings Lane
                       terraces? - A. That is during the match, yes, sir.   After all
                       the fans have been put through the turnstiles into the ground
                       they would be redeployed there.

                    Q. Just as a matter of interest, what would they be doing there?
                       - A. Just essentially order and be there as a safety valve,
                       really.
                G
                    O.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Would they be standing at the
                         pitch end probably watching the match? - A. No. sir, they
                         would be at the back of the tunnel.

                    G. At the back of the tunnel? -   a   . Yes, sir.

            H       O.   Would there be others at the front? - A. Inside the perimeter
                         fence or on the track?

                    O. No, I am talking about just at the pitch end of the tunnel? -

                                               O. SYKES

     A. No, sir.

Q.    We have got a photograph of 1988. Have you got a copyofthis
     one? It is a one-off photo. There may be one there. Do vou
     see it? - A. Yes. sir.

Q. You see a number of helmets just by the tunnel there’ - A
   Yes, sir.

Q. What serial would that be correspondingly last year for this
   year? — A. Quite obviously that could be the corresponding
   serial. .

Q.    That is what I thought. There is no reason why they should
     not come and watch the match at that end of the tunnel at that
     stage? — A. No. sir. I misunderstood you. I was thinking
     more about the front of the fence. I did not realise.

G. But that is the one you are talking about? -     a   . I would
   surmise so, yes.

Q-        MR. KALLIPETIS:   I don't think there is any other serial
     that has a duty anywhere near the tunnel to the Leppings Lane
     terraces is there? — A. Without looking through the entire
     Order, sir, 1 don’t know.

          MR.'COLLINS:   14 and 15, both do.

          THE WITNESS:   I am only in possession of the serial
     numbers under my direct command.

Q-        M R - KALLIPETIS: Serial 14 ;is also to be located in the
     central tunnel during the match to maintain order as required,
     and IS is to be located in the tunnel to the north pen, so
     that is not the central tunnel. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Mr. Sykes, you said when you entered the central terraces
   through the tunnel   you took in  Officers fromoutside gate C
   with you.  Is that   right? - A.  No, sir, not from outside gate
   C. I collected the Officers. I went through gate C and I
   collected Officers   who were in  the concoursewho were making —
   their way back round to the playing area. Itook them back
   and we went through the tunnel.

Q. This is after you had been to the control box? -       a   . Yes, sir.

G. Did you see Mr. Hand-Davis, the mounted Police Inspector           when
   you went up to the control box? - a . No, sir.

G. Can you remember when you went to the control box whether you
   saw any mounted Police moving off, going up the roadway behind
   the directors* car park towards the far end of the ground? -
   A. No, sir. I believe I was probably the first Officer in
   that area, and then straight back through to the central
   tunnel.  I suspect they moved off after that.

Q. Did you see Sergeant Burns when you went down the central

                  A
                         tunnel to the terraces? - A. I can't recollect seeing him
                         there, sir.

                      Q. You did say in response to a question from Mr. Collins that as
                         far as you were concerned all the injured and ultimately dead
                         who were brought up through the tunnel had come from the front
                  B      of .the pens? - A. Yes, sir.

                      Q. I think in fact we shall hear evidence, Mr. Sykes, that a lot
                         of the injured in fact were found only 3 or m yards in from
                         the mouth of the tunnel, actually in the centre of the
                         terraces themselves? - A. We had gone quite a way down the
                         terracing, sir, before we came across these.
                  C   0. You went into pen 4, I think? -   a   . Yes, sir.

                   A
                       Q. The only reason I put this, Mr. Sykes, is that we know what
                           time the first ambulance arrived at the back of Leppings Lane
                           end terraces and the evidence of the Ambulance Officers will
                           be that certainly within a minute of their arrival there
                           were several bodies already present and brought out to them?
                           - A. That is possibly true, sir, because after I had given
                   B      •the young girl resuscitation then I realised obviously we
                           had got a major problem, there was dead people, and I
                           immediately requested ambulances then and they were not long
                           after that before they came.

                       Q. Let me make it clear, Mr. Sykes, t'ner is no criticism at
                          all because obviously once you are occupied with trying
                          to rescue somebody, quite properly, you don't know what is
                   C      going on around you. That would be right, wouldn't it?
                          - A. In those circumstances I cannot recollect everything.

                                MR. KALLIPETIS:   Yes, of course.   Thank you,
                          Mr. Sykes.


                                        Cross-Examined by HR. GLASGOW:
                   D
                       Q. Mr. Sykes, could you just help us about visiting Stewards?
                          - A. Yes sir.

                       Q. It is standard practice, to your knowledge, for visiting
                           teams to bring a nuiaber, a smallnumber of Stewards with
                           them? - A. Yes sir, normally the away supporters the
                         ■ Stewards control the trains or the official Club,
                   E       Supporters' Club, they are stewarded.

                       Q. You don't know the precise number that will be coning but
                          you anticipate that it will be what a handful of a dozen
                          or so? - A. Normally. I am never given that precise
                          information and that is usually an agreement between the
                          Clubs concerned. It isnot a concern of mine.
                   F   Q. A general agreement all round the Clubs that that is a
                          sensible thing to do? - A. I can't confirm that but that
                          is the impression I get.

                       Q. Yes, even your impression may be valuable. Could you just
                          help me as to this, Inspector, they obviously won't have
                          on an all ticket match seats allocated to them. They
                   G      won't have tickets with seats? - A. No sir, they just go
                          through the gate and find their own way on the terracing.

                       Q. They arrive with their own fans usually and am I right in
                          thinking that from the Police point of view although you
                          recognise that they won't have specific duties to perform
                          once they arrive at the ground, it is a sensible thing to
                          have Stewards among their own fans? - A. Yes sir, they
               H          keep order on the way to the football ground and I find
                          that generally speaking v/e can seek advice or get more
                          information if we require it.

And they of course will wear their own Club tabards? - A. No
sir, they normally just have a lapel badge that says "Steward".

But they will obviously be known to their own supporters
and hopefully will have a general calming influence in the
areas where they are allowed into the ground? - There is
some debate what influence they do have, but obviously that
is the intention.
      MR. GLASGOVI:   Yes, thank you very much indeed.   •


              Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Sykes, on the question of Stewards coming with the fans
in theory it would be a good idea? - A. Yes sir.

And there are a number of them who are of considerable value?
- A. Some are obviously better than others. Some Clubs take
it more seriously.
On this occasion I think the crowd of Stewards that you saw
or were drawn to your attention by the man at the stile ....
- A. By a Sheffield Wednesday Steward, yes.

.... they were accompanied with youngsters, were they? -
A. Yes sir.
And they were seeking to get in with passes? - A. Yes sir.

Thev were about 30 or so in number? - A. That is correct.

And according to the information you had there had been a
considerable number of such Stewards who had already gone
through with their passes? — A. Already gone through Gate C
into the ground sir.
May I turn from that, Mr. Sykes. I think you policed the
game in 1938. Is that right? - A. Yes sir.

Where were you in 1986, what role did you fulfil? - A.
Exactly the same role as I had this year.

 So you were outside the Leppings Lane gates with the same
 Serials and the same number of men? - A. Yes sir.

 Can -I just ask you because there has been some evidence,
 it is not entirely consistent, suggesting that there was
 in 1988 some cordon of Police Officers filtering non­
 ticket holders from ticket holders before they got to the
 Leppings Lane gates. V7hat do you say about that? - A. I
 have no knowledge of that. I did not incorporate that in
 any plan I did and I am not aware of that at all.

 And during 1983 were you making your way around that area?
 - A. Yes sir, doing exactly the same or trying to do the
 same as I did this year.

A
    Q.         LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR: I am not quite sure how far you
         went from the turnstiles in the direction of Leppings Lane?
         - A. Obviously, my Lord,, I am concerned with the turnstile
         area. If I go on to the roadway then I can see possibly
         200/300 yards towards Penistone Road.

B   Q.    I appreciate you have got a view up the road. I am just
         wondering how far, looking at the model there, would you go
         out on to the Lane itself or not? - A. Yes sir, I have got
         free access all the way there.

    Q.    Yes, I know, but I   am justwondering where youphysically
         took yourself, how far in the direction of the roundabout
         you went, if at all? — A. None sir. Immediately in the
C        roadway outside the turnstile area.

    Q. You would not have gone beyond the end of that model, in
       other words? - A. No sir.

    Q.    Either year? - A. Either year. My primary   role isthe
         turnstiles.
D              MR. WOODWARD: Sir, there will be evidence, no doubt,
         enabling the whole of Leppings Lane to be covered.

    Q. But your concern was immediately in the area you see shown
       on the model? - A. That is correct sir.

    Q. And you were able to tell the Inquiry about what you there
      < observed during 1983? - A. Yessir.
E
    Q.    Have you policed this ground on    manyoccasions? -   A.I have
         policed Hillsborough Football Ground in various roles since
         1976.

    Q. Would it be right to say, Officer, that you have considerable
       experience in the habit and conduct of crowds? - A. Yes sir,
F      that is true. I have policed since 1980, apart from the odd
       game due to annual leave or whatever, I have policed every
       football match at Hillsborough since 1930.

    Q. And that includes capacity attendances? - A. That includes
       probably five semi-finals sir and various other matches
       where it is a capacity crowd.

G   Q.   Now you were given the task again in 1989 of policing outside
         Leppings Lane? - A. Yes sir.

    Q. If you had had any concern about the Police methods and any
       anxiety as to'whether or not it would be adequate on this
       occasion, would you have raised it? - A. Yes sir. On the
       Friday before the semi-final I had a briefing at Hillsborouah
       for all Senior Officers. I had a separate briefing with
       Mr. Greenwood, the Ground Commander and we discussed the
       Operational Order and I had not qualms about it whatsoever.
                                   G. SYKES


So you had the opportunity to discuss it, it was discussed
and you had no qualms about being able to do the job? -
A. Yes sir.

May I ask you however about this queueing, this word that
appears. When there is a crowd of more than a few people
at the turnstiles at Leppings Lane, has it ever been the
practice to have strict rigid queues going to each turn­
stile? - A. No sir. If you get a large number, as you can
see from the photographs, see from the layout, it is impossible
to form rigid queues to the turnstiles, sir.

So when you saw the word "queueing" in your Order, do we
understand that you were acting according ....

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: The word is not "queueincf in
the Order, the word is "queues".

      MR. WOODWARD:    When you saw theword in the Order
relating to what you   were expected todo, how did you
interpret that? - A.   I take that as a broader view of
queue and that it is   to try and maintain order down towards
the turnstiles.

And in the past have you had any difficulty in ensuring
that people got to the turnstiles to enable then to take
their turn? - A. No sir.

So the effect of what had been practised enabled people in
the past, fans, to take their turn to go through the
turnstiles? - A. Yes sir, that is correct.

Had their been any problems about ensuring that? - A. No
sir, we have not hac problems in the past at all.

On occasions when the crowd had built up in the past had
you use*1 horses? - A. Yes sir.

For what purpose? - A. I have used horses at the turnstiles
to prevent crushing actually at the wall. It is to relieve
the pressure at the front. _

So the use of that device is to prevent people being
crushed, it is not to order them into lines? - A. That is
true sir, there is just not enough area there to form
orderly queues that people are suggesting with this amount
of crowd.

I don't suppose you could get a horse betv/een each turnstile
entrance, could you? - A. Mo sir.

So the practice has been not to have a lining up? - A. Hot
on a large capacity crowd.

Would you have a look please at Photograph MW10/19A and
MWN/18A in the Composite. Those photographs are taken at
14.16 and 14.17? - A. Yes sir.
                                  G. SYKES


Those are views from Leppings Lane looking at the gates
towards the turnstiles? - A. Yes sir.

How does what you see there compare with your ordinary
experience of people attending such an event? - A. There
is a large number of people coming down the road as you
can see. Obviously at that stage I was getting concerned
with the number of people that I could see flooding down
the road.

Your concern was in respect of the people coming to that
scene? - A. Yes sir.

And the volume of it? - A. Yes sir.

You have touched upon the question of closing Leppincs Lane?
- A. To vehicular traffic, yes sir.

May I ask you in a little more detail about it. On this
occasion consideration was given by you to closing Leppings
Lane? - A. Yes sir.

At about what time was that? - A. I would estimate, sir,
roughly 2.15 time.

What did you do about it? - A. I asked the mounted section
to put a cordon of horses across the mouth of Leppings Lane,
which they did. I tried to get through on the radio to
ask for vehicular traffic to be stopped. I was getting no
response. I then spoke to Hr. Marshall. I went to him,
told him what I had got in mind. He agreed and he got
through on his radio and had the traffic stopped.

Was any other Officer involved in discussing that with you,
Mr. Creaser or anybody? - A. I-Io sir. I heard Hr. Creaser's
evidence yesterday and I actually discussed it with
Mr. Creaser after I had spoken to Mr. Marshall and informed
him in fact what our plan was.

So you discussed it with Mr. Creaser after you had mentioned
it to Mr. Marshall. That is on the 15th? - A — Yes sir.

But you put a cordon, a line of horses. Where did you put
it? - A. Between the outer perimeter fence and the roadway
up towards Leppings Lane, across that area.

Following the line   of the curve? - A. Roughly, yes sir.

What was the point of that? What was the purpose? - A.
The purpose is to form a cordon across there of Police
horses to prevent people just spilling down towards the
turnstiles and to try and relieve the pressure at the
front.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I am not quite sure how the
closing of Leppings Lane and the placing of this cordon
of horses were related, if they were. They may have been
                                 22


                                          G. SYKES


        quite separate things? - A. My intention sir was to stop
        vehicular traffic comings into Leppings Lane, so I put the
        cordon of Police horses across the mouth towards the turn­
        stiles. The intention was that the people coming down
        Leppings Lane would be held actually on the roadway as
        opposed to packing them into the already congested area.

Q. So those two things were related? - A. Yes sir, it was all
   oart of my interpretation of what I saw as a solution to
   the problem.
q   .         h r . WOODWARD.: So you would have space for the people
        to be held back by the horses? - A. Yes sir.




                                /Q. Was that sort of
                                         G. S YKES


 Was that sort   of arrangement something you would have
 expected to have relieved any problems towards the
 turnstiles?     A.   That is the problem that I saw, that
 is the solution that I saw and that is the plan that I
 put in operation.     I fully expected that, to solve the
 problem.

 Did it?   A.   No, sir.   You have heard evidence from
 hr. Hand-Davis and other Officers of people jumping under
 Police horses and so forth.   That has never been my
 experience anywhere.

 So wherever there had been a cordon or a barrier would have
 required that people observe it and did not seek to break
 through it.     A. Yes, sir.

And you did, according to your recollection, have such
an endeavour at this time?   A.   Yes, sir, that was my
intention and that is what I tried to do.

When you formed that line and you took that measure,
was there in fact any crowd or any problem about where
that position -- where that line was taken?  A.   I do
not understand that question, sir.

It is my fault,   forgive me.    When you took that measure
A.   Yes, sir.

Was there any throng against which you had to take it or
not?   Could the people have stopped there?   A.   I
thought that the people should have stopped there.   That
it why I put it across there.

Were those people against whom you were taking that measure
people who were in any way embarrassed or in any difficulty?
A.    They shouldn't have been. There should have been no
problem and it would have been quite safe.   We had stopped
the traffic and we could use all the roadway as a holdinq
area.

At that time they were not being pressed upon or pushed
on?   A.    Only by obviously people joining from Leppings
Lane but there should have been no crush on those people
whatsoever.

Did the crush develop however?     A.   Yes, sir,    it kept   -
building.

You have spoken about the number of people arriving.   Did
the number arriving at 2.30 and thereafter surprise you?
A.   Yes, sir.   We had had a steady flow up to that
point and it suddenly all started to go wrong with the
number of people that I saw converging down from both
directions in Leppings Lane.

Apart from the numbers, you have mentioned the element of
drink amongst some people.   A.   Yes, sir.

                                                              G.   S Y KE S
                A
                    Q. It may be said at a football match it is expected that
                       some people will have taken a drink.   A.   It is not
                       normal these days, sir, but on Semi-Final day I expect
                       people to arrive who have been drinking.

                    Q. But on this occasion was your expectation in fact of the
                B      numbers or of the amount of people in significant drink
                       realised?   A.  • No, they far exceeded it, sir.  The
                       number of people arriving late and the amount of
                       intoxication did surprise me.

                    Q.   Turnstiles and people without tickets, may I ask you about
                         that?   A.   Yes, sir.
                C   Q. You say that people were going ---  What were people doing
                       at the turnstiles without tickets?   A.   Obviously I
                       couldn't see from the outside and what I saw from the
                       inside is that my attention was drawn by one of the
                       turnstile operators shouting that people were gaining
                       admission without tickets and they were, in fact, jumping
                       over the turnstiles and there were people also stood in
                       the turnstiles and people was coming underneath their
                D      legs.

                    Q. You say, "jumped over the turnstiles", you do not mean
                       over the roof?   A.   No, sir, over the actual gate, you
                       know, the revolving gate.

                    Q. They were leaping the gate and people coming underneath it.
                       A.   Yes, sir.
                E
                    Q. Was this just odd ones or what?   A.   No, at that stage
                       there was quite a number coming through the left-hand
                       or the turnstiles nearest to Gate C and Officers on those
                       details were ejecting them straight through Gate C.

                    Q. You spoke of people milling about without tickets.
                F      Were there people milling about without tickets?
                       A.   Yes, sir.   From shortly after 11 a.m. when I briefed
                       the serials people were coming to the ground asking for
                       tickets, shouting, "Has anyone got a ticket?" and that
                       carried on all through the afternoon.

                    Q. Of course it is suggested that it is to be expected you
                       might get some people without tickets turning up.
                G      A.   That is expected and we always experience that.
                       What-we always do is, when we recognise people without
                       tickets and people shouting, we periodically sweep them
                       out of Leppings Lane.

                    Q.   It would seem that on this occasion there was a greater
                         number than was expected.   A.   Yes, sir.   I have
                         never known this amount of people without tickets.
            H
                    Q.   It has been suggested that there might have been - you
                         may have heard the evidence yesterday - 2 0 0 or perhaps
                         2,000.   Where do you put it, doing your estimate?
L Harpham Ltd            A.    It is very, very difficult to assess because
                    I
                            ?5


                                                 G.   S YKES


   obviously you don't know the number of people who you
   have turned away and come back.        I would estimate the
   2 , 0 0 0 is probably nearer the mark.

Q. In the past you have spoken of people turning up without
   tickets but not there going to the turnstiles.  A.   No,
   sir, generally they mill about on the roadway where 'I
   put the cordon of Police horses across.  They mill around
   that area shouting, "Who has got tickets?"   They mill
   about towards Catchbar Lane, there is a bridge that goes
   over the road, they stand on the walls there shouting
   for tickets, and they generally mill about that area.

Q. The description you give of that behaviour seems to be
   of people who are advertising that they are in the market
   to buy tickets.   A.   Yes, sir.

Q. Not people who were endeavouring to get through, despite the
   endeavours of everybody without.   A.   Not at that stage.
   There were people endeavouring to purchase tickets.

Q. So you put it at significantly higher than the estimate
   that was given yesterday.   A.   In the day, yes, sir,
   I would say the 2,000 was nearer the mark.

Q. What was the attitude of people?    We have talked of people
   being upset and frustrated because they are being held up.
   You have spoken of the ordinary expectation you have of the
   crowd.   Do people get held up at football matches?
   A.   Yes, sir, it is quite common to be held up at the
   turnstiles.    It is one of those facts of life that if a
   lot of people turn up at the wrong time, then they cannot
   get through quickly through the turnstiles.

Q. In your experience, has the behaviour been like it was in
   1989?   A.    No, sir.   I have never ever seen that
   before.    People generally just queue and wait their turn
   to get through the turnstile.

Q. May I move on to the events and the incident that occurred.
   You went into the ground and you went into the tunnel.
   A.   Yes, sir.

Q. And you organised there Policemen.   A.   Yes, sir,
   I got the available men who were in the concourse and
   were cleared from the back a way through to the people
   who were injured at the front.

Q. Can you help about this:   was the situation such when you
   got to the exit from the tunnel on to the terraces that
   there were spectators around there who did not want to
   move?   A.   Yes, sir, there was a lot of people still
   looking forward and trying to really see what was happening
   because they didn't  know.

Q. Are you able to recall whether the game was still going on?
   A.   I would imagine at that stage it had definitely stopped.
                                              G.   S YKES


But there were people there who were ---   A*   They
were craning forward, really, to see what was happening
at the front.

You organised and assisted in the getting .out of people.
A.   Yes, sir.   Possibly the first casual-ty came out
of the back which I brought out.

Are you able to say how far down the terrace that casualty
was when you found it?   A.    It is very, very difficult
because obviously we were virtually fighting our way through
a crowd.   I would say possibly hai-f to two-thirds of the
way down.

Is that the right-hand pen or the left-hand pen, 3 or 4?
A.   That is, as I went down, left-hand pen, Pen 4 , sir.

Were casual ties being passed back by    people in the crowd?
A.   At that stage I am not aware of     that because we
got the first casualty, a young girl     who was unconscious,
and we took her straight back to the     concourse.          ’

She was on the ground, was she?   A.   There were three
Police Officers just attempting to lift her when I got there.

So you came upon her on the steps of the terrace.
A.   Yes, sir.

In the earlier stages when people were being admitted to
the ground you went in and out through one of the gates,
did you?   A.   Through Gate C, yes, sir.               ’

Did you observe any stewards around at that time?
A.    Yes, sir, there were stewards there all the time.

What stage was that that you went    in through Gate C?
A.    2 p.m., I think, sir, when I   saw people climbing over
the wall.    It was about 2 p.m.

                Re-examined by HR. COLLINS:

You have been asked about numbers without tickets.     Were
you given any information in any briefing as to any
expectations of people arriving without tickets?    A.   No,
I can't recollect that, sir, at all.                        ’

                  By LORD 3U5TICE TAYLOR:

Just one question.   The line of horses, was it your ides
to draw that up or the mounted Officers?   A.   No, when
I saw the crushing at the turnstiles, then I asked one of
the mounted Officers to form - —

You asked them to?    A.   Yes,   sir.

Well now, we have had conflicting views about this.
Mr. Hand-Davis thought that despite the line of horses
people were breaking through in significant numbers, I

                                                          think.    Mr. Creaser said yesterday that the line of
                                                          horses was achieving some success but by that time the
                                                          gates were opened and there really was not any need for
                                                          that any longer.    Can you help about that?   I think
                                                          he said that odd individuals were getting -through between
                                                          the horses or the odd one underneath but essentially it
       •                           B                      was being effective but the gates obviated the need for
                                                          it.    A.   You mean when the gates went open?

                                                  Q . Yes.        Well, obviously when the gates went open
                                                      then there would be no need for a line of Police horses
                                                      there but there was definitely a line xrf Police horses
                                                      there prior to that.

                                                           What I am trying to get at is whether it was achieving
                                                           some success.         A.     Not the success that I originally
                                                           hoped, because obviously I hoped that putting the Police
                                                           horses there would relieve the pressure at the gates and
                                                           that people would stop being crushed but that was not
                                                           happening;        people were, like    you say, going through the
                                                           round the Police horses and underneath.

                IAN TURNER Called
            Examined by Mr. GOLDSACK:

Inspector Turner, I do not think you were present at the
semi-final this year?   A. That's correct, sir.

But last year you were an Inspector in charge of serials
out in Leppings Lane?   A. Correct.

I think you had men that year protecting the side roads
off Leppings Lane with barriers?   A. Yes.

Ensuring that non-residents did not go down?   A. Correct.

Did you have any system last year for filtering people as
they came along Leppings Lane?   A. No.

Did you have any system last year for checking whether
people had tickets before they reached the perimeter
gates?   A.  No.

Either a formal system or an informal system? A. Informal
in so much as perhaps being asked by individual officers,
as fans came down Leppings Lane, "Have you got tickets?",
on an informal, ad hoc basis, but not a formal situation.

Do you recall at any stage last year having the portable
barriers - you know the sort I mean - across Leppings
Lane at any stage?   A. No, never, sir.

To make sure that people went in particular directions?
A,  No, never.

            Cross-examined by Mr. GLASGOW:

Inspector, just one matter, if I may.    Do you know a Mr,
Kenneth Evans?    A, No, sir.

A silly question!  The Kenneth Evans who used to be, I think,
the Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands who is now
the Liaison Officer to the Football Association? A. No,
sir.

We are going to hear, I think, that in this year that you
were responsible for, Mr. Evans was concerned on behalf
of the Football Association to’ look into the arrangements

                                        n          And he mav tell us that he went to the ground to look
                                                   round in 1988 to see how things were working? A. Yes.

                                         0         He has a recollection of a very effective system of
                                                   queuino    being organised in this year when you were
                                                   responsible in 1988, and of speaking to a number of the
                                                   police officers outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles
                                                   I iust wondered if that-helped you to remember whether
                                                   anybody of that kind might have approached you?     A. No,
                               B                   he di d n’t, sir, and I wasn't directly outside the
                                                     turnstiles;   I was further along Leppings Lane where
                                                    the side roads come into Leppings Lane.

                                          0            Are you able to help the Inquiry as to the system which
                                                       was actually being employed at Leppings Lane itself, at
                                                       the turnstiles end, for organised queuing?    A. No, sir.
                                                       I wasn’t involved in the queueing situation at all. My
                                                       brief was to prevent access down the side roads. Although
                                                       I did walk up and down Leppings Lane and in fact round
                                                       the block and into Penistone Road, at no time did I go
                                                       down to the turnstiles.
                                                       I see.   So if Mr. Evans tells us that there was a system
                                             Q-        -r filtering people and checking tickets before they got
                                                       to the turnstiles and that there were six mounted officers
                                D                      forming specific queues, and that he saw and was impressed
                                                       upon by that organisation in 1988, you can neither agree
                                                       nor disagree?    A.  Correct.

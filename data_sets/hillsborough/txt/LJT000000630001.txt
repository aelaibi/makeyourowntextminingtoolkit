       Many thanks for your       agreeing   to   my    participation   in   the
       forthcoming Seminar.

       I do not know whether the Home Office keep you in touch with
       relevant events after Hillsborough these days, but I saw with
       interest that it was chosen as the subject for the Adjournment
       debate last Friday.  I thought you might like to have a copy.

RECOLLECTION OF FACTS RELATING TO HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
BY PC 1226 ELLIS               '               ----------



I am a Police Constable of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary presently stationed at
Kirkby-in-Ashfield.

On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I had been attached to the Mounted Section for the day t;
assist other members of the Section.       We travelled to Hillsborough, Sheffield, unde-;
the supervision of PS 1710 WATSON in order to assist South Yorkshire Police with
public order duties at the s .A. Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Fore?

My duties at the ground were to supervise the visiting Nottingham Forest Supporters i
Psnistone Road Turnstiles in company with Notts and S.Yorks Officers.

At about 2.30 pm that day the South Yorks Mounted Officers resumed from that      area
1saying me to patrol that area alone.       About 20 yards from me was Fc 4 59 HINES who
was also working alone.

During my patrol I found the Forest supporters to be of good behaviour and at no time
was there any public order or crowd problem.       Also whilst in this position I did no-,
see any Liverpool Supporters prior to or after the g a m e .    My patrol covered only
Penistone Road corner of the Forest Supporter end.

I was not aware of any crowd problems at Leppings Lane or      any other par-c of the grour
and was not aware of what had happened until the postponement      of the game.

At about 3.40   pm I stood by with other Mounted Officers on Peninstone Road.      I then
assisted with   the orderly dispersal of   the Forest Supporters from the ground and at
6.20 pm we were stood down.

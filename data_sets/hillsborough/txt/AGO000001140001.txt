               Further to my previous statsnents I would like to add the following,

               Cn Saturday 15th April IS89 (150489) I worked .in the capacity of
i              Special Constable at the F.A. Semi-Final football match between

               Liverpool F.C. and Nottingham Forest F.C. which was being played at

               the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.

     |         My recollection of the events of that dav are vague and confused.

               As a result of this I feel that mv irercry, my recollection of that day

fl             is ccssibly inaccurate.       I am unsure of what time I arrived at the

               Lerpir.cs Lane entrance to the crcund or even hew I came to be cn the
I           pitch but I did.

|           By time I got onto the pitch it seemed to be mass contusion, there

            wera police officers and supporters all o v e r the place.                   I could see

               I was in a state of shock.    I didn't k n e w what to do but my
      pit-n-
       a C jzal instinct was to help these people in the best way that I could,

      j- can't describe to you in any detail ray exact movenents over the next

      half an hour cr so.   I knew that I approached several people lying on

      the pitch and assisted if possible.     I did not give any of these

     pec ole mouth-to-mouth or heart massage.

     I dacided that there were enough people dealing with the situation

     at the Leppincs Lane end of the around and made my way to the Spicn

     Kcp end of the ground.

     I could see that bodies were being carried from the Lepcincs Lane end

     to the Spion Kcp end of the ground and then being placed on the pitch.

     I assisted to carry a number of dead and injured people fron the Spicn

     Kop end of the pitch, into the gymnasium where a tertecrary mortuary

     iiac been set up.   I was talkinc? to sane of these people, contorting

     then and trying to reassure them.      I am unable to describe ‘any of

     these people in the detail.

     By this time I really was in a state of shock, I couldn't believe what

     I was seeing.   I seened to be on automatic pilot.     My memories are

     very confused and distorted.

     I can recall carrying a youth who I new knew to be, Kevin Daniel

     WILLIAMS from the pitch to the gymnasium.     He was the last person that

     I assisted in carrying.   I first saw Kevin WILLIAMS lying cn the pitch

     near to the goal area at the Spion Kcp end of the ground.       At that

     stsce he wasn't on a hoarding or a stretcher.

 I   I r 2 TEr.ber that there were several people around where he was lying.

     I can't recall anyone giving him rrcuth to mcuth.     With the help of
1    other people, who I c a n ’t recall, Kevin WILLIAMS was placec onto a


I    hoarding and carried into the gymnasium.

     stay with the body.
                                                  Someone instructed me to



i
 i didn't knew what to do.    I didn't want to believe the toy was dead.

 I didn't knew if he was dead or not but I decided that I had got to

atranDt to revive him.     I started to give him mouth-to-nouth but

sar.acne, I ccn't knew who, touched me cn the shoulder and told me he

was dead.     By this time mv head h2 d gone, I wasn't aware of what I was

doing or what was really happening.

At 16.06 hours (1606) Dccccr CURPEN examined Kevin WILLIAMS and

certified him dead.

I ranember a detective officer,

corolete the GEN 18 form (sudden death form).

I s caved with the body until the -early hours of Sunday 16 th April

(160489) when I escorted Kevin WILLIAMS, who at this stage had not
                                                   * •   v     •

been identified, to the Medico Legal Centre.

I identified the bedy by the number, allocated, which in the case was

Nurrcer 51.   I had no further dealings with Kevin WILLIAMS.

This statsnent is made to the best of my recollection and 1 belie/e it

to be the truth.    Howsver, under the circumstances I cannot be

positive that the details are accurate.     I have been quite badly

affacted by the whole incident and I am trying to erase it from my

merory.

I have marked on a plan of the pitch (Reference D.J.M.l) the

approximate location where I first came into contact with the

deceased, Kevin Daniel WILLIAMS.

      MEETING BETWEEN ANNE WILLIAMS AND P.C. BRUDER - 15TH DECEMBER, 1991.


      P.C. Bruder made his statement approximately ten days after the disaster.

      At that time he asked the West Midlands Police for the name of the boy he had
      attempted to resuscitate (ie. Kevin Williams). This was refused.

      At the meeting with P.C. Bruder he stated that he came across Kevin on the pitch and
      that Kevin was either convulsing or twitching. Kevin had a pulse and there was
      vomit in Kevin's mouth. As he tried to resuscitate Kevin an ambulance approached
      going towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground. He shouted for the ambulance
      to stop in order to put Kevin in it, but it went straight past.

      On 3rd May 1990, P.C. Bruder was visited in his home by a West Midlands Police Officer
      who asked him to 'reconsider' his statement. He was asked if he was mistaken when he
      stated that Kevin was convulsing and had a pulse. P.C. Bruder stated that he was not
      mistaken.

      N.B. It was only at this time (ie. 3rd May, 1990) that P.C. Bruder learnt for the
      first time the name of the person he had tried to help.
                                                    y       V        •


      At the same time as the West Midlands Officer was interviewing him in his home, -tek.3 D r
U^n-j^-Gejwier rang P.C. Bruder and tried to persuade him that the facts of his statement
      were incorrect in particular that the ambulance could not have been driving onto
       the pitch but might have been driving oif it. Again, P.C. Bruder refused to admit
       that he had been mistaken and was adamant that the ambulance had been driving onto
       the pitch.                                                  -

      The West Midlands Officer was witl? P.C. Bruder from approximately 10.00 am - 4.00 pm
      on 3rd May.

      P.C. Bruder told the Officer that he didn't want to see Kevin's parents but if
      they wished to meet with him then he would be prepared to meet them anywhere.
      (W.B. When the West Midlands Officer visited Mr. and Mrs. Williams the same
      day he informed chsm that P.C. Bruder would not see them).

     P.C. Bruder stated the reasons behind the West Midlands Officer visiting him when
     he stated "when he came down to see me it. was with a brief - to get me to change
     my mind."

     In response to whether or not he would be prepared to make another statement, P.C.
     Bruder replied that he would be prepared to stand up in Court and state that Kevin
     was convulsing, that there was a pulse and that there was vomit in his mouth.

     Asked whether or not Kevin was alive when he got to him, P.C. Bruder replied
     "there was a pulse and if that means he was alive then he was alive."

     When P.C. Bruder left Kevin he was certain that he was dead. He himself vomited
     and then went home. He destroyed all the clothes he was wearing on that day. He
     stated that he has never received any counselling and has dealt with the disaster
     "in his own way."

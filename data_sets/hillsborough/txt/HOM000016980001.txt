Dear Mr Loyden

Thank you for your letter of 24 May, which I
have shown to Lord Justice Taylor.

Lord Justice Taylor has directed that the West
Midlands Police, who have been preparing
evidence for his Inquiry, should invite you to
make a full statement to them of your
experiences at Hillsborough Stadium on 15
April. Arrangements have therefore been made
for officers from the West Midlands Police to
contact you for this purpose.

                                Yours sincerely

          Dear Mr Whalley,

   ^ W i t h reference to your letter of May 12 in reply to mine of ■
       May 11 in which I said I wished to give evidence to the Hillsborough
       Inquiry.
          The nature of the evidence is based on my experience at the Lepping
          Road entrance when I became trapped in the crowds waiting to gain
          entry to the Stadium.   The pressure of the crowdspropelled me to the
          gate which was opened.   I was one body away from the gate at the
          time it was opened,   I had earlier spoken to a mounted policeman.

          I witnessed the flood into the entrance and the dispersal of the
          fans go to various parts of the Stadium.    The game had started
          and I witnessed the beginning of what turned out to be a maj or
          tragedy.  I will not go into detail about these events since it
          would take some time.  I feel that the best way of giving evidence
          is directly to the Inquiry, and I hope you will agree.

          As a football fan for more than 40 years, I feel I have a
          clear responsibility to contribute to your proceedings.

Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to thank you
for your letter of 11 May, in which you say
that you would like to give evidence to the

instance, you might like to let him know in
writing the nature of the evidence which you

like to write to me at the above address, I
will see that Lord Justice Taylor sees your
letter straightaway.                ,

I SAW PEOPLE SHOUTING FOR HELP AND A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER WITH GREY HAIR
STOOD ON THE FENCE AND SHOUTED AT PEOPLE TO GET BACK, HE DID NOT SEEM TO
REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I THINK THAT THE MATCH HAD ALREADY STARTED BY
THEN.PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED AND I LATER SAW A MAN ON THE FLOOR WITH SOME
STUFF COMING OUT OF HIS MOUTH, I THINK HE WAS DEAD. AT ABOUT 13 MINS AFTER
THE CRUSH I WENT BACK UP THE TUNNEL AND I SAW TWO ROWS OF POLICEMEN STANDING
THERE, THERE WERE ABOUT 16 OF THEM.I SHOUTED AT THEM THAT PEOPLE WERE DYING

                 SUPPORTERS JUST HANGING AROUND - NO-ONE SEEMED TO WANT TO GO INTO
                 THE MATCH UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. IF THEY HAD GONE INTO THE GROUND
                 WHEN THEY ARRIVED, THE PEOPLE WHO HAD TO ARRIVE LATE BECAUSE OF
                 THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION WOULDN'T HAVE MET WITH SUCH A SURGE. MY
                 TICKET WAS CHECKED AND THE CORNER WAS RIPPED OFF TO SHOW I WAS
                 SEARCHED.

THE SIGNS FOR WHERE TO GO WEREN'T VERY CLEAR, SO ANYONE COMING LATE WOULD
HAVE HAD DIFFICULTY FINDING THEIR WAY. AT THE TIME I GOT THERE I GOT ALL THE
ASSISTANCE I WANTED. WHEN I GOT INTO THE STAND, IT WAS VERY NOTICEABLE THAT
THERE WERE A LOT MORE NOTTS FOREST FANS IN THE GROUND. I WENT AND LOOKED OVER
THE BALCONY INTO THE PENS BELOW. I STAYED THERE WATCHING UNTIL THE TEAMS HAD
FINISHED THEIR KICK-AROUND, SO I MUST HAVE BEEN STOOD THERE FOR WELL OVER AN
HOUR. I COULD SEE THAT THE SIDE PENS WERE ALMOST EMPTY WHEREAS THE CENTRE
PEMS WERE ALREADY FULL. THERE WERE HARDLY ANY LIVERPOOL FANS IN THERE UNTIL
A ® i E A S T 2.45 - IT SEEMS TO BE A FAULT OF THE LIVERPOOL FANS I'M AFRAID THAT
THEY WAIT TIL THE LAST MINUTE TO GO INTO THE GROUND. WHAT I FOUND MOST
ANNOYING WAS THE LACK OF INFORMATION COMING OVER THE TANNOY. THE NOTTS FOREST
UNDERSTANDABLY THOUGHT THAT THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE JUST MESSING AROUND, AND
THEY WERE GETTING AGITATED OF COURSE - THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY NASTY
INCIDENT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE LINE OF POLICE OFFICERS ACROSS THE CENTRE
LINE. THE FANS HELPED WITH THE INJURED MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE, ALTHOUGH I
REMEMBER A YOUNG POLICEWOMAN TRYING TO PULL THE RAILINGS DOWN VERY EARLYT ON,
BUT NO-ONE WAS HELPING HER. WHEN WE GOT BACK TO THE COACHES SOME TIME LATER,
ABOUT 4.30, OUR COACH WAS ABOUT TWO THIRDS BACK IN NTHE QUEUE OF COACHES, SO
IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT A LOT MORE HAD ARRIVED AFTER US. IT BECAME APPARENT THAT
WE HAD A LAD MISSING FROM OUR COACH. I TOOK THAT LADS FRIEND TO A POLICEMAN
AS HIS MISSING FRIEND WAS WEARING VERY UNUSUAL CLOTHING. THE BOBBY TOLD ME HE
HAD NO RADIO AND NO WAY OF CONTACTING ANYONE WHICH WAS RIDICULOUS.

I WAS WITH A COACHLOAD OF FANS, BUT NO-ONE IN PARTICULAR.

                 ON AT THIS TIME. THERE WERE TWO POLICEMEN ON HORSES, THAT WAS NOT
                 ENOUGH TO CONTROL THE CROWDS. AT ABOUT 1420HRS AND 1440HRS WE
                 WERE ALL CONTINUALLY PUSHED AND SHOOVED. I SAWA YOUNG BOY WHO WAS

ON THE WAY THROUGH THE TURNSTILE I GAVE MY TKT TO A STEWARD BUT NOT EVERYBODY
DID. I KNOW THE GROUND SO I WAS ALRIGHT ON WHERE TO GO BUT PEOPLE WHO HAD
NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE HAD NO DIRECTIONAL SIGNS TO FOLLOW. I GOT TO THE LEFT
HAND SIDE OF THE TERRACES AT ABOUT 1450HRS. AS WE WERE COMING THROUGH THE
TURNSTILE I HEARD TAHT THE GATE WAS OPEN BUT I DIDNT SEE WHO OPENED IT. I SAW
WHEN THE GAME HAD STARTED THERE WAS A BIT OF PUSHING GOING ON BEHIND THE
GOAL. ABOUT 5 MINS AFTER KICK OFF I SAW A POLICEMAN GO ONTO THE PITCH SO I
THOUGHT THAT SOMETHING MAY BE WRONG.      THE FANS WERE CRUSHED IN THE PEN S , THEY
WBM| BEING CARRIED OVER THE CROWDS AND HANDED OVER THE FENCE ON TO THE PITCH.
T H M E SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND THERE WERE DEFINATELY
NOT ENOUGH. THERE WERE PLENTY OF POLICE OFFICERS INSIDE THE GROUND TO HELP
THE FANS BUT NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH ON THE OUTSIDE.

THE SIDE PENS, I ALSO OTHERS BEING PULLED UP FROM THE TERRACES INTO THE
UPPER STANDS.
THE MAJOR THING OVER ALL WAS THE LACK OF CROWD CONTROL, BY THE POLICE BUT
MAINLY THE STEWARDS. THE ONLY AREA THAT WAS CAUSING ANY PROBLEMS THAT DAY WAS
THE CENTRE PEN OF THE LEPPING LANE END.
THE THING I DIDN'T SEE THE CALL FOR WAS THE POLICE LINE ACROSS THE NORTH
STAND, PEOPLE FROM THEW NORTH STAND WERE TELLING THE POLICE TO GO AND HELP
THE FANS BUT THE DIDN'T, AND ALTHOUGH I COULD SEE THE NEED FOR THE POLICE
LINE ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH, I THOUGHT THTA THE POLICE LINE ACROSS
T : A NORTH STAND CAUSED ALOT OF ANGER.

THERE WAS NO ORDERLY QUEUE AT THE TURNSTYLES,THERE WAS ONE OFFICER ON EACH
TURNSTYLE SEARCHING FANS.ONCE INSIDE WE HAD TO FIND OUR SEAT LOCATION,THERE
WERE NO STEWARDS INSIDE THAT I COULD SEE.I COULD SEE THE LEPPING LANE END WAS
VERY PACKED IN THE MIDDLE AND THE OUTSIDE SECTIONS, THE SECTIONS TO THE SIDE
OF THE MIDDLE WAS FAIRLY PACKED,THE OUTER SECTIONS HAD SOME SPACE. THE
IMPRESSION I HAD WAS THAT THE POLICE TOOK THE SITUATION AS IT DEVELOPED AS A
RIOT RATHER THAN AN ACCIDENT,IT WAS NO FAULT OF THE BOBBY,S NOT THE
INDIVIDUAL.

TRYING TO PUSH THEM BACK OVER THE FENCE. IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE WERE
BEING CRUSHED, BUT THE POLICE DID NOT APPEAR TO NOTICE. PEOPLE THEN BEGAN TO
BE CARRIED ONTO THE PITCH ON STRECHERS AND THE POLICE THEN FORMED A BARRIER
ACROSS THE PITCH. THEY SEEMED MORE CONCERNED WITH CROWD CONTROL. OUTSIDE
THERE WERE DEAD BODIES LINED UP, I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

                                      WEST LANCASHIRE, . . .|
ARRIVED AT 2.45PM OUTSIDE HOPING TU SWOP TICKETS FROM STANDING TO SEATING BUT
CRUSH WAS TOO BIG TO DO THAT, LAST YEAR THERE WAS ONLY ABOUT 100 PEOPLE THIS
YEAR THERE MUST HAVE BEEN 2000 ALL TRYING TO GET IN AT ONCE.WE WERE QUEUEING
AGAINST THE POLICE HORSES, IT WAS NOT THE WORSE CRUSH I'VE BEEN IN, THEN THE
POLICE HORSE WAS PUSHING FROM THE BACK AND THE BLUE GATE OPENED ABOUT 5 TO
3,WE WENT STAIGHT IN WITH EVERYONE ELSE, I WENT TO THE TIOLET AT THE LEFT OF
THE TUNNEL AND THEN JOINED THE PEOPLE IN THE TUNNEL TO GET ONTO THE TERRACES,
THE CRUSH WAS SO GREAT WE WERE FORCED TO THE FRONT, I'M 16 ST AND 6 FT TALL,
AND I WAS CAUGHT ON THE CORNER OF THE BARRIER THAT COLLAPSED, THE FORCE OF
PEOPLE ROUND ME WAS TERRIBLE,MY FRIEND WAS SHOUTING FOR HELP,CLIMBED OVER THE
BODIES LYING IN FRONT OF THE GATE AND WAS PULLED OUT, THE POLICEMAN ON THE
GATE WAS SHOUTING TO ME TO HOLD PEOPLE BACK,THE TWO LADS IN FRONT OF ME WERE
ALIVE WHEN THEY WERE PULLED OUT BUT THERE WAS MORE PEOPLE UNDER THEM, I
PANICKED THEN AND MY LEGS WERE CAUGHT, A BALDY POLICEMAN WITH GLASSES PULLED
MJ*pUT AND I WANDERED ONTO THE PITCH IN A DAZE. I HAVE A LOT OF BRUISING BUT
I m D NOT GO TO HOSPITAL.
I THINK THE POLICE WERE TO BLAME FOR THE BAD ORGANIZATION.

DIRECT PEOPLE WHO HADNT BEEN THERE BEFORE. I MADE MY WAY TO THE NORTH STAND
AND WHEN THE GAME HAD KICKED OFF I SAW PEOPLE SPILLING ONTO THE PITCH. ABOUT
5 MINUTES LATER A LAD WALKED PAST US WITH A BROKEN ARM REALLY DISTRESSED, AND
I COULD SEE PEOPLE BEING CARRIED OUT. AT THIS TIME ABOUT 50 POLICE MEN CAME
ONTO THE PITCH AND JUST STOOD AT THE HALF WAY MARK. I SCREAMED AT THEM TO
HELP BUT THEY JUST STOOD THERE. I THEN TORE DOWN SOME HOARDINGS AND WITH A
MATE RAN TO THE LEPPINGS LANE END. WHEN I GOT THERE THERE WERE A LINE OF
BODIES WITH THEIR FACES COVERED WHO WERE DEAD. I THEN HELPED TO STRETCHER
PEOPLE TO AMBULANCES FOR I DONT KNOW HOW LONG.

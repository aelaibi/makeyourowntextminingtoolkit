                        My Lords,

                                 The appellants a re th e parents of two girls, Sarah and
                        Victoria Hicks, who died in th e d isaste r a t Hillsborough Football
                        Stadium on 15 April 1989 when they w ere respectively 19 and 15
                        years of age.      In this action they claim dam ages under th e Law
                        Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) A ct 1934 for th e b en efit of the
                        e s ta te of each daughter of which th e y a re in each case the
                        adm inistrators.    The respondent is the C hief C onstable of South
                        Yorkshire who does not c o n te s t his liability to persons who
                        suffered damage in th e d isaste r. The basis of th e claim advanced
                        here is th a t a t th e m om ent of death Sarah and Victoria each had
                        an accrued cause of action fo r injuries suffered prior to death
                        which survived for th e benefit of th e ir resp ectiv e e s ta te s . The
                        action was trie d by Hidden 3 . who held th a t th e plaintiffs had
                        failed to prove th a t e ith e r girl suffered before death any injury
                        for which damages fell to be aw arded. His decision was affirm ed
                        by th e Court of Appeal (Parker, Stocker and Nolan L .JJ.). Appeal
                        is now brought to your Lordships' House by leave of th e C ourt of
                        Appeal.

                                No one can fe e l anything but the g re a te s t sympathy for th e
                        relativ es of those who died in the d isaste r, th e circu m stan c es of
which a re now all too well known. The anguish of p a re n ts caused
by th e death in such a horrifying e v e n t of sons and daughters who
were on the very threshold of life m ust indeed have been alm ost
unbearable. But the common law has never awarded dam ages for
the pain of bereavem ent. The A dm inistration of J u s tic e A ct 1982
section 3(1), by substitution of section 1A of the F inance A ct
1976, introduced such a claim for th e firs t tim e in th e fixed sum
of £3,500 (subsequently increased by sta tu to ry instrum ent to
£7,500) but only for the b en efit of a spouse in re s p e c t of ~.he
d e a th of the o th e r spouse or for th e benefit of p aren ts in respect
of th e death of a minor child.            The sam e A ct, by section 1,
abolished th e right to an award of dam ages in a conventional sum
for th e benefit of th e e s ta te of th e deceased under th e A ct of
1934 in respect of th e deceased 's loss of expectation of life, save
to th e limited ex te n t provided by section l(l)(b), which is not here
relev an t.    Such conventional aw ards had long been fe lt to be
anom alous.     In resp ect of th e d eaths of Sarah and V ictoria th e re
was no dependency and hence no claim under the F a ta l A ccidents
A cts.     Thus, a p a rt from a b erea v em en t claim under th e A ct of
1982 in resp ect of Victoria, a claim for dam ages in re sp e c t of
injuries suffered before death was th e only claim which Mr. and
Mrs. Hicks could bring.

        This action and another action tried by Hidden J . a t th e
sam e tim e, which also failed and has not been pursued beyond the
C ourt of Appeal, w ere said to be t e s t cases which would affo rd
guidance in relation to o th e r sim ilar claim s arising out of the
Hillsborough disaster. We w ere assured by counsel, and I have no
reason to doubt it, th a t th e action was not brought for th e sake
of th e money t h a t may be aw arded but ra th e r to m ark th e anger
of th e se parents and other bereaved relatives a t w hat occurred.
But w hatever justification th e re may be for th a t anger has no
relevance to dam ages in a civil actio n for negligence, which are
com pensatory, not punitive.

           The difficulty which im m ediately confronts th e appellants in
this House is th a t th e question w hat injuries Sarah and Victoria
suffered before death was purely one of fa c t and Hidden J .'s
conclusion on th e evidence th a t th e plaintiffs had failed to
discharge th e onus of proving any such injury sufficient to a t t r a c t
an aw ard of dam ages was a finding of f a c t affirm ed by th e Court
of Appeal. The appellants m ust th e re fo re persuade your Lordships
to rev erse those concurrent findings if they a re to succeed.            Mr.
H ytner says t h a t th e prim ary f a c ts were not in dispute and
subm its, th e re fo re , th a t th e House is in as good a position as th e
c o u rts b e b w to draw th e proper inferences from those prim ary
f a c ts . But th is submission ignores th e special re stra in t w ith which
th e House approaches findings of f a c t which are co n cu rren t.        In
Higgins v. J. & C. M. Smith (Whiteinch) Ltd., 1990 S.C. (H.L.) 63,
Lord Jauncey of T ullichettle, in a speech with which th e re s t of
th e ir Lordships agreed, said a t p. 82:

       "Where th e re are concurrent findings of fa c t in th e courts
       below generally this House will in te rfe re with those findings
       only w here it can be shown t h a t both courts w ere clearly
       wrong. It is nothing to the point th a t this House might on
       th e evidence have reached a d iffe re n t conclusion, . . . The
       principle does not depend upon the advantage possessed by
       the judge of firs t instance of seeing and hearing the



                                      2
       w itnesses - th a t advantage will already have been re f le c te d
       in th e decision of th e lower a p p e lla te c o u rt to confirm the
       findings of th e judge.1’

          This s ta te m e n t of principle in a S co ttish appeal a c c u ra te ly
re fle c ts previous a u th o rity to th e like e f f e c t in an English appeal
(see The Owners of the "P. Caland" and F reight v. Glamorgan
Steamship Co. Ltd. [1893] A.C. 207) and clearly applies to
concurrent inferences of f a c t w hether or no t th e prim ary f a c ts are
in dispute.

         The evidence h ere showed t h a t both girls died from
tra u m a tic asphyxia.  They w ere in th e pens a t one end o f the
Hillsborough Stadium to which access was through a tunnel some
23 m e tres in length.       When the pens w ere already seriously
overcrowded a g re a t num ber of additional sp e c ta to rs, anxious to
see the football m a tch which was about t o s ta r t , w ere a d m itte d
through th e turnstiles and surged through th e tunnel causing th e
dreadful crush in th e pens in which 95 people died.                  M edical
evidence which th e judge acc ep ted was to th e e f f e c t th a t in cases
of death from tr a u m a tic asphyxia caused by crushing the victim
would lose consciousness within a m a t t e r of seconds from th e
crushing of the c h e s t which c u t off th e ability to b re a th e and
would die within 5 m inutes.       There was no indication in th e post
m ortem reports on e ith e r girl of physical injuries a ttrib u ta b le to
anything other than th e f a t a l crushing which caused th e asphyxia,
save, in th e case of Sarah, some superficial bruising which, on the
evidence, could have        occurred e ith e r b efo re or a f t e r loss of
consciousness. Hidden J . was not satisfied th a t any physical injury
had been sustained b efo re w hat he described as th e "sw ift and
sudden [death] as shown by the m edical evidence." Unless th e law
w ere to distinguish b etw ee n death within seconds of injury and
unconsciousness within seconds of injury followed by death within
minutes, which I do n o t understand to be suggested, th e se findings,
as Hidden J. him self said "with regret," m ade it impossible fo r him
to award any dam ages.

        Mr. H ytner sought to persuade your Lordships, as he sought
to persuade the C o u rt of Appeal, th a t on th e whole of the
evidence the judge ought to have found on a                    balance of
probabilities th a t th e r e was a gradual build up of pressure on th e
bodies of the           tw o  girls causing     increasing breathlessness,
d iscom fort and pain from which they suffered fo r some 20 m inutes
before th e final crushing injury which produced unconsciousness.
This should have led, he subm itted, to th e conclusion th a t they
sustained injuries which caused considerable pain and suffering
while they w ere s till conscious and which should a t t r a c t a
substantial award of dam ages.             The C o u rt of Appeal, in a
judgment delivered by P a rk e r L.J. w ith which both         S tocker and
Nolan L .J J . agreed, care fu lly reviewed th e evidence and concluded,
in ag re e m e n t w ith Hidden J ., th a t it did not establish th a t any
physical injury was caused before the f a ta l crushing injury.         I do
not intend myself to em bark on a detailed review of the evidence.
In the circu m stan ces I think it su fficien t to say        th a t, in my
opinion, th e conclusion of fa c t reached by Hidden J . and the C ourt
of Appeal was fairly open to them and it is impossible to say th a t
they w ere wrong.




                                        3
            A good deal of argum ent in th e courts below and before
your Lordships was addressed to th e question w hether dam ages for
physical injuries should be increased on account of th e terrifying
c ircu m stan c es in which they w ere inflicted. This may depend on
difficult questions of causation.         But on th e fa c ts found in this
c a se the question does not arise for decision. It is p e rfe c tly clear
law th a t fear by itself, of w h atev er degree, is a norm al human
em otion for which no dam ages can be aw arded. Those trapped in
th e crush a t Hillsborough who w ere fo rtu n a te enough to escape
w ithout injury have no claim in resp ect of the d istre ss they
suffered in w hat must have been a tru ly terrifying ex p erien ce. It
follows th a t fe a r of impending d e a th fe lt by th e victim of a fa ta l
injury b efore t h a t injury is inflicted can n o t by itself give rise to a
cause of action which survives for th e b en efit of th e v ictim 's
e s ta te .

       I would dismiss the appeal.

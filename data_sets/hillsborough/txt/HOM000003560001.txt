PS/Baroness Blatch (Mr Roberts^

DAVID ALTON MP: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL

Issue
Enclosed letter of 14 October from David Alton MP to the Health Secretary, passed by DH
at official level to the Home Office late last month. The case is a distressing one, involving
the                                                                               the
Hillsborough stadium disaster in 1989.

Timing
2.   To send replies now, if Ministers are content.

Recommendation
3.    Baroness Blatch to write to Mr Alton as in enclosed draft A,and PS/MofS to write
to DH as enclosed draft B.

Summary
4.     Mr Alton wrote to the Prime Minister earlier in the year and received a reply,drafted
in VSU, dated 30 August. A copy is enclosed for ease of reference. Mr Alton's letter of 14
October follows a meeting Mr Alton and Mrs Ann Winterton MP had with the Secretary of
State for Health on 27 June on the subject of euthanasia, and although the very detailed letter
Mrs Bottomley sent to the two MPs on 12 July included a



5.     The point at issue in the correspondence with the Prime Minister, which also seems
to DH and to me to be the main issue in the present correspondence, is the administration of
the disaster fund for victims and bereaved relatives from Hillsborough.

                                   The position on that was, however, carefully set out in the
Prime Minister's reply and is that the main fund was established as a private rather than a
charitable fund: it is not, therefore, a matter for Ministers or for the Charity Commission and
would have to be contested through the courts. Mr Alton's letter of 28 July, enclosed with
the new correspondence, was considered when we drafted the PM's reply in August.

6.     Although there is, therefore, a great deal of background to this case, the reply should
be reasonably straightforward in referring back to the Prime Minister's reply.
Presentation I handling
7.      I have dealt with Hillsborough before, in Police Department, when the disaster took
place, and was among the Home Office officials to give evidence on policy issues to Lord
Justice Taylor's inquiry; I was present when Lord Ferrers met with bereaved parents of
Hillsborough victims. This is clearly a very distressing case for the parents of
         and the proposed reply is appropriately sympathetic.

D raft A: Baroness Blatch to David Alton. MP

Thank you for your letter of 14 October to Virginia Bottomley, enclosing one from solicitors
E Rex Makin and Company of Whitechapel, Liverpool LI 1HQ about                              who
                             in the Hillsborough stadium disaster. As I believe you know, the
Department of Health copied the correspondence to the Home Office last month. I am sorry
you have not had an earlier substantive reply.


I have also seen a copy of John Major's letter to you on 30 August and I would wholly
endorse his admiration for                         ?ravery and dedication in respect of
in very difficult and distressing circumstances.


Nevertheless, as I understand it the main point arising from your letter of 14 October is the
administration of the Hillsborough disaster fund. The position on that remains as set out in
John Major's letter, and I am afraid there is nothing further I can usefully add to what he said.
D raft B:       PS/Baroness Blatch to K Menicou. Diary Clerk to SofS for
Health

TH E PRIME MINISTER

      Thank you for your letter of 28 July I have the utmost sympathy for




                            and I have great admiration for the bravery and
dedication they have shown.


       There was enormous public sympathy following the Hillsborough
disaster, in consequence of which such a very substantial and impressive sum of
money was donated. As you appreciate, in such a situation those responsible
for administering the money have some discretion over the terms under which a
trust or trusts are established. Guidance has been published which can be of
assistance in these circumstances, and this may have been taken into account by
the trustees of the Hillsborough funds.


       One option is to establish a charitable fund, which would bring the
monies within the remit of the law on charities, and would place the
organisation concerned (which would be a charity) under the supervision of the
Charity Commission. However, as the trustees explained to you (as recorded in
your letter of 28 July to                       , that can have significant
limitations in the way the money can be applied. A considered decision is
necessary, taking the advantages and disadvantages of both into account. The
Government considers that both types of trust have their place in providing for
the allocation of resources.
      Where a non-charitable, discretionary trust is established, its status is the
same in law as any other private trust. As a non-charitable private fund, the
use of the money is the responsibility of the trustees under the law as it relates
to private trusts. Trustees of private trusts are responsible for the
administration and distribution of the money and property pertaining to the trust
within the terms of their trust deeds and the law. However, they do have the
authority, within those constraints and subject to limitations on their powers of
investment, to make judgements about how the money is used. Such
judgements in the case of any disaster fund will be complicated and difficult,
the allocation between short term and long term needs, for example, may well
be an issue the trustees should properly consider.


       I have considered carefully whether private trusts should be further
 regulated, but I am not convinced that there is a general need for such
 legislation. The Government is not better placed to take decisions about the
 disposal of funds than the trustees concerned, or the courts. Indeed if the
 Government were to seek to place legislative constraints on the actions of
 private trustees, this might well prevent the imaginative and efficient use of
 resources which discretionary funds can allow.


        In the case of private trusts, where someone who considers he or she has
 a claim to the money disputes how it has been administered, the proper course
  of action would be to pursue the matter in the courts. With this in mind, I am
  afraid it would not be right for me to comment on the actions of the trustees in
  this particular instance.

       Thank you for your letter of 14 October to Virginia Bottomley enclosing one from
       solicitors E Rex Makin & Co. of Whitechapel, Liverpool LI 1HQ about the case of
       Hillsborough victim                  I have been asked to reply.

       I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but as you know we did not originally
       have the full set of papers on the case.

       Having considered the full submission, it appears that the point at issue which E Rex
       Makin & Co. is pursuing on behalf of                      is the administration and use of
       the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund. This is properly a matter for the Home Office,
       not the Department of Health, and I am forwarding the correspondence to them.

       I hope this is helpful.

28th July, 1994



Dear

I promised you that 1 would seek a meeting with Mr.Reddington and the
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Trustees.     On Wednesday morning I met Mr.
Reddington, Derek Morris, and Michael Blankstone and spend 90 minutes In
fairly Intensive discussion and not little disagreement.

The principal points which I raised centered on the Issues you brought up
with me during our meeting. I complained about the absence of a contingency
fund, the lack of accountability, the arbitrariness of the dispensations, and
the failure to consider
I also raised the general management of Disaster Funds and the lessons which
might be learned for the future.

At the end of our meeting there had been little common ground but there was
certainly   no  doubt   about your strength of feeling      concerning  the
administration of the Trust Fund.

I challenged the basis on which a Descretlonary Trust was established and the
secrecy which has accompanied Its administration.     They countered this by
claiming that they had consulted widely with all those Involved In previous
disaster funds (e.g. Bradford) and that the most Important consideration for
them had been "flexibility''.

They cited the example of the Abbervan Disaster Fund, which had been a
Charitable Trust Fund, and they claimed that the Trustees had been so tied by
the terms of reference of the Charitable Trust that they simply "couldn't get
rid of the money".

They admitted that this led to them paying ,tax on the interest generated by
the Â£11.6 million in the discretionary fund. However, they also claim that
they came to an unofficial arrangement with the Exchequer and the interest
was ultimately transferred to the Charitable Trust.    The Charitable Trust
totalled about Â£2 million (1600,000 from donations, Â£375,000 from interest
Â£340,000 from the unpaid tax, and Â£626.000 which was transferred). Of this,
Â£100,000 remains which has not been distributed.     I suggested that this
should be used to set up a contingency fund, from which annuities could be
paid and help given                      become clear.
I specifically complained about the use of money for residuary purposes while
there are victims families who are still in need. MrÂ» Morris commented at
this point*   I can understand that point of view and it is not one we
overlooked." However, it was clearly one with which he disagreed and he and
Mr. Reddington made a point of saying that there had been "no objection from
consultantees." I specifically asked who had been representing the views of
the injured and he said that there was no group. 1 asked whether you had
been consulted and, of course, he had to confirm that you had not.

I also made a point, at Robin's suggestion       (and he was good enough to
provide me with a superb brief), about the way in which (aubstantial parts of
the Trust money had been dissipated in legal actions. The               ^Â«v â¢id

spent.

Although th.y Â« r . full rf 1 1 ch.            tÂ£Â«
say that they satisfactorily addressed the p            ln the hope that he
going to copy this correspondence to ^ * Prlâe to consider the handling of
might ask the appropriate Government Minister to consxae
future Trust Funds set up in the wake of disasters.

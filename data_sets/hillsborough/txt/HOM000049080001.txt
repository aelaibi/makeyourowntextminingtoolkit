 1                                                Wednesday,    8th October,   19 97
 2   LORD                                You represented yourself at the
 3          inquest, did you not?
 4   MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes,    I did.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Having read some of your
 6          cross-examination you seem to have done a pretty good job,
 7          if I may say so.
 8   MRS. McBRIEN:      Thank you very much.         Can you hear me?
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Yes,    I can hear you.
10   MRS. McBRIEN:      My voice is affected because of my cold I have
11          had, normally I would be speaking much louder than I am.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I am not sure whether you sent me a
13          letter earlier on, because I, as it were, had not got you
14          down on the list to come and see me until recently I am
15          afraid I have not re-read that letter.              But I am sure you
16          can tell me in your own words what your principal points
17          are and what your worries a r e .
18   MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes, the reason â€”         I don't remember us being
19          told how to get in touch with you to make these
20          appointments really.         So this is why I hadn't made an
21          appointment.       There may have be an announcement at the
22          meetings that I attended, but, you know, no telephone
23          number was given or any arrangements so I would have made
24          an appointment to see you definitely.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          Never mind, you are here now.
26   MRS. McBRIEN:      I am glad now that I am here today.            I have, you
27          know, brought a lot of things I have.              You have read the
28          letters that I sent, have you?
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:           I have read them, yes,      I have not
30          read them today or yesterday,          I have read them in the
31          past.    So they will be on the file and I will read them
32          again.    But what would be helpful is if you could just
33          tell me as shortly and clearly as you can what the points
34          are that you want to make.
35   MRS. McBRIEN:      I know it's difficult to put in a very concise
36          form because I am sure you understand it has taken me


                                             2
 1         years to    do the work I have in relation to t h i s .     I was
 2         teaching    at the time of the disaster and the amount       of
 3         work I've put in in this is quite colossal actually.              The
 4         amount of time that I've spent travelling to Sheffield.                 I
 5         gave four and a half months up of my life for the inquests
 6         alone.
 7   MR.   BONE:    You went every day, didn't you?
 8   MRS. McBRIEN:      I did,      yes.   All that, the expenditure of        it all
 9         and you do this but you don't get paid for it.            Personally
10         I think it's a pity that we've had to go through all this
11         because I didn't ever commit a crime myself, all I did was
12         send my son â€”     I allowed him to go to a football match in
13         1989 and I thought I was sending him as if he was going to
14         school really.        I felt that he was going to be safe that
15         day and that he was going to return home.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Horrendous thing to happen?
17   MRS. McBRIEN:      The shock of all that, to lose somebody so young
18         in those kind of circumstances I really â€”        you know,       the
19         suffering we have gone through it cannot be put down on
20         paper.     I just wouldn't begin to be able what it's done to
21         us really.     So there's that side of it.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Even if did not understand before I
23         came up here certainly I understand now that I have talked
24         to so many of you.
25   MRS. McBRIEN:      Having said that I have never been interested in
26         finding out too much about what happened to John in the
27         mortuary and places like that, things like that.            As I
28         say, the suffering anyway has been tremendous.            So those
29         kinds of details, although we should have been entitled to
30         have those details, that doesn't worry me really.            I
31         wouldn't like to go through another inquest and have more
32         of those details before me.
33                 All I've ever been concerned about was why John
34         didn't come home from that match, the cause of it.            That;
35         is was what I have concentrated on from day 1 really and
36         to me it seems so simple, but I am not a lawyer.            I have


                                           3
had no training in legal matters.                I can only go as a
mother and, you know, what I feel went wrong.                I don't
know much about football, very little in fact.                I had no
interest I would say or very, very little.               John enjoyed
football,    he loved going to the matches and I didn't stop
him doing that because it was a part of his life but I
personally, you know, didn't take an awful lot of interest
in football.
        But I do understand management because I was a
teacher     and I have been in charge very often of an entire
school.    I did supply teaching and if the headmaster was
away I'd be sometimes put in charge of the school.                 That
takes c o n tr o l. You are in c o n t r o l .   So I understand
responsibility,      I understand management and those are the
things I that have concentrated in relation to
Hillsborough.
        I see it as a criminal act, the opening of Gate C or
the opening of exit gates,          as simply as that.       That is my
theory.     That is what I believe and I won't change my mind
about that.      Nobody can convince me otherwise.
        I am not thinking as the see other people in the
Hillsborough Family Support Group.               I have been under
tremendous pressure from then,           even at inquest they didn't
want me to say what I was saying because they believe that
it was all right to open exit gates.               They say that was
all right providing the fans had been diverted once inside
the ground.      My line of thinking is totally different and
to me that was where it went wrong, that is what caused
John's     death to me.      That is it really.
        I'm quite sure that if somebody else would have given
â€”   would have opened those exit gates to allow entry to
fans those people would have been prosecuted and we would
have had plenty of evidence on the tapes and the
photographs to show who had done it.               But we know who did
it.     I know who gave the order to open the exit g a t e s .
BONE:     Do you know when your son went into the ground, at
 1         what time?
 2   MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes,   I do.     I mean that again is â€”    that does
 3         cause a little problem really.          He was waiting at the
 4         turnstile and knowing John and the way I had trained him
 5         he would never do      anything which was dishonest.       I know we
 6         live in â€”     I call   it quite a wicked world     and adevious
 7         world really but I trained them to be very honest.            He
 8         would never want to go into a football match without
 9         showing his ticket.         He would know it was wrong.
10                 I can almost feel what happened to him that day.            He
11         did go into gate through Gate C.
12   MR.   BONE:    He went in    through Gate C?
13   MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes, he   did.
14   MR.   BONE:    He could only do that because the police had opened
15         it?
16   MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes.
17   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I do not think there is any
18         criticism of him for going through Gate C.
19   MRS. McBRIEN:      No, there's never been criticism of John going
20         but I know John would have felt very troubled at that.               He
21         moved away from the turnstiles because somebody he was
22         with was, you know, finding it a bit difficult out there
23         and he suffered with asthma,          so John moved with this other
24         person. He would have been able to stand in the queue
25         himself and would have just stayed there, whatever gates
26         would have opened John would have definitely gone in the
27         right manner.       He would know what was correct and what was
28         not correct. But if police, you know, allow you through
29         it's a different matter,         isn't it, I suppose.
30                 But I just feel he was feeling guilty himself that
31         day.     The reason I say that is because he went to the
32         toilet when he went and a number of his friends have said
33         that he was a long time, which, you know, he would be keen
34         to go in.     But he must have been so worried because he had
35         all of his ticket on him when he died.           He didn't have the
36         portion of it, a part taken off.           So that would be making


                                             5
 1        him, all the day I'm sure he would be very tense and
 2        worried that he'd done something wrong I feel.              So that
 3        d i d n 't help him that day I 'm s u r e .
 4              But the opening of the gates anyway, you know, why?
 5        That was the correct procedure, that was how the ground
 6        was designed by the engineer, you were to fill the ground
 7        up gradually,    standing areas and seating areas filled at a
 8        certain rate of     flow to make it safe.        They had   exceeded
 9        the speed limit     dramatically     by opening three exit gates
10        and the turnstiles were still operating at the same time.
11        Now that is the     a tremendous influx of fans all         at once.
12              I have got    photographs of the pens and the         state of
13        them after the opening of Gate C but I have not shown them
14        to anyone.     I got them from the police,         I just told them I
15        wanted see John no matter what the circumstances,             I wanted
16        pictures of him and I did manage to get those photographs
17        showing the tremendous overcrowding that took place,               it
18        doubled, the numbers doubled in minutes.
19              I have got all the figures in my notes.            I can't
20        remember them off---
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The capacity of those two pens
22        between them was about supposed to be about 2,200.              They
23        opened the gates and I think the estimate was that another
24        2,000 came in through the gates and, undoubtedly, the bulk
25        of them went into those two pens.             So there were a great
26        m any more people in there than there should have been?
27   MRS. McBRIEN:     The reason they'd go to the side pens, the
28        standing area as well was popular.            Any real supporter
29        liked to stand on the t e r r a c e s .   I know when I wrote to
30        Lord Justice Taylor at the time and he wanted
31        recommendations for safety at grounds for the future I am
32        sorry that I wrote and said I would like to see all seater
33        stadiums.      I am so sorry about it because I was not
34        right.   It was not the terraces that caused the disaster,
35        because John was standing on a terrace did not cause his
36        death.



                                           6
 1                 If those standing areas had been filled correctly,
 2         like they had been done in 1988, everything would have
 3         been all right.     People,   if they were going in at the
 4         right rate, would have been allowed to walk down the
 5         tunnel and see that they were full and have enough room to
 6         go back out of the tunnel.          The tunnel was meant to be
 7         open because you could have anything happening on the
 8         terrace and you needed a means of escape anyway.           So you
 9         couldn't block a tunnel off.          This business of the other
10         people saying:     "The tunnel should have been blocked off."
11   MR.   BONE:    They should have shut the gates is what some people
12         say.
13   MRS . McBRIEN:     Shut which gates?
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The gates to the tunnel.     I do not
15         think that was a very good idea but what they ought to
16         have done was to put a police cordon across it.
17   MRS. McBRIEN:     Yes, but you can only do it for so long because
18         if people want to go to the toilet they would have free
19         movement in and out of there.          If they want to go an move
20         to another place.
21   MR.   BONE:    But then the police cordon could have let people
22         come have let people come out from the tunnel into the
23         concourse to go to the toilet or to go to the side p e n s .
24         All the police cordon would have done would be to stop
25         people coming through the cordon into the tunnel.
26   MRS. McBRIEN:     Yes, but it would be very difficult to manage a
27         crowd of 2,000,    even the police standing at the entrance
28         to that tunnel that day could have ended down the tunnel
29         themselves.     I think it would have been virtually
30         impossible to do it really myself.          I mean the ground was
31         not designed to do that.
32                 It was so simple.     If you â€”   the rate of flow was
33         supposed to be 750 fans per hour per turnstile at an
34         ordinary match, but at an all-ticket match, which that
35         was, they would be coming in at a rate of 1,000 per hour,
36         instead 2,000 came in in minutes,         from 2.52 up to 3.0 3 or


                                           7
 1         something like that, you know, a very short period anyway.
 2         1,000    per hour,   it's a very differ rate of flow.
 3                 It's like driving on the road.         Very often accidents
 4         are caused not because they're just accidents,             human error
 5         or mechanical failure s o m e ti m es .    This was human error
 6         really.     The only recommendation I should have made when I
 7         wrote to Lord Justice Taylor was that exit gates should
 8         never be opened, but that is the rule anyway.              That was
 9         the rule in the Green Guide so you didn't have to
10         recommend that that was the case because it was already.
11         They didn't follow the rules.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I think they realised that the
13         gates should not be opened          but they judged, rightly or
14         wrongly, the situation was          so critical outside.
15   MRS. McBRIEN:      It was not, not really.         I was there four and       a
16         half months,    I listened to       everybody who gave evidence and
17         not one witness,     not one person came forward to say that
18         he had even been bruised outside.            Nobody was taken to
19         hospital outside.      Nobody would have died outside.
20                 The police operational order was strictly to keep out
21         people who were drunk, who were without tickets, they do
22         turn up at matches but they are not football supporters
23         who are allowed into the ground.          The police's job is
24         primarily to keep them out.          You do not open gates.
25                 You have to know how m a n y people attend a match,        it
26         is important to know the numbers who were allowed in the
27         ground that day and you couldn't count them if they came
28         in through the gates at rate.          The turnstiles go     'click',
29         it's like these revolving doors,          it's a slow movement.
30         It's the rate, the colossal rate of flow.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       You think it was Superintendent
32         Marshall who made the critical mistake?
33   MRS. McBRIEN:      I do, really, yes,      I do.
34   MR.   BONE:     He was the man outside the ground?
35   MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes.    I don't think it's down to just one man
36         but it is, as I have said before,         if you're put in a


                                           8
 1        position of responsibility you are in charge, the buck
 2        stops at you really,        doesn't it?
 3                I don't know      if you watched     Jimmy McGovern's   "The
 4        Lakes",    i t 's a very powerful drama,      it's very, very good
 5        and in that there         is a headmaster who leaves his class of
 6        children and some         of them go out     onto the lake and are
 7        killed.     He is clearly responsible,       he was in a position
 8        of responsibility.        I mean straightaway being a teacher I
 9        think,    "Oh, my goodness,      fancy doing that."    You've got
10        those people's lives, you can't risk people's lives, you
11        just can't do it.        They are very, very valuable these
12        people,    individuals.
13                As a mass it's frightening,        I would be a bit scared
14        seeing so many people but 800 police or whatever,           about
15        800 that day, they got it right in 1988, same number,               same
16        teams were playing, Nottingham and Liverpool, the same
17        allocation of tickets.          John was standing on the terrace
18        in 1988 at Leppings Lane, he came home.            He went in
19        through a turnstile and everybody else did that day.            I
20        mean I hear people in the group say,           "Oh, people were in
21        difficulty that year",         I don't remember John mentioning
22        anything.
23                Always if you are in a crowd and you are close to
24        someone,    I mean,    it's going to be slightly uncomfortable,
25        boys, young men.        I go to auctions,    I go to antique
26        auctions and I see men standing, they don't like to sit
27        down.     You know the younger a person is they like to do
28        things in a certain way and when you are that age you like
29        to be â€”     that is the way -- not an old lady w h o 's going to
30        have a seat, this is why I'm in favour of terraces coming
31        back really,       I am, because I think the spirit has gone out
32        of football myself.        I wouldn't dare say that at the
33        meetings.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          You attended Lord Taylor's Inquiry,
35        did you?
36   MRS. McBRIEN:     No,   I didn't,    sir.   At the time we were so



                                            9
 1         dreadfully affected by it that that was totally out of the
 2         question.
 3   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I am not saying for a moment that
 4         you are wrong about this but at Lord Taylor's Inquiry Mr.
 5         Hytner, who was appearing for most of the families,
 6         actually,    specifically said on two occasions that he was
 7         not criticising Mr. Marshall for asking for the gates to
 8         be opened.
 9   MRS. McBRIEN:      He stated that?
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Yes, he did, yes.
11   MRS. McBRIEN:      Oh.    He was acting for the families,   I know, but
12         I represented by myself, you see.
13   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        At the inquest?
14   MRS. McBRIEN:      Yes.     I didn't go along the lines that Tim King
15         was going,    I was on a different tangent altogether,
16         really.     He was blaming the groundsmen for the disaster,
17         whereas I was blaming human error.
18   MR.   BONE:     You asked the Coroner some questions about opening
19         the gate, did you not?        Or asked Marshall some questions
20         at the inquest?
21   MRS. McBRIEN:      I haven't got it all in my head now and you
22         couldn't ask incriminating questions anyway,        I had to be
23         very, very careful what I said because I had no legal
24         training whatsoever.
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         It must be very difficult for you.
26   MRS. McBRIEN:      It was very difficult,    I had nobody behind me
27         helping me.        I had to make up the questions as they came
28         to me, really, now that was very difficult to do.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        As I say, having read some of your
30         cross-examination it seems to me that you did very well.
31   MRS. McBRIEN:      I tried to put in quite a lot of effort,     I used
32         to be up until 3.30 in the mornings in the hotel,        it was a
33         very lonely life in that room in Sheffield.         I'm glad I
34         did it and in a way I have enjoyed getting to know more
35         about legal matters,       I have enjoyed that.   I actually
36         enjoyed working with those barristers,        I really felt it


                                          10
 1          was a different experience in my life,       so that, you know,
 2          I have gained something from that.
 3                  After all people were only doing their jobs, they
 4          were representing those particular people.        So they were
 5          doing what they could for them, you know,       I understand all
 6          that.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Did you feel that you were, as it
 8          were,    out-gunned by all the representatives for the police
 9          and so on?
10   MRS. McBRIEN:       I did but I enjoyed the challenge, you know, and
11          I didn't find them â€”      as I say,   I quite enjoyed doing what
12          I did.     I found it was difficult but I think I was treated
13          pretty fairly really.      I know some of the group, the
14          Hillsborough Family Support Group thought that I was on
15          the side of the police.      I know how strange it seems to
16          say such a thing,     I mean there was nobody who wanted â€”
17          I'm not against the police in general at all.        I would
18          never do such a thing but I like fairness,       I do like to be
19          fair.
20   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        So far as this Scrutiny is
21          concerned, as I think I said on Monday, Lord Taylor came
22          to the conclusion that the police lost control of the
23          crowd outside.      Not because of the behaviour of the fans,
24          but because of inadequate policing,      he criticised the
25          police for losing control of the situation outside.
26   MRS. McBRIEN:       Yes.
27   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I have received no further evidence
28          in relation to that matter at all,      I have not been asked
29          to look at any further evidence in relation to that.
30   MRS.   McBRIEN:     It was due to the closing of   the road,
31          primarily.     That was the main cause of   the build-up.
32   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I accept Lord Taylor's findings
33          about that.     I am not going to suggest that there should
34          be any review of those findings.
35   MRS.   McBRIEN:     But he is not blaming any particular person,
36          he's saying it was due to a number of causes, Lord Taylor.


                                         11
 1        Whereas I don't think it was due to a number of causes and
 2        I certainly don't blame the City Council and I certainly
 3        don't blame the engineer.          I blame the failure of the
 4        police to operate the system correctly that day and safely
 5        that day.       I blame them one hundred per cent actually,          I
 6        think one hundred per cent blame,         I don't see it any other
 7        way.
 8                I am so sorry for the       people who did    it, we all make
 9        mistakes,      I do know that, anybody can make a mistake
10        because we are only human.          If m y house had burned down,
11        my property I would forgive someone for that, but to take
12        somebody's life like John's away I cannot forgive that,                I
13        c a n 't .
14   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Can     I just ask you    what it it that
15        you would like me to do so          far asyou are concerned?
16   MRS. McBRIEN:       I would like you to recommend really to the
17        Crown Prosecution Service that this matter,             I don't know
18        how to put this in so many words, but the way I see it you
19        are going to make a report, now it depends what is in your
20        report, that's going to be very important, what you say in
21        that is going to carry a lot of weight.              So the whole
22        country â€”       it's like the death of Diana, this is a big
23        matter,      this is something that doesn't go away lightly.
24        Will it ever go away?       You get big concerts going on now
25        and raising millions really for justice.             Where you are
26        putting a lot of money in they mean business, but they are
27        not getting it right,      I know, but the money is there, the
28        backing is there from the country,         I do know that.
29                So we are looking to somebody to do the right thing.
30        I know it's so difficult,         it is so difficult, if it was
31        not the police it would be so simple.           I feel that,    I just
32        do feel that if somebody w ould have climbed over the gate,
33        three fans had vaulted these big gates the matter would
34        have been dealt with and w e would not have suffered like
35        this, we would have been able to grieve much sooner
36        because      we can't really grieve while we are still trying


                                         12
 1        to sort this matter out, this is the problem.         That is the
 2        punishment that we do not deserve.        The people who do
 3        deserve punishment are not being punished and that is
 4        annoying me really as much as anything.
 5   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Can I come back to the question I
 6        asked you a moment ago?     Who do you think should be
 7        punished?
 8   MRS. McBRIEN:     The three senior police officers.      I wouldn't
 9        mind if they were treated leniently and I'm sure they
10        would be, but at least it would be seen to be done,
11        justice would be seen to be done.
12   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     These are the police officers in
13        the control room or the ones outside?
14   MRS. McBRIEN:     Just three police officers, Marshall for causing
15        the build-up by closing the road at 2.17,       I mean he
16        requested Duckenfield to close the road at 2.17, it had
17        never been done in the history of that ground,        it was a
18        major road and to close it for 40 minutes and allow people
19        to crowd into the road and the paths caused a massive
20        build-up outside.     That was not criminal, that was not
21        criminal.     That was a mistake,    that was a blunder but he
22        could have still done something.        Marshall had caused a
23        problem.    What he should have done was ask for the kick-
24        off to be delayed then.     He had a public order situation
25        outside that ground, not inside.        There were 50,000 people
26        inside who were perfectly safe at that time including John
27        because he went in 2 or 3 minutes before that.
28             So if he would have delayed the kick-off,       if he would
29        have asked for the delaying of the kick-off then John and
30        all the others would have come home,       later.   I wouldn't
31        have even known,    I wouldn't have even thought about it
32        really.     He would have just come home as he did on a
33        number of other occasions.        So that was a mistake.
34             Marshall is like somebody putting the ammunition in a
35        gun and the other one firing it really, to me, that's how
36        I see it.     He stood back from it really.     He'd caused it



                                       13
 1        and then it was put on to the other man, who requested
 2        that the exit gates then â€”       because he didn't know what to
 3        do with all these crowds outside.       So again Duckenfield
 4        hesitated for four minutes.       That's a long time.     Then he
 5        lied about it.     He even lied that he had given that order
 6        because it was criminal.     He would have told people in the
 7        ground what he was doing if it was something that should
 8        be allowed.     Then the police inside would have known how
 9        to react to those fans.     They were treating like a pitch
10        invasion and I don't like to think what might have
11        happened to the fans that     day or how they were treated. I
12        don't dare to think of that side really.
13             It's so many things.     He knew it was wrong himself or
14        he would have made an announcement that he was doing i t .
15        This is where I differ from the other people in the Group.
16        They're saying:    it's all right to open   exit gates. If     it
17        was all right why w a s n 1t there an announcement made
18        because the police received compensation for what they
19        suffered because they were treating it as a pitch
20        invasion.     They were pushing them back   in and making sure
21        that they died really.     You know, this   is â€”   I
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I think the question of the police
23        getting compensation is a thorny one.       For reasons that I
24        do not understand the police settled I think 14 claims,
25        they were all Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.          They then
26        decided that perhaps they had made a mistake about that
27        and so they contested them and they lost at first instance
28        before the trial judge, they won in the Court of Appeal
29        two to one and the case is now going to the House of
30        Lords.    So the position at the moment is that two lord
31        justices have decided one way because the trial judge is
32        now a Lord Justice of Appeal, two decided the other and it
33        remains for the House of Lords to say what is going to
34        happen.
35             I know that it has been,      if I may say so, an
36        understandable source of irritation for the Hillsborough


                                      14
 1          families that the police did receive compensation.
 2   MRS. McBRIEN:       I was in favour of them receiving compensation.
 3          I spoke out on the TV in Sheffield.            There again I'm
 4          always     the other are on the side, whereas I'm not.           I
 5          mean this â€”     the Coroner knew what I was up against at
 6          Sheffield.     I was getting more abuse from my own, from
 7          people who I was supposed to be on the same side than I
 8          was from barristers.
 9                  The whole thing has been very, very confusing and
10          maddening and very, very difficult for me, exceptionally
11          difficult.     I really had one hammering but I would do it
12          all again for John and I would willingly sacrifice the
13          rest of my life to do it.          I know my husband would like me
14          to just leave it, forget it all, but I can't.             I can't do
15          it.     He was too good a person.      He was too likeable a
16          person.     He had too much about him.         No.   I just have to
17          do it for him.     I've two other sons but John was always so
18          very special.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I admire your courage and
20          persistence,    if I may say so.
21   MRS. McBRIEN:       I would like to, as I said the other day when I
22          stood up yesterday---
23   MR.    BONE:     On Monday.
24   MRS. McBRIEN:       On Monday,   sorry.    You see,    I'd even forget the
25          day â€”     it's been worse than this.       I've forgotten now what
26          I was going to say.
27   MR.    BONE:     You said something on Monday when you said up.
28   MRS. McBRIEN:       I've forgotten.
29   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         I think you said something in
30          answer to something that I had said that you blamed the
31          opening, you said that the opening of the gate was the
32          critical decision.
33   MRS.
34   LORD
35          clearly.
36   MRS. McBRIEN:       I have always said that.      That was not â€”


                                           15
 1         nothing was made of that by Tim King at all.          In fact, he
 2         was not there for the verdict, the day of the verdict, you
 3         know, when the verdict was announced.          It's not good, is
 4         it, really, when you have acted for the families.          So
 5         really it would be wonderful if we could get justice.             I
 6         know it is very, very difficult, very difficult indeed.               I
 7         think the law should apply to whoever has committed a
 8         crime.    That's how I see it.
 9   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        The law does apply to whoever has
!0         committed a crime,     not only it should do, but it does.
11         Police officers are in no special position so far as the
12         law is concerned.
13   MRS. McBRIEN:      No, not if it is taken to the right court.          This
14         is how I see it.      I see it very simply.      There was a case
15         on the news the other say where those two girls who'd
16         stolen the flowers in Chester.        That was the Magistrates'
17         Court.    This is how I see it.      If it's a crime you just go
18         to the Magistrates'     Court and take it from there really.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Have you said to me really all that
20         you think you wanted to say?
21   M R S . McBRIEN:   I'm not sure about t h a t .   I know that you a
22         making a reports and you will be making recommendations.
23         What form will they take, the recommendations?          What kind
24         of recommendations?
25   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I cannot tell you at the moment.
26         They will either be recommendations to the Home Secretary
27         that he should have a further public inquiry or that the
28         Attorney-General should apply to the Divisional Court
29         again for a quashing of the verdict and a new inquest or
30         recommendations to the prosecuting authorities that they
31         should reconsider prosecution.        But that will on the basis
32         that there is fresh evidence which bears upon the question
33         of liability which has not hitherto been considered.
34   MRS. McBRIEN:      It's the fresh evidence.       To me I don't need
35         fresh evidence because I know the gates were opened.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        I absolutely follow that but,


                                          16
 1        unfortunately,    I cannot countermand the decisions which
 2        have been taken.     I am not a Court of Appeal from the
 3        Divisional Court.     I am not the person who decides whether
 4        people should be prosecuted or not.       I can only invite
 5        them to reconsider their decisions on that if I consider
 6        that there is fresh evidence which has not been considered
 7        by them which puts a stronger case for prosecution.         That
 8        is really what it comes to.
 9             There are various other things that I have been asked
10        to look at.    People are very concerned that they have not
11        been able to trace what precisely what happened to their
12        son from A to B and what happened to them afterwards?
13   MRS. McBRIEN:     I don't think all that is so important.    I would
14        prefer not to go through all that again.       As I went there
15        for four and a half months,      the idea of a new inquest,
16        obviously I would take it on again but I would prefer to
17        give my time to other queries now and earn money m y s e l f ,
18        rather than give so much of my life all the time to this
19        business.     I can't if there's a new inquest.    Again,   I
20        would like to ask questions and this time I would be more
21        â€”   I feel better about it now so it would be much easier
22        for me than it was in 1990.      And the fact my father died
23        that December as well I would find it easier.       So I would
24        do it again if there was a new inquest, which I'm hoping
25        there will not be nor a new inquiry.
26             The quashing of the verdict would be all right
27        because I just saw very clearly as recklessness, pure
28        simple recklessness.     That to me is unlawful killing.
29        That is the only verdict that I would come out with when I
30        have studied everything.     I see things more simply because
31        the law you can only always make it sound very complicated
32        because you can play with words so well in the law and you
33        lose the main thread of it, don't you, really with all the
34        other arguments going on.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     It is called loosing the wood for
36        the trees.

     1   MRS. McBRIEN:           That's the point and that's what I think
     2           happened with the jury at Sheffield,             four and a half
     3          months of listening to so much how on earth could they
     4           come down to very small points,             especially when the
     5          barrister who was acting for the families was not even
     6          mentioning those main points?            So it was very difficult
     7           for them I think.           So it was not surprising that they came
     8           out with that verdict, but it was the wrong verdict,                just
     9           like it was the wrong decision to open the gates.                 It was
    10          the wrong verdict.
    11   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              I am very grateful to you for
    12           coming, Mrs. McBrien.           I think I have learnt a lot from
    13          you.
    14   MRS. M c B R I E N :    I don't â€”     as I say---
    15   MRS. M c B R I E N :    You have put your points,      if I may say so, very
    16          clearly and I congratulate you.
    17   MRS. M c B R I E N :    Thank you.    But where will it go to from here is
    18          the question?
    19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              I am afraid that may be another
    20          matter.         But at any rate it makes my task easier when I
    21          have people like you putting sensible points clearly.
    22   M R S . McBRIEN:       Yes, but it is difficult all the same, isn't it,
    23          when I am saying so dramatically what I am saying and I
    24          have said it on TV, about a criminal act being committed
    25          nobody has come forward and said: how dare you say that
    26          about the police.            They would do, wouldn't they, if I was
    27          wrong?
    28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              I do not know about that.
    29   MRS. M c B R I E N :    So if a crime has been committed why isn't
    30          anyone being prosecuted?            That is my question.
    31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             Thank you very much indeed.
    32   MRS. McBRIEN:          Thank you.
    33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:              I am grateful to you for coming,
    34   MRS. M c B R I E N :   Thank you for giving me so much of your time,          I
    35          had quite a lot extra, didn't I.
    36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:             Not at all.

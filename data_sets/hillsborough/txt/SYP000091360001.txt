          been     rhv^efore.                Eventually            there     seemed       to     surge       f o r w a r d and,          I

          went     tietween'HhsNtwo                  horses.          I went       forward        straight            to    the

          turnstiles          and       s t r a ight       into     the    gro u n d .

          Whilst      I was        ouo\j.de          I sa w    p e o ple     climbing          o ver    the      w all      to    get        in.

          There      was     a Pjji. ice C^x£)i c e r on tlis w al l                    helping        them      over.

          1 do     not     remember           seeing        any Stewards               outside       the     turnstiles.

          Once     inside        the     ground        I did        no\see         any    signs        directing            me    where           to

          go.      I j ust       asked a steward                   the w a y N ^ n d     he    t o l d me       how    to    get       to my

          seat.

          When     I got      to m y         seat     w h i c h was       in the N o r t h S t a n d         there          was a        lad

          about      20 years           of a g e      in m y       seat.     I said        thats       my    s eat.          He s a i d           it

          was     his.       I showed          h i m my       ticket       and     said Where           is y o u r s .           He    then

          went     and     i sat        in m y       seat.         The    t ime    I t ook       up ray seat           was       j ust       as    the

          game     was     stopped           and     the    players        were        leaving       the     pitch.

          I looked         towards           the     Le pp i ngs'^l^iie end a n d             I saw     that, b e h i n d             the     goal
                                                                                                 PO ^
          it w a s    very       pa cked.            I saw Police            QfTVs-e!rs on           the     -rente        pushing           peop i e

          back.       I thought              t hat    rh^re        had    been     figntmg.

     ,,1      then heard           people          shout in g \ f t        us     out we       are     getting         squashed and

^         killed.          I then        saw       f ans    c 1i m 5 i n g \ y                 fence        onto      the    pitch.               !he

          police were            then        helping        them      over                     ere a l s o       being       pulled           up

             into      the      stand       beh i n d ,

             I then        saw       people       b e i n g ^carried            up the        pit'bi^on A d v e r t i s i n g        hoardings

             I heard           people       say    t hat       son\fans            had       died.

             Eventually              the i>ire B r i g a d e          arrMs&ed a n d           the    fence          was    cut    down and

             more      people         were      pulled         out    of     the    pens.

             I eventually               left      the     ground        j ust      after-Jlhe         a n n o u n c e me n t      that   the   game

             was     cancelled.              I made         my w a y       baTtsk^to the          coach and            eventually

             everyone           came     b ac k    to     the    coach.                          ^               .

             I could           not    understand why                 there      was      a    line    oi/Police            Officers      across

             the      pitch.         I think       that        most     of      them     could       have    been          better    employed

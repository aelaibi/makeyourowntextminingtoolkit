   Dear Sir

   Enclosed please find the copies of questionnaires taken from
   (22 yrs) and his m o t h e r (54 yrs) by officers from west Midlands
   Police investigating the Hillsborough Disaster together with the copy of a
   letter from us to Superintendent F Carlisle of Greater Manchester Police
   currently investigating a complaint against an unidentified member of your
   force, which alleges he was seeking payment from Liverpool supporters without
   tickets to allow them into the ground.

   As the questionnaires by             - questions 24 and 52 seera to suggest a
   similar type of complaint against a South Yorkshire Police Officer and in the
   same area, (although I accept it is at a later time) it is felt the two
   incidents may be connected and details have been forwarded to Superintendent
   Carlisle direct at his request for further enquiries. These papers are
   forwarded to you for the necessary action. If it appears this is totally
   unconnected to Superintendent Carlisle’s investigation we will at your
   invitation investigate the matter accordingly and as agreed in respect of other
   such allegations.

   I trust that these arrangements meet with your approval, but if I can be of any
   further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me or my staff at Nechells
   Green Police Station.

   Yours faithfully




   J M JONES
   ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE (HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY)

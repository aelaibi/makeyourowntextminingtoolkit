      the updated edition of your interim report in due course.

      In the meantime I have prepared a draft letter to help in your
      approach to the Police Complaints Authority ^on the
      availability of evidence produced by the criminal_
      investigation.  I am sure that you will recall raising this
      rather sensitive topic during our meeting with Gareth
      Williams.  I do hope that the draft proves to be of some
      assistance.
      Should you wish to discuss the draft or any aspect of the case
      please do not hesitate to telephone me.

      Yours sincerely

From J M Jones Esq to capt Taylor P.C.A.



I write following our introductory meeting on 25th August,

which I found helpful.    You will appreciate that matters have

progressed and Mr Geoffrey Dear has now been formally

appointed as the Investigating Officer after the request made

by the Director of Public Prosecutions to Mr Wright for a full

criminal enquiry.



The investigation is well under way and it is obvious that

there will be a very large number of statements and other

evidence produced.   This has prompted me to consider the

question of the future availability of the evidence, in

particular, for the Coroner for the purpose of the inquest and

for Mr Wright for the purpose of disciplinary or civil

proceedings.



When the enquiry is complete,     in the usual way, copies of the

investigating officer's report together with statements and

other evidence will be sent to you as the supervising member

of the Police Complaints Authority and to Mr Wright for

transmission to the Director.     I take the view that it would

be of benefit to me and also to the Coroner and Mr Wright if

at this early stage you would concur with my opinion that

there should be no objection to the Coroner and Mr Wright

having access to the evidence for the purposes I have referred
V   to above.   I say this having regard to the unusual nature of

    the investigation which is looking not only at the potential

    criminal responsibilities of those police officers involved

    but also the possibility of criminal proceedings being issued

    against the other bodies and persons whom we mentioned during

    the meeting on 25th August.   Obviously this evidence could

    only be made available after the Director had concluded any

    criminal proceedings or decided that no such proceedings were

    to be issued.



    I am sure that this course can be adopted in the special

    circumstances of this unusual investigation and that by taking

    this decision at an early stage there can be considerable

    savings for the public purse without any prejudice to the

    criminal enquiry or subsequent proceedings.



    I have discussed this matter with Mr Newell and Mr Cleugh of

    the Crown Prosecution Service who agree that this course of

    action could properly be adopted and to whom I have sent a

    copy of this letter.



    I look forward to hearing from you on this matter, however, if

    in the meantime I can be of any assistance please do not

    hesitate to contact me.



    Yours faithfully




    J Mervyn Jones

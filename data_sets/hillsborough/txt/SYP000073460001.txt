We w a i t e d for     the Police       to open up a gap and when they did we walked

into    the    inner area and        joined the queues                 for    the   turnstiles.           As we

went    through       the gap    it closed up a gain and                                      was   seperated

queuing       for    the turnstiles        there were          no    proper      queues.       Just a mass

of    people avid crushing was             taking        place,      over     there.     There were                      j

at their       tickets and       if they were alright                  letting      them go.        The    people

were    climbing       over   to a v o i d the        crush outside.



I saw no stewards at             the turnstiles,              apart     from the two m o u n t e d         police

there was a P o l i c e m a n on each turnstile,                     and then a few mo re H o 1 1 c e

From            the moment                 we ente r e d the       terrace we were            subjected         to    crushing.

it was                 getting worse all               the time,,         We tried, to worm our way forwara

and as we did so                            I was    s e p arated from rny brother              by the          crowd.       we

For most        of the time          I was    one    person    from the      front    fence.



The     crushing was          continual       throughout       the    time   I was    in the    pen.      I

was     very hot ana found             it difficult         to get my breath.            Towards     the end

I   thought      I was going            to faint.      I felt myself         going and thought at

one     point    1 was       going      to die.      It was     very    confusing      because ail these

people were           pushing       from     behind but     tnere was     no where      to go because         I

had     corns up against            abrickwall        about 3 feet         high with the       steel fence

on top of        it at the very f r o n t .



At about 3,10           pm    (1510 hrs)       the    lad in front        of me who was aoout my

age     but smaller,          was    saying    he    couldn't    breathe and         pleading     for

someone     to get       him out,.         It wasn't a loud shout              but   very feeble and

half     hearted.        Everything          seemed to go        quiet aro u n d me and ail I            could

near was        him asking me to get                him out.



I then     realised          I had to get       out myself?          but w o u l d n ’t be able    to witn

him there.            I then    put my hands          on the fence        either     side   of him and

pushed     bacs and got my arms                locked straight           to give     ham room to        ciimb

0ut .



Thera was        terrific       pressure       on my back and          I was    finding     it hard to

keep tne space           for h i m .       I shouted at him to hurry up and                  ciimb

out over        the    fence    but    he was       very weak    saying      ‘‘i c a n ’t" and falling

back.



1 then m a n a g e d to        put my      rignt     foot   on the wail and he           cnen used my

legs,     shoulders and head to                climb over        the fence.          Ones ne was

standi ng on top of rns a couple                     of people       outside    leaned      in and pul iea
Once    he hau got        out    I sassd my anus a bit              because          they wsre       hurting

due    to the     pressure,       once    I had eased my arms              through the         force       behind

just    pushed me straight              up against       the front       fence.

However,       because        of the    pressure       from behind       I could       not    pull myself

up,,    Tnsn for a couple              of seconds       the    pressure     eased and         I managed        to

pull myself        half way up.           The    pressure       then    came    back on and my             legs

w e r e tn e n t ra p p e d a g a i n s t lh s f e n c e .     fh e p r s ssu r e l n e n ease ci a g a i n

and    I m a n a g e d to scramble        up the fence          using my arms and             legs.



There were a couple              of    lads who had been helping                people       out    leaning        on

tne overhang          of the     front    fence and they           leant    in and      pulled me out.

I then fell        onto the       floor       outside    the    pen.



I looked back           in the    pen and saw my brother was                   stuck    in the       far    left

hand    corner     of    pen 4 at       the    front    by pen 5.        My brother          is about       six

foot    four    tall     like me but          far wider and stockier                than me.        1 could

see    that    nis arms wsrs           trapped    oy nis       sides and       he    couliin* c move.          l

shouteu 'to him that             1 was ail       right.



The    best way to get           to him was       from over the          side       fence    from    pen 5.         I

therefore went           to    pen '3, there was a policeman at this                        gate    leu ting

people     out but       not    into    pen 3.



There was       one     policeman       inside Pen 5 trying             to get       people out       but    he

was    on nis    own and        c ompletely overwhelmed.



                                 policeman on the gate and a sked him to                       let me       into

Tne    policeman told me to go away a n d that                          I was    getting    in the way.           I

told him          I wasn't    going       anywhere       with rny brother          still    inside the      pen

and    pushed       past him and          into Pen       5,     together with a c o u p l e .of other

p e o p J.e *



There      were a few        people       between my brother and the                   fence where    I was

and    I helped       to    pull    them out       first and then                      worked his way to

the fence at first                I c o u l d n ’t get hold of him and was                pulling    on his

hair     and      clothes    to    pull   him out,            I then m a n a g e d to get    hold of him

as    I leant       over    the side       fence and m a n a g e d to       pull       him out.



Before          I got my brother          out    I h e 1 ped two or three          people    over the       side

fence      including a small              coloured boy about            six years       old who was

passed over          p e o p l e ’s heads       to me.



Once     I had got my brother               out we then went             onto    the    pitch,



                     and    I were    shocked and             c o u l d n ’t believe wnat was

Happening.           We    then s a w a number           of    people    trying    to pull       down tne

f r o n t fence      so we then went             over    to he 1 p .    We started p u J.i i ng at         i ne

fencing at          first    it was       just    starting       to bend.        ihen some       policemen

came     over and told us to stop but we                        carried on.        Then some       qtner

poli cemen ^came over              threw down thei r hats               on thefloor a n d star tea

pulling as well.              There was a whole                load of us       pulling ana. evens.ua 1 iy

it started to             come away at the          bottom        corner and we then m a n a g e c         Co

bend     it back.



A P o l i c e m a n then went        into the       pen and went          to a man who inad been next

After    we had    pulled the            fence    off we then stood around for a bit we

couldn't       believe what we were               seeing.

of the    pens    like    us or         come out    of the stands          to help.



We    then went    over    to the         corner    of the    pitch formed             by the West and

S o u t h stand where we           could see       the dead and       injured being          laid out.

When we got where                                 the    coach had been,            it had moved,                     so first            of all we

went            to          phone        home      to tell      them we we alright.                         We e v e n t u a l l y used a

moved.                      After a while                everyone was         back       but for            three         people.              A few

of tneir                     individual             friends went            off   to maKe           enquiries and. pnons                            calis

but       couldn't                  find anything               out.

I believe                       that          fencing             of some          form     is n e c essary at grounds                    but at

Hillsborough                              the overhang and wall                            at   the    bottom of the fence                      stopped

a lot of                     people                from escaping,                  the e m e rgency         gates were             far    too       small

                                        h,i j.s




If fencing                             is kept            then          it must       have adequate            facilities            to aixow

people               out               i n an emergency.



I also               think                that        football                clubs    spend far         too muc h m oney on                   things

such as                  players and not enough on facil. ities                                             for     the    fans,          Most            of

the         footDai 1 grounds are                                        old and       cravnped and         cannot        deax       with       i a rye

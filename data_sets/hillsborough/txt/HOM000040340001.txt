From       previous           experience             I knew             it w a s      too       much     for      turnstile              flow

I s e e m e d to         recall          that       all       the       turnstiles              had     stopped.              Men were

screaming           trapped             in    them.           Gate       ’C V    was       open       and      people         were       coming

through.            The       terror          in    th e      turnstiles              communicated                itself           to me a n d

brought         the      seriousness                of     the      situation              to     mind.

I went        out       through          gate       *C*.

I remember              standing             alongside             Inspectos           Graham           Delaney           and Bob Purdy

a n d Sgt.         John       Morgan          pulling          people           out    of       the     crush        on t u r n s t i l e s           A-

G.     I feared           some          would       be     killed.              Some       were       reluctant              to    come.          I

t hi n k     they       had    got       so    close          to    the     turnstiles                they      had       the      single

intention           of    passing             through.              I shouted              at     some      and      as      many     as

possible,           I pulled             under       the       iron       b ar       that       is a     continuation                 of     the

wall       housing        gate          *C*.        The       crush       quite        suddenly             eased.            I saw         gate

* B ’ had       been      opened.              The       queues          became        controllable                  and      containable

again.          The      two       turnstiles              nearest          gate       *C’ appeared                  to      function

a ga i n .      Sgt.      Barry          SORSBY          on    his       police        horse          c a me    up      to    railing            and

using        the    horse          as    a    barrier          we       were     able       to       filter       o ut       of    t h is

agitated           crowd       fans          who    produced             tickets.               I told         the      stewards            on

gate       'C      to    take       the                                          •

By    now     I have          no    idea       of    time          or    what, h a p p e n i n g         inside.

By word         of m o u t h        information                passed           "Inside           - Pitch         invasion"                 Went

to    the     pitch       via       rear       of    police             control        box        and    down        the      first         steps

                                                                                                                                                  R215

in    th e S o u t h          Stand.               I saw          no    players          or       officials           on    the        pitch.

The      invasion ap pe ar ed                       to    have          spread          as    far       as    the     penalty           spo t.          I

got      on to          the    pitch           and       had       got       near       to    the       goal     p o st     when        I noticed

those         on th e         pitch        were          not       running             towards          opponents           end       or a w a y

from Police                 officers.                   Some       were          holding          themselves             others         lying       down

I looked            towards           the          fence          holding          back       fans        in the         Leppings            lane

terraces.                Police           officers                were      standing              on    the    fence        and        leaning

o v e r.          Through       the        gaps          in th e            legs       I could          see    the       faces        of     fans

pressed against                      the       fence.              I realised                they      were      stood          up    dead.         The

gate       to      t h is     pen was              opened.             I think          it w a s        no. 3       gate.

Automatically                  (or        so       it    seemed)             police          officers          formed           a    double        line

u p to        the       gate    and        formed             a    chain          gang       to    p as s     out     casulaties.                  When

there         w               ~ r'2 at         your       end          of    the       line       to    pass     on      the        casualty you

carried            it    on    to     the          pitch.              PC    2417       Pete       ROTCHEL and              I carried              the

unconscious                 body      of       a    14 y e a r s            old    boy       dressed          in b l u e        tee     shirt       an d

blue       jeans         on    to     the          pitch.              I felt          his    heart          beat     but       his     breathing

was      so       extremely           shallow             that          I thought             he       was    d e ad .      We       p r e p a r e d to

do m o u t h        to      mouth         when          I realised                he    was       infact       breathing               himself.

We    did         not    interrupt                 this       natural             breathing             and    monitored               his

condition               very       closely.               Keeping                him    warm       and       protected.                I remember

as    I wa s         kneeling             over          him       that       I was       kicked           in t h e       b a c k.       I seemed

surrounded               by    the        click-whizz                   click-whizz                of     cameramen.

People            came w i t h        a    board and                   this       boy was          carried away.                     More     came

with another                  board        to       carry          away          the    young          woman     being          attended           to

n ex t     to      u s .I r e m e m b e r           intervening                   as    they       were       going        to       place     her       on


n a i 1s u p .

 I turned and                 saw     behind             me       a fireman apply                      cardiac        masage           to m a l e       in

early         thirties.               He       then       gave          oral       resuscitation and                       I knelt           beside

the        casualty           to     do    cardiac                massage.              As    t he      fireman          sat        b ac k   he

s i g n a l l e d me          no t    to       continue.                    We    checked          fo r      vital       life        si g n s .
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      R215

 There           were       none.           I cover       the    c a s u a l t y ’s f a c e         with    th e     front       of     his

 sweat e r .

 I heard              someone          say    " T h e y ’ re    charging"             I looked            towards         the    Spion

 Kop and              saw     people         on    the    field moving             towards           it.        They were          not

 running.                It      looked       as       though a       confrontation                 was    imminent.             I went

 beyond           the       half       way    line       and made          uniformed          officers           form up         in a

  line.           There          was    a    line       across       the    width       of    th e     pi tc h.       This       halted

 the       progress              of    the    Liverpool          fans.           Some    of     them were            crying.            Some

 were       frustrated.                     Some       were    angry.        It    did       no t    help       to   hear       the     mass

 of N o t t s ,          fans         behind       chanting          and    goading.           They        seemed         unaware        of

 t he      tragedy.

 4.20pm                  This         was    the       first    lull       in t h e     sequence           of    events         since     I

  l ef t    the        police          room.           I looked       at    my    watch       it w a s      4.20pm.             I became

 aware           that       my    radio       was       still    working.             There         were    public         address

  announcements                   and       the    ground       slowly       emptied.

 5.00pm                  Given         hot    drinks.           Mustered          serials           in N o r t h S t a n d       and

  spoke          to    officers             distressed          by    experiences.

 About           5.30pm-          I went          to    gymnasium          which      was     being        used      as    a    temporary

  mortuary             and       I assisted             in the       collation          of    details           of   the       dea d.

  ■11.00pm               Went         off    duty       from    the    gymnasium.

  10.45   am             Alone to Leppings Lane terraces               and West Stand, because I have

  been Inspector in charge of this end on a fairly                              regular basis since 1985-

  I   hold    a    set    of    keys    to   the    padlocks    on    inner     gates   and   the    main exit/

  padlocked six pen gates                (one upstairs,        five   in terrace pens)        to wall in the

j^open position.            Checked that two West Stand                'wing'    emergency exit gates had

12 noon               Turnstiles open.                  Officers and stewards                   in position.          Build up

gradual and       friendly.             Well       behaved.          Made     constant          checks     of snack bars,

programme       sellers         re     security.           Supervision             of    pen       filling     unnecessary.

Officers, stewards and turnstile progress okay.

Between 1.30          pm and 2.00 pm.                Approximately six men with Liverpool accents

at Gate       'C'.        Steward          on    gate     called       men.         Produced        small      wallets      with

dynatape       claiming         'Official          Liverpool           stewards'.             No    tickets      attempt       to

’yank’ gate open but I anticipate and held firm.                                         I slammed it shut.             Repeat

performance ten minutes later.                          No entry.

About 2.30       pm.       ’Last minute'             buld up           started.          Press on turnstiles.                 Boy

fainted    to property            cabin.           Deploy Police Constable                      to snack bar and then

two Police Constables                  to programme            sellers not in porta-cabins.                        Check pens

and elevated section.                  No problems.

Approximately          2.40      pm.        Young       Police       Constable          with       'stupid     and    legless'

drunk   wandering          about       in       concourse       at     rear    A-G      turnstiles.            Did not know

where    to    go.        Took       him    to     Police       Room.         Had       to   support       drunk      all   way.

(Police Constable 1719 or 1715 or similar).

2.45 pm               Checked         watch       leaving       police        room,      radio      message,         "Get some

more    horses       up    here"        (or       similar).            Auto    -     assumed        Leppings       Lane      end.

Unknown       officer      said,       ’'Sounds         like     its    getting          busy      at   your    end    Harry".

Returned      to Leppings            Lane       end via route           under North Stand.                   Getting busy.

Concourse      rear       11-16.           Climbing       over       wall     above      gate      ’B ’.     Joined Police

Constables       at       ’B'    gate       entice        down.          Fans       distrustful.               Waving       their

tickets.        Inspector         John          Bennett    had       climbed onto            turnstile roof to deal.




                                                                     104
Aware   of     the     crush outside              11-16    turnstiles.           Coming     through very           slowly.

Stepped      away      from     turnstiles          to    watch     Inspector       Bennett        but    two    or   three

times     Iwas        pulled     by     Liverpool          people who       had     got     inside        who    were

complaining           about    the crush outside.                  "You should be out there.                    People are

gonna get killed".

Through      the gate         in the wall          between        the two concourses at the rear of two

sets of turnstiles.                  I became aware of a movement of people.                              From previous

experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

for waiting friends              responding            to a kick off or crowd cheer or similar.                            I

stepped      through          into    the    concourse           behind A-G.         (Not    sure        whether      pulled

again by fans).

Twice called on radio using allocated call sign- 'India 7'»

I seemed       to recall         that all the turnstiles had stopped.                            Men were screaming

trapped          in them.        Gate       'C'    was    open     and people       were     coming       through.       The

terror           in the       turnstiles           communicated           itself     to     me     and     brought       the

seriousness of the situation to mind.

I went out through gate                 'C'.

I remember            standing       alongside          Inspectors        Graham    Delaney        and Bob Purdy and

Sergeant John Morgan pulling people                              out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                         I

 feared some would be killed.                          Some were reluctant to come.                  I think they had

 got    so   close       to    the    turnstiles           they     had    the    single     intention          of passing

 through.        I shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the iron

 bar    that     is    a continuation             of     the     wall   housing gate        'C'.       The crush quite

 suddenly        eased.          I    saw     gate        *B ’    had   been      opened.        The      queues      became

 controllable           and    containable             again.       The    two    turnstiles        nearest       gate   'C’

 appeared to function again.                        Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

 up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of




                                                                    105
                                                                                                                           (K
                                                                  5



  this agitated crowd                   fans who produced tickets.                 I told the ste»cu-ua on gate

   'C' to take the stubs.

  By now I have no idea of time or what                           is happening outside....

  By word of mouth information passed,                            "Inside - Pitch invasion". Went                    to the

  pitch via rear of police                       control box      and down the           first steps         inthe South

  Stand.      I saw no players or officials                       on the pitch.

  The invasion appeared                   to have        spread as far as the penalty spot.                       I got on

   to the pitch and had got                      near    to the goal        post when I noticed those on the

^^pitch     were    not       running       towards       opponents      end or away        from Police Officers.

   Some were holding themselves,                        others lying down.           I looked towards the fence

   holding    back        fans       in    the       Leppings     Lane    terraces.         Police        Officers     were

   standing    on       the    fence       and       leaning     over.       Through the        gaps    in    the   legs   I

   could see the faces of fans pressed against the fence.                                       I realised they were

   stood up dead.              The       gate    to    this pen was opened.              I think       it was number 3

   gate.

   Automatically          (or it seemed)                Police Officers formed a double line up to the

   gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                                     When there was no one

 ^^it   your end        of    the       line     to pass on the          casualty,       you carried it on to the

   pitch.      Police         Constable           2417    Pete    Rotchel     and    I    carried      the    unconscious

   body of a 14 years                   old boy,       dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

   to   the   pitch.           I    felt       his    heart    beat   but    his    breathing       was      so   extremely

   shallow that I thought                  he was dead.           We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

   realised        he   was        in     fact       breathing    himself.          We    did   not     interrupt      this

   natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

   and protected.              I remember as I was kneeling over him that I was kicked in

   the back.        I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.




                                                                         IflB

    People    came    with         a board        and    this    boy    was    carried       away.       More       came   with

    another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                                                  I

    remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

    I   turned    and      saw      behind me       a    fireman       apply    cardiac       massage      to a male          in

    early    thirties.             He    then     gave     oral    resuscitation            and    I knelt beside           the

    casualty to do cardiac massage.                        As the fireman sat back he signalled me not

    to continue.           We      checked      for vital       life signs,          there were none.               I covered

    the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.



•
    I heard someone say,                 "They're charging".             I looked towards the Spion Kop and

    saw   people      on      the       field     moving    towards      it.         They    were    not      running.        It

    looked as though a confrontation was                           imminent.          I went beyond the half way

    line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.                                     There was a line across

    the   width      of      the    pitch.        This     halted      the progress          of* the Liverpool             fans.

    Some of them were               crying.        Some were        frustrated.         Some were angry.               It did

    not help to hear the mass                     of Notts        fans behind chanting and goading.                        They

    seemed unaware of the tragedy.

    4.20 pm               This was the first               lull in the sequence ofevents since                         I    left

    the police room.                I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.                           I became aware that

^ ^ m y radio was still working.                        There were public address announcements and the

    ground slowly emptied.

    p.00 pm               Given      hot    drinks.        Mustered serials              in North Stand             andspoke

    to officers distressed by experiences.

    About    5-30       pm    I     went     to    gymnasium       which       was    being       used   as     a   temporary

    mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

    11.00 pm              Went off duty from the gymnasium.

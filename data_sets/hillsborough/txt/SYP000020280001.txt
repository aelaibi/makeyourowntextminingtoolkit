            Police Investigating Team (Hillsborough)
            Sheffield C.I.D.




            Dear Sir / Madam,

            r e :-                                               Merseyside.

            I understand you wish to take a statement from              for the
            Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry.   I am currently trying to help
            in the aftermath of Hillsborough, through practical assistance and the
            offer of counselling.  Initial indications are that            |is quite
            traumatised by his experiences and he has not yet felt able to share
            those experiences with even those post closely involved with him.   He feels
            he would be still less ready to discuss the events at Hillsborough with
            officials he has never previously met.

            Both _____________ |and myself do appreciate the importance of a thorough
            inquiry, but at this stage he is asking me (through this letter) to
            confirm the reasons for his reluctance to assist you yet.     I would
            therefore ask you on his behalf to merely leave details of how to contact
            you when he feels able to assist in your inquiry.

            Yours faithfully

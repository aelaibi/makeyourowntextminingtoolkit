      where the semi-final is. The crowds have forced their way in -
      they've broken fences and the gate down. I don't know exactly
      what it is but there are people trapped. "

 3.   Actions of crews on arrival.

      Rivelin WrT - StnO Swain in Charge

      Attended the Leppings Lane side of ground and encountered       severe
      congestion that prevented immediate access to the ground.

      An immediate request for the use of a resuscitator on a casualty
      in the rear of an ambulance was answered.

      Rivelin 1 was made Contact Point in Leppings Lane for the incident
      with StnO Swain OiC.

      A request for resuscitation equipment inside the ground was
      received from a Police Officer. In view of this a "Make Pumps 10
      for resuscitators" message was sent. Crew members were despatched
      into the ground in an effort to make contact with Senior Police
      Officers, and ascertain the extent of the incident.
3.2   Central WrT 1 and 2 - StnO Fletcher and SubO        in Charge

      Attended at the Riverside Entrance off Penistone Road at the rear
      of the South Stand. The crews were not met or directed by the
      Police so the officers made their way onto the pitch to the area
      immediately in front of the West Stand where they found many
      casualties on the pitch who needed first aid treatment. No
      rescues as such needed to be undertaken but it was obvious that
      bodies and casualties needed to be attended to.

      The crew members were then directed to perform mouth to mouth
      resuscitation and first aid. Two resuscitators were used by the
      crews.

      A casualty receiving area was set up at the rear of the West Stand
      by so directing T/StnO      and casualties were moved from the
      pitch to this area by crews, police and spectators.

      Approximately 20-30 persons were moved to this area. The obvious
      dead being located in a holding area at the rear of the West Stand
      and   the   injured removed by ambulance to hospital.        Later
      information received by StnO Fletcher told him to evacuate
      casualties to the Gymnasium at the rear of the North Stand.

      The crews of Central 1 and 2 were joined and assisted by those
      from Darnall 1 and 2, Ringinglow 1 and the Emergency Tender from
      Central.

      When the pitch had been cleared of casualties ail crews were
      directed to the Gymnasium and carried out further assistance.

3.3   Central Emergency Tender - LFm Housley in Charge

      Attended at Penistone Road but could not gain access to the ground
      because of height restriction for the appliance. Proceeded to
      Leppings Lane and the Contact Point.

      The crew then proceeded as directed into the ground via the North
      Stand and onto the pitch with a resuscitator treating casualties
      both on the pitch and later in the Gymnasium.

3.4   Rinqinqlow WrT- StnO______ in Charge

      Attended at Leppings Lane entrance.

      The crew then proceeded as directed into the ground with a
      resuscitator and gave assistance to casualties on the pitch in
      front of the West Terrace together with the crews from Central 1
      and 2 and Darnall 1 and 2. When the pitch had been cleared of
      casualties the crew was directed to the Gymnasium.

3.5   Darnall WrT 1 and 2 - T/StnO        and SubO       in Charge

      Attended Leppings Lane entrance.  Crews entered the ground as
      directed and gained access to the pitch via the West Terrace
      rendering assistance to casualties with two resuscitators and




                                     2.
      mouth to mouth resuscitation. Working with other crews casualties
      were removed initially to the casualty receiving area which T/StnO
            had been directed to establish at the rear of the West Stand
      and subsequently to the gymnasium.

      On instructions from ADO Robjohns, SubO             and his crew
      undertook a circuit of the pitch to ascertain if any further
      injured people needed assistance and get them to the Gymnasium for
      treatment.   All crews were eventually located in the Gymnasium
      rendering assistance to casualties.

4.    The "make up" message from StnO Swain was received in County       Fire
      Service Control at 1528 by Brigade radio.

 INCIDENT - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND, SHEFFIELD - 15TH APRIL, 1989

     REPORT OF CHIEF FIRE OFFICER H.E. WRIGHT, QFSM, MIFireE, FBIM



Whilst at my home at Bawtry Road, Doncaster at about 1545 hours on
Saturday, 15th April, 1989, I received a telephone call from Fire
Service Control informing me of an incident at the Hillsborough
Football   Ground, Sheffield to which cutting equipment had been
requested with reports of fatalities and injuries to spectators. I was
informed that ten pumping appliances and two emergency tenders were in
attendance and the control unit had been mobilised.    Assistant Chief
Fire Officers Hornsby and Seaman had been mobilised but were not yet in
attendance, the senior officer in charge being Assistant Divisional
Officer Robjohns at that time.

Information from the incident was limited and as I expected an
Assistant Chief Fire Officer to arrive there in a relatively short
period of time I requested the next message.

No further information about the incident was received so I decided to
travel to Sheffield to make myself more available to attend the
incident should the need arise, booking mobile at 1554 hours.

The messages about the incident heard on the County Fire Service radio
scheme were sufficient for me to realise that a serious incident
existed at the Hillsborough football ground and I proceeded there
arriving at 1612 hours.

On arrival I was directed to an area behind the South Stand of the
stadium where I parked my car and was met by Temporary Station Officer
     who provided a very brief outline of the situation and advised me
of the location of the County Fire Service Control Unit in Leppings
Lane to which we both walked.

At the Control Unit I met Assistant Chief Fire Officers Hornsby and
Seaman, and Divisional Officers Hildreth and Lockwood and was advised
of the situation which was that many casualties had been dealt with
both on the pitch and at the gymnasium and these included fatalities.
At that time County Fire Service personnel were in the gymnasium
assisting with casualties or standing by at their appliances awaiting
further instructions. Contact had been established with the senior
Police Officers at their control point in the ground and Temporary
Assistant Divisional Officer Green had been positioned outside that
control point for liaison purposes and was in contact with the County
Fire Service Control Unit by radio.

Assistant Chief Fire Officer Hornsby advised me that he had contacted
the Senior Police Officer at their control point who had advised him
that no further action by the County Fire Service to that already being
undertaken was required.     I was also advised of the comments heard
regarding the possibility of crowd disturbance if the announcement was
made which abandoned the match.
I took over control of the Fire Service activities at this incident at
1618 hours. I considered the need for detailed information from the
Police as to requirements of the County Fire Service and the situation
as it existed at that time and instructed Assistant Chief Fire Officer
Seaman and Divisional Officer Lockwood to make personal contact with
the Senior Police Officer for that purpose.      A radio message was
received from Assistant Chief Fire Officer Seaman advising me that no
further requirement of the County Fire Service was needed, the pitch
and terrace were clear of casualties and that he was proceeding onto
the terrace area where the accident occurred.

The spectators had during this time been leaving the stadium at the
Leppings Lane end, a number of which made congratulatory remarks to the
personnel situated there.

As the crowd cleared somewhat I instructed Assistant Chief Fire Officer
Hornsby and another officer to personally check the situation at the
gymnasium where casualties were still being dealt with.

Assistant Chief Fire Officer Seaman and Divisional Officer Lockwood
then returned to the Control Unit and provided information relating to
the situation on the West Terrace and I decided to view this myself
with Assistant Chief Fire Officer Seaman.

I decided to visit the Police Control Point at the stadium and whilst
en route received an up to date report from Assistant Chief Fire
Officer Hornsby regarding the situation       in the gymnasium with a
suggestion that we reduce the number of appliances and crews at the
ground.

Upon my arrival at the Police Control Point I observed Assistant Chief
Constable Jackson on the telephone and Chief Superintendents Hole and
Duckenfield all of who I knew together with other officers. I spoke to
Chief Superintendent Hole and advised him that I proposed to reduce the
number of crews at the ground to four unless the Police required the
retention of more. No objections to this reduction were made and
thanks were expressed for our attendance. An instruction was given by
radio for all but four pumping appliances to return to their relative
bases.

I proceeded to the gymnasium where I met Assistant Chief Fire Officer
Hornsby, Divisional Officer Lockwood, Assistant Divisional Officer
Robjohns and Station Officer Swain. The senior Police Officer was no
readily apparent to me and no other Fire Service presence was evident.
As I could only see fatal casualties being collected in this area I
instructed Assistant Divisional Officer Robjohns to make contact with
the Senior Police Officer at this location tosee if there was a need
for a fire Service presence and to advise me of the result of     this
enquiry by radio.      I then proceeded to return to the Control Unit
stopping at the West Terrace to again look at the area in which the
incident had occurred.

Assistant Divisional Officer Robjohns advised me that no presence was
required at the gymnasium and I instructed him to return to the Control
Unit.
Whilst at the Control Unit I was advised by an officer in charge of an
appliance that Assistant Divisional Officer Robjohns car had sustained
damage due to supporters leaving the ground walking over it. I
inspected this with ADO Robjohns and noted damage to most surfaces of
the paintwork.

Instructions were given for all appliances to return to their bases at
1724 hours after sending a "Stop" message to Fire Service Control.




Chief Fire Officer.

Subject   Major Accident - Hillsborough Football Ground              Date   24.05.1989



          Sir,

          I am 38 years of age, single and I am employed by the South Yorkshire
          County Fire Service as a Fire Control Operator. My duties include
          accepting incoming telephone calls from other emergency services and
          the   general   public, recording such calls and despatching the
          appropriate fire appliance in respect of the incident in question.  I
          then maintain radio contact with the despatched appliances throughout
          the duration of the incident.

          At 1512 hours, Saturday, 15th April, 1989 I was on duty in the Control
          Room, situated at Fire Service Headquarters, Wellington Street,
          Sheffield. I was at that time in telephone contact with Police Force
          Control situated at Police Headquarters, Snig Hill, Sheffield and
          passing to them information in respect of appliances having been
          despatched to a house fire, where there was a possibility of an
          elderly lady trapped in the house, situated at Gatty Road, Shiregreen,
          Sheffield.   This subsequently resulted in the death of the elderly
          lady. Whilst in conversation with the Police Force Control at 1513-                   ■


          the following conversation took place :

          Police               Can we have cutting        gear for Hillsborough please
                               straight away.

          Fire Control      Just a minute, right what's the address?

          Police            Cutting equipment for Hillsborough        football   ground
                            straight away.

          Fire Control      Hillsborough football ground?

          Police            Yes, Hillsborough football ground.

          Fire Control      What road is that on, do you know?

          Police            There has been a major accident, all the ambulances
                            are up there.

          Fire Control      What road is it on?

          Police               I have no idea, Hillsborough football ground.

          Fire Control      What road is it on, do you know?

          Police               "Hillsborough football ground, what road is it on?"
                               (this was said to someone in Police Force Control) -
                               "Penistone Road” (to Fire Control)
Fire Control     Penistone Road.

Police           Penistone Road O.K.

Fire Control     Penistone Road,    just      a    minute    -   what's   exactly
                 involved?

Police           It's football,     a   big       match,    Liverpool     v    Notts
                 Forest.

Fire Control     Yes, but why do you want us, you said it was an                 RTA
                 (Road Traffic Accident).

Police           No, no, no, major incident inside the ground.

Fire Control     Major   incident   inside, do you know exactly what it
                 is?

Police           No I don't, they want all the cutting gear.

Fire Control      For what, do you know?

Police            Hang on a sec.

Police            (Male voice) - Hello.

Fire Control      Hello, now you want some cutting gear, what                 exactly
                  is it for?

Police           There has been a major accident at Hillsborough
                  football ground where the semi-final is, the crowds
                  have forced their way in, they have broken fences
                  and gates down, I don't know exactly what it is but
                  there are people trapped.

Fire Control     Right, O.K. leave it with us.

The above conversation was simultaneously recorded on audio tape at
the Fire Control and the tape has been preserved and can be produced
in evidence if so required.

I did not know what street Hillsborough Football Ground was on and I
needed to ascertain the name of the street and district before I could
attempt to get the computer to display a list of the nearest available
pumping and special appliances. This is why I kept asking the Police
Force Control for further information as to the location.

During the conversation between myself and Police Force Control,
temporary Senior Fire Control Operator          | who was monitoring
the call, suggested that it could be located on Penistone Road and the
Police confirmed this. I also knew that before a decision could be
made as to the type and number of appliances required to attend I
would have to know why the Fire Service were needed and what was
involved.

Police Force Control were asking for cutting gear and I needed to know
why. I kept on asking questions so that I could ascertain what type
of emergency situation we were required to attend.
The pre-determined attendance for Penistone Road, Owlerton is 2
pumping appliances. Due to the unusual nature of the incident I did
not feel qualified to decide what attendance should be made. I waited
for specific instructions which were given to me by temporary Senior
Fire Control Operator               and I was instructed to mobilise 6
pumping appliances, one emergency tender and the control unit.       I
immediately acted on these instructions.

The appliances were immediately despatched and the first appliance was
recorded arriving at the scene at 1522 hours.    Together with other
Fire Control Operators I then subsequently maintained contact with all
appliances and officers at the scene of . the incident together with
other ongoing incidents until the end of my watch at 1800 hours.

Subject   Major Accident - Hillsborough Football Ground       Date    24.05.1989



          Sir,

          I was on duty on Saturday, 15th April, 1989 as Temporary Senior Fire
          Control Operator and was responsible for mobilising duties at the time
          of call for the Hillsborough Football Ground.

          I monitored a call which Fire Control Operator S. Davies was talking
          from the Police, they were asking for the cutting gear straight away
          to a major accident at the Hillsborough Football Ground, the operator
          asked several times for a road; butthey were unable to give one, at
          this time I asked the operator to ask the Police if it was Penistone
          Road, which they confirmed.

          Fire Control Operator Davies tried to find out why the cutting gear
          was required, and eventually a male caller came onto the line and
          stated that they did not know exactly what was involved except people
          were believed to be trapped.

          I asked Fire Control Operator Davies to type the address details
          "Penistone Road, Hillsborough" on her screen format in an attempt to
          get the computer to display a list of the nearest           available
          appliances.   There was not a match in the computer for this address,
          but there was an option for Penistone  Road, Owlerton.   I told the
          operator to select this option as I knew it to be the correct
          district, and a list of the nearest available appliances          was
          immediately displayed.

          The mobilising details for Penistone Road, Owlerton did not indicate
          that the Football Ground was a special risk, and this prompted me to
          make a further search of tKe data Ease to see if a special risk
          existed.

          I asked Fire Control Operator Davies to enter "Wednesday Football
          Ground" on the premise line in an attempt to retrieve a better address
          and back up details from the computer, but no options were displayed.

          As I monitored the conversation between the Police Control and Fire
          Control Operator Davies, although the information being passed was not
          adequate for our needs, it was obvious that they were unable to give
          us any more precise details.

          There is not any special attendance recommended for this type of
          incident, I therefore relied on my instinct and instructed Fire
          Control Operator Davies to mobilise six pumps, one emergency tender,
          and the control unit at 1516 hours.
I had initially given consideration to the number of emergency tenders
which may be required to attend, but I delayed in mobilising the
second emergency tender until I had re-assessed the situation.      At
1521 hours I gave instructions for a second emergency tender to be
mobilised from Barnsley Station knowing it was equipped with cutting
gear.

At   1527 hours a message from the first pumping appliance in
attendance, Rivelin 1, was received in Control requesting "make pumps
ten for resuscitation equipment" and I mobilised a further four pumps
to attend.

No further address details for Hillsborough Football Ground were
obtained by the Fire Service Control until receipt of a message from
Rivelin Station pump at 1529 hours requesting "all appliances to
attend at the Leppings Lane entrance". These instructions were given
by radio to all officers and appliances who were still mobile to the
incident.

ADO Mulcrone came into the Control Room during the ongoing incident
and was arranging for further oxygen cylinders to be available should
they be required at the Football Ground. I assisted him in contacting
B.O.C. Brinsworth, liaising with the control unit, and confirming with
the appliances on return to station if they required replacement
cylinders.

At all times I monitored the movements of all the appliances which
were   proceeding to the Hillsborough Football Ground, and when
necessary monitored all other incoming emergency calls which were
being handled whilst this incident was ongoing.

I also worked in liaison with Fire Control Officer            who was
the Officer in Charge of Control on that day, to make sure that
pumping appliances were brought into station areas which were denuded
of cover.

This kept me fully employed until the night watch came on duty at 1800
hours, and I was able to be relieved of my duties.




Leading Fire Control Operator
SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE


INCIDENT - HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND - 1STK APRIL, 1989

REPORT OF ACO A. HORNSBY


At approximately 1530 hours I received a telephone call from FCO
in Fire Service Control. He informed me that they had a "Major Incident"
in progress at Hillsborough Football Ground involving a large number of
fatalities and casualties.     I informed FCO         that I would attend
the incident.

On arrival at Hillsborough I was directed by the Police towards the
Leppings Lane entrance and I parked my car at the rear of a fire
appliance 100 yards from the Control Unit. I ascertained from the Sub
Officer in charge of the appliance that the Control Unit was in
attendance at Leppings Lane but he had seen the OiC, DO Lockwood, proceed
towards the Gymnasium where most of the casualties were. I handed my
tally to the Sub Officer and asked him to take it to the Control Unit for
me and to inform them that I was proceeding to the Gymnasium. Stn.O.
      ~|accompanied me to the Gymnasium (the crowd at this time were
impatient and I noticed several scuffles with the police).

On arrival at the Gymnasium I contacted ADO Robjohns and he briefed me
that there were approximately 50 fatalities and 70 seriously injured
persons in the Gymnasium and to the best of his knowledge all casualties
had been removed from the terraces, etc. He could not at that time tell
me how the incident had occurred.        I walked round the inside of the
Gymnasium and met Stn.O. Fletcher. I ascertained that all Fire Service
personnel were all right and were standing by to assist in first aid
treatment. I contacted DCAO Hopkins who was organising casualty handling
in the Gymnasium and I asked if there was any additional services he
required from the Fire Service. He replied that the Fire Service had
done a grand job and that no additional services were required. I
contacted ADO Robjohns and instructed him to remain at the Gymnasium as
OiC of the Advanced Control Point and that the Fire Service Crews were to
stay there with him.

Accompanied by Stn.O.        I went to the Police Station in the grounds
to ascertain any further details of how the incident occurred and I was
informed that three barriers had given way in one corner of the "Kop".

I telephoned Fire Service Control from the Police Station and informed
them that there were possibly 70 fatalities and 30 seriously injured and
that the information was to be passed on to the Chief Fire Officer.

I then proceeded to the Control Unit and informed Fire Service Control
and all personnel on the fireground that I had taken over as OiC of the
incident. I then proceeded to the Police Control Viewing Gallery to
establish a contact with the Senior Police Officer. An Inspector was in
charge of the Police Control and he informed me that ACC Jackson was OiC
of the incident and he was located in the middle of the football pitch.
I asked if there were any further casualties requiring Fire Service
assistance, to which he replied "No", and I also asked if he required any
additional Fire Service assistance, to which he also replied "No".
Whilst discussing the incident in general a telephone message was
received in the Police Control from a Club Official requesting that a
carefully worded message be transmitted over the Public Tannoy System
informing the crowd that the match had been abandoned. The senior Police
Officer refused to transmit that message unless        authorised by ACC
Jackson.   He stated that there had been a lot of skirmishes andwith the
current atmosphere he was afraid a riot might ensue.

I left one officer, ADO Green (with fireground radio), at the Police
Control Viewing Gallery and instructed him to act as Liaison Officer.  I
returned to the Control Unit and issued instructions to all Fire Service
Personnel to eithers-

         1.   Report to the Gymnasium and remainthere.
         2.   Report to the Control Unit.
         3.   Remain seated on their appliances.

I instructed SDO Smoothey to report to the Gymnasium and   to ensure en
route that any Fire Service personnel he saw were          informed of my
instructions.

The Chief Fire Officer arrived and I informed him of the         situation
although   at that time I was still       unsure of how the incidentoccurred.
The CFO took over as OiC of the incident.

I remained on the Control Unit until the crowd had adequately dispersed
and then I accompanied the Brigade Photographer to the "Kop end" where
the injuries had been sustained and then we proceeded to the Gymnasium.
I ascertained from the DCAO, Mr. Hopkins, that no further immediate
assistance was required of the Fire Service personnel and then contacted
the CFO suggesting that, with the exception of 4 appliances and the
Control Unit, all other appliances be returned to base.

The CFO arrived at the Gymnasium and informed me that he had reduced
appliances as suggested. The CFO was briefed by ADO Robjohns and Stn.O.
Fletcher.

I was instructed by the CFO to contact the Senior Police Officer to see
if they required any further assistance from the Fire Service - ACC
Jackson was contacted and he informed me that our services were no longer
required.

                           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
            OPERATIONAL EQUIPMENT IN ATTENDANCE AT THE INCIDENT

            REPORT BY ASSISTANT CHIEF FIRE OFFICER A.D. HORNSBY


The policy in the South Yorkshire County Fire Service is that all
operational fire appliances carry the same firefighting equipment which
is located in the same position on each appliance.     A list of the
appliances in attendance at the incident is attached (see Appendix A),
together with an inventory of the rescue equipment carried on the
Emergency Tender (see Appendix B).

1.    Resuscitation Equipment

     Each appliance carries a Brook Airway and an Oxygen Resuscitator
     with two oxygen cylinders.

      There are two types of Oxygen Resuscitator on appliances

      (a)    Motivus   -   ) details of which appliance carries which
      (b)    Maxaman   -   ) resuscitator as detailed on Appendix A.

     The reason that two types of resuscitator are maintained within
     the Brigade is that the Motivus set is no longer produced and has
     been superseded by the Maxaman set.

     The resuscitators work on the principle of a controlled flow of
     oxygen being supplied to the patient which will ventilate the
     patients lungs if he/she is not breathing or assist if he/she has
     difficulty in breathing.

     The only difference between the two resuscitators is :

      (a)   Maxaman - ceases to supply oxygen once the patient breathes
            on their own.

      (b)   Motivus- continues the oxygen flow after the patient
            breatheson their own and the oxygen is released to open air
            by a trip valve.

     Each set operates on a rotary scale which is suitably variable
     from child to adult settings. The duration of the sets varies
     from 20 to 40 minutes per cylinder.

     Each set is subject to a weekly standard test which consists of
     checking the contents of the oxygen cylinder to ensure that the
     cylinder is at least 75% full. The set is also checked to ensure
     that the cycling changes on the adult and child settings.

2.   Failure of Resuscitator

     At the incident resuscitator set no. 1297 which was carried on
     Stocksbridge 2 appliance did not function properly.

     As part of the Brigade procedure the resuscitator was impounded
     and an investigation was carried out by the Brigade Equipment
     Officer as to the reason for the failure (see Appendix C).
3.    Specialist Resuscitators

      Enquiries have been carried out to determine if resuscitation
      equipment suitable for dealing with crush injuries is available,
      but to date we have no knowledge of such equipment.

4.    Rescue Equipment

      Host operational   firefighting    equipment can be utilised for
      rescue purposes    and a list      of such equipment is attached
      (Appendix D).

      Equipment which could have proven useful in removing the          barrier
      fencing in such an emergency is as follows :

Bolt Cutters

These are approximately 3 feet in length, similar in operation to a
pair of scissors and are capable of cutting through metal rods.

Hydraulic Rescue Set

Consists of various pieces of equipment suitable         for   spreading    and
forcing apart obstacles up to 8 ton in weight.

Air Tools

Air operated pneumatic      zip   gun   suitable   for cutting through metal
sheeting and rivets.

Air operated pneumatic saw for cutting through      metal   sheeting,    bolts
and rods.

Tirfor Equipment

Equipment which works on the winch principle of pulling of lifting
obstacles up to 2 ton (5 ton on ET) in weight utilising slings and
chains.

Thermal Cutting Equipment

This equipment is carried on all Emergency Tenders and is capable of
cutting through all ferrous metals of unlimited thickness even under
water. It operates by a special cable being burnt at high temperatures
as a result of oxygen being fed into it. There is sufficient equipment
per Emergency Tender for 6-10 minutes duration.

Hurst Cutting/Spreading Equipment

A petrol driven engine provides hydraulic power through hydraulic hoses
to either -

(1)   Cutters

      Providing a cutting force of 15 ton in the optimum position.         Not
      suitable for hardened or tensile steel.
(2)   Spreaders

      Providing a spreading distance of 24” with a force of 3.60 ton
      and a pulling distance of 24" with a force of 2.55 ton.

          HILLSBOROUGH INCIDENT.   MAXAMAN RESUSCITATOR FAILURE


At approximately 0915 hours on Tuesday, 18th April, 1989, I received a
telephone call from West Division Headquarters stating that they were
holding Maxaman Resuscitator, Serial No.1297 which had been impounded
after failing to work at the Hillsborough incident. This resuscitator is
normally carried on Stocksbridge 2 appliance. It was reported that the
resuscitator was delivering an oxygen flow comparable with the control
knob being in the "child" setting and would not adjust.

The set was collected from West Division Headquarters and brought to the
Technical Services Office at Command Headquarters. On examination it was
confirmed that the set was working as described.

The end cap of the control knob was removed and it was discovered that the
control knob retaining nut had worked loose allowing the knob to turn on
the spindle without turning the spindle itself which wouldadjust the
flow.   The control knob was set in its correct position and the nut made
finger tight. This allowed the set to function correctly and adjustments
to the flow rate between "child" and "adult" to be made. The set was then
transported to the Brigade Training Centre to be placed on the test lung
to ensure the correct tidal volume of oxygen was flowing at maximum and
minimum settings. Once this was confirmed, the control knob nut was fully
tightened and the set returned to West Division Headquarters to be put
back into service.

Part of the Brigade weekly test on resuscitators is to start  it cycling
and adjust the control knob to its extreme settingsto ensure that the
flow rate does adjust. It is possible that this nut was slightly loose at
the time of the last weekly test but not loose enough to show a
malfunction. Further vibration due to being carried on the appliance may
then have loosened the nut to the extent of not operating the spindle at
it's next use.

Records show that this resuscitator was last tested on 10th    April,   1989,
and was working satisfactorily.

Opinion as to if the Fire Service had been called       to   the   incident:
earlier could they have been of more assistance




At whatever stage the Fire Service had been called in attendance we
carry sufficient equipment on each and every appliance to be able to
cut and remove the perimeter fence quickly. In addition we carry
equipment with which we cam pull the fence down. Over and above that
on the Emergency Tender we carry more heavy duty equipment which would
also perform the same function.

Subject   Hillsborough Incident - Saturday, April 15th 1989 Date     18.04.89



          1.      I was duty ACO on the above date.     I had worked at Fire
                   Service Headquarters during the morning and arrived back home
                   at about 1345 hrs and closed on button 9 (available at home)
                   on the encoder unit in my vehicle.

                   At about 1525 hrs I tuned into Radio Sheffield for news of the
                   FA Cup Semi Final matches which were being played.

          2.      It was immediately obvious that some kind of serious incident
                   had occurred at Hillsborough Football Ground and a reference
                   was made to fatalities. I anticipated that the Fire Service
                   would   most   likely have been called and I immediately
                   telephoned Fire Service Control. The number was continuously
                   engaged and it was not until about 1540 hrs that I managed to
                   contact Control.

          3.      I was informed that the Fire Service had received a message
                   "Major incident - cutting gear required" and was given details
                   of the appliances attending. I asked who the Senior Officer
                   mobilised to the incident was and why I had not been informed.
                   I was told that Control had me shown on a paging unit and that
                   they had tried to contact me by that means without success.
                   They had therefore contacted ACO Hornsby who was attending. I
                   informed them that I had been at home since 1345 hrs and also
                   that I was mobilising to the incident.

          4.      I set off to Hillsborough shortly after 1540 hrs and arrived
                   at about 1614     hrs. Whilst enroute, I received a message via
                   Control from the Chief Fire Officer asking me to obtain
                   information on     the exact details   of the incident and to
                   contact him as soon as possible.

          5.      In fact the Chief Fire Officer arrived at the Control Unit
                   about one minute after I had arrived and a meeting took place
                   between the Chief Fire Officer, myself, ACO Hornsby and
                   Divisional Officers Hildreth and Lockwood. The Chief Fire
                   Officer wanted to know what actions were being taken by the
                   Fire Service and what the police required the Fire Service to
                   do. DO Hildreth was the Officer in Charge of the Fire Service
                   Control Unit. He said that in order to establish contact with
                   the police he     had posted T/ADO Green outside the police
                   control box with a fireground radio so that he was able to
                   communicate from there to the fire service Control Unit.
                   ACO Hornsby had surveyed the position which was that numerous
                   people had been crushed on a part of the terraces and had had
to be removed onto the pitch where they were being given
resuscitation and first aid.    Fire Service personnel were
actively engaged doing this on the pitch and also in carrying
the injured to the club gymnasium which had been set up as a
clearing   station.   ADO Robjohns was in charge of that
operation.

The Chief Fire Officer decided it was necessary to make
contact with the Officer-in-Charge of the police control and
instructed myself and DO Lockwood to attend. When we arrived
there, T/ADO Green was at the top of the steps leading to the
control box and I asked him who the senior police officer was.
He said that there were a number of police officers inside and
he did not know which one was in charge. I went inside and
asked who the senior police officer was and indicated that the
Chief Fire Officer wanted to know if the police required any
assistance from the Fire Service beyond that which they were
currently undertaking.

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson spoke very briefly to me and
said that he was in conversation (by telephone I think) with
the Chief Constable and could not talk further at that point
but he would speak with the Chief Fire Officer as soon as he
could. From what I could see fromthat point there did not
appear to be anything more required of the Fire Servics.

I left the police control box        and sent a message to the
Control Unit by fireground radio. I was able to see the
section of terrace and confirmed that it was on the West Stand
terrace in the area behind the goal mouth. The area was clear
and I passed a message that myself and DO Lockwood were making
our way to that part of the terrace to investigate.

We inspected the terrace and it appeared that a single crush
barrier had failed at a point about 12 feet from the perimeter
fence. (I know now that two sections of a three section crush
barrier had failed) I passed this information to the Control
Unit and then returned to the Control Unit to speak with the
Chief Fire Officer.

The Chief Fire Officer and myself went to inspect the terrace
after which we went to the police control box. All casualties
had been removed from the pitch at that time. The Chief Fire
Officer spoke with ACC Jackson in the control box while I
remained outside.     When the Chief Fire Officer returned, a
message was received from ADO Robjohns via the Control Unit
indicating that the work of the Fire Service was almost
complete and suggesting that pumps be reduced to four.      The
Chief Fire Officer confirmed this action and we then made our
way to the gymnasium area part of which was being used as a
mortuary.    At this point the Chief Fire Officer decided to go
to West Division Headquarters to look at the file kept on
Hillsborough and asked that Divisional Officer Binnington, the
SFPO of West Division, be contacted and asked to meet him
there.    I then went to meet DO Binnington and the CFO at West
Division Headquarters and remained there until about 2200
hours.
11.     During the evening, I checked with Fire Service Control what
        status the display board was showing for me, bearing in mind
        the problem in contacting me earlier, and it was apparent that
        although the encoder in my vehicle was indicating that my
        status   had been updated, the Control computer was not
        registering for some reason.

Subject   Major Incident Hillsborough Football Ground             Date      20.04.89
          15th April, 1989



          On the 15th April, 1989, at 1527 hrs. whilst on stand-by at my home
          address, I received a telephone call from Fire Servics Control
          informing me of a major incident at Hillsborough Football Ground.   Six
          pumps, two emergency tenders and the Control Unit had been mobilised to
          the incident, the precise details of which were unknown.     I was to
          attend the Leppings Lane entrance to the ground. I confirmed my
          intention to attend.

          Whilst en route, I was requested, by     radio,   to   take    charge   of   the
          Control Unit on my arrival.

          I arrived in Leppings Lane at 1558 hrs at which time there was very
          little traffic or pedestrian obstruction. I was advised by a police
          constable to park in a side street as they were expecting trouble from
          spectators when they left the ground. I was unaware that the game was
          being abandoned or the extent of the incident at this time.

          On proceeding down Leppings Lane, I met ADO Green who accompanied me to
          the Control Unit. On entering the Control Unit I made contact with
          L.Fm          I enquired who was in overall charge from the Police and
          had contact been made with them.        He replied in the negative but
          informed me that Divisional Officer Lockwood was in charge of the Fire
          Service and that he and ADO Robjohn were in radio contact. ACO Hornsby
          was also in attendance and had gone to the gymnasium to rendezvous with
          Divisional Officer Lockwood. It was obvious the Control Unit was not
          in contact with the officer in charge of the police and that we had at
          that time no direct lines of communication with them.

          ADO Green was instructedto take a fireground radio, proceed to the
          police control box, establish a communication link      and   obtain
          information regarding the extent of the incident.

          At about this time, Assistant Chief Officer Hornsby entered the Control
          Unit having done a survey of the incident and briefed me regarding the
          extent of the incident, the approximate number of casualties and their
          locations.

          I was engaged throughout the incident in the Control Unit.         At no     time
          was any police presence available at the Control Unit.
                                                                                    31
There were no problems experienced by the Control Unit in providing the
command post for this incident. I attach a copy of the plan drawn in
the Control Unit, and a list of the messages sent, officers and
appliances attending as recorded in the Control Unit.

Subject   Incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium     Date
          on the 15th April 1989                                       17.4.89



          On Saturday 15th April 1989 at 1517 hours, whilst mobile to an
          incident at Shiregreen, Sheffield. I was informed by Fire Service
          Control, that a major incident had occurred at the Hillsborough
          Football Stadium. I informed Control that I would redirect to this
          incident.

          I arrived at the Stadium at 1529 hours and immediately rendezvoued
          with StnO Swain at the Leppings Lane entrance. I obtained
          information from the StnO to the effect that, numerous casualties
          were involved, suffering crush injuries and asphyxiation, he had
          requested make pumps 10 for resuscitation equipment and that in his
          opinion it was confusion and chaos within the ground. I advised the
          StnO that I would take over command of the incident and that he
          should advise control of that fact and that Rivelin 1 was contact
          point for the incident and he was to assume the duties of Control
          Officer, at the appliance. I then commandeered a fireground radio
          and proceeded to the ground through the- tunnel leading into the West
          stand Terracing. En route I passed numerous casualties suffering
          minor injuries and shock.

          On entering the ground, the bottom terracing of the stand was
          relatively empty, the fans either having left the ground or
          congregating on the pitch. I made my way onto the pitch in order to
          ascertain the gravity of the situation, it was an hopeless task due
          to the hundreds of fans and numerous police officers massing at this
          end of the pitch. It was obvious that there were a large number of
          casualties but to determine the nature of injuries or whether First
          Aid assistance was being administered, was impossible. I attempted
          to make contact with the Senior Police Officer in charge on the
          pitch, but because I had no means of identifying who this was I
          approached a Police Inspector. I suggested that attempts ought to be
          made to clear the pitch of those fans not directly assisting in
          casualty handling, this would then enable me to determine those
          casualties not receiving attention.

          I then made contact with StnO        and StnO Fletcher and obtained
          from them an overview of the situation. I was advised that
          casualties were being cleared to the Penistone Road end of the pitch.
          I decided to make my way to this end of the ground and control and
          deploy Fire Service Personnel where required. I advised the contact
          point to send all available personnel and resuscitators to this end
          of the pitch where numerous casualties required assistance. Whilst
          in control of this situation, I was advised by a fireman that there
          were further casualties requiring assistance in the gymnasium, I
          deployed personnel to this location.
During this period I heard over the Fireground radio that DO Lockwood
was now in command of the incident. I advised DO Lockwood of the
situation at the main casualty clearing area and requested that in
order to speed up the evacuation of casualties to hospital, further
ambulances should be deployed to the Penistone Road end of the
ground.

I remained on the football pitch until all the casualties on the
pitch had been removed, if then deployed a crew to make their way
around the perimeter of the pitch to confirm that no further
casualties required assistance, I then proceeded to the gymnasium.

The gymnasium was divided into 3 sections, the first section was a
make shift mortuary containing approximately 50 fatalities, the
centre section was in use as the casualty handling area.
Approximately 30 casualties suffering from all types of injury, were
in this area. Fire Service personnel were involved in resuscitating
and rendering general first aid at this location. I arranged for all
available personnel and equipment to be deployed to the gymnasium.

ACO Hornsby made contact with me at the gymnasium and I advised him
of the situation, he advised me that he was now in command of the
incident. Shortly afterwards SDO Smoothey arrived and I reiterated
the situation.

I remained at the gymnasium overseeing casualty removal and acting as
Fire Service Liaison Officer, until no longer required.

          S.S.C. Incident - Hillsborough Football Ground
Subject   Sheffield Saturday 15th April 1989                   Date    20.4.89


          As duty s.D.O. I was informed by Brigade Control of a reported 'Major Ircident'
          that had been reported at Hillsborough Football Ground. Control were not able
          to inform me of the exact nature of the Incident at that time, but said that
          six appliances had been mobilised and that D.O. Lockwood and A.D.O. Robjohn
          were attending.   I instructed Control to inform me on any further messages,
          and decided to proceed to the Incident. Enroute to the Incident I was aware
          from 'Radio Messages' that appliances had been 'made up' and that more Senior
          Officers were attending.   I arrived at the ground and not being aware of the
          exact Contact Point, I parked my car outside the General Office Block and
          proceeded on foot. Being informed by Service Personnel whilst enroute that
          the Contact Point was at the Lepping Lane End of the ground. After reporting
          to the Control Unit, I was briefed by A.C.O. Hornsby and instructed to over­
          see the roles of D.O. Lockwood who was in charge of a group of. personnel
          attempting to rescue/recover persons injured in the area of the Lepping Lane
          terrace and on the football pitch, and A.D.O. Robjohn who was in charge of
          Service Personnel in the Training Gym at the rear of the new stand. Fatalities
          were being taken to that location.   I was issued with a hand set radio and
          proceeded to make contact with D.O. Lockwood. I contacted him on the Gantry
          of the Police Surveillance Point at the junction of the Main Stand and the
          Lepping Lane Terrace.   He pointed out to me the roles of Fire Service
          Personnel who were on the area of the pitch, and informed me that in general
          all the fatalities had been removed, all Personnel were looking to assist
          in any first aid. From the vantage point of the Gantry I was able to observe
          that several hundred fans were on the pitch, there was a large Police presence
          on the pitch and in the area of the terrace at the rear of the Goal Posts.   I
          was satisfied that at that stage no further persons remained trapped in the
          area of the terrace immediately behind the goal. D.O. Lockwood informed me that
          there was soon to be a public address announcement that the match had been
          abandoned, and we agreed that it would be best if Fire Service Personnel were
          to leave the area of the pitch before such an announcement was made. I was
          concerned for a possible adverse reaction from the supporters who were rcming
          about on the pitch. I proceded to the pitch and instructed Fire Service
          Personnel to leave the area of the pitch as I was concerned about a possible
          crowd reaction to a pending announcement that the game had been abandoned.   In
          fact the announcement was made whilst I was on the pitch and was received in a
          good and orderly manner by spectators.   I proceded to the Gym and made contact
          with A.D.O. Robjohn who had several Fire Service Personnel with him. He
          showed me the fatalities layed out on the Gym floor and indicated that
          resuscitation had been carried out, but that all actions had now concluded.
          Strict control on entry into the area of the Gym was being exercised by the
          Police, and I was satisfied that Fire Service Personnel in the area of the
          Gym could remain and carry out any assistance required of them in assisting
          with fatalities.   Liquid refreshment was available to all members of the
          emergency services within the area of the Gym. Several Fire Service
          Personnel informed me of their efforts at resuscitation and the harrowing
          sites they had observed. After a period of time I returned to the area of
          the pitch and noted that the ground had almost emptied, I returned to the
          Gym and informed A.D.O. Robjohn that if all tasks had been completed, he
          should assemble all Fire Service Personnel together with any equipment and
          return to the Control Unit. A.D.O. Robjohn informed the Control Unit of my
          instruction to return but was informed to remain with Fire Service Personnel
          Continued.

in the area of the Gym until advised by the Control Unit. I assumed that
Officers at the Control Unit remained concerned about the reaction of
Football fans and felt it safest for Fire Service Personnel to remain in
the Gym until the crowd had moved away from the area outside the stadium.
I returned to the Control Unit to see if   I could be of assistance in any
further role. At this point A.C.O. Hornsby informed me that the incident
from an Operational Point of view was being wound down. I left the incident
at approximately 1730 hours. •

Whilst I observed the results of the incident, i.e. the damaged/broken
crowd barrier, restrictions in the crowd escaping from the area of the
terrace at the Lepping Lane End.^ I did not witness any actions at the
time the incident commenced, and as such I am unable to offer any
positive judgements as to any actions/omissions taken at that time.

Subject   Incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium     Date
          on the 15th April 1989                                       17.4.89



          On Saturday the 15th April 1989 at 1522 hours. I was informed of
          major incident requiring cutting gears at the Hillsborough Football
          Stadium and that six pumps and Emergency Tender had been mobilised.
          I booked mobile to the incident at 1524 hours.

          En route, I heard a make pumps 10 message for resuscitation equipment
          on the radio.

          My initial approach to the Stadium was via Penistone Road and I
          encountered some traffic congestion at this side of the stadium.
          Further radio messages informed me that appliances should attend the
          Leppings Lane entrance.

          I proceeded to this area and met StnO Swain at the contact point. He
          informed me that crews were inside the stadium and ADO Robjohns was
          requesting additional resuscitation equipment. I instructed StnO
          Swain to assemble all crews and equipment not already committed into
          the stadium at the contact point and to maintain contact with me by
          fireground radio.

          I then proceeded into the stadium via the centre tunnel of •Lhe West
          Stand. I was then confronted by a scene of several hundred
          spectators and police on the football pitch.

          No Fire Service Personnel were evident to me and I later realised
          that this was because they were down at ground level attending to
          casualties and therefore screened from any view by standing
          spectators.

          I then proceeded down onto the pitch and eventually located StnO
          Fletcher who informed me of the situation as he knew it at that
          stage. That was, that some casualties had been taken out to the
          Lepping Lane entrance, but the majority had been and were been taken
          to the gymnasium at the Penistone Road entrance. First aid and
          resuscitation was being administered by crews on the pitch.

          I could find no Senior Police Officer present on the pitch so I made
          my way up to the Police Control Box. When I arrived at the Control
          Box I could see the whole of the ground, and a number of casualties
          being dealt with by Fire Service Personnel. When I entered the
          Police Box,I identified myself and asked who was the Senior Officer
          in charge. I was told the assistant Chief Constable but they did not
          know where he was. I also asked if a senior officer of the Ambulance
          Service was available and was told that they did not know.
                                                                        lu


No police officer present came forward and identified himself or gave
me any information on the situation and I was virtually Ignored as
th*y busied themselves on the telephones and radio.

ADO Robjohns then contacted me by radio stating that he needed men
and equipment in the gymnasium. This I arranged with StnO Swain by
radio at the contact point and then continued to co-ordinate movement
of men and equipment from the vantage point at the Police Control
Box.

When the Fire Service Control Unit arrived I requested an officer
with a fireground radio to relieve me at the Control Box so that I
could report to the Control Unit in person.

I was relieved by T/ADO Green. On arrival at the Control Unit.   I
briefed ACO Hornsby gff the incident at that stage.

          As Officer in Charge of Central One, I responded on the initial
          turnout to the Sheffield Wednesday Ground Incident, with a total crew
          of four men.

          On arrival at Penistone Road I and Station Officer Fletcher tried to
          find out from the police what the incident was. All the police could
          say at that time was there had been some fighting. We then decided to
          take our pumps down the Riverside Entrance. This was fortunate as we
          pulled up right outside the police observation point. Even at this
          point I did not know what the incident was. I instructed my crew to
          stay with the appliance the Station Officer and myself went into the
          ground. From the top of the walkway what I saw was bodies laid out
          all over, at and around the goal mouth area. A verbal and radio
          message was sent to both crews. All resuscitation and cutting
          equipment required. The cutting equipment was not used at all. I
          got my crew to work on as many people as possible, mouth to mouth,
          cardiac compressions and resuscitations with the one resuscitator
          carried on our appliance.

          People were just tugging and begging us to do something and keep
          going. I took over control of both crews to do what we could with
          the equipment we had, including the use of our own personal
          resusciades.

          I was informed there were some ambulances outside near the appliances
          I organised stretchers to remove people out to the ambulances which
          were parked at the side of Central One and Two. Word then came
          through to all casualties to the sports hall. All personnel and
          resuscitators to report to the sports hall. Station Officer Fletcher
          and myself tried to organise with the Officer in Charge of the
          Ambulance Service, some kind of priority of moving the people from
          the hall into the ambulances, as people with slight injuries were
          just walking into the ambulances. This was fruitless. I took over
          this role for a while. A doctor then took over from me. We carried
          people into the ambulances on his orders. I was then asked to take
          my crew and check the ground to see if there were any more
          casualties. None were found. At that time a radio message
          instructed all crews not in the sports hall to return to their
          appliances, as the ground was to be evacuated. We stood by the
          appliance till instructed to return to base.

          Central One returned at 1805 hours.

                         Incident Narrative.

Hillsborough Incident.


The call to this incident was received at Control at 1517 hours.
I proceeded with two pumps Central 1, Central 2, and E.T. (10
men).

The route followed to the stadium was along Penistone Road, the
route was reasonably clear, the weather was dry and sunny.
On arrival at the stadium there was no one there to meet us which
I expected given the message said (major disaster).
We drew the appliances to a halt just before the first set of
gates into the stadium, I dismounted the appliance and asked a
police officer where we were expected to go, he said he had no
knowledge of any incident or direction. I asked a further police
officer if we could get in via the double gates, he said yes and
immediately opened the gates into the roadway down the side of the
stadium, I went to a gate adjacent to the entry gate, the police
officer said they hadn't called us and didn't need our assistance
but perhaps we should go further down the road, this we did.
I ran down the road to the end of the stadium where the police
observation box was situated and was shown the route to the pitch
by a Marshall.

I proceeded onto the pitch the crowd had not moved at all. The
pitch around the area of the Leppings Lane goal area was full of
people some casualties, some relatives and friends of casualties,
people stood, people kneeling, people laid down. Many people in
obvious shock this included St Johns ambulance personnel, police
as well as the fans.

Once on the pitch I asked several police officers who was in
charge and where the casualties were being moved to - they
couldn't tell me.

It was clear to see that no rescues as such needed doing, but
bodies and casualties obviously needed removing from the scene. I
gave my men instructions to carry out first aid and resuscitation
that required doing and to try to be as selective as possible
(there were only five men available initially).
I spoke briefly to Station Officer Swain who informed me he was
having difficulty in getting to the incident. I informed him I
was at the actual incident. It was obvious to me we were going to
need more men than the initial turnout and there would be an
urgent need for resuscitators. I then lost contact with him and
my own drivers, I sent a Liverpool fan with a message to my
drivers to make pumps 10, this he did, but in the meantime Station
Officer Swain had already sent the message.
At this point I contacted Fm         the driver of Central 1 and
asked him to try to get ambulances to the point where our
appliances were as I knew this route was clear - this he together
with Fm         driver of Central 2 did. Shortly after this Temp.
Station Officer       reported to me I asked him to go to the
roadway were the appliances were parked and set up a casualty
handling area, which he did, I then proceeded to try to get the
most urgent cases transported to this casualty handling area,
approximately 20 to 30 persons were transported by means of make
shift stretchers to this point, approximately 10 persons were
taken off the field by ambulance.
At this stage Firemen from Darnall and Ringinglow were arriving
and giving first aid. This was also the time when ADO Robjohns
arrived on the field.

ADO Robjohns informed me that a temporary morgue had been set up
in the gymnasium, I responded by having the obvious dead removed
to the gym and the other casualties to the point I had set up.
DO Lockwood arrived on the pitch I gave him a brief report of the
situation, he informed me he would go to the police control box
overlooking the incident and set up a control point which he did.
ADO Robjohns informed DO Lockwood that a casualty handling centre
had been set up in the gym but there was a shortage of ambulances
- the number of serious casualties was quite low at this stage and
the decision was made to move the remainder to the gym, and
discontinue the casualty handling area I had set up and divert the
ambulances to the gym.

          Upon attendance at approximately 1522 hours at the Penistone Road/
          Riverside Entrance. (A on map). After a short delay we proceeded
          along the private road following Central 1 and 2 in the direction of
          Leppings Lane side of the ground.

          After proceeding approximately 60 metres the approach was blocked due
          to the height of the appliance against the stand which gave no or
          very little clearance. Station Officer Fletcher was informed by
          Storno Radio that our progress was blocked and unable to gain vehicle
          access by that Route (B).

          Asking for police assistance the appliance was reversed back onto
          Penistone Road (A). At this point a police constable was asked for
          more information and where we could be utilised best. No information
          was forthcoming. Remounting the appliance we then proceeded along
          Penistone Road in the direction of Wadsley Bridge. At this point I
          overheard a storno radio message that resuscitation equipment was
          required at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

          At point (C) on the map we were stopped by a Police Inspector who was
          in radio contact with a colleague. However after a short period of
          time he was not able to offer any positive information. So we
          proceeded to Leppings Lane and parked at point (D).

          Taking with us a Motivus resuscitator one spare bottle of oxygen and
          a first aid kit we proceeded into the ground through the north stand
          access ramp. Entering the stand we forced our way through the ground
          and onto the pitch where we immediately came across a casualty laid
          out with a group assisting by giving mouth to mouth and cardiac
          massaging. Taking charge of the situation we got the resuscitation
          equipment to work and took over giving cardiac massage. Friends of
          the casualty pleaded with us that we continue and don't give up now.
          An advertising board was brought to the side of the casualty, the
          casualty was transferred to this and carried from the pitch (E) to a
          waiting ambulance (F) where he was put into the care of the ambulance
          service.
We then made our way back onto the pitch and walking in front of the
north stand giving assistance to four people and oxygen to a further
two.


We were by now directly in front of the Leppings Lane Stand (G), I
contacted Divisional Officer Lockwood by storno radio who had by this
time located himself by the police box overlooking the ground/
incident.

He directed us to the gymnasium with our resuscitation equipment.
Upon arrival at the gymnasium (H) we were directed to two casualties
whom we gave oxygen and comfort. A further two casualties were
assisted from the area and onto waiting ambulances. We continued in
this area rendering humanitarian service. Five minutes before the
crowd has asked to disperse we made our way back to our appliance.
Where we were instructed to wait for further instructions.

Some members of the public became agitated and upset that appliances
and a staff car were blocking exits from the ground. There was some
verbal abuse "you have done a good job now xxxx off" and some took
their anger out on the E.T. (no damage was dona on later inspection).
To try and alleviate the situation the staff car was moved to one
side.

A number of members of the public thanked us for what we had done and
a young man came into our care who had lost his father in the rush to
leave the ground. They were reunited a few minutes later.

After the crowd has dispersed we returned to Station arriving back at
approximately 1720 hours.

Subject   Incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium    Date
          on the 15th April 1989                                      17.4.89



          On the 15th April 1989, I was Officer in Charge of Rivelin One
          appliance when we were mobilised to a major incident at Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Club. On receipt of the call at 1516 hours, I
          proceeded to the Leppings Lane end of the ground. On arrival I was
          unable to enter nearer than the iron railings at that end of the
          ground because of the large numbers of police, public and ambulances
          at the site. I contacted control and requested that Darnall Road
          appliances attend at Penistone Road end.

          As I dismounted from the appliance to speak to a police inspector at
          the gate and an immediate request was made for a resuscitator in the
          rear of the ambulance which we applied.

          I asked the inspector what he wanted me to do and he attempted to
          contact his superior by radio but with no success.

          I then sent Fm        down the road at tl*e rear of the stand to
          attempt to find a more senior police officer. He returned to inform
          me the most senior officer down there was a sergeant. Further
          conversations were made between myself and the police inspector as to
          his requirements and at one stage he was of the opinion that our
          services were no longer required.

          I then sent L/Fm           and 1 Fm to look onto the pitch whilst the
          inspector made further attempts to contact his superiors.

          A police officer then emerged from the ground in some state of shock
          requesting resuscitators to be taken into the ground as there were
          dying people on the pitch. In view of this message I contacted
          control by radio and made pumps 10 for resuscitation equipment.

          At this time ADO Robjohns arrived and I briefed him of the situation
          and he took of over the incident at this stage.

          He then went into the ground to assess the situation for himself and
          left me at the gate to lease with oncoming crews. I then directed
          five crews to the ground as instructed by ADO Robjohns and DO
          Lockwood. I also directed some ambulances to the Penistone Road end
          of the ground in the absence of anybody knowing the ambulance
          requirements and Mr Robjohns repeated requests for ambulances to be
          sent to that side of the ground. I then sent with DO Lockwood and
          ACO Hornsby into the ground and cleared five crews from the pitch
          back to their appliances as there was some concern that the crowd was
          getting restless.

    I cleared all personnel from the pitch and then went to the gymnasium
    to prevent further personnel from going onto the pitch until
    instructed to do so. I then returned to my appliance and returned to
    base at 1730 hours.

Subject   Incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium    Date
          on the 15th April 1989                                      17.4.89



          On the 15th April 1989 at 1516 hours. I responded with my crew on
          Ringinglow 1 to a request to attend a major incident at Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Stadium where cutting gear was required.

          'En Route' to the incident appliances were directed to the Leppings
          Lane end of the stadium. Ringinglow 1 booked in attendance at
          approximately 1527 hours. On arrival I contacted StnO Swain.

          I then proceeded on foot with hand radio Maximan Resuscitation set
          and crew directly onto the playing area of the ground.

          The sheer magniture of the incident was unsettling, dozens of
          casualties lay on the playing area with hundreds of spectators and
          Police milling around.

          Communication using fireground radio's was difficult because of the
          large volume of noise in the stadium, ADO Robjohns set was defective
          so he commandeered my radio.

          I and my crew were dispersed amongst the casualties of our own
          volition to render cardiac massage, mouth to mouth resuscitation and
          Maximan Resuscitation. (A Maximan Resuscitator off a Stocksbridge
          Appliance was found to be defective. Although some doctors and
          paramedics were saying working Maximan Resuscitators were of no
          usei).

          Assistance was given moving casualties to ambulances for transfer to
          hospital.

          In the early stages of my arrival I was aware that make pumps ten for
          resuscitation purposes and a contact point had been made.

          I asked two senior police officers if those spectators not injured in
          anyway could be moved out of the congestion to enable those
          endeavouring to give assistance more room to work, the reply was 'we
          have already tried to do this'.

          Police co-ordination and Control seemed to be non existent on the
          playing area.

          Ambulances started to arrive and casualties were taken to hospital.
          I and my crew remained with casualties on the playing area until the
          last had been removed.

          The gymnasium was utilised as a holding area for the injured waiting
          to go to hospital and with a clear division a temporary morgue for
          fatalities.
                                                                        57
The point was reached where supporters were asked to leave and at the
Leppings Lane end of the ground. Severe congestion was being caused
by fire appliances and a staff car. L/Fm           had these vehicles
re-sited to assist egress.

In the gymnasium assistance was given to doctors in rendering first
aid treatment as requested and casualties moved from the gym, to
waiting ambulances.

          At 1528 hours on 15th April 1989, control mobilised Lowedges 1,
          Sub O       |as Officer in Charge in response to a make pumps 10
          message from Officer in Charge at Hillsborough Stadium.

          Our approach to the incident took us along Langsett Road and
          Middlewood Road, and our progress was not impeded by traffic
          congestion. The appliance was parked in Leppings Lane 20 yards from
          the entrance to the Stadium.

          I instructed my crew, with the exception of the driver to bring our
          first aid and resuscitation equipment together with a short
          extensions ladder and salvage sheets to be used as stretchers if
          required.

          At the entrance to the ground I contacted Station Officer Swain and
          handed my nominal roll tally him, he then informed me I was to
          proceed to the gymnasium in the ground taking our first aid kit and
          resuscitation gear only and report to Assistant Divisional Robjohns.

          Whilst crossing the pitch oxygen was given to two casualties lying on
          the ground, both with chest injuries and having difficulty in
          breathing. The remainder of my crew and myself reported to
          ADO Robjohns and Station Officer Fletcher who were attempting to
          organise a priority list of casualties for removal to hospital from
          the gymnasium.

          I was asked by Stn O Fletcher to assist the ambulance service in the
          lifting and placing on stretchers of the remaining injured.

          The crew under my instruction were then involved in this task as well
          as assisting with resuscitation needs and first aid as and when
          required.

          After the majority of casualties had been removed to hospital, some
          crews including mine were instructed to return to their appliances,
          this I did, informing the control unit that, my crew had withdrawn
          from the incident, shortly afterwards we were mobilised to Base.

          On Saturday the. 15th April at 1516 hours, Darnall One was called to
          and incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.

          Whilst travelling along Penistone Road to the incident, a message was
          passed by Control to attend Leppings Lane Police Incident Room.

          On arrival I was met by Station Officer Swain of Rivelin Fire Station
          and he requested me to take my crew with Motivus and First Aid
          Equipment and proceed into Leppings Lane entrance where there were
          many casualties.

          The driver of the appliance was ordered to stand by on the appliance.

          Having reached this location my crew were divided into pairs to
          attend to casualties to render first aid wherever possible.

          We were then assisted by members of the public to remove casualties
          to the far end of the ground (Penistone Road Entrance), where
          ambulances and doctors were waiting to attend to them.

          I was then instructed by Assistant Divisional Officer Robjohns to
          take some members of my crew to go round the perimeter of the playing
          area to instruct any casualties that were not seriously injured to
          make their way to the areas where the doctors were in attendance.

          Having done this we were then instructed to report to the gymnasium
          where we were requested to assist doctors with casualties as
          required.

          After a period of time we were told to return to our appliance and
          wait for further instructions.

          At approximately 1655 hours we were ordered to return to base.

Incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium
on the 15th April 1989                                      18-4-89



On Saturday 15th April 1989, I was Temporary StnO in charge of
Darnall Road when Darnalls' 2 pumps were mobilised at approximately
1516 hours to "Major incident, cutting gear required" at Sheffield
Wednesday ground, Penistone Road. En route to the incident a message
from Rivelin One was relayed via control requesting oncoming
appliances to attend at Leppings Lane and report to Police Control.

On arrival at approximately 1526 hours, we were met by large numbers
of both Police and civilians grouped around the entrance at Leppings
Lane. I requested my crews to bring resuscitation and first aid
equipment and tried to gather information from Police Officers around
the entrance but they could not give any details of the incident. I
attempted to contact other Officers-in-Charge via Storno Radio but
found it ineffective even though the batteries had been changed that
morning and the radio tested satisfactorily.

Once through the gates (A) and onto the road (B) running behind the
West Stand we observed a number of apparently dead bodies lying at
the side of the road shielded by a line of Police Officers. We made
our way through the tunnel (C) onto an almost empty terrace but
observed a great deal of activity on the pitch which we reached, with
difficulty, through holes in the fencing. At this point I was under
the impression that the incident involved a structural collapse and
expected fire crews to be involved in extrication of casualties. It
was not immediately obvious to me what had caused the large number of
casualties.

Moving onto the pitch we mixed with crowds of confused civilians and
a number of Police Officers and eventually large numbers of victims
some apparently dead. The crews began to attend to the casualties
while I tried to make contact with other Officers-in-Charge and
assess the situation. I eventually located StnO Fletcher and it was
agreed that casualties should be removed through the South Stand to
the road behind,where I would set up a casualty clearing area (D).
During this operation it was necessary for me to request large
numbers of fans to clear the aisles in the South Stand and, to their
credit, they did this quickly and in an orderly manner. Along with
Police Officers and Stewards I arranged to have a clear passage (E)
maintained through to the roadway. I believe over 20 casualties were
removed by this route. Throughout this period Darnall Road crews
remained fully committed to resuscitating and transporting
casualties.
I informed StnO Fletcher that the exit route was being maintained and
a casualty clearing area had been established. While supervising the
roadway (B) I found that it was becoming blocked with people and
vehicles but after liaising with a Senior Police Officer the
congestion was reduced. On returning to the control unit I informed
DO Lockwood and StnO Swain that I would attempt to keep ambulances
flowing along roadway (B) between Leppings Lane and Penistone Hoad.

On returning to the casualty handling area I found Fm         and Fm
       Successfully handling the arrival and departure of ambulances
They had initially found that ambulances arriving at the Penistone
Road entrance (F) were rapidly being fitted by casualties with
relatively minor injuries while the more seriously injured were not
being reached at the casualty clearing area. This was resolved after
Fm         and I made contact with Police Officers at the Penistone
Road entrance. After I had obtained an operative storno radio a
message was transmitted requesting fire crews with resuscitation
equipment proceed to the gymnasium. I passed this information to a
number of men in the immediate area. (This was originated by ADO
Robjohns).

It was about this time that ACO Hornsby arrived and I passed on
details of the incident and the locations of DO Lockwood and ADO
Robjohns.

Once it had become clear that most of the casualties had been removed
from the pitch and the casualty area I went to the gymnasium and
informed ADO Robjohns that oncoming ambulances were still attending
Leppings Lane, while the majority of the casualties were now in the
gymnasium, and the ambulances were more urgently required here.
Darnall Road crews eventually regrouped in the gymnasium and were
then requested to return to our appliances and stand-by. While
returning to our appliances CFO Wright arrived and I accompanied him
to the Control Unit.

The match was eventually abandoned and the ground cleared but due to
the position of our appliances the fans leaving onto Leppings Lane
were forced to come into close contact with firemen, appliances and
police officers. The occasionally hostile attitude of the crowd was
a cause of concern to my crew and myself. At one point ADO Robjohns
car was damaged by passing crowds including one person who walked
over it. I expressed our concern to ACO Hornsby and he advised us to
remain with our appliances, which, we did after moving them a few
metres to give the crowds a clearer route. Shortly afterwards we
were released from the incident and encountered heavy traffic
congestion arriving back to station at approximately 1750 hours.

Mansfield Road. WRL StnO         OIC attended the incident at
Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground. The appliance was in attendance
at 1534 hours at the Leppings Lane entrance. I went to the contact
point, the appliance tally was handed over. I contacted SubO
and asked him what the situation was. He reported casualties in the
walkway, on the pitch and gym.

3 crew with resuscitation set and first aid equipment dealt with a
male person requiring resuscitation in the walkway, they were
successful in bringing him round, a further 3 persons were given
oxygen in this area. They then proceeded to the gym and gave further
assistance. 1 Fm went straight to the gym and found a person with
serious neck injuries, he found a doctor to treat the person. He
then rounded up 3 crews with resuscitation equipment for use in the
gym.

I contacted StnO Swain at the contact point, he requested me to go to
the gym and help ADO Robjohns. I contacted tne ADO Robjohns who
directed me to organise patient removal from the gym to the
ambulances. When the situation was under control I was told to
return to the appliance with my crew.

          On Saturday 15th April 1989 at 1528 hours, I attended Hillsborough
          Football Stadium as OIC of Stocksbridge one appliance. On arriving
          at the contact point, I was instructed by the Station Officer there
          to take my crew with first aid kit and resuscitation equipment and
          enter the ground and go onto the playing area.

          Immediately after instructing my crew to gather the necessary
          equipment. I was informed by the Station Officer not to enter the
          ground but to wait at the contact point. After approximately five
          minutes I was then instructed by the Station Officer to enter the
          ground, make my way onto the pitch and contact ADO Robjohns, taking
          Stocksbridge one and two crews and equipment with me. On the pitch I
          was instructed by DO Lockwood to take my crew and equipment to the
          far corner of the pitch.

          En route I stopped and assisted an ambulance/medical crew deal with a
          male casualty, putting the casualty in a stretcher for removal to
          hospital, Stocksbridge crews were then directed into the gymnasium.

          Inside the gymnasium we assisted the medical/ambulance teams giving
          first aid to the casualties and to my knowledge no actual
          resuscitation was carried out by Stocksbridge one crew.

          On Saturday 15th April 1989 at 1528 hours, Stocksbridge 1 and 2 were
          called to a major disaster at Hillsborough Football Ground.

          I was riding as OIC of Stocksbridge Two. On arrival at Leppings Lane
          I was met by the control point officer and given instruction to take
          my crew with First Aid and Resuscitation equipment into the ground
          and contact ADO Robjohns.

          On entering the pitch no contact could be made with ADO Robjohns, but
          we were instructed by DO Lockwood to go to the far end of the field.

          On arrival at the other end, I was told to render first aid and deal
          with casualties that were taken into the gymnasium.

          This building was also being used as the mortuary and was very
          congested with bodies and casualties. At this stage my crew were
          giving first aid and resuscitation treatment. I myself gave
          resuscitation to three casualties on different occasions.

          After a period of time we were told to regroup our crews and return
          to our appliances till further instruction.

            Refs   Hillsborough Disaster - 15 April    1989 (150489)



            Dear Mr Jones,



            Thank you for your letter dated 11th January 1990.       (110190)

            Further to the formal    complaints I made when three West Midlands

            Police Officers visited me on the 6th December 1989 (061289) and took

            a statement from me.     I am now forwarding a detailed account of event

            as I saw them on the 15th April    (150489),   together with an account of

            how the tragedy has affected me.

            1' have sent a copy of this account to our solicitor who informed us o
                                                                                 PAGE       2
                                                                                 D3637

           the 16th January      ("i£>0'189) that we are not entitled to any compensation

          as we were not present at Hillsborough,

          We are not anxious about the inquests and do not mind a long delay.

          What we are seeking,       however,   is justice!



          Yours sincerely



          J . McBrien   (Mrs).

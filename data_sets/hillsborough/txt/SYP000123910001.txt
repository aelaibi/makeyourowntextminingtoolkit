 REALISED THE EXTENT OF THE INCIDENT,         THERE WAS NOT GOING TO BE ANY TROUBLE S

 THOSE POLICE OFFICERS COULD HAVE HELPED CONVEY & ASSIST THE INJURED.

 MESSAGE CAME OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER TO CLEAR THE PITCH & RETURN TO THE TERRACES.

 ifll MATCH I WITNESSED HOSTILITY TOWARDS POLICE OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND

 WHICH I SUPPOSED WAS A NATURAL REACTION.

 INITIALLY I WAS UNAWARE OF THE SITUATION , BUT IT THEN BECAME APPARENT THAT

 FATALITIES HAD OCCURRED AS FANS CARRIED DEAD BODIES ON HOLDINGS ACROSS THE

 PITCH.   AT THIS STAGE I WAS AMAZED TO SEE THAT A LINE OF POLICEMEN WHO HAD

 ENTERED INTO THE STADIUM VIA THE ENTRANCE SITUATED BETWEEN THE NORTH STAND &

 THE SPION KOP WERE ACTUALLY STANDING IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND UNAWARE Or

 THE SITUATION.     THE NUMBER OF POLICEMEN WAS APPROX 20 WHO WERE THEN JOINED BY

 ABOUT 4 POLICE DOG HANDLERS.        THIS WAS AT ABOUT     1520 HRS.   WHEN THEY CHANGED

 POSITION & LINED THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH.            I BELIEVE THIS WAS TO AVOID A

 CLASH OF SUPPORTERS.      A FEW MINUTES LATER,      THE EXTENT OF THE SITUATION BECAME

 APPARENT & AIDE WAS GIVEN BY THE POLICE.

 THE FIRE SERVICE ARRIVED AT ABOUT         1320 HRS WITH CUTTING EQUIPMENT & ACTED

 i l FESSI0NALLY 4 ,T WAS AT TH.S STAGE THAT ! ACTUALLY FELT SOMETHING POS.TIVE

 WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING.

 THE GROUND AT ABOUT     1430 HRS IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE PENS         <3 & 4) WERE GROSSL'

 OVERCROWDED & ACTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO AVOID FURTHER FANS ENTERING.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

       IRE WAS NO ORGANISATION OF THE CROWD TRYING TO GET INTO THE GROUND.               IN VIEW

 OF THE CRUSH OUTSIDE I D O N ’T THINK THERE WAS ANYTHING THEY COULD DO EXCEPT

 OPEN THE SIDE GATE - MAYBE THEY SHOULD HAVE DELAYED THE KICK OFF.

 THERE WERE NO SIGNS TO SAY THAT YOU COULD GO ROUND TO THE SIDE TO GET TO THE

 TERRACES.     ABOVE THE TUNNEL IT SAID        ’S T A N D I N G ’ AND EVERYONE WAS HEADING FOR

 THERE AND Na~QhiE i^lAs\oiNG TO THE SIDE
  O f\r~
 LAST YEAR THERE WERE LOTS OF STEWARDS ABOUT AND MY TICKET WAS CHECKED A NUMBER

 OF TIMES,    EACH TIME A CORNER BEING TORN OFF THE TICKET.             THIS YEAR I HAVE A

 COMPLETE TICKET AND STUB UNTOUCHED.

 3^jENT A BIT EARLIER LAST YEAR BUT I WAS ABLE TO WALK STRAIGHT IN.                  THIS YEAR

 I WAS CRUSHED AGAINST OTHER FANS IN THE NORTH STAND ENTRANCE AND THEN WHEN THE

 PROPER ENTRANCE WAS SHOWN TO ME I WENT THERE AND GOT SQUASHED AGAIN.

 INITIALLY FANS WERE ATTEMPTING TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCE BUT WERE BEING PUSHED

 BACK BY THE POLICE.   EVENTUALLY FANS DID GET OVER WITH THE HELP OF SOME OF THE

 POLICE IN FRONT OF THE FENCE.     BUT AT THIS TIME A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS CAME

 OVER FROM A CORNER AND STOOD IN A LINE ACROSS THE PITCH,    I THINK THEY WOULD

 HAVE BEEN USED TO HELP PEOPLE OVER THE FENCE.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ID LIKE TO STRESS THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE POLICE OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND.

G19

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I BELIEVE THAT LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED THE SPION

       END BECAUSE OF THE VAST NUMBER OF SUPPORTERS WHO ATTEND BOTH HOME AND AWAY

 MATCHES ALSO A SMALL AREA AROUND THE TURNSTILES WHERE I CAME IN AND NO PROPER

 QUEUES WERE FORMED.

 i®-CH REALISED THE SEVERITY OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.          THERE W A S N ’T ENOUGH FIRST

 AID GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH FIRST AIDERS.

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I WAS PRESENT AT HEYSEL STADIUM IN BRUSSELS WHEN LIVERPOOL PLAYED JUVENTUS.                 I

 FEEL THE SAME EVENTS OCCURRED OUTSIDE THE GROUND AT HEYSEL AS HAPPENED AT

 HILLSBOROUGH.        THESE ARE:~

 A)        TOTAL LACK OF CONTROL OUTSIDE TURNSTILE AREA.

 B)        EXTREMELY SLOW MOVEMENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILES,   CAUSING A HUGE BACKLOG
                                                                              PAGE

      »


 C)       DUE TO B) ABOVE 7 THE GATES AT HEYSEL WERE ALSO OPENED TO LET EVERYBODY

 IN WITHOUT TICKETS BEING TAKEN.

 D) HUGE VOLUME OF PEOPLE THAT CONSEQUENTLY FILLED THE LIVERPOOL ENCLOSURE

 HAD NO WHERE TO GO AND SPILLED OVER ONTO THE OTHER ENCLOSURE WHERE OTHER

 FANS WERE.

 I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW:

 "WERE THE TURNSTILES OPERATING NORMALLY/ADMITTING FANS BETWEEN

 2.30PM      (1430) AND 2.50PM    (1450) ON THE D A Y ? "

 E)       THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM AT HILLSBOROUGH WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE

 MESSAGES COULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD.

 Q45

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD S U R G E , IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT

 CAUSED IT?    (BRIEFLY)

 AGAIN AROUND KICK-OFF TIME THERE WAS A SURGE TO MY RIGHT,         EVERYONE

 PUSHING D O W N .


Gf

 G46

 WERE YOU INJURED,      IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

 Q47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 NO.   I SAW A PERSON RECEIVING HEART MASSAGE,    BUT D I D N ’T REALISE AT THAT TIME

 ANYONE HAD DIED.

 G48

       YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,     IF SO,

 BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 MO - I ONLY HELPED REMOVING ADVERTISING BOARDS.


G17

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS,      OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE FENCING AT FRONT BY THE PITCH. THE GATES IN THE FENCING BEING TOO SMALL.

 FENCING BETWEEN THE PENS WHICH RESTRICTED CROWD MOVEMENT.         ALSO CROWD P R E S S U R E .

 WHAT TIME BID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?
        ♦



 APPROXIMATELY 16.30 HRS (1630 5.

 G!31

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 S T E W A R D , A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 LEFT OF OWN ACCORD WHEN GROUND WAS FAIRLY EMPTY.


G1S

 Gf>2

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A

 CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 r®

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS TOTAL CONFUSION.     NO ONE APPEARED TO BE IN CHARGE. LOUDSPEAKER

 ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE POOR & C O U L D N ’T BE HEARD.   IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT PEOPLE IN THE

 REST OF THE STADIUM D I D N ’T REALISE THE SITUATION.    MORE INFORMATION WOULD HAVE

 HELPFUL.

 G54

 ^THERE     ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ORGANISATION WAS OF A POOR STANDARD. SCREENING FOR TICKETS IN LEPPINGS LN,

 AWAY FROM THE TURNSTILES,    WOULD HAVE ASSISTED IN THIS CRUSH. ORDERLY ENTRY

 INTO GROUND COULD HAVE THEN BEEN MAINTAINED. ONCE IN GROUND DIRECTIONS TO

 TERRACING WAS VERY POOR. KICK-OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.         THERE WAS A SURGE

 JUST ABOUT KICK-OFF TIME. TOTAL LACK OF INFORMATION.

 WITH MY TWO CHILDREN.

 042

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCE OR UNUSUAL INCIDENT AT THE TIME OF

 TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 I SAW A CAMERA WHICH WAS VIEWING THE CROWD.      I WAS ABLE TO LOOK STRAIGHT AT II

        SEE THE MONITOR.   IT WAS IN AN OPEN BOX AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR STAND ABOUT

 10 TO 15 FEET AWAY FROM ME TO MY LEFT AND DOWN A BIT.      THERE WERE NO MARKINGS

 ON IT, AND IT WAS MANNED BY A MAN IN CIVILIAN CLOTHING.      AT 2.00 PM

 (1400 HOURS),    IT HAD VANISHED.


015

 043

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 AT MY TIME OF ENTRY, THERE WAS STILL A LOT OF FANS TO COME,     BUT IN THE CENTRE

 PENS IT WAS PACKED ALREADY.     THE FOREST END WAS FULL, BUT ALL THE STANDS AND

 THE TWO SIDE AREAS AT THE WEST END WERE PRACTICALLY EMPTY.

                                                                                         QSL595

 0*44

 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,             IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 HAPPENED?

 NO.

 045

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,            IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT?     (BRIEFLY)

 YES.     I SAW SURGES BUT THE FANS C O U L D N ’T BE SWAYED VERY FAR BECAUSE BY TEN TO

 THREE    (1450 HOURS),     IT WAS VERY FULL AND THEY WERE ONLY SMALL PENS.


016

 046

£ [ R E YOU INJURED,      IF SO, DID YOU ATTEND HOSPITAL IN SHEFFIELD?

 NO.

 Q47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 NO.

 048

 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,               IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 I AM A QUALIFIED FIRST AIDER, AND IF I HAD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT WAS BAD I COULD

 HAVE GOT DOWN THERE S O M E H O W .     BUT I D I D N ’T KNOW.   MY CONSCIENCE WAS HEAVY AT

      30 PM   (1700 H O U R S ) , WHEN I HEARD.


G17

 049

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR                IN THE DEATHS,   OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE OBVIOUS.        THE GATE ONTO THE PITCH W A S N ’T OPENED QUICK ENOUGH IN MY MIND,

 AND I THINK THAT THERE BEING ONLY ONE ESCAPE ROUTE ALSO ADDED TO THE DISASTER.

 THE CENTRE PENS WERE ALLOWED TO FILL UP TOO MUCH WHEN THE SIDES WERE EMPTY.

 050

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?
                                                                                       PAGE

 4 . 45   PM (1645 H O U R S ) .

 Q51*

 DID YOU LEAVE OM THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,             A STEWARD,    A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT,             OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 I HEARD A FEW ANNOUNCEMENTS ONE OF WHICH WAS THAT THE GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED

 THIS WAS ABOUT 4=25 ISH <1625 HOURS).              WE STAYED AS IT REQUESTED FOR A SHORT

 WHILE THEN LEFT MAINLY BECAUSE MY KIDS WANTED OUT.


Q1S

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

£      I D O N ’T THINK SO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

    1) THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OR EVEN AN ABSOLUTE BREAKDOWN IN CO-ORDINATION ,WITH

THE EMERGENCY SERVICES.               AND A LACK OF COMMUNICATION OF ALL KINDS.

 2)    I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHEN THE PROBLEM WAS REALISED,          WHY A LINE OF POLICE

 OFFICERS,      WHO HAD MARCHED ONTO THE HALFWAY LINE, STAYED THERE,        INSTEAD

 GETTING STUCK        IN.    IT WAS QUITE APPARENT,    AFTER THE INITIAL CHANTING,    THAT

 j^RE      WAS NEVER GOING TO BE ANY CROWD PROBLEMS.

 3) THROUGHOUT THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF URGENCY WITHIN THE EMERGENCY SERVICES

 QID-3A

 DID YOU GO TO THE SAME MATCH LAST YEAR?

 NO.


Q19

 Q54

    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 (BRIEFLY)

 THE PRESSURE FOR US FROM 2.30 PM <1430) ONWARDS WAS A CROWD SURGE FROM THE

 FRONT BACKWARDS.      THIS PRESUMABLY OCCURRED BECAUSE AS MORE PEOPLE CAME INTO

 THE PEN FROM THE TUNNEL THE REACTION FROM THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT ON OUR SIDE
                                                                            PAGE

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 FOR A LONG TIME, PROBABLY MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR, THERE APPEARED TO BE NO ONE

 IN CONTROL OF THE SITUATION.           THE FIRST LOUDSPEAKER       ANNOUNCEMENT WAS AT

 10    TO 4 (1550) BY KENNY D A L G L E I S H .    THERE ALSO APPEARED TO BE TOO MANY POLICE

 FORMING A LINE ALONG THE HALF WAY                LINE AND NOT TOO MANY HELPING THE INJURED.

 IT SEEMED TO BE THE SUPPORTERS WHO WERE DOING ALL THE FETCHING AND CARRYING.

 THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE SITUATION W A S N ’T IMMEDIATELY APPARENT AND TOOK TIME TO

 BE REALISED.       THERE ALSO APPEARED TO BE A LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE CROWD

 AND POSSIBLY BETWEEN THE POLICE.


Q19

•

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I NEVER SAW ANY ATTEMPT TO STEWARD THE LEPPINGS LN STANDING AREA, EITHER BY

 THE POLICE STEWARDS OR LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.                ATTEMPTS SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 MADE BEFORE THE CROWD SURGE TO DIVERT PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE CENTRE SECTION

 WHICH WAS OVERFUL AT 2.30 PM (1430).               THEY COULD HAVE DIRECTED PEOPLE TO THE

 SIDE PENS OR POSSIBLY CLOSED THE TUNNEL BUT IT WAS PAINFULLY FULL AND CRUSHED

 IN THE CENTRE PENS FROM 2.30 PM (1430) BEFORE THE MAJOR CROWD SURGE.

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 YES. ABOUT 2.30PM     (1430) WITNESS VISITED GENTS TOILETS IN WEST STAND.             THE

 WINDOWS WERE OPEN ALLOWING A VIEW INTO THE GROUND AREA AND RIGHT BACK TO THE

 TURNSTlCrES. SAW AN ABSOLUTE MASS OF PEOPLE.          THEY WERE STATIC. COULD SEE

 MOUNTED OFFICERS TOWARDS THE FRONT GATES. THEY HAD LOST CONTROL.                I THOUGHT

 BLOODY HELL,    SOMETHINGS WRONG HERE WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE CROWDED LIKE THAT.

 THE CROWD DID NOT APPEAR TO BE PANICKED AT THAT POINT.              X SAW THIS FOR ABOUT A

 MINUTE. AT ABOUT 2.50PM (1450) WITNESS IS BACK            IN SEAT. FIRST IMPRESSION,

 THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE CROWD TROUBLE BECAUSE BY THEN THE PENS WERE ABSOLUTELY

 JAM PACKED.    THE CROWD W A S N ’T SWAYING AT ALL. WE MOVED DOWN TO THE FRONT OF THE

^TAND.   WE SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT FENCING. THE SIDE OF THE ONE PEN

 INTO THE EMPTIER PEN, AND PEOPLE CLIMBING UP INTO OUR STAND.               IT W A S N ’T UNTIL

 AFTER THE GAME WAS STOPPED WE KNEW THE SERIOUSNESS OF IT.              I SAW THE KICK-OFF

 AND THE START OF THE GAME MORE PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCING AND THERE

 SEEMED TO BE MORE PEOPLE IN THOSE PENS.          I SAW A POLICEMAN RUN ONTO THE PITCH

 AND STOP THE GAME.

 G47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS ?

 NO. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BEING PULLED OUT OF THE PENS APPEARED LIFELESS AND

 HELPLESS.       BODIES SEEMED TO BE DOTTED ABOUT BEHIND THE GOAL AND AT THE SIDE.

 ST JOHNS AMBULANCEMEN AND POLICEMEN WERE DOING CARDIAC ARREST ON THESE PEOPLE.

 SOME FOR FIVE MINUTES.          ONE OBVIOUSLY DIED. A POLICEMAN PULLED THE M A N ’S T-

 SHIRT OVER HIS H E A D , AND PUT HIS TUNIC OVER THE BODY.         IT WAS FIFTEEN MINUTES

 BEFORE A FIREMAN CAME ONTO THE PITCH WITH SOME WIRE CUTTERS. THERE WERE                A   LOT

 OF FANS    ON    THE PITCH.   I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO RECOGNISE ANY OF THE DEAD

 OR INJURED FROM MY POSITION.          I HAVE SINCE HEARD THAT A DISTANT COUSIN OF THE

 FAMILY DIED IN THE CRUSH.

T K t NESS DID NOT ATTEND LAST Y E A R ’S SEMI-FINAL. HAS ATTENDED THE REPLAY AT OLD

 TRAFFORD ON 7.5.89       (070589). RETURNED TO ANFIELD ON 16.4.89 <160489) TO PAY

     DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

     STEWARD,   A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

     AN ANNOUNCEMENT MADE SAYING THE MATCH HAD BEEN ABANDONED AND SAYING AMBULANCES

     WERE COMING INTO THE GROUND,     WOULD WE REMAIN IN OUR SEATS FOR THIS. WE WAITED

     ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES THEN LEFT.

     G52

     DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

     NO.

     G53

     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

     HANDLED,   AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

    T D O N ' T THINK THE STEWARDS REALISED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.      FANS WERE BEING PULLED

     INTO OUR STAND. THEY LOOKED HELPLESS.       I D O N ’T THINK THEY WERE BRIEFED FOR A

     MATCH OF THIS STATURE. GENERALLY,      I THINK THE POLICE COPED WELL. THERE WERE

     ENOUGH OF THEM. COUNTED 10 DOG HANDLERS IN FRONT OF FOREST END AND POLICE ON

     HALF-WAY LINE COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DEPLOYED ON THE PITCH. OFFICERS NEARER

     THE FENCES REALLY DID A GOOD JOB RESUSCITATING PEOPLE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO

     THEM.


    Q20



     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT    YOU WISH TO ADD   WHICH YOU FEEL IS

     VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL    INQUIRY?

     •1) SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE TICKETS ALLOCATED TO LIVERPOOL,       BUT SAYING THAT, THEY

     HAD TO DO IT THAT WAY IN TERMS OF SEGREGATING FANS,

i    2) STEWARDS NOT BRIEFED ENOUGH FOR MATCH OF THIS STATURE.

     3) ORGANISATION BEFORE    THE GAME SEEMED   ADEQUATE BUT ON THE DAY IT FELL SHORT

     AND I D O N ’T THINK IT COULD   HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PRACTICE.

     4) MAYBE THE PENS S H O U L D N ’T HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE PERIMETER

     FENCING IS OK. BUT THE PENS PREVENTED FANS FROM FANNING ACROSS TO THE EMPTIER

     PENS.

               bln where, alas, I feel you nay consider I belong.



               It 1b difficult to know where to begin to respond to your connente concerning

               Brian Clough’s forthcoming autobiography and hie "painful verdict" on the

               H illsb o ro u g h tragedy.   The reason I say this le because it seens evident to ae

               that Binds such as your own and Mr .Clough's have patently, In the tine which

               has elapsed since the tragedy, beeona lndefatigably resolved and steadfast in

               their stances, Baking It virtually pointless for someone such as myself to

               provide any first hand observation which night render your seaningly

               entrenched viewpoints unfounded.

               sense of injustice at what I know to be the lingering and (contrary to your

               assertion) frequently repeated inaocuraoies surrounding Hillsborough that

tortured living who experienced the d teaster, to attempt, at the very least,

eome redress In the direction of justice and truth.



tt seems the only Indisputable fact about Lepplnge Lane is that 96 people were

crushed to an unimaginably agonising death;      what caused them to die and why

they cane to pay the ultimate price is polemical and has spawned a polarisation

of views.   On the one hand, essentially blaming the fans themselves for killing

their own kind, have been the authorities and the overwhelming majority of the

press <in your own newspaper the following -some no longer with us - have at

various times, most more than once, expressed such opinion * yourself, George

Gale, Anthony Burgess, Colin Velch, Patrick Paterson and your deputy editor at

the relevant time, whose name escapes me); on the other hand, essentially

expressing innocence and blaming the authorities are the Liverpool fans

themselves (and also supporters from other clubs who have populated Leppings

Lane at earlier FA cup semi-finals).



The striking thing about the two opposing lobbies is that those bolding the

former view tend not to possess first hand experience of the actual event nor

of similar but mercifully non-catastrophic events both elsewhere and in the

previous semi-finals at Hillsborough ( and, with respect, in this context I

cannot agree with you that Mr .Clough's view from the bench and the pitch

constitutes such a first hand view).       In stark contrast, those holding the

latter view are precisely those who experienced Hillsborough and other such

events and survived.      It seems to ne that to accept the views of the former

whilst rejecting those of the latter - notwithstanding the argument that "they

would say that, wouldn't they?" - Is rather akin to giving sore credence

regarding the horrors of Vorld War One trench warfare to some renote general

rather than to a Wilfred Owen or other such blighted trench veteran.



the reality of Hillsborough, ae is often the case 1£ suob natters, lies between

the two extremes for rarely do black and white antitheses, however convenient,

reflect actuality.    Without intending to sound glib, the reality Z speak of is

actually rather simple and it is this:       tbs two adjacent central pens where the

deaths occurred were full to overflowing around one hour before the deaths

first became noticed.        In spite of this, for the whole of that hour long period,

fans were allowed to continue to enter therein.        At the entrance to the central

access tunnel leading into these pens stood neither a solitary steward nor

policeman to close off this access and to inform the steady stream of arriving

fans that both central pens were already full and that the flank pens either

side were virtually empty.        And so, for an hour, fans, oblivious to what was

happening inside continued to enter the tunnel and attempted to gain entry onto

an already crowded terrace, in Just the same way as each of them bad done

hundreds of times before at previous games elsewhere and at Hillsborough.         This

time, however, their efforts to find a "spec" amongst the paoked crowd had a

tragic difference;     in this Instance the confined, fenced-in terraces of

Lepplngs Lane were already overfull way beyond capacity and the minimal

remaining vestiges of empty spaoe which the incoming fans filled or tried to

fill meant that gradually, horribly and, unbeknown to them, those In front were

slowly being crushed in a human vice.        As the fateful hour approached and etlll

more fans (again unaware of the horrors now taking plaoe so heinously In front

     of them) ocmtinued to try to find a way onto the terrace, the overall levergae

     effect (by then exacerbated by natural crowd movement induced by events on the

     pitch as a Liverpool shot hit the bar) crushed the last remnants of life out of

     96 people.



     Jty certainty about these facte Is absolute.    At around five past two* my two

     friende and 1, who had taken our place In the right hand oentral pen some

     twenty minutes earlier, had decided that the crushing and pushing behind the

     goal had, by then, become intolerable (certainly, even at that time, it was
                                       ,      i


     probably as bad as I can ever remember experiencing) and had determined to

     find a more comfortable position elsewhere.      Vlth strenuous effort we had

     eventually forced our way back to the tunnel, (this Incidentally, being after we

     had first tried to escape the crush by moving laterally when to our surprise we

     were informed by other fans around that there were fences preventing such

     lateral movement),    Leading the pen via the sole entry and exit point of the

     central tunnel we emerged back Into the open courtyard outside and waited there

     for ten minutes or 60 , recovering from our exertions and simply enjoying the

     spaciousness and relishing the fresh air.      Purlng this time a steady stream of

     fans were making their way down the tunnel and no steward or policeman was

     present to check this flow,    Patently from our experience the pens were already

     brimful when we had left and, In hindsight, it Is irrevocably clear the tunnel

     should at that time have been closed off.      Tragically It was not and I hasten

     to add that, equally tragloally, neither my friende nor myself, despite the

     unpleasant crushing we had just experienced had neither the presence of alnd

     to realise the need for the tunnel to be closed nor to Inform a policeman or

■toward of the, same.   Ve simply made our way to the left-hand side tunnel, and

thereafter, onto the empty terracing of the left-hand pen, to await the start of

the game, aware of only one unusual phenomenon - the crowd, usually so noisy

and full of songs and chants, were strangely quiet and subdued, an indloatio.         o

Any of the other facts surrounding the Hillsborough tragedy merely muddy the

waters, which, sadly, is precisely what the Taylor enquiry ended up doing,
                                  '        *


Ticketless fans, fans who had been drinking, the crushing outside of the

turnstiles, fans who had arrived late - none had any bearing whatsoever onwhat

was already happening inside the killing pens - oil were merely re-enactions of

what had happened countless times before at countless other similar events. The

opening of the gates by the police to avert the possibility of serious injuries

amongst the fans milling outside, is probably the best example of such clouding

of the reality of Hillsborough.       By the time this event happened the fansin the

pens were already being crushed to death. In any case, the video evidence

clearly shows those fans spilling Into the courtyard through those gates, first

looking around for their friends and then walking in small groups (not rushing

as a mob) towards the central tunnel (the only one visible as you enter the

courtyard) possibly, in the case of some, to their own deaths.



The truth of Hillsborough is thus clear:       the central killing pens of Leppings

Lane were full at around 2 pn and yet, in spite of this, fans were still allowed

to continue to enter these pens for at least one hour afterwards.       It le
    1994-10-27    13=03                                 0512541426                P. 02




incontrovertible fact that this failure to close off the central tunnel aocess

leading to these pens was thus responsible for the inevitable ensuing

overcrowding and severe crushing which resulted in the 96 deaths.     The fane

themselves were blameless:    they were merely re-enacting their weekly rigmarole

of finding a space on a packed terrace, unaware of the Imminent carnage inside

and, sadly in some cases, of the fate which awaited them.



This conclusion brings me to the other simple fact about Hillsborough, one

which I feel, if not exonerating the negligence of the authorities in closing

off the tunnel entry from around 2 pm, then certainly explains their failure to

do so (and also my own, my friends' and probably others' failure to recognise

the dangers which in retrospective analysis are now so painfully clear).        It is

this!"   never before at any football natch or like situation, in Europe at least,

had anyone been crushed to death in the circumstances which existed at

Hillsborough (Heysel had been the result of Liverpool thugs oharging sadly

naive Italian innocents, whilst Ibrox had been a completely unrelated disaster

where fans had already left the terraces).    The Justifiable fear of hooligan Ibid

and the attempts to curb it had led to the creation of pens at small ends like

leppings Lane and no one to my knowledege, without the benefit of hindsight,

had scarcely imagined nor contemplated the terrible consequences of

overcrowding therein.     As such, even as a Liverpudlian I feel it is unfair to

expect anyone (even the polios in front of whose unseeing eyes the disaster was

unfolding and some of whose officers, fearing an outbreak of hooliganism, were

actually trying to force back into the pens those attempting to escape the

crush) to bear the blame for Hillsborough;     negligent the authorities, and
     1994-10-27    13=04                                    0512541426               P.03




certain individuals thereof, nay have been but in reality they did not know

what was happening until it was too late,        Hindsight is not, alas, a sense which

anyone possesses prior to a tragedy like this (as my friends and I are only too

tragically aware) and besides, nothing can bring back those poor dead souls nor

erase the suffering and grief of all involved!       all the revenge and

recriminations in the world cannot do that. In any case, those who Bade errors

of Judgement still have to live with themselves and my friends and I must count

ourselves amongst that fraternity for not being alive to the obvious dangers

which we had left behind when we emerged from the tunnel.



Fotwithetanding all this impotency and 'if only'.there is, however, something

which I feel oan be done about Hillsborough even at this late stage, and this, I

think, is my point to you, Xr.Vooldrldge:    respected Journalists such as your

good self and public figures such as Brian Clough, with regard to such

momentous events as Hillsborough, surely owe it to themselves and to everybody

else to thoroughly research and examine the evidence available with open minds

and not merely, as appears most revealingly in this instanoe, to treat such

things as matters of bland barrack room opinion to be hung on convenient coat

hooks such as "drunken end ticketless mobs of Liverpool fans".           Matters of such

importance demand open minds, not closed ones coloured with pre-conceived

prejudices.   On the actual evidence clearly available to those who genuinely

care deeply enough to look, those Liverpool fans who entered that unmanned

tunnel, unaware of what was unfolding beyond them, have no case to answer; they

merely became part of a packed crowd in which neither the living nor the dead

could be held responsible for the tragedy which transpired;        it was simply

 their regular Saturday ritual,   To accuse any of them of killing their fellow

 fans is rather like accusing the mining folk of Aberfan of killing the

 innocents of that schoDl with the slag heaps they helped to make.      It Is brutal,
 uncivilised and not true.




 The agonies Liverpudlians have had to endure from trite and often callous and

vicious statements conoerning our alleged oulpability for the deaths of, in nay

 instances, our own loved ones, by journalists such as yourself, have been

iaaense,   I an certain that I for one hove had several years taken off my own

lifespan by the stress and pain such inaccuracies have inflicted.      Contrary to

your assertions we do not pillory - we are pilloried;     regularly by such as

yourself, apparently blind to the realities:    we wince, we hurt and we bleed

every time we have to endure illfounded prejudges such as yours and

Xr.Clough's.



I ask but one thing of you, Kr .Wooldridge.    Contact me to discuss Hillsborough

in the detail it both deserves and demands.     I do not ask any more of you until

such tine and I think, in the circumstances, It is an equitable request 1 make.

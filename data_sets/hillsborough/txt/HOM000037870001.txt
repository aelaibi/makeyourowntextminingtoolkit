MICHAgL DAVID KELLY


1.   Michael    David    Kelly    the    brother      of    the   Applicant           Joan
     Sinclair      was   born    on   let March 1951, and was 38 years old
     when he died at Hillsborough football ground                  on     15th      April
     1989.


2.   At the mini inquest the jury heard from Dr John Clark that in
     his view the cause of death was             crush     asphyxia.       This       was
     based    on    finding signs of asphyxia in Mr Kelly's face which
     was rather congested and         had    a   bluish     discoloration.             Dr
     Clark     stated     that    these     changes      were     fairly       mild    in
     comparison to a lot of the other victims.               He further             stated
     that    one of the other features of asphyxia is to find little
                                                                   *


     haemorrhages on the skin.          He remarked ,that 'these               in    fact
     were not present.      Mr Kelly had not inhaled vomit and had not
     suffered any internal or severe injuries               and        there   was     no
     natural disease to account for his death.               Dr Clark said that
     he still thought Mr Kelly died of crush asphyxia and for some
     reason the signs of this were rather mild.                 He suggested that
     it may have been the case that Mr Kelly's heart                    stopped       for
     some particular reason very very quickly and he died but that
     this is something which is impossible to prove.


3.   Dr Clark's evidence was followed by the               evidence       of     Police
     Inspector Matthew Robert Sawers who stated that at about 3.35
     pm Police Constable Willmott made his way on to the Spion Kop
end     of the ground.          There he saw Mr Kelly lying on the pitch
on his back.       Michael appeared to be                   unconscious.          Together
with     Police    Constable             Lally     he checked for vital signs of
life but could not find any.                  Mr Kelly       was        carried    to     the
temporary      mortuary.            At     about     3.59     pm       Dr    Andrew     Byrne
certified Michael David Kelly dead.


At the mini-inquest visual evidence was produced by Detective
Inspector      Michael         Layton,       of    the West Midland Police                who
showed a photograph timed at 3.08 pm which appeared                               to     show
Mr    Kelly    alive       in    Enclosure 3.         When asked by the Coroner
whether he could say at that point if Mr Kelly was conscious,
unconscious,         alive       or       dead,    Detective           Inspector       Layton
replied that Mr Kelly was probably still alive but. certainly
                                                       /
                                                                   ✓
in distress.       The Applicant is concerned that such a question
was     directed     at    a     police       officer       and        feels    that      the
information sought by the Coroner ought to have been obtained
from a medical expert.


Inspector Layton also stated that a P C Maughan had attempted
to    resuscitate      a    man at the Leppings Lane end of the pitch
but without success.            P     C    Maughan     assisted             spectators     to
carry    the   man     to the Spion Kop end of the ground, where he
left him with a St John's Ambulance officer who has not                                  been
identified.        He further stated that P C Maughan had met with
the Applicant and both are satisfied that it was actually                                 Mr
Kelly that P C Maughan had attempted to assist.
At     the    main inquest the jury heard from Police Officer John
Raymond Maughan that on the day he got                          on    to     the    Leppings
Lane     end       of   the     pitch       at    about      3.04 pm.        Three or four
minutes later he approached a man who was laid on his side by
the     goalposts        on    the grassed area behind the bye line.                         He
identified the man as                  Mr Kelly.         The man did not             appear tobe
breathing          and with         the help of some civilians he turned Mr
Kelly over and worked                  on him for a few minutes.                    He       appeared
to     start       to   breathe.        Police Officer Maughan continued to
breathe for the man for a while.                       Mr Kelly then          appeared       to
slip     unconscious           but     he   was       breathing.        Police       Officer
Maughan was clearly confident in                       his     recollection         that     he
appeared          to    have    won     through and used the expression, "We
have won that one".              With the help of supporters                  he     carried
Mr     Kelly       towards      a     grassed      area on the pitch near to the
gymnasium where the first aid people had set up                              a     reception
area     in       the   comer.         They       left    Mr     Kelly in the care of
ambulancemen and went back to help at the                            other    end.       P    C
Maughan       was confident that Mr Kelly was still breathing when
he put him into the care of the St John's Ambulanceman.


In a meeting with the applicant P C Maughan stated that after
he    had     left      Mr     Kelly    with      the     ambulancemen he ran back
towards the Leppings Lane end                    to     assist       other    spectators.
Before       he    reached Leppings Lane he received a radic message
to form part of a cordon on the half way line which                                he    duly
did.         The   Applicant     asked him why he did this when he knew
people were dying.            He replied that he had to as            it    was     an
instruction, things were utterly chaotic and nobody knew what
they were doing.            This evidence was not put before the              jury.
Such     evidence       was    highly     relevant to theissue        of whether
death was due to or            aggravated by     lack of care,         an     issue
which was not left to the jury.


The Applicant is concerned that Mr Kelly was eventually found
lying on his back           without     apparently     having    received          any
treatment          from the     emergency services. Shecontends that he
ought to have been laid in the recovery                 position.          Further,
because       of    the absence of any obvious signs of crush injury
on Mr Kelly's body she feels that he would have survived                           had
he     received      prompt     medical    treatment      once   he    had        been
resuscitated by P C Maugham, and thereafter left in the                           care
of     the    St John Ambulance Service.         Finally the applicant is
concerned that the evidence shows that               Mr    Kelly      was     alive
beyond       the     3.15   pm cut off time imposed by the Coroner and
that the facts of the case present sufficient material for                           a
jury    to     consider whether to return a verdict that the death
of Michael David Kelly was due to or aggravated                  by        lack    of
care.

                           I wrote to S t e p h e n Paul K e l l y . - Is t h a t you?
                   ( indicating a g r e e m e n t ) On 13th M a y y o u s i g n e d a fo r m
               C   I sent to y o u and, in fact, y o u c o n f i r m e d that the

                   address, age, da t e of birth, o c c u p a t i o n a n d that is'still
                   so, isn't it?     Dr. Forrest d id the b l o o d alcohol levels in
                   t h e case of Michael and gave us the e v i d e n c e on the first
                   day, on the Wednesday, and in fact in t h e c as e of Michael
                   n o n e was detected.       It was negative-         Dr- Clark.
           D                MR. FRASER:      Just b ef or e y o u call Dr. Clark t h e r e is

 but Paul K e l l y s a w h i m e n t e r vi a a turnstile.          Further, sir,
 I would add that M i c h a e l ' s jacket h a s n ev er been Sound
 despite e x h a u s t i v e e n q u i r i e s to trace it and, of course, it
 is p os s i b l e that the m a t c h ticket c o u l d have been c o nt ai ne d
 in that jacket.

As we have a l r e a d y s a i d on many oc c a s i o n s in c i r c u m s t a n c e s -
like t his the p r e s e n c e or a b s en c e of t he ticket itself
doesn't pr ov e - well, it m a y hel p in certain cases but y ou
can't draw too m a n y c o n c l u s i o n s from it, p a r ti cu la r ly in a
case like this.        Now, Paul K e l l y who m we are tal k in g about,
that is no relat i on , is it? - A. N on e whatsoever,, sir.

It is just c o i n c i d e n c e he h a p pe n s to have the s a m e n a m e ? -
A c o mplete c o i n c i d e n c e , sir, yes.

Paul had an u n f o r t u n a t e e n c o u n t e r with a horse, is that
right? - A. C e r t a i n l y he had an injury to his right foot and
toe which he a t t r i b u t e s to the act io ns of a horse.

From o u r point of v i e w we are not too conc er ne d with how he
got the injury but it meant he wa nted to get into the gr ound

That is pag e 15, isn't it?    Paul K e l l y isn't here, is h e ? -
He refers to it first on pag e 13 a nd d e s cr ib e s the same
injury on page 15 w i t h the horse.

In effect, what he s a y s is that he w as told the gate was
going to be o p e n e d w h i c h we take it to be the c on c e r t i n a
gate, or one of t h e b i g gates, and he would be able to get
in?_ - A. He d o e s r e f e r spec i f ical l y , sir, to Gate C.

Yes, that is right, he does. - A. It was c e r ta in l y brought

 it b e c a u s e b o t h o f those things w o u l d be g u e s s e s but that

           THE      WI T NESS: It might be helpful, sir, if I                     make one

 clarification.                 I d o n ’t think we h a v e got the wr on g
 i m p r e ss io n but        it w o u l d be right to s a y 1 t h i n k that the
 o n l y two o p e n i n g s of the gate, in w h i c h a s u b s t a n t i a l n u m b e r
 o f pe ople went through, were those y o u h a v e r e f e r r e d to

 short p e r i o d of time, if there is a n y e v i d e n c e of p e o p l e

           T H E C OR ON ER :          Yes, that    is a v e r y g o o d point-     Me

 h a p p e n i n g w a s that the gate, I w a s g o i n g to say, was

 bei n g o p e n e d intermittently, u s u a l l y to throw p e o p l e out a n d
 not to a l l o w them in.                For example, o n e is tim ed at 1438, an

        T H E C OR ON E R:      In fact, it is o n l y f a i r to s a y that
Paul K e l l y d o e s m e n t i o n a time, I h a v e just noticed, but the

s ay s th a t c a n ' t p o s s i b l y right or w o r d s to that effect. -
That is true, sir, yes.

H i s t i m i n g s ca n' t b e r e l i e d on? - A. His t i m i n g s can 't be
r el ie d on.       I am s a t i s f i e d the w i t n e s s is d o i n g h is best to
r e co ll e ct but c e r t a i n l y his i n f o r m a t i o n a b o u t tirring can't
be r e l i e d on, sir.

There is a n i n t e r e s t i n g sentence here.             T u r n to page 16
because t h i s m a y a c t u a l l y help.      T h e last paragraph, Paul
Kelly says, "Once I was inside the g r o u n d I s a w the gate

e v e r y b o d y c a m e in a n d went down the t u n n e l . I now k now the
gate was o p e n e d at t h i s time about 14 50." - A. Yes.

As I say, I w o u l d n ' t be too reliant on h i s timi ng s but that
is what he s a y s ? - A. He does say that, sir, yes.

   a number of metal railings going up which is spiked at
   the top and a metal bar runs about two or three inches
   across from the.' top and so there are straights rails
   going up to the top but they are not the angled ones
   that we see in the picture.
        MRS. McBRIEN: I am very sorry about that but I
   had to come in on this.
        THE CORONER: I was puzzied as well which is why I
   got him to show us which fence it was. We wanted to be
   sure we were talking about the right one.
        MRS. McBRIEN: I just thought I would be helpful.
   I did not want to interfere in any way at all.
        THE CORONER: No, Mrs. McBrien, it was a- helpful
   intervention I am quite sure.
       MR. GRIFFITHS:       I think C.521 might help, sir.
        THE CORONER: Just stick it up on tae screen and
   let us have a look. This is dealing with the railings.
Q. Just turn round, Officer. That is the top end of one
   of those radial fences. Is that what you mean? - A.
   Yes, that is what I am referring to, sir.
        THE CORONER:       There is nothing else, Mr. King?

        MR. KING:    No, sir.

Q. It was definitely the radial fence, was it? - A. Yes.
Q. Hasit got spikes or    not? - A. I don't know.

Q. Mr. Maughan, I have asked you to come because I want
   you to deal with a specific matter? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. I think you had some dealings with a gentleman on the
   pitch, is that right? - A. That is correct, sir.
Q. Am I right in thinking you eventually identified this
   gentleman as being Michael David Kelly? - A. That is
   correct, sir.
Q. That was from photographs? - A. Yes, sir, that was from
   photographs.   ’

Q. How confident are you about your identification? - A. I
   am pretty sure it was the same man.
Q. You are pretty sure about that? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Is it right that your duty was off the field initially.
   You had to go somewhere else? - A. That is correct.
Q. You got on to the field just after three, about four
   minutes past three, is that right? - A. Yes, the"
   players W'ei.e'i»tixj.'on the pitch.
 *                                        y
Q. Pardon? - A. The football players" were still on the
   pitch when I came on.
Q. We axe not too concerned about what you thought was
   going on but eventually you came upon a man on the
   pitch, is that right? - A. That is correct.
Q. He did not appear to you to be breathing at that stage?
   - A. That is right.
Q. He also looked blue, is that correct? - A. That is
   right.
Q. I think you then positioned him and started
   resuscitation, is that right? - A. That is correct,
   sir.

Q. In fact, you thought you were successful, is that
   right? - A. I did think I was successful.
Q. What actually happened? - A. When I approached the man
   he was laid on his side by the side of the goalposts.
Q. Just speak up and lean forward. - A. He wj&s laid on his
   slide by the goalposts on the grass part of the area
   behind the bye line and he did not appear to be
   breathing and with the help of some civilians we turned
   the man over, worked on him for a few minutes. He
                                                              71

  appeared to start to breathe again and then we got a
  hoarding and carried him to the ambulance area at the
  other end of the pitch.
Q. Before you tell me about that you came on to the pitch
   about three or four minutes past three. Bow long was
   the time interval before you got to this chap? Have
   you any idea? - A. Probably three or four minutes.

Q. It was not very long, in other words?     A. No.
Q. Then you worked on him with t^ie help of some
   supporters? - A. That is correct.
Q. Did he, as far as you remember, actually breathe
   spontaneously on his own, or ,did you have to continue
   breathing for him? - A. We continued breathing for him
   for a whiJLs*_ then he appeared to slip unconscious but
   he was breathing, this was just before we took him away
   to the other end of the pitch.
Q. So then you picked him up on a stretcher or hoarding? -
   A. On a hoarding.

Q. And carried him across the field? - A. That is correct.
Q. Towards the gymnasium, is that right? - A. That is
   right, where the Ambulance Service, or there were some
   Ambulancemen there who had sort of set an ambulance
   station up, just on the pitch itself, on the corner.
Q. What did you do with him when you got to that position?
   - A. We handed him to the ambulancemen andhe was left
   in their care, and we came back down the pitch for a
   second time.
Q. That was the last you saw of him? - A. That is correct,
   sir.
Q. Of course, you can't help me as to what happened to him
   subsequent to that? - A. I can't sir, no.
                Cross-Examined by MR. KING
Q. Officer, I on behalf of the family of Michael Kelly am
   seeking to investigate as much detail as the family can
   obtain about the last moments of his life, and you will
   bear with me on that? - A. Yes.
Q. I want to see if I can pinpoint the time slightly more
   as to when you went to Michael at a time when he was
   not at first breathing, then you worked on him and he
   appeared to be breathing. You say the players were
   still on the pitch when you got onto the field? - A.
   That is correct, sir.
Q. Were they actually playing, do you remember, or just
   standing around? - A. Nottingham Forest was attacking
   the Liverpool end.

        MR. KING:   Sir, so you know, it is from the
   Sunday Mirror newspaper of April 23rd, 1989. It shows
   a photograph, and I am going|to try and ask the Officer
   if it was the sort of area where he found Michael
   Kelly. I am going to point out someone on the ground
   who it is believed by Mrs. Kelly ....
        THE CORONER:      To be him.

        MR. KING:      Yes.
Q. Officer, do you see that newspaper, and it shows a
   photograph which we are led to believe is of the scene
   on 15th April/ 1989? (Passes newspaper to Witness) - A.
   That is correct, sir.
Q. It shows the Leppings Lane gdal and it shows, I think,
   a well known goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, clearly in
   the picture, doesn't it? - A. That is correct.
Q. He is clearly still on the pitch there. Do you see
   somebody on his back in white? - A. That is correct,
   sir.
Q. Is that the sort of position you found Michael Kelly
   in? - A. Looking at the photograph I would say the
   position was probably two or -three mbre to the right of
   the gentleman lying on the ground.
Q. As you look at the picture? - A. Yes.
Q. Does the gentleman on the ground you see, I know it is
   very difficult, does it jog any memories, such as you
   can see on that photograph, as to whether it looks very
   similar to the person you were dealing with7 - A. The
   chap who I found and approached on the ground had a
   blue jacket with him. If I could be certain he had the
   jacket with him I could say that was the man.
Q. When you say he had the jacket with him, do you mean he
   was wearing it or it was simply on the ground? - A. It
   was beside him on the ground.
Q. So he was not wearing a jacket. I think the photograph
   shows that gentleman has a white shirt on of some sort,
   doesn't he? Does that tie in with your recollection? -
   A. I would hot possibly say t^hat.
Q. Certainly, give or take a few feet, the sort of
   position and the sort of timing looks about right? - A.
 — It is about right, sir.
        MR. KING:   I don't know whether you want to see
   that, sir?
                                                             74

                                              J.   R.   MAUGHAN


        THE CORONER:   Yes, could I just glance at it? If
   it is shown to Sergeant Killoch the chances are we will
   be able to find this photograph and then if need be we
   can exhibit it.
        MR. KING:   That is helpful.   I atn obliged, sir.
Q.y I know it is difficult, but you say you worked on the
   man Michael Kelly for a few minutes, I think you put
    it, didn't you? - A. That is correct.
Q. You are clearly confident in your recollection that you
   appeared to have won through, if I can put it that way?
   - A. Yes, sir,/ I was.
Q. That was an expression which you used when you were
   describing it - I think you have spoken to Mrs. Kelly
   about it, haven't you? - A. Yes.
Q. And you used the expression, "We have won that one", or
   something like that? - A. That is right, I did.
Q. So it does sound as if you were quite confident in your
   own mind when you took the man over to where you put
   him into the care of the St. John's Ambulance, that he
   at that stage was still breathing? - A-. I was quite
   confident he was, sir.       ■_      ,     ?
Q. How did you actually deliver him to the St. John's
   Ambulance? Did you lay him on the ground, did you
   actually hand him to somebody or what? - A. No, we
   carried him. on a hoarding across the pitch to, as I
   have described, as you come out of the gymnasium onto
   the pitch itself, the first aid people had set a sort
   of reception area up in the corner, and we put the
   hoarding down on the floor and what they were doing,
   they were moving them off the hoardings so that we
   could have them to carry back to the other end of the
   Ground.
Q. Did you actually receive back the hoarding on which you
   had carried Michael? - A. Not the same one.
Q. Did you actually yourself see him being taken off the
   hoarding? - A. No.
Q. So the last you saw of him was when he was laid down on
   the ground in the way you have described? - A. Yes.
Q. It looks then, it is fairly obvious from your evidence
   but I will put it to you and ask you so the family can
   hear me, there is from the summary of evidence which
   they have been provided with, evidence that at 15.35
   (sir, this is paragraph 4 of the summary), at 15.35 an
                                                                  75

     Officer, Police Constable Wilmot, made his way into the
     Spion Kop end of the Ground, and he says apparently
     that at 3.35 he saw a man who he believes to be Michael
     David Kelly lying on the pitch on his back, who
     appeared unconscious, and IT Is said IftaE with another
     Officer, that is Police Constable Lalley, the original
     Officer, Wilmot, checked for vital signs of life but
     could not find any, and Mr. Kelly was placed onto a
     temporary stretcher and taken into the gymnasium, and
     at about just before 4 o'clock, 15.59, Dr. Byrne
     certified life extinct. You have no knowledge at all,
     do you, as to what happened to Mr. Kelly, what
     attention he received or otherwise, from the moment you
     laid him downy and you presumably went back to help at
     the other end? - A. That is correct, sir.
          MR. KING:   Sir, I always regret mistakes on
     sensitive matters. I have referred throughout to Mrs.
     Kelly - it is his sister, and I am sorry. I hope the
     family will forgive me for that:

Q. It was Mr. Kelly's sister you had been speaking to in
   the way you have described to me? It is Mrs. Sinclair,
   the lady we see there who you were speaking to, wasn't
   it? - A. That is right.
          MR. KING:   I am sure she will forgive me if I
     have mis-described her.
          THE CORONER:   Yes, I knew about that and I
     overlooked it too, I am sorry.
Q.        MR. KING:   You have been very helpful, Officer,
     because you can obviously see the concern of the
     family.
          Sir, subject to the photograph being found I don't
     think I can take that any further.
          THE CORONER:   We have not got the photograph
     here. It is either in Birmingham or it may be in our
     office. What I propose to do is to try and retrieve it
     and make an acetate of it in the usual way.
Q. You did not actually identify Mr. Kelly on that
   photograph, did you? - A. No.
            THE CORONER:   Do we need it?   Is it going      to help
     us?    I don't mind doing it.
 _          MR. KING:   Sir, I think the witness could go this
     far:
                                                             76

                                               J.   R.   MAUGHAN


Q. I think you could say that it could be Mr. Kelly? - A.
   Yes.
Q. There is nothing in it which makes you say that it
   definitely isn't? - A. That is correct.

Q. I think you can say that subject to moving a few feet
   to the right in your recollection, it is the sort of
   area of the goal where you saw him? - A. That is where
   he was found, yes.
Q. Given that we see Bruce Grobbelaar on the pitch it is
   the sort of timing you would be expecting from your
   evidence? - A./That would be about right.
       MR. KING:      Sir, it may be helpful for the family.
       THE CORONER:   I am very happy to do it, it just
  may take a little while.
       I think that is the sum total of the cases where
  we needed to do urgent things, so to speak. We will
  pause for a little while and have a cup of coffee. Did
  you want to say anything to me, Mr. King?
       MR. KING:   Sir, there are one or-two matters I
  would like to mention to you.    .. y
       THE CORONER:   Yes. Leave us and you will have a
  slightly longer coffee break.
              (In the absence of the Jury)
       MR. KING:   Sir, in relation to the witnesses
  Bichard and Goddard, are they in Court now?
       THE CORONER:     They may well be, so if they could
  just leave us?
      (Mr. Bichard and Mr. Goddard left the Court)
       MR. KING:   Sir, I have taken the opportunity
  during the lunch adjournment to read through as best I
  can the evidence they gave, certainly to Lord Justice
  Taylor, and certainly two matters, sir: I would invite
  you to call them but I would invite you to call them to
  give a full witness account of the events in the
  Control Room during the relevant period, that is to say
  on the day of the match.
   *   Sir, having read through what they have said in
  those accounts they clearly have eye witness evidence
  as to the circumstances leading up to the request f°r
  the closure of the gates. Their evidence is not on all
                                                         77

                                           J.   R.   MAUGHAN


fours with the evidence which we have heard at all from
Mr. Duckenfield as to what was said in the Control
Room, what was believed in the Control Room as to the
gates which were to be opened1, the circumstances in
which Gate A came to be opened are dealt with, the
circumstances in which kick-off was or was not to be
delayed are dealt with and thV decision to refuse the
request of P.C. Buxton to delay kick-off is dealt with,
the decision   to send serials round    to Gate A or onto
the North Stand is dealt with;, and     sir, Mr. Bichard,
and I say it   so you can hear me so   I do not in any way
take anybody   by surprise, actually    gives evidence asto
what Mr. Duckenfield said in Jiis presence as to how it
had come about 'that the problems had arisen on the
Leppings Lane end, and you know, sir, to what I am
referring in that respect.    ^




   /All those are matters
                                                            73




      All those are matters which I nave to say to you,
sir, on behalf of those I reoras^nt, I would want to
and would submit I should. be antit led to investigate
if you call then.     I would be failing in my duty if I
acquiesced in a ruling which you have indicated you
would oe minded to give, that if you did call thrin,
sir, you would restrict then in the way you have
described, because they ape giving factual evidence on
•natters vhich the Jury ha'/e to determine and, indeed,
daal with quite vital matters relating to the
behaviour of !tr. D u c k e nf i 4l d .

        In those ci rc um st a nc e s, sir, I in fact have two
a pp li cations . One is to #nvits you to call then, in
your discretion, and to invite you, sir, to take this
stance, that if you do call theji you should allow
questioning on all the natters to which I have
referred .

     Sir, if your ruling is that in your discretion
you will call them but restrict the:n to only the
matters you have referred-'to, in my submission thit
would be the worst of both worlds and, in fact, one
would be jiving a false picture to 'the Jury rather
than no picture at all, and,a false picture and a
misleading picture can be worse than no picture.

     THE CORONER: That, of course, is the last thing I
want to do.
                              *

     MR.*KING:   Of course £ sir. But ny strong
submission to you is notwithstanding the tine problem
we have, these are witnesses of substance on the vital
events which this Jury are particularly concerned
with, which are the events leading to and then
immediately following the decision to open the gates
at the Leopines Lane end, rand it is hard to see a
rationale, for having included so many other witnesses
who do not go to such vital events in the overall
picture and not to call these witnesses.

     If it be, sir, a matter of convenience because of
time, and I am not so insensitive as riot to appreciate
that problem, all I can say on behalf of those I
represent is - this is not’ meant facetiously at all,
sir - 'rather like the argument that kick-off should
not be d e l ay e d merely because of a reason, if, in
fact, they are witnesses o"f substance then they ou.<»ht
to be called as full witnesses, even if we have to
recognise, and I am sure I play a role in the blame
for this as muc h as anybody else,      that our time­
tabling has gone awry in this Inquast. I say that
without m e an i ng any disrespect to you, sir, at all
         I m e a n what I say about ray role at all tines
     THE COriOIIER:   Did you want   to say s o t s C h i n " , Ur.
Payne?

      MR. PAYNI:    Sir, a lot of what Ur. iCin;3 has said,
 I think I would a q t 2 e with, Chat once the witness has
 bean called Chen ha is ac large, and ic is difficulc
 really to 3 3 3 any legitimate basis on vhich
 examination can be restricted, buc I think our
.position would be to invite you to adhere to the
 original approach that you intended Co follow, namely
 Chat on balance, having heard the evidence of Che
 principal occupants of the Control 3ox, you will
 probably not need to recall the ocher people.

      I am only goin* Co add Chis because I did not
mention it before the adjournment, buC I am slightly
concerned about Che sequence of witnesses.   Hr. Xin^
has very fairly indicated the lines of cross-
exanination which he would intend to open up with
these witnesses and, of course, one cannot pre-jud^e
what chey would say or how it would cone out, but one
cannot help feeling that Chese could be points which,
in fairness, ought Co have been puc, or at least Chey
ought to have had the oooortunitv to deal with it 'ihen
the other occuoants, Hessrs. Duckenfield and Hurray,
were giving their evidence.    it would be very
unfortunate if the Inquest, got into the stage of
leaving natters in the air which could perhaps be
dealt with by those other witnesses who might then
have to be recalled.   This is a ghastly prospect which
certainly I thin’c we would wish to avoid, but in the
interests of fairness one can see thac if parCicular
points were to be made, or evidence were to be given,
tn?n this is the kind of thing which Messrs.
Duckenfield and Hurray ought to have a chance to deal
with.

      TJIZ C O R O H E R : I think that that goes without
saying, but if matters were to be raised where Mr.
Isaacs and Hr. Manning were to say to me, "Hang on, we
want Mr. Ouclcenfield and Mr. Murray to have an
opp ortunity to answer", I would certainly not raise
any ob jection if I were to call these witnesses.            I
think that point goes without saying,, whatever the
effect on timing, I am not really interested.             It
does not matter to me.           I want to finish this month if
I can, rbut if we do not, we do not, we adjourn it to a
convenient time.

     MR. P A Y U E : I thin’c we would be at one with Mr.
Xing on this, that one r e c o g n i s e s .that time pressures
do not really have any input into this decision at
all, it has to be taken on its merits.            j.hat is
think our oosition would be that we would invice you

to adhere to the original approach that you had,
namely that having heard the evidence of the principal
people, and their evidence having been thoroughly and
lengthily gone into by all interested parties, it
would not be necessary to take the matter further.

     r r z C0R0;3'l: \ l e are .loin^ to have a coffee break
in a minute.     Yes, ?!r. lussell?

      !R. R'JSSZLL: Sir, I have not risen to say
anythin® in this particular debate.    I am almost
exclusively on the sidelines in resoect of these
'witnesses who are to be called, save for one very
minor matter.    But perhaps I could cone to your
assistance to this extent,    "e anpear here with your
l’ave, we ask questions of witnesses with your leave.
Thev are your witnesses and you call then for the
purposes tnat you see fit for the purposes of these
In rues ts.

        You indicated at one stage that it was your
purpose to call the Officer who vas responsible for
operating the video camera, or the console of video
cameras, to be in a position to explain to the Jury
tne technical capabilities pf those cameras.       That, it
seems to ae, is a wholly different area of evidence
from tne factual recollection of those Officers,
either the person operating the camera or the person
operating the radio on that day.      Inasmuch as with
some of the witnesses we have had today you have said,
T h e s e witness es are going to deal with a ve ry limited
area of evidence and nothing else", and we have
iliered to that, I do not see why there is a problem
in you de al ing with these witnesses, these two Police
officers, in that same restricted manner.

      C ertain ly Inspector Hemmingway, as you will
appreciate, could have dealt with all sorts of matters
relating to the conduct of the afternoon in question,
not least the rescue and the role of my client in it.
I did not see k to ask him those questions because I
un lerstood the very limited ambit and the very limited
purposes for which you wanted those witnesses called.

      But,, sir, if you seek to elicit matters of fact
and ma tters of recollection of these witnesses as to
what they s a w on the day, then of course I can
understand the position that my learned friend. M r .
LCing is in and, no doubt, my learned friend Hr.
Isaacs, and Hr. Manning as well, as to what evidence
they might wish to elicit once you go down that road.
But it does appear that there i 3 a vary clear and
obvious cut-off point in their evideaca whereby you
can limit the evidence of the3e witnesses to tne

                                                                   31




\
        technical capabilities of the paraphernalia that they
        had at their disposal, that thay were operating, and
        limit it to that.      Once you open up the factual
        account of tne day in question, than you have embarcei
        down the road, and certainly within the areas tnat you
        have explored so far in these Inquests it would ->e
I       very difficult to stop either :.ny learned friend :ir.
        i'ini, or ;n-.’ learned friend Hr - Isaacs, or Mr. ''lamin;,
        from aslcin^ questions about those subjects as veil.
J
             ‘I?.. CAICIIPOLE: If it is of any assistance, it
    c   does appear that all the legal representatives are of
        che same mind, at least in relation to the second limb
        of Mr. king's application before you.     I make no
        comment as to whether you ought to call these
        witnesses or not, it is a matter for you, sir.      But.I
        Jo believe, as my learned friend Mr. Hus sal I has said,
        tnat if you embark on any attempt to elicit factual
        evidence, it would be inappropriate to prevent any of
        my learned friends from exploring those matter." and
        putting it into its proper context.

              THE COROMER: I accept that point. ' If we 3 0 into
        the facts, then it is only right that they should be
        srcolored, but it is the extent and the method of
        exploration which I an concerned about.    I have no
        objection if, for instance, I were to ask the Officers
        to recount in examination-in-chief what their
        recollection is with regard to the events, to that
        point being examined but purely factually.     i«hat I am
        not going to have is what we have done in the past and
        wnich we did at great length with Mr. Hurray and Hr.
        DucUenfield and which, in fact, I '<new we were doing
        an: I thought in the circumstances was right, but I an
        quite entitled to say, "You have as’.ced enougn
        questions on this, next subject", as I do quite often
        with Mrs. McBrien, and that is all I am saying, and
        tnat is the way I am going to do it.    So I am going to
        call Mr. Goddard and when I have heard him I will
        probably call Hr. Bichard and we will obviously be
        sitting tomorrow and if need be we will sit on Monday
        if we have not finished, and that is it.

             ::R. CATCHPOLE: You mooted the possibility that
        tomorrow might be put into a full day.

             THE CORONER: Yes, we will sit t as a full day.

             Mil.   CATCHPOLE:   That is very helpful,   than'c you.

             THE CORONER;   The way I put the order was not an
        accident, that was after some considerable thougnt.    I
        could have got it wrong.   Be that as it may, certainly
        if at the end of t         nee it would aopeac that it
is eight to ask 'Ir. Duckanfield and Mr. 'lacray to coaa
back to deal with any outstanding points, I will do
so.
     !1R. PAYl'E: will you allow :ne to   30   last if tnis
haooens?   These are Police Officers.

         CO^O'.'Efl: Yes.
      7'IZ                So we 'nti 11 have a quick bre=k.
I an afraid you will have to be hack in Court as fas:
as you can.

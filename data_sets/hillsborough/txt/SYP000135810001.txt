  I have received a copy of th e le tte r th a t you w rote to D etective S ergeant Julie
  A ppleton about y o u r concern over th e H illsborough d isa ste r, the criminal
  en q u iry and th e decisions th a t have been made. I have noted yo u r disquiet
  h u t I th in k it would be in ap p ro p riate fo r me to make any comments.

  You say       in y o u r le tte r th a t you a re read y fo r explanations and I th erefo re
  th in k it   would be ap p ro p riate fo r you to raise y o u r concerns th ro u g h y our
  Solicitor    so he can take up th e m atters a t th e In q u ests which you will probably
  know b y     now commence in Sheffield on 19 November 1990.

  Because th e In q u ests a re about to commence it would be inappropriate fo r me
  o r my officers to engage in explanations outside th e public arena of th e
  C oroner's C ourt. T hat h is how I believe th e C oroner would p re fe r it and I
  would ask you to b e a r w ith me in th is re g a rd .

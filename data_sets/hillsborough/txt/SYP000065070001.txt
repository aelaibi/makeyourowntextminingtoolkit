       began       to m a k e         their          way     to    the       g r o u n d at         about     h a lf    past        two       to

       quarter          to       thr ee.         The        walk       to    the     groumk^would               t ake a b o u t          2-3          minutes,

            n u m b e d of         people        came        into       the       shop'Xnd asked where                       they        could             b uy

       hundred.

       At     about      f iv e       to    three           we w e r e       s t ill      getting           a steady         stream           of          fans

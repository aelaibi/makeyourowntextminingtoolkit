RE:   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

As you are probably aware, I was present at Hillsborough and witnessed
the horrifying scenes that took place as the tragedy unfolded.   I was
deeply affected, as were thousands of people whether they were present
or not.

You can imagine my total dismay, therefore, at the remarks of the
Spokesman of the Sheffield Police Federation.    I believe he was
coirpletely out of order to express such insensitive and distasteful
comments particularly as these are without any foundation.    For a
person of his standing and authority to allege mass drunkeness, and other
obscene violations by fans, is revolting in the extreme and quite
erroneously contrary to the events as I saw than.

I am, as you know, a great supporter of the Police, and this is why this
person's remarks cause me so much distress. Mary officers, on that
fateful afternoon, carried out their duties heroically, and I have
nothing but syiipathy for the officer who made the decision to open the
gate. I believe, however, that some form of protest should be sent to
the Sheffield Police Authority expressing the disgust of the people of
this area at the words of Mr Paul Middup. Surely a person in his
position should know better than to utter words which may well be subject
to the forthcoming inquiry. I could not believe my ears when I heard him
on the radio, and I am so incensed that I am writing to you for your
thoughts, as I regard your cool professionalism very highly.

Yours/sincere 1v

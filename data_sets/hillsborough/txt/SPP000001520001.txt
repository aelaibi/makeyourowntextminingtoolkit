Dr. S. L. Pepper,
H.M. Coroner for South Yorkshire,
Medico-Legal Centre,

8th November 1990.


Dear Dr. Pepper,

Thank you for your various recent letters, perhaps I could deal with the
various matters you raise in each of them at one go but in the order in
which the letters have been written.

On the 26th October you wrote to me concerning the Registration of the 95
deaths and invited me to accept documentation in respect of the 95
with a view to my distributing them directly to the bereaved or their
respective Solicitors. ± have given very careful consideration to your
proposition but think that on balance it would be better if the Registrar
wrote directly to the Family Representat ive whose details you have enclosing
the relevant documents and inviting him/her to deal with the various
formalities.   i say this not because ± have any wish not to assist but
because neither my Committee nor my own practice act for all the families
now and as the Registration of a death is such an intensely personal (and in
my view private) matter 1 think it is a matter which is perhaps best dealt
with without the involvement of Lawyers.    i do hope you understand and
accept my assurance that i have no wish to be obstructive and in other
respects will obviously do all ± can to assist as ± hope recent history has
demonstrated.


Just before your Fre-lnquest Review began on Tuesday you asked me to let you
have a list of Family Members who were in attendance, the information you
required is as follows:-

                      1.       Mr and Mrs Traynor.
                      2.       Mr and Mrs Joynes.
                      3.       Mr Jones.
                      4.       Mr Ball.
                      5.       Mr Spearritt.
                      6.       Mrs McBrine.
                      7.       Mr Glover.
                      8.       Mr Hammond.
                      9.       Mr Hicks.
                      10.      Mr itemberton.
                      11.      Mr McAlister.
                      12.      Mr Church
    will appreciate that the Hillsborough Family Support Group (from wham my
Committee presently receive instructions direct) do not include all these
people,   Mrs McBrine and Mr Church are notable exceptions.

I hope     to be able to let you have a def initive list of those familieswho
are under the umbrella of the Group during the course of the next couple of
days ...    that information will enable you to identify those families who
are not within the umbrella and you may then wish to contact them directly
to explain your present thinking.      ± think it would be right to say that
those families who are not part of the Group fall into two distinct
categories ... those who have decided that they have no wish to be involved
in theresumed inquest hearing for one reason or another and those who wish
to haveseparate representation and as far as 1 am aware only Mr and Mrs
McBrine fall into this latter category but you may have other information
about this.


Your letter dated 31st October was received with some enthusiasm!         My
Committee are as keen as you to ensure that two principal aims are achieved
following the resumption of the inquests those being that the Jury hear all
that is relevant without hearing unecessary repetition and that the families
of those who so tragically lost their lives are satisfied that everything
that should be done is seen to be done and your willingness to attempt to
prepare and distribute factual statements intended to be "scene setters"
which will be presented by Officers of West Midland itolice is much
appreciated and receipt by us of copies of those "scene setters" at the
earliest possible opportunity would be greatly appreciated so that Counsel
can go through than in advance and highlight any aspects or areas which he
feels might require amplification.

We entirely recognise and appreciate the point made in the   final   paragraph
of your letter.

At the tre-inquest Review you indicated that it was your intention to allow
your Jury to view the two hour compilation video put together with West
Midlands .folice as part as their investigation into this tragedy and that
this might be shown on the afternoon of the first day. This information has
(as you might imagine) beccme public knowledge and the fact that the video
has been produced in two formats i.e.        with and without sound has been
brought to our attention, it is my strong view that the version with sound
should be the one played to the Jury so that they may fully appreciate the
flavour of events as they took place but that version is by its very nature
distressing to both listen to and watch. Two points arise. You may feel
that some members of your Jury could be so affected by what they see and
hear that they may require some form of professional support following their
exposure to the video and you might also feel that if the film is to be
played in open Court members of any family affected by this tragedy present
in Court should be warned by you that the version of the film that is about
to be played will have the soundtrack. It is of course a matter entirely
for you as to how you deal with this ... 1 merely make these points with
respect for your consideration.


Turning finally to your letter dated 6th November and its enclosures might 1
begin this section by thanking you for supplying the list of proposed
witnesses.   It will ccaae as no surprise to you to learn that we are now in
the process of extracting from the transcript of the evidence ''given before
Lord Justice Taylor the evidence given by those in the list who gave
evidence before him and trawling our files         to   see   if    we  have
statements/letters etc from those others named (apart from the Police
Officers and Club Officials)      so   that   Mr   King   may   have   those
transcripts/statements before him as the individuals are called to give
                to assist him and although we have no wish to obtain any unfair
          ntage by having the transcript/statement available for Mr King we can
    r—-—     y °u that the provision of the list by you is very much appreciated.
     To refine matters one stage further (and ultimately to perhaps save time) we
     would appreciate the publication as soon as possible of a "running order" of
     the witnesses and thereafter a timetable showing the dates on which it is
     anticipated that those who will give evidence will be called                i
     appreciate that it may not be possible to give more than two or perhaps
     three days notice Jawt of who will give evidence on a particular day but even
     that much notice would greatly assist us in the logistical exercise which I
     am sure you will appreciate we must undertake.

     Ihe matters you raise in numbered paragraphs 5 and 6 of your letter are
     under active consideration and as soon as 1 am in a position to get back to
     you constructively i will of course do so.

    ihe po^ifclbn of the transcript of the i^re-inquest Review on 30th October is
    much appreciated.

    Ux the topic of transcripts i can tell you that we will require a copy of
     the daily transcript and undertake to meet the cost involved by the issue of

c   a single cheque at the end of the tearing. Doubtless your staff will let me
    know what are to be the arrangements of collection of the transcript on a
    daily basis       i do not anticipate being in attendance myself beyond the
    iirst week but a member of my Staff will be present with Mr King throughout
    the entire hearing and once a pattern for collection of the transcript has
    been established hopefully it can continue throughout the tearing. Will von
             arrfnse ±or the invoice for the total amount due to be drawn against
    Hillsborough Steering Committee ... upon receipt by me of the invoice a
    cheque will be issued in settlement within seven days. A V.A T        invoice
    will be required.

     in conclusion might i repeat a point made by me in earlier correspondence
     '; ‘ xt *s unusual for a Solicitor to enter direct personal correspondence
    with one of Her Majesty's Coroners on topics such as those raised in this
     letter and 1 appreciate the uniqueness (if there is such a word) of the
    present situation and if you feel that i have overstepped the mark in any
    respect in this letter then i sincerely apologise and can assure you that no
    disrespect or breach of etiquette is intended ... all that 1 have said has
               ™ a 8enume attempt to contribute to the fair and smooth running
    ot the forthcoming resumed hearings it inevitably presents difficulties for
    both yourself and my Committee in a large number of respects and 1 know that
    my fellow Ccmnittee Members and the Family Support Croup which we represent
    are keen to ensure that such logistical problems that will inevitably arise
    are dealt with m the best possible way for all concerned without seeking to
    obtain any unfair advantage.                                           ^

    1 look, forward to being before you again from the 19th November for at least
    a week in company with Mr King.

    Yours sincerely,
       ^   r \U

HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY - LETTER FROM JULIE FALLON


i ssue

We have received the attached correspondence from Julie Fallon, the sister o f Andrew
Sefton, who died at Hillsborough. Mrs Fallon refers to the perceived limitations o f
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s terms o f reference (copy attached), and is highly critical
o f the handling o f the matter by the various authorities in the years since the disaster.

Timing

2.      I regret that Mrs Fallon’s letter was mislaid within the Unit, delaying this
advice. We expect Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to deliver his report next Friday, 30
January (Mr Pugh’s submission o f 22 January refers) and an early reply would,
therefore, be helpful.

Recommendation

3.     That you reply to Mrs Fallon along the lines o f the attached draft.
(Hillsborough relatives usually receive a Home Secretary reply).

Consideration

4.     As is the case with many o f the relatives, Mrs Fallon has little confidence in
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s ability to head the scrutiny. This stems largely from the
unfortunate remark the Judge made to Mr Phil Hammond, a member o f the
Hillsborough Family Support Group, when he visited Liverpool in October.

5.     Mrs Fallon’s criticism o f the terms o f reference is also shared by many o f the
families, a number o f whom have written to you previously. My submissions o f 22
October and 24 November 1997 refer.

6.     It was for the Judge to consider evidence submitted to the scrutiny, and he was
entirely responsible for the conduct o f the scrutiny. It would, therefore, not be
appropriate for you to comment on matters until you have received his report. Lord


f:\oppu\complnts\shortsub\mjw-0192.doc
Justice Stuart-Smith has not indicated that he finds his terms o f reference to be
restrictive.

8.     Mrs Fallon has copied her letter to a number o f other parties, including Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith and the Members for the Liverpool Wards. To date, we have
received letters from two Members, to whom Mr Michael is due to reply. Again, it
would be preferable if these replies, which will refer to your own to Mrs Fallon, could
be sent before the report is delivered.

Handling/presentation

9.       There are no additional handling considerations.




                                         PETER EDMUNDSON

Terms of reference




To ascertain whether any evidence exists relating to the disaster at the
Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which was not available;


      (a) to the Inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor; or


      (b) to the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Attorney
         Generalfor the purpose o f discharging their respective
         statutory responsibilities; or


      (c) to the Chief Officer o f South Yorkshire Police in relation to
         police disciplinary matters;


and in relation to (a) to advise whether any evidence not previously
available is o f such significance as to justify establishment by the
Secretary o f State for the Home Department o f a further public
inquiry; and in relation to (b) and (c) to draw to their attention any
evidence not previously considered by them which may be relevant to
their respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action
which should be taken in the public interest
DRAFT REPLY FOR HOME SECRETARY’S SIGNATURE


Mrs J Fallon




Thank you for your letter o f 21 November about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny
into the Hillsborough Disaster. I am very sorry for the delay in replying.


The terms o f reference which I have given Lord Justice Stuart-Smith for the Scrutiny
will allow him to establish conclusively whether any material evidence was
overlooked in the consideration o f the causes o f the disaster or the consideration o f
criminal or other proceedings. As you point out, his terms o f reference also enable
him to recommend any other action which should be taken in the public interest. His
terms o f reference are, therefore, very wide indeed and I am confident that they have
allowed him to carry out a full scrutiny o f the evidence submitted by the families and
others.


I am sure you will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on
the detailed issues you raise in your letter, many o f which fall within the remit o f the
Scrutiny. As I have indicated before, I will make public the advice given by Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith in his report, and will take whatever action is needed in the event
that he suggests material evidence about the disaster has been overlooked. Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated that he hopes to deliver his report shortly.




                                                                                             *

I sincerely hope that you take the time to read and digest the contents of this letter, as I
do not write it easily. My brother, Andrew Sefton, was killed at the Hillsborough
football disaster in 1989 and I am proud to say that I am a member o f the Hillsborough
Family Support Group and continue to fully participate in our group’s campaign.

On a personal level however, I have reached a point where I feel the need not only to
direct a series o f observations and questions towards you, but furthermore, demand
that discussion around these areas takes place, by those that are elected and paid to
serve us.

I will not dwell on the reservations that I have with regards to your choice of judge in
the present unprecedented scrutiny, for Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s crassness,
insensitivity, lack of personal contact with real people, his lack of understanding about
the case, and the inevitable questions that they raise both about his capacity to conduct
the scrutiny, and the reasons for your choice o f him, are self-evident to the nation as a
whole - rather I will simply direct my concerns, thoughts and questions to you Mr.
Straw, for you are the new Home Secretary with all the power, responsibility, high
profile and accountability that that position entails.

My concerns fall into two categories. The first are specific to Hillsborough and its
victims and the second are areas o f concern highlighted by the disaster, but with wider
relevance to every member of the public. Furthermore I would urge you to remember
that your response to this letter, these issues and most notably Lord Justice Stuart
Smith’s recommendations will send not only a message to the country about your
willingness to deal effectively with what I believe to be criminal acts specific to
Hillsborough, but also with the laws, procedures and attitudes currently in operation
that allowed these acts to remain unchecked, and in some cases, seemingly rewarded.

Firstly then, having met personally with Lord Justice Stuart Smith and heard and
experienced his interpretation o f the terms o f reference for the scrutiny - 1 feel
confident in saying that the terms o f reference are on the one hand so tight as to be
practically unworkable, demanding o f us as they do, the production o f new evidence
that has never been available to the police and/or the coroner, and yet completely
ignoring the fact that after 8 V2 years there is still evidence that no one outside these
two agencies has ever been given access to. Yet ironically, on the other hand, the
terms o f reference and Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s interpretation o f them are, I feel
exceedingly vague, claiming to want ‘to be advised o f anything that is deemed to be in
the public interest’, and yet when personally questioned on his understanding and
interpretations o f this, Lord Justice Stuart Smith was unable to give my family a
response, and indeed I would go so far as assuming based on my experience o f the man
that in his final recommendation, his interpretation o f the term “in the public interest”,
will bear no resemblance to my families informed interpretation o f the term!
Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly obvious that these terms o f reference
completely side-step the real complaints and concerns - they cannot effectively
highlight the issues for which I have campaigned, and I would bet that they are not
what the public believe the Hillsborough victims are getting, for they will neither bring
out the truth about the events before, during and after the disaster, or fully recognise
the urgent need for a full, honest, credible, public enquiry; for it would appear that the
lies, the corruption, the falsification o f evidence, the collusion, the convenient
promotions and retirements, the sickening police compensations, the failures o f the
inquest system and the High Court, the fact that the police have never formally
accepted any responsibility for their actions and the reality that most o f the victims died
after 3.15 p.m. and yet none o f the evidence after this time has ever been openly dealt
with, just happens to fall outside the terms o f reference for this scrutiny, - so what
exactly is it that is being scrutinised?

Having brought to your attention my concerns, specifically regarding the scrutiny, I
will now turn my attention to the questions that I feel are highlighted by Hillsborough -
concerns that need attention, discussion and reform, “in the public interest”.

1.     Why, when in cases like ours, families are deliberately prevented from having
       access to vital evidence, evidence is falsified, hidden or destroyed. As
       vulnerable lay people we are badly advised, misled and pathetically represented,
       bullied, ill informed and legally ground down, and the sheer time scale o f this
       deception means that we are prevented from gaining access to the European
       Judicial system - is there no cause for redress? If you do not examine these
       fundamental injustices, then the message you will be sending is that the Police,
       and the judicial system exist as entities beyond examination, reproach or
       change, think carefully M r Straw, if this is indeed the message o f the New
       Labour and New Britain then having lived with it as a reality for the last 814
       years, I am sure I can continue to do so, but having voted for massive change -
       can the public?

2.     Why, in a democratic system as sophisticated as ours, are the police still
       allowed to investigate themselves? The internal networks are too incestuous
       and binding to ever allow proper scrutiny - we all know this, it is insulting and
       outrageous, so when will it be addressed?

3.     Why, when in cases where the police have some alleged level o f involvement in
       a crime or in an act o f criminal negligence, are they allowed to monopolise and
       control the crime scene and indeed the access, quality and quantity o f the
       evidence given to the victims who ironically need to build any case against the
       police?
Why are the police officers who have been negligent, incompetent or, as we
believe in our case, criminal and corrupt, allowed to walk away with their
professional and personal lives unscathed? I believe Hillsborough was the
inevitable culmination o f all the powers and attitude bestowed upon our police
force by the Thatcher government, their actions leading up to Hillsborough,
during the disaster and since, all clearly show that they believe themselves to be
invincible, beyond prosecution and even beyond criticism. For 8 V2 years they
have publicly and privately laughed at my family and now they are laughing at
you and your office, - so what as Home Secretary are you going to do about it?

Why do we have a coroners system in this country that allows coroners to
select biased evidence, bury relevant statements, fail to disclose interests, insult,
bully and blame victims, mislead juries and still remain both employed and
respected. As a nation we are becoming increasingly aware o f the inadequacies
o f the coroners system, so how much longer are we going to have to live with
them before you act on our behalf?

Why do we have a state o f affairs in Britain that means that the more negligent,
inept and even criminal, individuals are in a situation the better it is for those
individuals and organisations involved - for the wider the responsibility net can
be spread the less chance there is o f internal disciplinary charges being brought,
never mind criminal prosecution. Thus it appears that the message from the
legal system in this country to all organisations and their employees is one o f
encouragement to negate their humanity and professionalism and if the worst
happens, the advice is keep denying responsibility and continually blame other
agencies and individuals, do this for long enough and the victims will simply go
away. Well, Mr Straw, my family and I will not go away - 1 believe that just
because the police, Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
the engineers who installed the barriers and the Football Association are
 allowed to blame each other for their contribution to the disaster and it’s
aftermath and walk away unscathed and with an air o f smug untouchability
 does not mean that I am unable to point the finger at the people that I feel to be
responsible - surely a judicial system as highly developed as ours can adapt to
 counteract this appalling loophole, or is the foundation o f a criminal charge o f
 ‘neglect o f duty’ totally beyond us?

Finally, I would draw your attention to the issue o f ‘Sleaze’; a huge impetus in
your recent general election success. The nation voted resoundingly in your
favour because they were sick o f the deception, corruption and the rewards
that apparently went with this - please remember that the Hillsborough
campaign presently has a large measure o f public support, simply because
people can smell the sleaze around Hillsborough, the lies and the injustice stink
and the majority o f people have realised that people like myself continue
against unbelievable hurdles specifically because no-one has ever been held
responsible for their actions, but more broadly because the inept procedures
and systems that M ed our family 8% ago are still in place ready to fail the next
     i
         set o f ‘disaster’ victims. Be assured M r Straw, until the issues that I have
         outlined in this letter are addressed, regardless o f the findings o f Lord Justice
         Stuart Smith’s scrutiny and regardless o f your response to these findings my
         family and I will continue to fight for our right to justice and police
         accountability and foil public disclosure on this matter by whatever means
         remain possible.

Yours sincerely




Julie Fallon

Dear Home Secretary,

I sincerely hope that you take the time to read and digest the contents o f this letter, as I
do not write it easily. My brother, Andrew Sefton, was killed at the Hillsborough
football disaster in 1989 and I am proud to say that I am a member o f the Hillsborough
Family Support Group and continue to fully participate in our group’s campaign.

On a personal level however, I have reached a point where I feel the need not only to
direct a series o f observations and questions towards you, but furthermore, demand
that discussion around these areas takes place, by those that are elected and paid to
serve us.

I will not dwell on the reservations that I have with regards to your choice o f judge in
the present unprecedented scrutiny, for Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s crassness,
insensitivity, lack o f personal contact with real people, his lack o f understanding about
the case, and the inevitable questions that they raise both about his capacity to conduct
the scrutiny, and the reasons for your choice o f him, are self-evident to the nation as a
whole - rather I will simply direct my concerns, thoughts and questions to you Mr.
Straw, for you are the new Home Secretary with all the power, responsibility, high
profile and accountability that that position entails.

My concerns fall into two categories. The first are specific to Hillsborough and its
victims and the second are areas o f concern highlighted by the disaster, but with wider
relevance to every member o f the public. Furthermore I would urge you to remember
that your response to this letter, these issues and most notably Lord Justice Stuart
Smith’s recommendations will send not only a message to the country about your
willingness to deal effectively with what I believe to be criminal acts specific to
Hillsborough, but also with the laws, procedures and attitudes currently in operation
that allowed these acts to remain unchecked, and in some cases, seemingly rewarded.

Firstly then, having met personally with Lord Justice Stuart Smith and heard and
experienced his interpretation o f the terms o f reference for the scrutiny - 1 feel
confident in saying that the terms o f reference are on the one hand so tight as to be
practically unworkable, demanding o f us as they do, the production of new evidence
that has never been available to the police and/or the coroner, and yet completely
ignoring the fact that after SV2 years there is still evidence that no one outside these
two agencies has ever been given access to. Yet ironically, on the other hand, the
terms o f reference and Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s interpretation o f them are, I feel
exceedingly vague, claiming to want ‘to be advised o f anything that is deemed to be in
the public interest’, and yet when personally questioned on his understanding and

response, and indeed I would go so far as assuming based on my experience o f the man
that in his final recommendation, his interpretation o f the term “in the public interest”,
will bear no resemblance to my families informed interpretation o f the term!
Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly obvious that these terms o f reference
completely side-step the real complaints and concerns - they cannot effectively
highlight the issues for which I have campaigned, and I would bet that they are not
what the public believe the Hillsborough victims are getting, for they will neither bring

the urgent need for a full, honest, credible, public enquiry; for it would appear that the
lies, the corruption, the falsification o f evidence, the collusion, the convenient
promotions and retirements, the sickening police compensations, the failures o f the
 inquest system and the High Court, the fact that the police have never formally
 accepted any responsibility for their actions and the reality that most o f the victims died
 after 3.15 p.m. and yet none o f the evidence after this time has ever been openly dealt
with, just happens to fall outside the terms o f reference for this scrutiny, - so what
 exactly is it that is being scrutinised?

Having brought to your attention my concerns, specifically regarding the scrutiny, I
will now turn my attention to the questions that I feel are highlighted by Hillsborough -
concerns that need attention, discussion and reform, “in the public interest”.

1.      Why, when in cases like ours, families are deliberately prevented from having
        access to vital evidence, evidence is falsified, hidden or destroyed. As
        vulnerable lay people we are badly advised, misled and pathetically represented,
        bullied, ill informed and legally ground down, and the sheer time scale o f this

        change, think carefully Mr Straw, if this is indeed the message o f the New
        Labour and New Britain then having lived with it as a reality for the last 8 V2
        years, I am sure I can continue to do so, but having voted for massive change -
        can the public?

 2.     Why, in a democratic system as sophisticated as ours, are the police still
        allowed to investigate themselves? The internal networks are too incestuous
        and binding to ever allow proper scrutiny - we all know this, it is insulting and
        outrageous, so when will it be addressed?

 3.     Why, when in cases where the police have some alleged level o f involvement in
        a crime or in an act o f criminal negligence, are they allowed to monopolise and
        control the crime scene and indeed the access, quality and quantity o f the
        evidence given to the victims who ironically need to build any case against the
        police?
Why are the police officers who have been negligent, incompetent or, as we

during the disaster and since, all clearly show that they believe themselves to be
invincible, beyond prosecution and even beyond criticism. For 8 V2 years they
have publicly and privately laughed at my family and now they are laughing at
you and your office, - so what as Home Secretary are you going to do about it?

Why do we have a coroners system in this country that allows coroners to
select biased evidence, bury relevant statements, fail to disclose interests, insult,
bully and blame victims, mislead juries and still remain both employed and
respected. As a nation we are becoming increasingly aware o f the inadequacies
o f the coroners system, so how much longer are we going to have to live with
them before you act on our behalf?

Why do we have a state o f affairs in Britain that means that the more negligent,
inept and even criminal, individuals are in a situation the better it is for those
individuals and organisations involved - for the wider the responsibility net can
be spread the less chance there is o f internal disciplinary charges being brought,
never mind criminal prosecution. Thus it appears that the message from the
legal system in this country to all organisations and their employees is one o f
encouragement to negate their humanity and professionalism and if the worst
happens, the advice is keep denying responsibility and continually blame other
agencies and individuals, do this for long enough and the victims wall simply go
away. Well, Mr Straw, my family and I will not go away - 1 believe that just
because the police, Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
the engineers who installed the barriers and the Football Association are
 allowed to blame each other for their contribution to the disaster and it’s
aftermath and walk away unscathed and with an air o f smug untouchability
 does not mean that I am unable to point the finger at the people that I feel to be
 responsible - surely a judicial system as highly developed as ours can adapt to
 counteract this appalling loophole, or is the foundation o f a criminal charge o f
 ‘neglect o f duty’ totally beyond us?

F inallyI would draw your attention to the issue o f ‘Sleaze’; a huge impetus in
your recent general election success. The nation voted resoundingly in your
favour because they were sick o f the deception, corruption and the rewards
that apparently went with this - please remember that the Hillsborough
campaign presently has a large measure o f public support, simply because
people can smell the sleaze around Hillsborough, the lies and the injustice stink
and the majority o f people have realised that people like myself continue
against unbelievable hurdles specifically because no-one has ever been held
responsible for their actions, but more broadly because the inept procedures
and systems that failed our family 8 V2 ago are still in place ready to fail the next
       set o f ‘disaster’ victims. Be assured Mr Straw, until the issues that I have
       outlined in this letter are addressed, regardless o f the findings o f Lord Justice
       Stuart Smith’s scrutiny and regardless o f your response to these findings my
       family and I will continue to fight for our right to justice and police
       accountability and fuU public disclosure on this matter by whatever means
       remain possible.

Yours sincerely

Dear Home Secretary,

I sincerely hope that you take the time to read and digest the contents o f this letter, as I
do not write it easily. My brother, Andrew Sefton, was killed at the Hillsborough
football disaster in 1989 and I am proud to say that I am a member o f the Hillsborough
Family Support Group and continue to fully participate in our group’s campaign.

On a personal level however, I have reached a point where I feel the need not only to
direct a series of observations and questions towards you, but furthermore, demand
that discussion around these areas takes place, by those that are elected and paid to
serve us.

I will not dwell on the reservations that I have with regards to your choice o f judge in
the present unprecedented scrutiny, for Lord Justice Stuart Smith s crassness,
insensitivity, lack o f personal contact with real people, his lack o f understanding about
the case, and the inevitable questions that they raise both about his capacity to conduct
the scrutiny, and the reasons for your choice of him, are self-evident to the nation as a
whole - rather I will simply direct my concerns, thoughts and questions to you Mr.
 Straw, for you are the new Home Secretary with all the power, responsibility, high
 profile and accountability that that position entails.

My concerns fall into two categories. The first are specific to Hillsborough and its
victims and the second are areas o f concern highlighted by the disaster, but with wider
relevance to every member o f the public. Furthermore I would urge you to remember
that your response to this letter, these issues and most notably Lord Justice Stuart
Smith’s recommendations will send not only a message to the country about your
willingness to deal effectively with what I believe to be criminal acts specific to
Hillsborough, but also with the laws, procedures and attitudes currently in operation
that allowed these acts to remain unchecked, and in some cases, seemingly rewarded.

 Firstly then, having met personally with Lord Justice Stuart Smith and heard and
 experienced his interpretation o f the terms o f reference for the scrutiny - 1 feel
 confident in saying that the terms o f reference are on the one hand so tight as to be
 practically unworkable, demanding o f us as they do, the production o f new evidence
 that has never been available to the police and/or the coroner, and yet completely
 ignoring the fact that after 8 V2 years there is still evidence that no one outside these
 two agencies has ever been given access to. Yet ironically, on the other hand, the
 terms of reference and Lord Justice Stuart Smith’s interpretation of them are, I feel
 exceedingly vague, claiming to want ‘to be advised of anything that is deemed to be in
the public interest’, and yet when personally questioned on his understanding and
interpretations o f this, Lord Justice Stuart Smith was unable to give my family a
response, and indeed I would go so far as assuming based on my experience o f the man
that in his final recommendation, his interpretation o f the term “in the public interest”,
will bear no resemblance to my families informed interpretation of the term!
Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly obvious that these terms of reference
completely side-step the real complaints and concerns - they cannot effectively
highlight the issues for which I have campaigned, and I would bet that they are not
what the public believe the Hillsborough victims are getting, for they will neither bring
out the truth about the events before, during and after the disaster, or fully recognise
the urgent need for a full, honest, credible, public enquiry; for it would appear that the
lies, the corruption, the falsification of evidence, the collusion, the convenient
promotions and retirements, the sickening police compensations, the failures o f the
inquest system and the High Court, the fact that the police have never formally
accepted any responsibility for their actions and the reality that most o f the victims died
after 3.15 p.m. and yet none of the evidence after this time has ever been openly dealt
with, just happens to fall outside the terms o f reference for this scrutiny, - so what
 exactly is it that is being scrutinised?

Having brought to your attention my concerns, specifically regarding the scrutiny, I
will now turn my attention to the questions that I feel are highlighted by Hillsborough -
concerns that need attention, discussion and reform, “in the public interest”.

1.      Why, when in cases like ours, families are deliberately prevented from having
        access to vital evidence, evidence is falsified, hidden or destroyed. As
        vulnerable lay people we are badly advised, misled and pathetically represented,
        bullied, ill informed and legally ground down, and the sheer time scale of this
        deception means that we are prevented from gaining access to the European
        Judicial system - is there no cause for redress? If you do not examine these
        fundamental injustices, then the message you will be sending is that the Police,
        and the judicial system exist as entities beyond examination, reproach or
        change, think carefully M r Straw, if this is indeed the message o f the New
        Labour and New Britain then having lived with it as a reality for the last 8 V2
        years, I am sure I can continue to do so, but having voted for massive change -
        can the public?

2.      Why, in a democratic system as sophisticated as ours, are the police still
        allowed to investigate themselves? The internal networks are too incestuous
        and binding to ever allow proper scrutiny - we all know this, it is insulting and
        outrageous, so when will it be addressed?

 3.     Why, when in cases where the police have some alleged level of involvement in
        a crime or in an act of criminal negligence, are they allowed to monopolise and
        control the crime scene and indeed the access, quality and quantity o f the
        evidence given to the victims who ironically need to build any case against the
        police?
Why are the police officers who have been negligent, incompetent or, as we
believe in our case, criminal and corrupt, allowed to walk away with their
professional and personal lives unscathed? I believe Hillsborough was the
inevitable culmination o f all the powers and attitude bestowed upon our police
force by the Thatcher government, their actions leading up to Hillsborough,
during the disaster and since, all clearly show that they believe themselves to be
invincible, beyond prosecution and even beyond criticism. For 8 V2 years they
have publicly and privately laughed at my family and now they are laughing at
you and your office, - so what as Home Secretary are you going to do about it?

Why do we have a coroners system in this country that allows coroners to
select biased evidence, bury relevant statements, fail to disclose interests, insult,
bully and blame victims, mislead juries and still remain both employed and
respected. As a nation we are becoming increasingly aware of the inadequacies
of the coroners system, so how much longer are we going to have to live with
them before you act on our behalf?

Why do we have a state o f affairs in Britain that means that the more negligent,
inept and even criminal, individuals are in a situation the better it is for those
individuals and organisations involved - for the wider the responsibility net can
be spread the less chance there is o f internal disciplinary charges being brought,
never mind criminal prosecution. Thus it appears that the message from the
legal system in this country to all organisations and their employees is one of
 encouragement to negate their humanity and professionalism and if the worst
happens, the advice is keep denying responsibility and continually blame other
 agencies and individuals, do this for long enough and the victims will simply go
 away. Well, Mr Straw, my family and I will not go away - 1 believe that just
 because the police, Sheffield City Council, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
 the engineers who installed the barriers and the Football Association are
 allowed to blame each other for their contribution to the disaster and it’s
 aftermath and walk away unscathed and with an air o f smug untouchability
 does not mean that I am unable to point the finger at the people that I feel to be
 responsible - surely a judicial system as highly developed as ours can adapt to
  counteract this appalling loophole, or is the foundation o f a criminal charge of
  ‘neglect of duty’ totally beyond us?

 Finally, I would draw your attention to the issue o f ‘Sleaze’; a huge impetus in
 your recent general election success. The nation voted resoundingly in your
 favour because they were sick o f the deception, corruption and the rewards
 that apparently went with this - please remember that the Hillsborough
 campaign presently has a large measure o f public support, simply because
 people can smell the sleaze around Hillsborough, the lies and the injustice stink
 and the majority o f people have realised that people like myself continue
 against unbelievable hurdles specifically because no-one has ever been held
  responsible for their actions, but more broadly because the inept procedures
  and systems that failed our family 8 V2 ago are still in place ready to fail the next

       remain possible.

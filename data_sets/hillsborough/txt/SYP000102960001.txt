               At 08.00 hrs on Saturday the 15th April 1989 I reported and corranenced duty at Rawrnai
            Police Station where I was subsequently transported via coach to Hillsboroug
            ground. At approximately 09.30 hrs that date I assumed duties as a member of Serial x
            53, under supervision of P.S BOWN and Insp. CHARLES.      We were subsequently briefed re
            the days events. A meal was then taken at approximately 10.00 hrs.
               At 11.00 hrs that date I attended with my serial on H e m e s Road whereupon we were
            deployed on foot to supervise the unloading of Nottingham Forest Supporters J^om coi*
            at this location. A large number of supporters had been drinking at that time,
            not encounter any serious public order problems at this time. However 1^ g e ^         s
            supporters immediately ran to the side of the road after alighting from the coaches i,
            order to urinate. I was also obliged to turn back a number of Liverpool supporters w
            were heading in the direction of the Notts Forest area of the ground, or had cans o
            alcohol. Those with alcohol were advised accordingly. Again no trouble was encoun
            this tine and the general mood of the crowds was good.
                At 14.55 hrs that date the area of Herries Road wasclear of Supporters and we we
             instructed to head in the direction of Claywheels Lane re collection of Meal.
                At 15.00 hrs that date while on route to Claywheels Lane a radio message was receiv
             for us to attend the Leppings Lane entrance of the ground. On arrival we were line
             into respective serials. At this time I was under the impression thattrouble was be
             experienced within the ground re fighting.                                  . .,
                At approximately 15.05 hrs I received an order to attend immediately inside h g
             and ebtered via the Leppings Lane entrance. No further instructions were receive a
             this point. I then entered via the main entrance and made my way towards the courty
             Once inside I was confronted by a hostile and emotional crowd, shouting and screaming
             words such as "MURDERING BASTARDS »,"THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT , and IT S A FUCKING D L
             I then rushed through the crowd towards the tunnel entrance to the stand. At this
             saw several casualties laid in the concrete floor. Some appeared injured, others apj
             dead. Most were receiving mouth to mouth resuscitation which was being administered
             both civilian and police personnel. The crowd at the tunnel entrance was still compc
             and was extremely hostile and it took every effort to push past them, enterthe tunn
             head towards the terracing. At this point the crowd was still hostile and wer p _
             hittting us as we attempted to get by. At this time I was still unaware of the gravii
              situation. On pushing my way through the tunnel and on entering the terracing there
              still a considerable crowd inside. On pushing through and into the crowd towards th
              area in pen 3 I saw the first of many persons lying on the floor. I assisted i n c ^
              one person, apparently dead, towards the tunnel. Other offerers then carried thebo<
              the rest of the way into the tunnel, and I returned to the stand in the areaof pen
              Throughout this period I was spat at a number of times and punched and jostled by
              supporters. At one point whilst in pen 3 I became enclosed by support.ers w h o appear
              both hysterical and angry. I attempted to push past them but was unable to do so an
              £ d t o r e ? S n to the top^f the stand at a position adjacent to the tunnel midway be
              pen 3 and 4. I then heard a man shout to me and on turning and lroking down ^ t o pe
              heard the man say "HELP HIM HE'S FUCKING DYING." The man was knealt on the floor wit
              another unconscious male.On approaching the man and assissting in carrying      him l
              obvious to me that he was dead, and with the help ofothers I carried him to the tun
              entrance whereupon other persons/ officers took hold of him.         en re
              At this time I was still unaware of the number of dead. As I reached the bottom of
               terrace I was still obliged to push past large numbers of people who aPP^red either
              hysterical, angry or in shock. As I pushed past them I saw whatappearedtobe larg
               of bodies, the majority being to my right in pen 3. At the same time I saw a
               near to and almost upon a number of bodies in pen 4. He appeared completelyhystera
               and was waving his arms and unintentionally striking a female Police Of ficerwhowas
               attempting to calm him down. I grabbed the man around the neck and pulled himdown j
               a struggle to avoid the other officer being assaulted. The man eventually got up <
               left the area . I then assisted with bodies laid upon the floor at this location
               picking them up and laying them on the pitch itself. Access to the pitch was gam e
               walking through a small gate at this time. M* next recollection is °f              °f‘

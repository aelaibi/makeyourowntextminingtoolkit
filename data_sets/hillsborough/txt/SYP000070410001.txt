The     time    would        now    be a b o u t          2.33pm       U t4 35).       I do     remember               a    few       of       the

Liverpool         players          were       on     th              . warming         up.      At       t ha t     time

everything           appeared           normal        and       I was     not      crushed      at all            at       that       st a g e,

although         it w a s        crowded.            The    f a ns     were     chanting        as       they       normally

would     be.        Within        a few minutes                 I di d      notice      that       the     crowd           started              to

sway     a n d we      were       being       thrown around               in t h e     pen.         At    that         time          1

thought        that       once     the m a t c h          had    started        people       would        stop         and

concentrate            on    the    game        and       1 was      also     thinking        t h at       I might              not       ge t       *

good     view     of t h e        game       but     I was       not    w o rr ied about            the     c r o w d as             it was

only marginally                  worse       than     I have         experienced.

At    about      2.50pm          {1450)        I can       remember          there     were     a    lot       of      people

clapping         and      I joined            in.     I saw       two     lads       in a g r o u p        near        me       at       one

s t a g e , but      as     the    crowd        swayed          I lost       sight     of    them.          They were                    close

e n o u g h at    one       time    for        us    to    say    hello       to     each    ot h e r .        They a r e                not

close      friends          so    the     c o nversation went                 no     further.            They were               Gary

   out       onto        the     f i e l d a nd t h e r e           was       a    large       surge             forward which                   carried

   me    forward           towards              the    pitch and              1 stopped              about            half       way       down    the

   pen,            X expected           the       pressure              to    release           like         in n o r m a l         surges         but       it

   didn't           and     it j u s t          built       up.         I then          started             to    get       frightened             and       I

   was        finding          it v e r y        hard       to     breathe.                 Somebody             in f r o n t       of me         put

   climbing              the        fencing.          As    I said,           I was          finding             it    increasingly

couldn't;          cross       the     half       way       line,        so    I asked             him w here          I could             get       a

drink.         He     pointed          over       towards           t he      South Stand.                   I walked            over       to       the

South        Stand       and     1 was       able         to     step      over      from          the     field       into       the       s t a nd ,

  I asked          some     of     the      supporters              for       a drink             but    they      didn't         seem        too

concerned,            probably           not       realising             what       was       going        on.      Eventually,                  I

saw a steward who                     I then asked                 for     a drink            and       I think        he     replied,

Have     you       got    any money?"                 I     didn't         realise            I did        so    I said          "No".

Anyway        I d i d n ’t get           a drink            from       the S t e w a r d           but     eventually             X found a

  When           I said a S t e w a r d             asked       me    if    I had any           money,         the      fact       is    that £

  the           time       he w a s     talking          to a     couple         of    other        blokes.          The      words,          "Hav

  you           got       any money"          were       said     but      as    I glanced away                it m a y       have       been

  one           of    the      others        that       said    it.        Although          I think         it was          the    steward,

      I would             also     like      to a d d      that      before       we    arrived           in S h e f f i e l d ,        not    lot

  after              we    left     the m o t o r w a y ,       the     police         stopped         the     coach and a s ke d               tc

      see       our       tickets,          after       w h e n we w e r e       allowed         to    continue.

      I will          also add          that       X have       related          events        as     they     happened and                  have

      told       t h e m as        best      as     I can.        These         times       may well         be     slightly

      inaccurate.

Liverpool           players          were        on    the      field warming                  up.        At       that       t i me

concentrate              on    the     game       and        I was        also        thinking         that         I might               not       get

good       view     of      the     game        but    1 was           not     worried         about          the     crowd           as       it was

    didn't          and    it j u s t          built       up.        I then          started              to    get       frightened             and       i

    was     finding            it    very       hard       to    breathe.                 Somebody              in f r o nt       of       me    put

    their       arms       up       in the          air    and      into        my    face           which       made       it w o r s e .

    shortly afterwards                         I saw       the      gate        open.           I.    cannot          sa y w h o          opened       the

            I am writing to follow up a point you made during the Liverpool City Council
            Hillsborough Disaster Wording Party meeting at Liverpool Town Hall on Fridav
            27 February.                                                                 y

            You will recall that you asked me why an advance copy of Lord Justice
            Stuart-Smith’s report was sent to the Chief Officer of South Yorkshire Police.
           Inadvertently, I may have misled you and therefore I would like to Dut the
           record straight.

            Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s terms of reference required him to ascertain
            whether there was any evidence relating to the disaster which had not been
            available to the Taylor Inquiry, the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Chief
           Officer of the South Yorkshire Police. Home Office officials have advised me
           that it was in his capacity as the disciplinary authority that a copy of Lord
           Justice Stuart-Smith’s report was sent in advance to the Chief Constable of
           the South Yorkshire Police.

           I hope this is helpful. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require anv
           further information.                                                          y

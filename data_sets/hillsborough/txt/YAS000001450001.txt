TREVOR LEWIS DALE           Date of birth 2nd August 1947.                                        States


1.   I    am   employed        by    SYMAS                   as     Divisional               Superintendent
     Operations         working      from                Parkway              Ambulance           Station        and
     responsible for the Sheffield and Rotherham area.                                                      I have
     held      this     post   for     2       years.                      However       I    have     18    years
     experience in total beginning with Sheffield City Ambulance
     Service and then with SYMAS after the reorganisation of the
     Metropolitan Districts in 1974.                                   I began as an Ambulanceman
     in 1971      and later became leading Ambulanceman at Batemoor
     Station.          I was then promoted to Station Officer at Maltby
^    and subsequently          transferred to Parkway.                                   I held the post of
™    Station     Officer       for   approximately                           18 months            before     being
     promoted to Divisional Superintendent Operation.


2.   Apart     from the Miller Certificate my other qualifications
     relate      to    Management         and            I    hold           the    certificate             of   the
     Institute of Supervisory Management.


3.   My duties are to          manage the Parkway Ambulance Station, which
     is    the    biggest      in    South               Yorkshire,                and       to    oversee       the
     provision         of   manpower        for          all         7      Sheffield          and     Rotherham
     station.


     I work on a 12 week rota which gives cover from 0600 to
     2400.       I am required to work two weekends in every 12 weeks.
     On Saturday the 15th April 1989                                       I was scheduled to be on
     duty from 0800 to 1630 as Duty Officer.                                        The Duty Officer is
     a    kind    of    troubleshooter                   whose              lob .it       is      to   sort      out

     problems and fill jLar'.fog- absent                                                  I had the use of
                               A
     a staff car to enable me to attend wherever assistance was
     required.


5.   During the week prior to the 15th April I had worked normal
     shifts and had taken Monday,                             Tuesday and Wednesday off in
     lieu of the weekend.


                                                                      W3
 6.   On the Saturday morning I arrived at the Station at 0800 and
       attended to my administrative work and read the log.                                         There
       was    not   a        lot    to     be done       at    the    Station          so   I drove      to
       control Headquarters at Heatherclose Rotherham to see what
       extra cover was being laid on in view of the football match.
       I already knew that there were two extra crews on duty and
       two officers attending at the match.


 7.   Later I drove around Sheffield to call at all local stations
       close to Hillsborough football ground.                                I was in the region
 ^    of   the ground              until    about       1450 when        I parked on Halifax
 ^    Road,    about         half        a mile     from       the    stadium,         to   watch     the
       crowds.           I    noticed        that       there     were       a    large      number      of
       Liverpool Supporters trying to park.                             I had no specific task
       at this stage but was simply making myself available for any
       contingency which might arise.


 8.    Towards 1500            I knew the match would be starting and assumed
       there would            be no trouble once the game was under way.                                  I
       therefore began to make my way back to Parkway Ambulance
       Station      on       the    other        side    of    town.         On    the      way   back    I
       intended to call in on one of my staff who had retired after
       illness      and        as     a     result       of    this     detour         I    was in    the
^ppi^^Frenchvi 1 le           area        when    I -^preheard          on       the    radio control
       responding to calls from Alpha's 3 and 4.                                  I knew that these
       were   the       call        signs    of    the        liaison    Officers           inside    the
      * Hillsborough ground.                     I could not hear both sides of the
       conversation       since , all* .drivers are able to pick up is
                            CU\0( fc&2- KZcflbec ^ *
       control      speaking,              cannot receive messages going into
       control from other drivers.                       Nevertheless there seemed to be
       a lot of contact from Alpha 3 and Alpha 4 so I guessed there
       must be something wrong.                         I therefore turned back towards
       the ground as a precaution.                       I did not look at the time.




                                                                Mi*
    9.    I    had    also       turned    on     Radio      Sheffield       and    I   heard    the
          commentator announce that the game had been stopped.                              When I
          heard this I radioed control for information.                              They told me
          there had been some sort of incident but they did not have
          any further information.                  As soon as I heard this I drove as
          quickly as possible to Hillsborough using the blue flashing
          light and siren.                On the way I continued to listen to the
          radio and heard the controller say something about Leppings
          Lane and the words "you want them at Penistone Road then".
          From       this    I    understood        that      there    was     an    incident     at
          Leppings Lane end but that Ambulances were being requested
          at the Penistone Road entrance.                      There was no contradiction
^         in this because I am familiar with the ground and knew that
          the Penistone Road gate was the only access                                for vehicles
          onto the pitch.


    10.   I was aware of a contingency plan relating specifically to
          the Hillsborough ground.                  Mr Eason and Mr Higgins regularly
          attend at matches and Mr Eason had drawn up this plan in
          liaison with the Police.                   It was not part of my duties to
          know this plan thoroughly or to be specially trained for it.
          But    I was       aware    that      a   plan     existed     and       I knew   of   the
          entrances and exits to the ground.


          At    some        stage    on    my     way   to    Hillsborough          I   heard    the
          controller order all crews to switch to ERC channel and I
          obeyed this instruction.


12.       I went straight to the Penistone Road end, approaching along
          Herries Road and turning left onto the Penistone Road dual
          carriageway.            I did a u-turn across a gap in the reservation
          and approached the gate next to turnstile 77-88, below the
          main Police access.               I parked the staff car on the central
          reservation.              I do    not     remember     what    time       I arrived     or
          whether I confirmed my arrival to control in the normal way.
          The radio may have been busy.


                                                               116
    13.   I left the car and saw Mr Eason standing In the middle of
          the road looking for Ambulances.                       I asked him how bad It was
          and he said there were about 9 fatalities.                                  He also said
          Deputy      Chief     Ambulance            Officer         Hopkins        and    Assistant
          Divisional        Officer     for     Support          Services       Morley       had     just
          arrived and gone into the ground.


    14.   Gate 77-88 leads into a yard in the corner between North
          stand and Spion Cop.               There were three Ambulances already in
          this yard when I arrived and space was cramped. Mr Eason was
_         directing Ambulances to reverse in because there was no room
          to turn round.         A maximum of 4 Ambulances could park in this
          yard.


    15.   Mr Eason explained to me that they were backing Ambulances
          into the yard to load from this point and asked me to take
          over his place.             He left me in the road waiting to receive
          Ambulances.        There was no traffic at this stage because the
          Police were diverting it up Herries Road South.                                 I also kept
          an eye on the Ambulances already in the yard and supervised
          some of the loadings.


16.       Soon after        I arrived        I saw an Ambulance approaching with
          blue    lights      flashing         and    thought         it      was   attending           the
          ground.     It was stuck in traffic on Penistone Road above the
          diversion and        I ran up to a Policeman in the street and
          asked him to do something about the traffic because I needed
          Ambulances down at gate 77-88 as a priority.                                I then ran up
          to the Ambulance and said to the crew "come on.                                    Get down
          here".     They said they already had a patient on board and I
          assumed     they    had      picked    up       a   casualty         from    the      ground,
          although I later found out this was an urgent admission to
          Northern      General        Hospital           which      was      unrelated         to      the
          incident     at    the      match.         The      Ambulance        moved      off    and      I
          returned to the gate.

17.   The     next    thing    I    remember      is       that      more    Ambulances      were
      arriving       and    I asked       them   to queue            in the     road while      I
      cleared the Ambulances which were already loading from the
      yard.      There were still three Ambulances in the yard, two of
      which were parked side by side with their backs towards the
      ramp which leads onto the pitch and the third was parked
      between them and the gate.                  I found that the Ambulance in
      front of the gate had been left by its crew without any keys
      and it was blocking the exit so that one of the Ambulances
      behind it could not get out.                     I therefore noted the fleet
^     number of the vehicle and its call sign and went into the
      gym to       look     for the crew.         I knew that                the gym was the
      designated casualty clearing area and therefore assumed all
      the injured were being taken there.                             The first thing that
      struck me in the gym was the number of bodies on the floor.
      The next       impression was the difficulty I had in locating
      Ambulancemen because both Ambulance Personnel and the Police
                                   H- \ f ' 3'AC££f3. *
      were wearing blue shirts and flat nnp~ and it was difficult
      to    tell     them    apart.        However         I    knew    which    station      the
      abandoned vehicle was               from and by looking                  for staff     from
      that       station I managed to find the driver fairly quickly.                           I
      sent       him back straight away to move his vehicle. I think it
      was                          from   Longley Station.                  It was unusual for
^     a driver to          leave his vehicle because the                      major accident
      plan requires every driver to remain with his Ambulance and
      I    had   myself      been     repeating        this          instruction      to   crews
      arriving at the gate.


18.   While I was in the gym Mr Hopkins saw me and                            asked me to get
      the    major     accident       vehicle         to       the    ground     as   soon     as
      possible.        When    I came out        of    the gym          I     tried to radio
      control on my hand set using ERC channel but I could not get
      any response.           The hand set appeared not to be working at
      all, although          I had no idea what was wrong with it.                         It was
      definitely switched on to the right channel.                                I therefore



                                                  119
      set out back to the staff car to use the radio.                    As I got
      back into the yard I noticed the Ambulance which had been
      first in the queue to back in for loading had driven off and
      was just turning in Vere Road.           I said to a nearby Policeman
       "where's he going" and he replied that he had sent them to
      Leppings Lane end.         I did not stop at that point to discuss
      why but went straight to the staff car and called control on
      the car radio.


19. I think I got through to control but I could not understand
      their reply because there was so much static on the set.                   I
_     did not look at the time.         I was straining to hear what they
™     said.     I asked for the Major Accident Vehicle to attend,
      repeating this request a number of times.              I then said "I'm
      not receiving you, I'm going back on the domestic channel".
      But     I found the domestic channel was very busy and I was
      forced to switch back to ERC.


20. While I was trying to get through, Mr Eason came over to me
      and asked me to pass on a further message to control.                      I
      cannot remember what it was about.             I said I would do so if
      I could only get through but I could not tell through the
      crackling whether they were answering me or someone else.                  I
      told Mr Eason that I was trying to get hold of the Major
^     Incident Vehicle and he said "it's OK.            The vehicles on its
      way.     Somebody's already been in touch".


21.   In between the static I heard control calling my call sign,
      Alpha    2,   and    understood   he   was   asking   me   the   number   of
      fatalities.         From what I had seen in the gym I said "about
      30".


22.   I then left the staff car to return to the gate and remember
      a Policeman shouting "right lads - dogs out".                    There were
      crowds of people and the dogs were very excited.                   I recall
      noticing an Ambulance going into the main Police access and



                                             liq
      assumed        he     had    been instructed       to   use       that    gate by      the
      Police.        Mr Eason was with me and I said "I'm going to                           see
      whats happening down there".                I found there were quite a few
      Ambulances parked in the yard at the side of the gym and
      also Police minibuses.                 Having taken a look I ran back down
      to Mr Eason because I               had no means of speaking to him except
      direct.            Even if my hand set had been working it is                          not
      capable       of    three way       conversations       so    that       you   can only
      communicate with control                and not with other Officers.                     I
      told him       I would          stay down at the main Police access to
      supervise this other loading area because the Police were
      sending Ambulances in without any real method.                            It struck me
      it would be better to be sending the Ambulances in one gate
      and out through the other but this was not practical because
      it would have taken to long to clear the Ambulances already
      parked in the yard by turnstiles 77-88 and there was also a
      Police riot van parked up between the North stand and the
      houses opposite which was blocking the way.                              On the map it
      does not appear as if there is room to drive past the ramp
      entering the North stand but in fact if is possible to drive
      under the stand.                In any case it was impossible to stop the
      many    spectators              from    loading    injured         fans        into   the
      Ambulances         wh±ie— these --vehicles         and— the        Poitee— van— were
      mannsu^QroH— ©u-t— ©f— the" way.             The Police driver could have
      been anywhere.


23.   After    this       I stayed       in the gym yard           by    the    main    Police
      access.       Ambulancemen were loading casualties all around and
      there were also many people sitting about in shock.                                   The
      same fan who was wanting to get to Hallamshire Hospital came
      up to me again.             I don't know what happened to him.                   Perhaps
      someone took him with them in the end.


24.   The    next        thing    I    remember   was    a    call       for     stretchers.
      Attendants were taking cots from the Ambulances with them
      into    the    ground.           I remember   a    group      of     Liverpool        fans



                                                   120
            carrying a young lad on a hording and they wanted to load
            him directly into the Ambulance on this board.                       I stopped
            them and moved the boy onto a stretcher which I then loaded
            into    the    Ambulance,        I think with    the assistance       of ____
                         from Middlewood.       The boy was not breathing.          I went
            to the front of the vehicle to fetch a bag and mask and when
            I turned round                        had already put in an airway.          I
            pulled his chin back and started resuscitation and the bag
            worked well.                           gave him cardiac massage and I
            continued inflations from the resuscitator.                 I knew the boy
            would need two attendants on his way to hospital and it was
            not possible for me to stay with him because I was needed in
            the gym yard.         I said to a nearby Policeman "can you drive-
                on second thoughts can you do CPR" (i.e. resuscitation)                 He
            said    he    could   so   I told     the   driver   to   get   in   and
            i            took   over my       job while    the Policeman     carried    on v~o \t h
CAtov eve   massage.       I told then to get to the Northern General which
            was the nearest hospital and I knew they would not have to
            cross any traffic.          They also had Police outriders.            I don't
            know who the boy was or what happened to him.


     25.    I then noticed walking wounded were being loaded into two
            Police personnel carriers parked in the yard.


            In the back of         another Ambulance         I saw a man with chest
            injuries struggling to breath.                 Someone was about to load
            another casualty on a stretcher next to him.                    I could not
            see the driver of the vehicle and there were no keys in the
            ignition.       It is policy to take keys away if a vehicle is
            left to avoid theft.             I asked whose vehicle it was and was
            told                         [     I went into the gym to look for him
            and found him administering a drip.               He said the driver was
                                also of Middlewood, and I went straight out to
            find him.      As I left the gym Mr Hopkins shouted at me to get
            some more body bags.             When I got back to the Ambulance the
            driver was already there and appeared to have been in the



                                                    12.1
      vicinity all the time.              I asked him if he would be alright
      with the two patients and he said "yes".                             I therefore asked
      a Policeman to drive the Ambulance while the driver remained
      in the back with the patients.                         The Ambulance left with a
      Police escort.


27.   It   was    typical       for    attendants not            to    return      to    their
      vehicles         after    they    had   gone into              the    ground      or   the
      gymnasium.         They    were    detained to            attend      to   casualties,
      'especially if they had madicai training.                                                for
      example was a paramedic.


      Next I carried out Mr Hopkin's instruction to request more
      body bags.         I cannot remember how I got back in touch with
      control, but I think I may have gone back to the staff car,
      because      I   remember       going   between          two    loading      areas.        I
      managed to speak to control and through the static I pieced
      together their reply             from which I understood that a West
      Yorkshire Vehicle was on the way with more equipment.


29.   After this time flew and I never looked at my watch.                                   Many
      casualties were being brought out by groups of supporters
      over whom we had no control.                  The major incident plan for
      Hillsborough specifies that the gym should be the casualty
^     clearing post and I assumed that those casualties who were
      being taken into the gym were being assessed by doctors or
      paramedics in there.             However because of the involvement of
      so many supporters many injured were being loaded straight
      into    Ambulances         with     the      Ambulance           crews      to    assess
      priorities.         I noticed that the doors to the gym were too
      narrow - you could only get one person through at a time.


30.   Other      vehicles      continued      to    arrive       and       in    each   case    I
      instructed Attendants to take stretchers in while the driver
      remained with the vehicle.              The operation seemed pretty well
      organised because more crews were available and the number



                                                   122   -
         of casualties coming out of the ground gradually reduced.


31   .   The next thing I remember is seeing                                          loading a
         12    seater Ambulance which we call a                       "Goldfish bowl"        with
         walking wounded.            I said to him "is it full - are you sure?"
         and when he insisted it was                  I told him to drive off.                  I
         do n 't know where he went.                 At some stage I had received a
         message from one of the crews that Northern General Hospital
         was reaching capacity and so I had been generally saying to
         crews     that   they        should      start     taking     casualties       to    the
         Hallamshire.


         By this time the two Police hire buses had left and had been
         re p laced      by    Ambulances          with     drivers       waiting.           Most
         casualties had been moved by now with the remainder being
         stabilised in the gym.


33.      I went back into the yard by the turnstile 77-88 and saw the
         West Yorkshire Major Accident Vehicle arriving.                              Mr Jones
         was     there    and        had    been     coordinating         the    arrival       of
         Ambulances at this gate, which he had instructed to queue up
         in the road outside.               Station Officer                     Iand I helped
         the driver to off load the body bags and found there were
         only about a dozen.               I took them into the gym and I think it
         was then Mr Hopkins asked me to check if there were any more
         walking wounded on the field.


34.      I went down to the end of the ramp and looked across the
         field.       There      were       still     lots       of   people     in    the    Kop
         applauding in a good natured way - as though clapping the
         efforts of the helpers - they were not shouting.                            There were
         Police    with       dogs    on    the    field    in    front   of    the Kop.        I
         scanned    the       field     quickly      but     could     not     see    any    more
         wounded.         I     don't       recall    noticing         the     Police       line.
         Everything had now calmed down.                     I went back into the gym
         and Mr Hopkins said he only need six Ambulances from then on



                                                      IZ3
and the others should stand by at Herrles Road bus station.
I took this message to Mr Jones,                         who was still lining up
Ambulances In Penistone Road.                      He In turn asked me to take
two Ambulances round to the Leppings Lane end to collect 11
bodies and bring them back to the gym.                       Until then I had not
been aware that patients had been collected from this end of
the ground and presumed these bodies had been brought out
from    the    back    having      died   at       the    fence.     The     first     two
vehicles        in    the    queue     were         from     West    Yorkshire         and
Nottinghamshire.            Travelling on the footplate next to the
driver      I directed       them    to     the     roundabout       at    the   end      of
Penistone Road and we turned left into Leppings Lane (Vere
Road is fenced off during match days).                           When we arrived at
gate C, Leppings Lane was beginning to clear.                                I did not
pay    much     attention         because      I    had    not     known    about      any
possibility of an incident outside the ground at this end.
There were still people around but there did not appear to
be any casualties and I did not see any bodies.                              There was
already       an Ambulance at gate                 C with its crew and Station
Officer       Higgins.      He asked why we had come and said he had
already been sent to collect the bodies and that the job was
complete.        There      was    nothing         further    for me       to do     so    I
returned to Penistone Road end with the two vehicles.


When I got back to the Penistone Lane end I was instructed
either by Mr Hopkins or Mr Jones to go up to Herries Road
bus    station to organise the Ambulances waiting                           there.         I
took the staff car and informed control on ERC channel where
I was going.          There was still interference but I made out
their reply that Alpha 4 (Mr Eason) was already there.                                     I
therefore said I would not leave the ground and went back to
Mr Jones or Mr Hopkins and said there was no need for me to
go.     I     went    into the gym to              see if I could help and Mr
Hopkins       ordered me to take            MrHiggins to the City Mortuary
(the Medico Legal Centre) to warn them to prepare for 80 to
90 bodies.
36. We     took    the       staff      car    and the     traffic        was    appalling.
      Nothing was moving in either direction anywhere around the
      ground      and we made our way through between                          the    lines   of
      traffic using the flashing lights.                   On the way to the Medico
      Legal Centre a young boy on a bike rode into the front of
      the staff car opposite Hillsborough Park.                            Fortunately he
      was not hurt and the              bike was also not damaged.                   We dusted
      him down and followed             him home on his bike to Harrison Road,
      Hillsborough.           We informed the control of this detour and on
      this occasion the ERC channel worked perfectly well.                                    We
      left the boy with his mother and continued to the Medico
^     Legal Centre.


37.   On   arrival      we    founda    number     of      Policemen           and    mortuary
      attendants        and    told    them    to expect        80   to   90    bodies.        I
      stayed for about 5 to 10 minutes and then left Mr Higgins
      and returned to Hillsborough alone.


38.   On approaching the ground I confirmed my arrival to control
      and received a garbled message to go to Herries Road bus
      station     and    set up a telephone              line to Headquarters.                 I
      therefore      diverted        to Herries Road.            On arrival,           Leading
      Ambulanceman                    approached     me    in    my   car       and    when    I
      explained why I was there he said the landline had already
^     been set up.            He said Mr Page at Headquarters wanted to
      speak to either Mr Jones or Mr Hopkins and they should get
      in touch.      I therefore went back to the ground to take this
      message,     driving       down     to   the      roundabout        at    the    end    of
      Penistone Road and reversing back down the dual carriageway
      in the opposite direction to the one way system.                               Penistone
      Road was clear.


39.   I drove into the gym yard and found both Mr Hopkins and Mr
      Jones in the yard.              I told them to contact Mr Page and they
      went over to use the Vodaphone in Mr Jones Range Rover Staff



                                                   125
      car.    There was very little left to do except to help in
      covering bodies with blankets or green stretcher sheets or
      whatever was available.


40.   Later   I recall Mr Page arrived           in his car with Mr Wade.
      They had a look round with Mr Hopkins and Mr Jones and then
      spoke to the staff.        He instructed Mr Eason                        and
      Mr Morley to continue dealing with the bodies and asked me
      to go back to Headquarters and arrange for some of the night
      crews   to    come   in   on   duty     early    to   give    extra   cover.
      Following     this   Mr   Jones    gathered      everyone     together   and
      sorted out crews on different duties.             He asked some to stay
      to assist in the removal of bodies and sent others back to
      their stations.


41.   I then came back to Headquarters arriving at about 1900 I
      managed to arrange for three crews to come in early at 2000
      two at Parkway and one at Middlewood.             After I had organised
      this a call came in and a message was passed to me that Mr
      Higgins was still at the mortuary and needed picking up.                   I
      went to fetch him and we both returned to Hillsborough to
      assist where we could.


42.   When I was back at the ground a message came through on
                    hand   set    that   Mr    Colin    Moynhan,      the   Sports
      Minister,    would   be arriving by helicopter           at    the Niagara
      Sports ground and an Officer should be detailed to meet him.
      I volunteered to go.       This was about 2200.         I made my way in
      the staff car to the Niagara ground and made myself known to
      the Police.    I informed control of my arrival.              I then stood
      talking to Mr Patnick (the M.P. for Hallam).                 The Assistant
      Chief Constable came to meet the helicopter.                 I had my hand
      set with me and by this time we had reverted to channel 2,
      although I cannot remember when this happened.                   I radioed
      control to ask when the estimated time of the arrival of the
      helicopter and they replied that the helicopter was coming



                                              IZ6
      and    only    an    Officer   In   attendance   was   required.      Mr
      Moynlhan landed at approximately 2210 and after he had left
      I returned to the ground.             I stayed with Station Officer
      Higgins and helped him loading the bodies into Ambulances.


43.   At about midnight Mr Higgins and I drove back to Longley
      Ambulance Station to collect our cars and stood down.              While
      we were still at the station.                           from Rotherham
      Station came in from the ground with a Renault vehicle which
      had seats wanting to collect a couple of stretchers.                  We
      told him to leave this vehicle and take an Ambulance which
      was available with stretchers already on board.               I believe
      these were required to carry more bodies.

Dear Mr Whalley,

RE: Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of 12th instant the contents of which I note and
which was most helpful.

We have asked members of the group to get their clients comments to us as
soon as possible and in any event before 6th October.

To date we have received relatively few replies and will let you have these and
any submissions shortly after 6th.

Yours sincerely,
      " o ”'

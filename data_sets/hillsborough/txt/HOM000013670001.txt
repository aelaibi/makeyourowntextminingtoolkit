HILLSBOROUGH : CORRESPONDENCE FROM MR PATNICK

In   your     note    of 8 September    to    Mr    Addison     you   asked   for   a
contribution    from FI to      a reply you are preparing             to Mr   Irvine
Patnick MP.     You will wish to use the following paragraphs:-


      "The immediate costs        of the Public Inquiry undertaken by Lord
      Justice Taylor will         be met in full by the Government.             With
      regard to the costs         of the investigations undertaken by            the
      West     Midlands     police,although        their   results    were      made
      available to Lord Justice Taylor they were originally started
      at the initiative of the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
      as they concern the policing of his area.                 In addition to the
      investigation of policing and related events on the day, the
      investigations by West Midlands police are necessary for the
      presentation         of   evidence      to     the   coroner's       inquests,
      complaints      and discipline matters and,           more recently,      from
      allegations of criminal liability.


      The Government by way of police specific grant at 51% plus
      block grant already pays a sizeable proportion of the costs
      of policing in South        Yorkshire.         However,    in view      of the
      exceptional and unforeseen circumstances of the Hillsborough
      tragedy,       the   Government   has    offered     the    South   Yorkshire
      Police Authority an additional special payment from central
      funds to assist them with the additional costs they now face
      in respect       of the work carried out on their behalf by the
      West Midlands Police"

HILLSBOROUGH: CORRESPONDENCE FROM MR PATNICK

I am not sure if the correspondence attached has already been
copied to you but you will see G2 are asked to put forward advice
and a draft reply.

I had in mind to include in any draft the points that the Inquiry
sought not to apportion blame to but to find out the causes of
the tragedy and recommend measures to prevent another accident;
and that other contributory causes are referred to in the Interim
Report.

The correspondence does seem to raise issues on the general
policing of South Yorkshire and the cost of the Inquiry.  (I
think the constituent is referring to the cost of the police
investigation). Could I trouble FI for advice and a contribution
on these points please, if possible by early next week.

I am now receiving various letters and I enclose one of
these to you, which are creating the impression that "a
whitewash" was the outcome of the Hillsborough disaster
enquiry.    I know this not to be the case, and that work
is still proceeding on this, but I have to report that the
feeling in Sheffield is running pretty high that South Yorkshire
Police are a good police force and that they are not responsible
for the tragedy that occurred.

I did feel it was my duty to inform you of the situation
and just enclose, as I stated previously, one sample letter.

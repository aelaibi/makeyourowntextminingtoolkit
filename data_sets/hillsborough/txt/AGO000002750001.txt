          HILLSBOROUGH PRIVATE PROSECUTION
          ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD

              I am grateful to you for your letter of 5 November.

          I now enclose a copy of Ms Adlington’s letter of 11 November, and the
          reply of 6 December. At present, I do not think th a t I require any further
          assistance from you, b u t I will revert to you if it becomes apparent th at
          you can help in some further way.

          You will wish to note paragraph 20 of Ms Adlington’s letter, with its
          request th a t the DPP waive his privilege in the advice given by leading
          counsel in 1990. I am inclined to think th a t it is a m atter for you to
          decide how to respond to this request.

               States :—

               I am a steward at the Sheffield Wednesday Hillsborough Football

               Ground.      I work at all the home matches           including the reserve games          I

              ■am al ways posted to the Hop which            ls t.he East standi ng terraces,       and

        d\   v* always   work with the same person

               On Satur day 15th April        1989 the day of the semi-f ina 1 ci^p tie between

               Liver pool and Nott ingham Forest           I started wo rk at thjr ground at      11pm

               and immediately went to the Hop,             the East terracj/f        I knew this end

              would be occupied by the Nottingham Forest f§4*is who started arriving

              at their      positions   in the ground at a b o u t ^ m i d d a y .   Thexe was a steady

               stream of people arriving until kick-off.                 The fans were good humoured

              and well-behaved.         As far as     I am aware there were no disorderly

               incidents on the Hop.
                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                            S2827

         I first became aware that there was a problem when I saw the Liverpool

         fans spilling onto the pitch at the far end of the ground the game had

         already started so this would be*/ at 6 minutes              past 3.    At that stage        I

         did not know what had causedyChe              incident.

         At approximately 20 past 3 fi          became aware of people lying on the pi£l::h

         injured and without being )instructors left my position and went )/o the

         far end of the ground and ontoy^he              pitch somewhere around t h e / p e n a 11y

         area of the Leppings Lane effg.           I would estimate that there were 2 to

         3 hundred Liverpool        fans on the pitch.         In Company with people who I

         didn't know I assisted with carrying 3 i/njured fans to the East

         terraces Hop where the St. Johns Ambiylance w ere attending to the

         injured.         I would not be able to recognise the injured fans             I

         assisted,        but they were all    conscious with what appeared to be leg

         i nj ur ie s .

         I do not believe        I saw anybody on the pitch who was dead but there

         were    people     lying all over the pitch near to the Leppings Lane end so

         I cannot be sure.

         After    I had assisted with the injured I went back to the East terrace*

         side as the Nottingham Forest           fans were     leaving the ground.

                                                                                            SIGNED

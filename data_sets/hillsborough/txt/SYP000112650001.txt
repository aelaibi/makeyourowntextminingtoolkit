                   comments          made it       appeared            that        this        fight        had      been m u t u a l l y a rr a n g e d

                   by    the    rival       factions.

                   Due    to    the     possible           consequence               of    this yo u th s             actions             it w a s       my

                   such    that       either       would         have       been       impossible              without              the    assistance               of

                   Immediately             before       this      incident             a number             of S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e

who       will     be    described                  in the          next      paragraph             the m a j o r i t y           of

At    3    pm h o w e v e r ,         a    group          of a p p r o x i m a t e l y         100 y o u t h s           had      congregated

outside          the     gates            immediately                 prior        to    the S p i o n Kop,               those         gates

leading          to     the      rear          of    the S o u t h S t a n d .                Their       was       no    uniformed

officers           in    view.             The       mood        of     the yo u th s          was       restless,             and       it wa s

obvious          that      they           did       not     hold        tickets          for       the    gam e .         From         comments

we    overheard            they           wre       speaking            of    rushing          the       gates       to     gain        entry.

At    t hi s     time      we     withdrew                to     t he    central          carriageway                of P e n i s t o n e             Road

because          we     were      both          of     the       opinion           that       we    were       isolated             from        other

officers           and     would           neither             have      been able             to s t o p       the y o u t h s ,            or

defend         ourselves              if       the     situation              became          ugly.        Without             warning            the

youths         suddenly           began             running           down     behind          the S o u t h S t a n d              towards               the

Leppings           Lane       end         of    the       ground.             We    b e l i e v e d at         t h at     time         t h at     a

could       neither           pass         or       receive           messages           on    the       CID Channel.

At    around 3.05                pm       it w a s        apparent            that       something             was       taking         p lace

inside         the      ground            to    t he      annoyance            of       the    Nottingham                f a ns     who      were

       problem         had       arisen          of    the        nature       that        was     later      to       unfold.            A    short

       time a f te r          thi*« w e          saw Police              vehicles           arriving          at       t he      groun d and             it

       was    obvious            that       something              serious          had     occurred.              We       decided           to

       return         to    th e    Police            Gym     to f i n d       out     if w e        could assist.                   The

       could       clear         the    tables           from        the    Gym       in    case      it w a s         needed        to       receive

       casualties.                 Before         a decision               was      made,        Chief       Inspector             Beal        ordered

       us    to    clear         the    Gym.

       nearest         the       entrance             was     occupied           by    the       Police,       the          centre        section

       had    tables          laid      out       where           programme           sellers         were     counting              their

       takings         and       the    far       section was               unoccupied.                 I assisted                clearing

       tables         from       the    Police           end and           casualties              b e g a n to        be     brought          into

       the Gym.             I ra n to            the    middle           section           and    demanded             the       programme

       sellers         to     vacate         it.        Many        bodies          were       being     br ought             into      the G y m

       and within             minutes            there        were       obvious           dead      bodies        and        ones      needing

       urgent         medical          assistance                 in b o t h     sections.              There          wa s      completed

       mayhem         and     relatives               were        also     entering            the    gym     looking             for     each

       other.          Th e      mood       of    some        of    them was           violent          but    obvious             under           the

       circumstances.

       At    t ha t    time        I ran         over        to    the     Gym      entrance          where        I took          hold        of a

                        the      pitch.            I walked           onto     the        pitch and             could       not      believe          what     I was

                        seeing.              The    pitch        wa s      full      of    f ans,         dead and          injured          lying       on the

                        returned             to    the    Gym.

laid        out    in     rows.          I saw PC E a m o n                Larkin        standing           near    th e      gym

entrance          and        noticed          that     the       original           officer        I had          ’posted*          there

had      gone.          I asked          PC    Larkin        to       carry        out    th e    same       duty and          he

agreed.            I later           saw      that     officer             collaps        as     an argument             took       place

with a man              entering            the     gym    demanding               to    find a        relative          who was

mi ssi n g .

I personally                 then     became          involved             in a     heated argument                 with       two

persons           trying        to    gain         entry     to       the G y m .         One     said       his    relative          was

d,ead       inside        and      the      other      said and             identified            himself          as: b e i n g a

reporter           from        the    People          Newspaper.              The        reporter           stated       he w a n t e d      to

get      into      th e      Gym     bu t     I refused           him access.                  I explained              that    his

actions           were       m i s g u i d e d and        he a g r e e d       to       leave,     apologising                to me     for

his      unprofessional                  approach.               He    did     n ot      re tu r n.

Things        then        began       to      slow     dow n ,        and    later a           room was           set    up w her e

bodies        were        to    be    identified             by       photographs.                My    duty was           to m e e t

OBSERVATIONS

It     is    perhaps           pertinent            to m e n t i o n        that        I have     been a          lifelong

football           supporter             and       I have        attended           many major              matches        including

Wor ld Cup Finals,                    FA Cup          semi       finals       and        finals,        and       also     many

Europ ea n Cup matches.                            I have        on m a n y        occasion attended                    football

matches           involving           t he     Liverpool              football           club.         My    observations

therefore           relate            to      them.

It     is w e l l       known         in f o o t b a l l c i r c l e s        that       Liverpool           Fans       are     both

             without       tickets.            The     lengths        I have       seen          them       go    to a r e      unbelievable.

             One    particular           match        that     springs        to m i n d a n d w h i c h               I feel        is v e r y

             Worthy    of m e n t i o n        is     the C u p F i n a l        whent h©y             p l a y e d at Wemjbly a g a i n s t

             Outside       that     ground          that      day were        many      thousands                of    fans     without

             tickets.        They        formed        themselves           into     organised               gangs       to     rush          the

             turnstiles.            Around          kick      off    time     that      day ma ny were                  still        outside

             was    shut    and     used       fo r    exit     purposes          had      small        runners           on    th e      bottom

             which    ran    in a        small        channel        in t he      ground.              As    the       fans     rushed          t hi s

             gate    the    runners        ca me       away     from       their      channel           and       the     base       of       the

             gate    was    pushed        forward.             This     resulted           in the           gate       turning           sideways

             at about       head     height.             Persons           who had     been        standing             near        to    the       gate

             were    crushed        by     th e      mob who         had    no s e n s e    of     safety.              They were              going

             to    enter    the     ground          no m a t t e r    w h a t.     Many          got    under          t he    gate       before

             order    was    restored,              however,         I could        not     believe              that    this        was

             without       ser ious       injury         to    those       who    had      been        innocently              s t a n d i ng

             nearby    at    th e    time       of     their        stampede.

             know whether           any    injuries            were    sustained.

             I feel    that       the      e v e n t s of      that        day show        the     problems             which        these

             supporters       have         caused        in the        past by       their         organised             methods           and

             there.        I have        always        felt     that       too   many       fans were                 admitted           on    those

     INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND SHEFFIELD
     ON SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989.



     REPORT OF MICHAEL ROBERT DYNES. DC 2405.



I am a Constable in the South Yorkshire Police currently stationed at
Hammerton Road Police Station, Sheffield.

At 10am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I attended the pre-match briefing
in relation to the FA Cup Semi-Final football match bfween Liverpool and
Nottingham Football Clubs to take place that day at the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Ground.

The above Police briefing took place in the North Stand of the     football ground
and was addressed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. Further     briefs were given
by Superintendent Murray,*. Inspector Sewell. Detective Sergeant   Charlesworth
briefed officers present on recent behaviour of the respective     supporters.

Following the main briefing myself and other CID officers were further briefed
by Detective Superintendent MCKay about our individual responsibilities.

Detective Constable 3119 Bagguley and iuyself were assigned duties outside the
ground. At recent football matches at the same stadium a large number of motor
vehicles fead been broken into and contents stolen during the course of the game.
We were both dressed in plain clothes and were instructed to carry out observations
for such offences in Penistone Road from an area outside the ground upto and
including the Owlerton Sports Stadium.

Ky dress was as follows:- Brown leather bomber jacket, green/white shirt, baggy
style jeans and brown suede shoes.

At 11am the same day DC Bagguley and I commenced the duties as outlined above.
We left the football ground and walked from there to Leppings Lane where I had
previously arranged to meet a r’olice Informant. The route took us past the Spion
Kop end of the ground and the general route to the ground from the City Centre,
At that early hour a large number of Supporters were already beginning to arrive
and a number of these were drinking alcohol from cans.

Following a discussion with the above mentioned man, we continued our foot patrol
up to the Owlerton Stadium where we made our presence known to staff at the car
park entrance. The time then would be around midday. Opposite the stadium is the
main junction of Penistone Road, Bradfield Road and Liversey Street. Situated at
the junction is a Public House named the Royal Hotel. The footpath outside that
public house was completely conjested with supporters of Nottingham Forest. Their
was the sounds of singing inside the pub suggesting fans of that club were also
inside.

At that time we were monitoring channel 19 of our personel radio, that channel
being solely for CID use. Reception was good and in fact we received notification
via DS 805 Buxton that other local public houses were also conjested in the same
area.. We did in fact make our way to the Royal Hotel where v/e spoke too and
identified ourselves to uniformed Police Officers who were outdide. This was done
so that they would recognise ourselves in the event that v/e required assistance.
We spoke to a uniformed Inspector, believed to be called Burgess who told us that
the landlord of that pub had been cautioned by him for selling crates of beer from
the boot of his car which was parked at the rear of the premises. We subsequently
saw a number of crates of beer when a rear yard gate to the premises was opened.
Following our conversation I actually entered the public house to assess the
behaviour of the fans inside. The Pub was completely full of Notts Fans and it is
safe to say that the majority of them were the worse for drink. One youth was

                             r
 actually standing on a table in the Pub leading the fans singing.There was
  not however any signs of trouble.Vi/e reported our observations to the uniformed
officers outside and volunteered our services should the pub need re-visiting.

We then continued our foot patrol along Penistone Road towards the ground. By
this time it would be approximately 12.30pm. The footpaths leading upto the
ground were heavily conjested with fans and from speaking to them a large number
were in fact 'Ticket touts’. One particular tout was spoken too and boasted of
having 20 tickets for sale. He saida £6 terrace ticket would cost me £25. When
we identified ourselves to him, he said he was from Liverpool and  'touted' on
a regular basis. He said he obtained his tickets from players of the Club, and also
held a large number of ’Kop’ season tickets which were purchased vd-th the sole
intention of getting large allocations of tickets for 'big games'. This particular
tout stated that in the week before the game Liverpool Police had taken his
tickets from him to assess their origin and validity. He said he had only got
them back the previous night and this had reduced their street value. Each ticket
he stated would have fetched around £ 50 in mid-week.

As stated at that time this man was one of approximately 20 touts present. We
were approached on many occasions by fans wanting to buy tickets, and the high
volume of them even at that time suggested that many were travelling to the game
without tickets.This was mentioned within the ground when we attended there for
our meal break at around 1.30pm.

At 2pm DC BagguleyAreturned to our patrol as mentioned above. In the short space
of time we had be. n away, the volume of supporters outside the ground had risen
drastically. I should point out however that the number of fans actually entering
the ground was minimal. The turnstiles at the Kop end showed no signes of
conjestion and. the road at that end of the ground was clear. Traffic was moving
easily for a match of the standard that was taking place. At the City end of
the entrances to the Spion Kop is a gateway leading to the South Stand entrances.
That gateway and also a bridge on the far side of it was completely conjested.
It was noted that this blockage was caused by fans asking for and also offering
for sale match tickets. Their were no Police Officers in uniform present at that
location and despite the fact that it .did not fall under our brief, we took it
upon ourselves to move these persons on.

We continued along Penistone Road towards Owlerton Stadium. Throughout that patrol
we saw two mniform officers only who were standing at the junction with Parkside
Road. The lack of officers visibly present was commented upon. I%ns present were
arriving in numbers, a large number of which were drinking beer from cans.

At approximately 2.45pm DC Bagguley and I had returned to the bridge area immediately
before the Spion Kop entrances. That area was comp^e tely blocked and fans were
spilling into the roadway. A group of 20 plus fans came running down the road away
from the site of Hillsborough Park. It was apparent that these youths had been
involved in some incident and so whilst DC Bagguley watched over me I stood amongst
them. The youths were boasting to each other of their part in a fight which had
just taken place in Hillsborough Park. It is pertinent to mention that at the
identical semi final meeting betfsween the same club| at Sheffield the year before
the Park had been the scene of serious disorder between fighting fans after the
game. I had personally dealt with one youth who was involved in the stabbing of a
Liverpool supporter and who is awaiting trial at Sheffield Crown Court. The youths
who I was standing with were all Nottingham Porest Pans and one in particular v/as
intrurnental in arranging them to meet on the bridge after the game when a further
fight was to take place with Liverpool ±’ans in the park. Prom comments made it
appeared that this fight had been mutually arranged by the rival factions.


                                 2.
Due to the possible consequences of this youths actions it was my intention fc
either arrest him or to strongly advise him. The mood of the crowd at that
 time, who comprised in the main of drunks, was such that either would have
been impossible without $he assistance of a uniformed officer. That particular
piece of road(Penistone Road) is directly prior to the City side of the football
ground. I continued to follow the particular youth and I was surprised to find
that the only Police Officers in view   were three or four from the Nottingham
Force. The youth was cautioned in their presence and his details obtained by
one of the Nottingham officers. Whilst this conversation was taking place
the youths friends became very hostile towards us and their was no doubt
that this section of fans were not only the worse for drink but intended to
fight with anyone they could.


Immediately after this, incident a number of South Yorkshire Passenger
Transport Buses arrived at the ground.The majority of persons on those
buses were also drunk. It should be noted however that despite their late
arrival their entry to the ground, wag tjuick. I believe that the time would be
around 2.50pm - 2.55pm. YJe had been joined at the scene by Inspector ...anus
Booth and!asked him to relay a message to match control warning them     of the
potential disorder in Hillsborough Park after the match. He stated that the
control channel was heavily conjested and suggested that we pass the message
later. It should be noted that we could neither pass or receive messages on
the radio which we were issued. (CID Channel 19)


Around 3pm we assumed the match had started by the sounds of cheerscoming from
inside the ground. Traffic in Penistone Road on the Spion Kop end was very
sparse and we commented on how easily it had cleared. It v/as our opinion that
it was in fact less than a normal Saturday home game at Hillsborough. No
persons appeared to have difficulty in entering the ground. Apart from a number
of persons who will be described in the next paragraph the majority of Nottingham
Pans appeared to have arrived in time to enter the ground*


At 3pm however a group of approximately 100 youths had congregated outside
the gates immediately prior to the Spion Kop, those gates leading to the
rear of the South Stand. Their was no uniformed officers in view. The mood
of the youths was restless, and it v/as obvious that they did not hold tickets
for the game. Prom comments we overheard they were speaking of rushing the
gates to gain entry. At this time we withdrew to the central carraigeway of
Penistone Road because we were both of the opinion that we were issolated
from other officers and would neither *M&.been able to ifliop the youths, or
defend ourselves if the situation became ugly.Ytfithout warning the youths
                                3
                                                                             a .,   m



suddenly began manning down behind the South Stand towards the Leppings
Lane end of the ground.We believed at that time that a fight was probably
taking place at the Leppings Lane end and still we could neither pass or
receive messages on the CID Channel.


At around 3.05pm it was apparent that something v/as taking place inside the
ground to the annoyance of the Nottingham Eans who were ’booing’ strongly.
We went to a turnstile nearby where we saw PC 1302 Pitt inside. He told us
that there had been a pitch invasion at the Leppings Lane end. I climbed
over the tunstile and entered a gangway between the South Stand and Spion
Kop. I could see persons on the pitch at the Liverpool end, and others climbing
from the West Stand terraces to the seated area.

DC Bagguley and I then returned to Penistone Road unaware that a problem
had arisen of the nature that was later to unfold. A short time after this
we saw Police vehicles arriving at the ground and it was obvious that something
serious had occurred. We decided to return to the Police Gym to find out if we
could assist. The turnstiles at the Spion Kop end were now empty.

On entering the Gym we were told that persons had been crushed at the Leppings
Lane terraces. Their was talk of many cast&ties and possibly someone dead.
In the Gym at this time was Inspector Towell and other CID officers. DS Lindley
game into the Gym and their was then talk of oireareight deaths. I suggested to
DI Towell that we could clear the tables from the Gym in case it was needed
to receive casualties. Before a decision was made, Chief Inspector Beal ordered
us to clear the Gym.

The Gym at that time was divided by nets into 3 sections. The section nearest
the entrance v/as occupied by Police, the centre section had tables laid out
where programme sellers were counting their takings, and the far section was
unoccupied. I assisted clearing tables from the Police end and casualties began
to be brought into the Gym. I ran to the middle section and demanded the
programme sellers to vacate it. I.Ian$ bodies were being brought into the Gym
and within minutes their were obvious dead bodies and ones needing urgent medical
assistance in both sections. Their was completed mayhem and relatives were also
entering the gym looking for each other. The mood of some of them was violent
but obvious under the circumstances.

At that time I ran over to the Gym entrance where I took hold of a uniformed
officer. That officer appeared in a state of helpless shock. I grabbed hold of
him as previously stated and identified myself to him. I told him not to move
from the doorway and to inform all entering to take dead bodies to the nearest
section and injured to the middle. The officer seemed relieved to have been
given a particular task to do. I obviously had no authority to do so, but told
him that if he moved he had me to answer too. Persons in the Gym were then
likewise organised by a senior officer.

At that stage I assisted to try and resuscitate two persons lying on the Gym
floor but our actions were *0 no avail. I had a feeling of h<*jl^lessness#I can
only describle the next few minutes as completeand utter confusion. One minute
their were five bodies, the nest their appeared to be fifty-five. The bodies
being brought in appeared to be never ending. Their were fans in the Gym demanding
to see or identify bodies, people being resuscitated and people weeping over the
dead. The dead and injured were being brought into the gym on stretchers and
advertising boards.
                             *
I could not believe what was happening and did not want to do so. At
that stage I decided to leave the Gym and see what v/as happening on the
pitch. I walked onto the pitch and could not believe what I was seeing.
The pitch was full of fans, dead and injured lying on the pitch. One
fan who was obviously dead,a coat over his head,was lying immediately in
front of and in full view of fans on the Spion Kop. A uniformed officer said
he was waiting for a advertising board to be brought to remove him on. I
told the officer that their v/as no more room in the Gym for such boards
and he would have to carry the body. Before v/e could do so a strectture
was brought and the man was moved from the pitch to the caring applause of
the Nottingham Eanswho by now had obviously understood the seriousness of
the incident. I returned to the Gym.

The flow of bodies brought into the gym continued and the dead v/ere laid
out in rows. I saw PC Eamon Larkin standing near the Gym entrance and noticed
that the orginal officer I had 'posted1 there had gone. I asked PC Larkin to
carry out the same duty and he agreed. I later saw that officer collapse as
an argument took place with a man entering the gym demanding to find a relative
who v/as missing.

I personally then became involved in a heated argument with two persons trying
to gain entry to the Gym. One said his refetive was dead inside and the other
said and identified himself as being a reporter from the People Newspaper,
The reporter stated he wanted to get into the Gym but I refused him access.
I explained that his actions were misguided and he agreed to leave,apologising
to me for his unprofessional approach. He did not return.

Things then began to slow down, and later a room was set up where bodies
were to be identified by photograph. My duty v/as to meet relatives and
explain the position. I did so and then brought them into the room where
they identified their relatives firstly by photograph, and then in person
as the body was brought up from the Gym. I continued to carry out this duty
until 4am. I can describe the events of this time in more detail if required
to do So b u H a o not feel up to compelling it to paper at this time.

l.iy duty finished that day at 4am.



OBSERVATIONS

It is perhaps pertinent to mention that I have been a lifelong football
supporter and I have attended many major matches including World Cup Finals,
PA Cup semi finlas and Finals, and also may European Cup matches, I have
on many occasions attended football matches involving the Liverpool football
Club, Lly observations therefore relate to them.

It is well known in football circles that Liverpool Fans are both unruley
and also have a special talent in gaining entry to big games without tickets.
The lengths I have seen them go to are unbelieveable. One particular match
that springs to mind and which I feel is very worthy of mention is the Cup
Final when they played at Wembley against Bverton.

Outside that ground that day were many thousands of fans without tickets.
They formed themselves jntoorganised gangs to rush the turnstiles,. Around
kick off time that day many were still outside when i say a group of over
100 rush a folding gate. The gate which was shut and used for exit purposes
had small runners on the bottom which ran in a small channel in the ground.
As the fans rushed this gate the runnex> came away from their channel and
the base of the gate was pushed forward. This resulted in the gate turning
sideways at about headneight. Persons who had been standing near to the
gate v/ere crushed by the mob who had no sense; of safety. They were going to
enter the ground no matter what. Many got under the gate before order was
restored, however I could not believe that this was without serious injury
                          5
to those who had. be n innocently standing nearby at the time of their stampede.

Other like ’mass rushes1 took place that day but obviously I dont know whether
any injuries were sustained.

I feel that the events of that day show the problems which these supporters
have caused in the past by their organised methods and which may have led upto
the tragic events of Hillsborough.
 X have worked at Hillsborough on football duties since 1977. I have therefore
 worked at numerous big matches that have taken place there. I have always felt
 that too many fans were admitted on those occasions in the Leppings Lane End.

                                           FURTHER EVIDENCE IN

                                      THE INQUEST INTO THE DEATH OF
                    B                     KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS


                               THE CORONER:    Now you may remember on Wednesday I
                          kept you late.    I said I had to go out and do a little
                          bit of thinking, and that is what we are going to deal
                          with this afternoon.

                               What we were thinking about was that one of the
                          inquests which we had done related to Kevin Daniel
                          Williams.    I will remind you of this inquest.   This
                          was the case of another young man, in fact he was only
                          15.    The problem in that case was that the evidence
                          was difficult to unravel as to when he died and what
                          had happened when he was being taken across the pitch
                    D     and had he said something in the temporary mortuary and
                          so on.

                               After the inquest was concluded my attention was
                          drawn by some of my legal colleagues, and very
                          rightlybecause they were realised it was a sensitive
                          problem and did not want to upset the family, so they
                          brought it to my attention privately first.    The point
                    E     which they were bringing to my attention was that one
                          of the witnesses appeared to say that when he came to
                          this young man at the Spion Kop end, more or less, of
                          the ground, he had convulsions and he also said he
                          could feel a pulse.    We knew from the visual evidence
                          - we are going to repeat all the relevant evidence in a
                          moment - we knew that he was being taken across the
                          pitch and we had a timing at 1532.   Assuming that was
                          right, this convulsion or whatever it was, was
                          happening after that point of time.   The question was:
                          what on earth was going on?

                               I agreed that this was a valid point.   I think we
                          were so concerned about the event which happened after
                          that, namely, what happened in the gymnasium, did he
                          speak or did he not speak - this was the lad with the
                          fractured voice box - that we may not have put quite
                          enough concentration and thought into the earlier
                          evidence, but we are going to do it now. We are going
                          to sort it out so that we know, as far as we are able,
                          so that we understand, if we can, what happened.

                               I think if Sergeant Killock could come back.
                H                               -   1   -



J. L. Harpham Ltd
                S E R GE A N T JOHN KILLOCK R ecalled
                         By THE CORONER:

          THE WITNESS:   Sergeant John Killock, from the
     West Midlands Police.

}.   Sergeant Killock, if you read - we are not ^oing to
     read the whole summary again because we don t need to -
     but I think paragraph 5 which is where somebody starts
     describing helping him from the terraces. - A.
     Following the severe crushing in the West Stand
     terracing Police Constable Michael John Craighill went
     into enclosure 3 and assisted a number of casualties.
     Police Constable Craighill assisted to carry a young
     man he now believes to be Kevin Daniel Williams from
     the gate in the perimeter fencing of enclosure 3 and on
     to the pitch.

     The officer attempted resuscitation but without
     success.

     Derek William Bruder is a Police Constable with    the
     Merseyside Police who was off-duty at the match    that
     day.   He was a spectator in the North Stand.      He
     recalls seeing a person lying on the pitch near    the
     Spion Kop and North Standing and describes that    person
     as having convulsions.

     Mr. Bruder went on to the pitch and gave mouth to mouth
     resuscitation, aided by a St. John's Ambulanceman who
     carried out cardiac massage.    Mr. Bruder recalls that
     a friend of the casualty was with him on the pitch.
     Resuscitation was continued and they were joined by a
     St. John's Ambulancewoman who took over from Mr. Bruder
     and after a short time by a St. John's Ambulanceman.

     The St. John's Ambulanceman said the casualty was dead
     and Mr. Bruder then left the scene.

     Neither of the St. John's Ambulance personnel or the
     friend of the casualty have been identified.

     The person Mr. Bruder tried to resuscitate is known to
     be Kevin Daniel Williams and there is visual evidence
     to show that, sir.

}.   Then the next paragraph deals with the lady police
     officer.   Just read that next paragraph as well. - A.
     Special Constable Debra Jane Martin went on to the
     pitch to assist and helped to carry several deceased
     and many injured to the gymnasium.   She assisted to
     carry one young boy, now known to be Kevin, into the
     gymnasium and she remained with him.

                            - 2 -
                    A(     Now what she said we are not going to deal with because
                           that was satisfactorily explained. What we are
                           interested in is that bit which has been read.    If we
                           turn to page 41, I think I arn right in saying that what
                           Mr. Bruder says - he says he saw a person about a
                           quarter of the pitch length away from the Spion Kop? -
                           A. Yes.
                    B,     He was lying on the ground or thereabouts? - A. That is
                           correct, sir.

                           He says he can remember this because he recollects an
                           ambulance going past which locates it in his mind and
                           in fact he tried to flag it down? - A. Yes.

                           Then he says:

                                "I saw this man lying on the floor having
                                convulsions."

                           - A. That is his exact wording.

                           Then if we turn over the page and pick out the bits
                    D      that are relevant.   He says he went down and he went
                           up to this man:

                                "...and then went to the man having convulsions."

                           - A. Yes, sir.

                           Then he says:
                    E
                                "I was joined by a St. John's Ambulanceman."

                           - A. Yes.

                                "That chap said, 'You do mouth to mouth and I will
                                do heart massage'"

                           - A. That is correct.

                           He goes on to say:

                                "I then took his pulse in his neck.    I could feel
                                a slight pulse."

                           - A. Yes, sir.

                           He then tried to resuscitate him, mouth to mouth, and
                           undressed him so he could do it more conveniently
                           probably. - A. Yes.

                        (). Then he says:

                    H                              - 3 -


J. L. Harpham Ltd
                                  "We continued to work on the man but after about
                                  five minutes he went grey and his face was
                                  withdrawn."

                             - A. That is right, sir.

                      Q. He talks about the man vomiting and being sick and
                         having a peculiar smell - at least, the breath...
                    B    Well, his mouth had a peculiar smell? - A. Yes.

                        ).   He also noticed there was something unusual about his
                             rib cage:

                                  "As I did heart massage his ribs were unnaturally
                                  prominent."

                             - A. Yes.

                         , Then eventually another St. John's Ambulance person
                           cameand he left the man? - A. That is right.

                         , This whole thing took quite a few minutes? - A. Yes,
                           obviously the officer had no conception of time.
                    D    , Can you remind me about the visual evidence?    It is
                           just to make sure I have got it right that there is
                           visual evidence, both of Mr. Bruder... - A. One
                           photographic print was mentioned, sir, and was given
                           the reference number TT.1/30.   That is a photograph
                           which shows Kevin lying on the pitch.   The person has
                           been identified by Kevin's parents.   Shown about to
                    E      give mouth to mouth resuscitation of Kevin is a man who
                           has been identified as Police Constable Bruder.    PC
                           Bruder has identifiedhimself on that photograph.

                         , Then there is another      timed print, is it PR.5/32 or
                           PR.5/33, showing Kevin     being carried across, paragraph
                           18? - A. There are two     photographs, sir: PR.5/A/32,
                           which is timed at 1532     and PR.5/A/33.    That is also
                           timed at 1532.

                                  THE CORONER:   Inspector Layton, just show us
                             where those photographs are.

                                  INSPECTOR LAYTON:   Yes, sir.   They are referred
                             to in the plan MWJL.42.   PR.5/32 is approximately at
                             this position here on the pitch.   That is the timed
                             photograph, sir.   TT.130 is not timed, but I believe
                             it is somewhere in this area here.   From recollection
                             I think I did that actually from what Mr. Bruder says
                             in his statement, about the positioning on the pitch.

                             THE CORONER:   Now Inspector Sawers went to see
                        Mr. Bruder because we wanted to be sure we had the
                        facts.

                               INSPECTOR MATTHEW ROBERT SAWERS Called

                                          By THE CORONER:
                    B        THE WITNESS:   Matthew Robert Sawers, Inspector,
                        West Midlands Police.

                        I believe you went to see him yesterday? - A. Yes, sir.

                        In fact it was Mr. Bruder's day off but he very
                        willingly gave his time? - A. He did.

                        Now can you summarise for me what he says? - A. Yes,
                        sir.   He starts off by referring and identifying his
                        two previous statements to us, sir, the first of which
                        was approximately a fortnight after the disaster
                        itself, and a second statement in August of last year
                        was a very short statement in which he merely
                        identifies himself on the photographs that you have
                    D   heard reference to, sir.

                        He goes on to say that I had shown him a number of
                        documents and plans, from which he was able to refresh
                        his memory.   He refers to the fact he had made some
                        notes on the day after the disaster but that they did
                        not refer specifically to his dealings with this
                        casualty.
                    E
                        He refers, sir, to joining Merseyside Constabulary in
                        1987 and receiving basic first-aid instruction during
                        his initial, training.    That was both in theory and
                        practical application.     He refers, sir, following the
                        incident and his dealings with this youth, to feeling
                        he was inadequately trained in his own confidence,
                        although it is also true to say that he is absolutely
                        satisfied that the first aid he rendered on the day was
                        the very best he could do and he felt he could do no
                        more.    He goes on to say as a result of feeling
                        depressed about the incident he applied of his own
                        volition for further first-aid training within
                        Merseyside Police.     Indeed, he attended a full week,
                        Monday to Friday course, leading to a further
                        qualification and much greater confidence in his own
                        ability.    However, with the benefit of that training,
                        sir, he is able to reflect on his actions of the day
                        and he is still absolutely satisfied that the first aid
                        he rendered in terms of mouth to mouth and heart
                        massage were correct and he could have done no more for
                        Kevin.

                    H                        - 5 -

He goes on then, sir, to deal with specific matters
that I referred him to in his original statement.
Specifically, sir, from the transcript and police file
he deals with page 41 of the police file statements,
which is page 6 of his original statement in April last
year.   He refers and confirms seeing Kevin a quarter
of the length of the pitch from the Spion Kop end of
the ground.   He refers to his being on the floor and
clarifies that as on the grass surface of the pitch.

He has given very careful consideration, sir, to the
expression that he used of having convulsions and in
the light of his further training and what he now knows
and thinks about the incident was that "convulsions"
was not the word that was applicable to these
circumstances.   He refers specifically to having seen
epileptic fits and says that what he originally
described as a convulsion was not anything like an
epileptic fit.   He goes on to say later, sir, that if
there was a part of the body that he saw move it was
his head and that the word that he best thinks
describes this movement is that of a twitch.

He refers to comments he made originally about
approaching the body, the body that was convulsing.
Having specifically considered it again, sir, he does
say that the body was not convulsing as he approached
it.   He referred originally, sir, to feeling for a
carotid pulse and originally he thought he had detected
a slight pulse.   On reflection, sir, he feels he would
be much more skilful if he were required to perform
this action again and he cannot discount the
possibility that he did not feel immediately in the
right place for the carotid artery.   He certainly felt
in the neck region where he thought he would find the
artery but he cannot say he would have gone to it
directly.

I put to him, sir, the specific point I believe Dr.
Slater made in his evidence about this inquest a couple
of days ago and PC Bruder specifically discounts having
felt for the carotid artery with his thumb.   He refers
to the first two fingers of his left hand.

He says in dealing with the carotid pulse that he may
have touched other areas around the neck region,
including the Adam's apple and that whatever he felt
there he cannot be categoric it was a pulse.     He feels
he may well be mistaken in that matter, sir.

Later in his statement of April last year, sir, he
referred to the face of Kevin Williams going grey and
being withdrawn.   He wanted you to know, sir, that he
cannot specifically say he saw the face change from a
                        normal pallor, or colour, to grey.   He mentioned it in
                        his statement, sir, in the sequence that it occurred to
                        him that he was now noticing that he was grey.   He may
                        have been grey as he approached him before he mentioned
                        it, or it may have occurred as he noticed it.

                        In his original statement he referred to vomiting and
                        thinking that Kevin had been sick.   He has given this
                    B   matter some further thought and he is absolutely
                        satisfied that Kevin was not sick.   He did not see
                        Kevin vomiting and he did not see vomit on the ground
                        or on his clothing.

                        Does he still confirm that there was a distinctive
                        smell? - A. Yes, he does, sir.

                        To finish with the vomiting aspect of his original
                        statement, he does have a clear impression in his mind,
                        sir, of a fluid of some sort in the mouth, but he
                        cannot discount that that could be spittle or phlegm of
                        some sort.

                        He referred in his original statement to the original
                    D   resuscitation attempts whereby he gave mouth to mouth
                        resuscitation and the St. John's Ambulanceman commenced
                        heart compressions.   His original thought, sir, was
                        that that was for approximately seven minutes and, give
                        or take, he is happy with that time and thinks it is
                        reasonably accurate.    He then later referred to
                        swopping over with the St. John's Ambulanceman and PC
                        Derek Bruder was then involved in external heart
                    E   compressions and this was when he noticed the unusual
                        rib cage and he had earlier referred, sir, to
                        unbuttoning his shirt, I believe.    He referred to
                        unzipping his trousers and noticing some striped boxer
                        shorts that you will see in the photographs that, have
                        been referred to, TT.1/31 and 32 respectively.

                        I have put to him the apparent difficulties in the time
                        sequence of the action that he describes near the Spion
                        Kop end of the ground and his specific reference to am
                        ambulance and asking the St. John's Ambulance colleague
                        who was assisting him and who has not been identified,
                        to stop the ambulance because he was considering
                        utilising it, sir.

                        I have drawn his attention to the problems in relation
                        to the known timing of ambulances arriving on the
                        pitch, both of St. John's and of the South Yorkshire
                        Metropolitan Ambulance Service and I have drawn his
                        attention to the apparent discrepancy in relation to
                        the time shown on photographs PR.5/A.32 and 3, sir.

J. L. Harpham Ltd
                     ). The point is that the ambulances were known to arrive
                        at about 1515 and 1517 or thereabouts? - A. Yes, sir.

                     5. And the photograph, PR.5/A/32 and so on, is timed at
                        1532? - A. That is correct, sir.

                     }.   We are saying he was dealing with this young boy after
                          that? - A. That is correct.
                 B
                          In fact I put the wrong times to you.   It is 1515 on
                          the pitch for the St. John's Ambulance and 1520 for the
                          first South Yorkshire... - A. That is correct, sir,
                          irrespective of which...

                          It is still earlier... - A. It is still earlier than
                          1532, sir, and that point has been put specifically to
                          Hr. Bruder and try as he may he is simply unable to
                          reconcile those differences.   I have put to him, sir,
                          was it for instance a question of one of those
                          ambulances actually exiting the stadium across the
                          pitch rather than entering the stadium.   He has
                          considered that point and try as he may his
                          recollection is still of it being an ambulance that
                 D        entered the stadium.

                          He refers then to being joined by the woman St. John's
                          Ambulance Officer, who he refers to pushing him out of
                          the way to become involved as a trained first aider and
                          recollects this was approximately six minutes after he
                          changed places with the male ambulance officer.   for
                          that reason, with the original seven minutes mouth to
                 E        mouth resuscitation, PC Bruder feels that that total of
                          thirteen minutes he could amend to a period of time of
                          between ten and fifteen minutes of sustained attempts
                          to resuscitate Kevin.

                          It was at this point, sir, that after approximately two
                          minutes of the involvement of the woman St. John's
                          Ambulance Officer, that the male St. John's Ambulance
                          Officer stood up and said, "He's gone."    He referred
                          to the expression being completely grey and would seek
                          to reaffirm that choice of words as his description of
                          Kevin at that particular moment in time.   He says,
                          sir, and I quote:

                               "There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, both now
                               and with the benefit of further training, that
                               then at the moment the youth I had tried to save
                               was dead, certainly dead, and beyond any further
                               help.   I and St. John's Ambulance personnel would
                               not have stopped if there had been any glimmer of
                               hope at all.   There was none."

He refers to the personal description of Kevin again,
sir, and refers to the fact he is absolutely satisfied
it was Kevin Williams that he was attempting to
resuscitate.

     THE CORONER:   I just want to make it crystal
clear that there is no suggestion in any of this of any
criticism of PC Bruder.   I think he did absolutely
valiantly and did his best.   Not only did he do his
best on the day, he is doing his best today as well,
through Inspector Sawers, to try and help us understand
what he remembers and I want that clearly understood by
everybody.   I don't want you to think we are knocking
him. We are not.   All I am trying to do is finding out
what happened.

      Mr. Fraser, any questions of this officer on this
part?    I had better tell you who else I am going to be
calling.    Dr. Slater and Dr. Gumpert, whom I will tell
you about when he comes.    He is a neuro physiologist,
a clinician, and an expert on this sort of thing.

     MR. FRASER:   No, sir, I have no specific
questions, save to say that I understand, Officer, you
have spoken to Mr. and Mrs. Williams, having spoken to
the officer?   I rise because I appear for Mr. and Mrs.
Williams and obviously have their interests at heart.

     THE WITNESS:   I did go and visit Mr. and Mrs.
Williams, sir, yesterday evening, having seen PC Bruder
and I have outlined briefly to them the contents of PC
Bruder's further thoughts and recollections for Kevin
on the day.

     MR. FRASER:   Sir, I understand they are
appreciative, both of the efforts the officer has made
and of his visit and they have no questions.   They
have decided not to come today, sir, for reasons which
I am sure you will understand but they are fully aware
of exactly what is going on on their behalf.

     THE CORONER:      Thank you.    Have you got any
questions?

     MR. LIMB:      No, thank you.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:      No, thank you, sir.

     THE CORONER:    When we have heard the rest of the
evidence I arn quite prepared to recall any of these
officers, or, indeed, any of these witnesses because I
want us to understand it.

     Dr. Slater.

             DR. DAVID SLATER Recalled
                  By THE CORONER:

Dr. Slater, you have, of course, already dealt with
this case a couple of days ago.    If I remember rightly
you said, among other things, that (a) this lad had a
broken voice box.   It was broken in four places.
Also (b) he was, of all the cases you dealt with,
perhaps the most asphyxiated, if one can judge that by
cyanosis and so on.   Would that be a correct
recollection? - A. That is absolutely correct, sir. Of
all the cases I dealt with Kevin showed really the
worst injuries to the neck in that there were four
fractures to the voice box.    In addition there were
three very large scratches to the neck.    In addition
to the normal signs of asphyxia, the blueness and the
hemorrhages which were very marked, there is no doubt
this was a very, very severe case of asphyxia and
probably the worst one I dealt with, sir.

We established to everybody's satisfaction what had
happened in the gymnasium and the account, we dealt
with that as to whether this lad could have spoken and
so on, so we don't need to be concerned about that.
What we are interested in this afternoon is the
evidence relating to Mr. Bruder.   I will also remind
you that in general that what has been said is that a
person becomes unconscious in an asphyxial situation
within anything from zero to twenty to thirty seconds.
There is a slight variation amongst pathologists, but
quickly.   Then that death usual supervenes within four
to six minutes or thereabouts.   The problem is, as you
have already heard, that whichever way you look at it,
Mr. Bruder was dealing with this young man quite a few
minutes after he had been taken out from the Leppings
Lane terraces.

In the light of the evidence can you help us as to what
you think was going on on? - A. Yes, sir.   I will deal
with this in three general areas and then Dr. Gumpert
certainly will come and enlarge on these and help us
out further.

Firstly, and I apologise if this is an emotive area, I
think I need just to spend thirty seconds in explaining
what death is.   Death is a sequence of events.   It is
not one set event and the sequence I will put to you is
an individual becoming unconscious;  whilst they are
unconscious they quickly lose all sensation of pain and
discomfort;  then there is a period of various tissues
in the body which are susceptible to a lack of oxygen,
dying.   The most important one of these is, of course,
the brain, and after about three to six minutes the
brain undergoes irreversible brain damage.    There is
then a point which we call brain death.    This is a
difficult concept, but by this I am implying that the
brain is irreversibly damaged.   The brain is no longer
able to control respiration and in fact that person,
for effective purposes, is dead, irreversibly.    That
is a medico legal definition, at least one medico legal
definition, of death.

The problem now comes that I have not mentioned other
tissues in the body.   For example, the heart, a very
emotive organ.   When somebody is brain dead it is
quite possible that the heart is still alive and still
beating and this can go on for a few minutes or longer,
perhaps even half an hour.

Then we come to the point where the brain is dead, not
controlling respiration, and finally the heart stops
and that is really the point of whole body death and
that is really what the lay person understands by
death.  A doctor going up, putting the stethoscope on
the chest, no heart beat, no respiration, then that
person is unequivocally dead.

I hasten to add there that although the person is truly
medico legally dead, in fact even then there are
tissues in the body that are still alive.   The skin is
still living.   The kidneys are still living.    This is
how we can then transplant them.   In fact it is an
emotive area and although that person is dead, there
are still tissues living.   It then takes another six
to twelve hours for all the tissues in the body to die.

Really, when we use the word "death" we have to be
very, very careful we are not talking about one set
event at one point in time.   We are talking about a
whole continuum of events that go on.

I mentioned that some tissues do not die as rapidly as
the brain and this includes both nerves and muscle.
In fact one can have a situation of somebody being
brain dead but the muscles and the nerves in what we
call the peripheral nervous system - not the brain -
are still living and in fact these can occasionally
function in some way.

Sir, that is a general comment on death.

In relation to the Hillsborough incident, the sequence
that myself has given, and although I have not heard
the other pathologists I understand they have given a
very similar sequence of events, has been a rapid loss
of consciousness, perhaps five to ten seconds.   I
understand I have been the nearest by quoting a paper

                     -   11 -
                        where unconsciousness can be instantaneous,   That is
                        the rapid loss of consciousness.

                        As soon as that person becomes unconscious I have said
                        several times that pain modalities, discomfort, again
                        disappear very, very quickly, perhaps within a second
                        or five seconds.
                    B   In very general terms, certainly myself - and I have
                        tried to keep it general - I then said that death - and
                        I have used the word very broadly, as you will
                        appreciate in my previous evidence - that death occurs
                        five, ten perhaps fifteen minutes after.   I purposely
                        kept that very open because human beings are very
                        variable.   You cannot say that somebody is going to
                        die in fifteen minutes, and not in fifteen minutes.

                        I am trying to put the concept that although I have
                        talked about averages, very occasionally you are going
                        to have additional extremes.   I think Kevin was one of
                        these extremes that did not fall into this five, ten or
                        fifteen minute sequence of somatic death, whole body
                        death, but in fact this was extended.
                    D
                        Having said that, Kevin had extremely severe asphyxia.
                        I have no doubt in my own mind that he had suffered
                        irrecoverable brain damage and death within the three
                        to six minutes that I said.   Therefore, I am quite
                        confident at that time that Kevin was dead and there is
                        nothing that anybody on this earth could have done for
                        him after that time, including PC Bruder and any
                    E   ambulance people who arrived.

                        Again, you will appreciate from what I have said to you
                        that although Kevin was brain dead I have not said that
                        other tissues in the body may not have been living -
                        the heart, muscles, nerves.   In fact I know Dr.
                        Gumpert will explain in a minute that in fact there are
                        mechanisms whereby when somebody is brain dead in fact
                        the muscles in the body can twitch.   This will come as
                        a surprise, and I apologise if it is emotive, this can
                        even happen to somebody who hasn't got a head.    That
                        person is clearly dead, they haven't got a head, but
                        those persons can actually have twitches in their
                        muscles.   This is what happened to Kevin.   He died
                        early - brain death - but unfortunately in this
                        particular instance we are talking about an extreme
                        case where perhaps the heat beating went on for a bit
                        longer and we noticed these twitches, at least PC.
                        Bruder noticed these twitches in the body.

                        I feel this is what happened in the case of Kevin.

                         . From the description - in fact it is only fair to say
                           you also had a word with PC Bruder because you were
                           concerned, you wanted to be quite sure that you
                           understood his evidence personally, so to speak? - A.
                           Yes, sir.

                        Q. In the light of what you heard and what we have heard
                           now, do you feel that this lad died, if you like, in
                    B      the totality sense, I don’t meant that his skin was
                           dead, but in lay terms at the point in time when Mr.
                           Bruder was with him? - A. Yes, sir, I am quite
                           confident of that.   When one speaks to lay people who
                           have experienced people dying, a word which is
                           recurrent in these descriptions of death is the way
                           that individuals turn grey.   In fact I was very
                           impressed by the content in PC Bruder's statement of
                           the word "grey", recurring several times.   To me as a
                           doctor that implied that that was the point of whole
                           body death.   In fact I feel that it was probably
                           around that time that Kevin's whole body died.    His
                           brain had died twenty/twenty five minutes before that
                           at the time of the crushing, but his whole body died at
                           the time PC Bruder was with him.
                    D
                        Q-   We have mentioned these twitches and I think sometimes
                             they are referred to as spinal reflexes? - A. that is
                             correct, sir.

                                  THE CORONER:   Now, Mr. Fraser, is that reasonably
                             clear?

                    E             MR. FRASER:   Even to me, sir, thank you, and I am
                             sure it will be clear to the family.

                                  THE CORONER:   Any questions?

                                         Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:

                             Doctor, it is an emotive subject.   I remember in your
                             evidence about Kevin you described death in terms of a
                             process rather than as a moment? - A. Yes.

                        Q.   I would like to ask you a few questions about the
                             process following unconsciousness.   As I understand
                             it, in the cases of these victims, unconsciousness has
                             come ten to twenty seconds after compression of the
                             chest? - A. Yes.

                        Q-   That is as a result of oxygen to blood mix leading to
                             unconsciousness? - A. Yes.   There are various...    We
                             are now not talking about the actual cause of death,
                             but mechanisms.   One very profound view that has been
                             put forward of crush asphyxia, traumatic asphyxia, it
                             is not simply only the reduction of oxygen going to the
                    H                             -   13 -

                          brain, but the fact that in fact there cannot be
                          circulation through the brain.   The pressure from the
                          chest is reflected up into the brain so in fact
                          effectively the cerebral circulation stops, so it comes
                          up against a dead end and it cannot circulate round.
                          But, yes, your concept then is right.

                          Following unconsciousness, that is to say, twenty
                    B     seconds, say, after the start of the crush becoming
                          fatal, is the body capable of facial expressions or
                          does it have a neutral expression? - A. First of all
                          the word "unconscious" itself is a very vague term, as
                          you probably appreciate.    There are varying degrees of
                          unconsciousness - superficial unconsciousness, perhaps
                          a sort of sleeping...    You are unconscious, really,
                          when you are sleeping, and then, of course,
                          unconsciousness becomes deeper and deeper and deeper.
                          The deeper bit is when one truly loses pain sensations
                          and in fact in this particular instance having spoken
                          both to Dr. Gumpert and, indeed, a consultant
                          anaesthetist, everybody I have spoken to is confident
                          that pain modalities have disappeared very quickly,
                          perhaps within one or two seconds, five seconds is the
                    D     longest I have heard somebody express.

                        Q . As I understand your evidence, foil owing that short
                            period of five, ten, twenty seconds at the most, there
                            is profound unconsciousness rather than, say, the
                            unconsciousness of sleep.   Is the face then of the
                            unconscious person, the profoundly unconscious person,
                            capable of expression of any sort, or is there a
                    E       neutral expression? - A. I think I prefer to leave that
                            to Dr. Gumpert because you are into a clinical area
                            there of what we call reflexes.   I am not trying to
                            avoid the question.   I think he wi 11 be able to give
                            you a very expert professional witn ess reply to that.
                            Would that be reasonable to you?

                                MR. LIMB:   Certainly.     Sir, may I pursue that
                           matter with Mr. Gumpert?

                                THE CORONER:   Certainly.    I want to be as
                           helpful as I can.   It is a difficult subject and in a
                           sense we are slotting it into the inquest of this poor
                           boy, but it is a more general topic and it will, of
                           course, apply in a sense to everybody, but I don’t see
                           how we can avoid doing it.    Please do pursue it with
                           Dr. Gumpert.

                                Thank you, Dr. Slater.

       DR. ERNEST JOHN WALLACE GUMPERT Sworn

                  By THE CORONER:

Dr. Gumpert, could you first of all give us your full
names, qualifications and appointment? - A. Ernest John
Wallace Gumpert.   I am a Bachelor of Medicine of the
University at Cambridge, Bachelor of Surgery of the
University of Cambridge.   A Member of the Royal
College of Surgeons and a Fellow of the Royal College
of Physicians of London.   I am consulting clinical
neuro physiologist and consulting neurologist to the
Sheffield Area Health Authority, Teaching.

Dr. Gumpert, although you are a Sheffield man
professionally, I dragged you back from Cambridge
today? - A. Yes, sir.

Where I tracked you down!   I very much appreciate the
fact you dropped all your other arrangements in order
to be here.   Thank you very much.   Dr. Gumpert, you,
of course, had nothing whatever to do with this case.
I think you dealt with quite a lot of the injured
following Hillsborough and indeed you may well know one
or two people I will be referring to later, but this
particular case was not one you came across.   You have
heard the evidence which has been put regarding this
young man.   What I would like you to do now is to give
us a short explanation, as you see death, in the first
instance and then we will try and relate it to this
young man and particularly Mr. Bruder's evidence
relating to him. - A. In about 1979 or 1980 when it
became possible to carry out renal transplantations or
kidney transplantations, it became very important that
the supply of kidneys of people who had died acutely,
usually in accidents, could be increased because the
life of a patient who has had a kidney transplant is
completely different to the life of a patient who has
to have dialysis three times a week.   They can go back
to normal life.

A hypothesis of brain death was then discussed, agreed
and published.    This consisted of certain examinations
of the back part of the brain, the part we call the
brain stem.    If you imagine the brain as being like a
walnut, and it is, it is like having a carrot stuck
underneath the walnut, and it is the carrot that
matters.    This is where blood pressure, pulse,
respiration and a whole variety of other functions are
controlled.    Once this part of the brain is dead, and
this death occurs, as you heard from Dr. Slater, in
between four and six minutes after deprivation of
oxygen, then the person is going to die.    They can be
kept alive by artificial means and some of you may
remember the case in America which was kept alive for
thirteen and a half years.

Some of us were concerned that the guidelines that were
drawn up were not strict enough and that there was no
call for them to be repeated after a passage of time.
Perhaps unwisely we said this and this resulted in a
BBC "Panorama" programme one night at ten o'clockwhen
the medical profession for once actually debated it,
eight of us.    As a result of that debate the
regulations were hardened.    They had to be carried out
by senior people who were used to doing it and they had
to be repeated.    A satisfactory outcome from my
personal point of view, although I don't know whether
the anguish was worth it really.

As a consequence of that I suppose in the next three
years I had to go through this rather unpleasant
procedure many times.   It was part of my professional
duty but still to this day I cannot certify someone
dead without being disturbed by it still.

From this I suppose I have gained a great deal of
experience of brain death and brain damage.   It seems
clear to me, sir, in this case that poor Kevin was
probably dead before he was got out of the area in
which he was standing.   I would agree with Dr. Slater.
I would think consciousness was lost probably within
ten seconds.   I would say loss of pain would be almost
instantaneous - not quite, but almost.

I cannot explain the Liverpool Police Constable's term
"convulsion 1 because to me a convulsion is a major
epileptic attack and he has quite clearly said he does
not mean that, so I don't know what he does mean.   I
think it would be wrong for me to try and guess what he
means.   I think we could accept that he does not mean
any significant movement.

Unfortunately, after people are brain stem dead, they
can twitch and very unnerving it is too.   This is
really due to a spinal reflex. What we think happens
in anoxia - lack of oxygen - is that the brain stem
dies first.   The cortex, that is the thinking part of
the brain, your walnut, probably goes on quite a bit
longer and the peripheral nervous system probably quite
a bit long still and I think that is the explanation of
what has been described by the Liverpool officer.

I know the Liverpool officer in his supplemental
statement when he was discussing the question of a
pulse says he may have been mistaken, but let us
hypothesise that in fact he wasn't and he had felt a
                        pulse when he approached this young man on the pitch,
                        would that fit in with your understanding...   Is that
                        a possibility? - A. It is a possibility, sir.   I would
                        like just to observe that feeling the carotid pulse is
                        quite difficult in somebody who has got a low blood
                        pressure, as would have been here.   In fact it can be
                        so difficult it is impossible and you have to put an
                        electrocardiogram on to know whether the heart has
                    B   stopped or not.

                        I would also like to say something about resuscitation.
                        I was very fortunate when I qualified that I became
                        house surgeon of a famous heart surgeon called Lord
                        Brock at Guy's Hospital.   That was in the days when we
                        did open cardiac massage.   In other words, if somebody
                        died you opened their chest and you massaged their
                        heart between your hands.   A terrifying experience.
                        It was while I was working for him that one day three
                        of us were doing it one morning, that he stopped it,
                        and that was the start of external cardiac massage.
                        Even to somebody like me who has been doing it for
                        twenty-five years, it is still very difficult.    The
                        last time I tried to do it I failed completely.    Even
                    D   to a trained person it is difficult.   Indeed, when
                        junior doctors are examined for this now, as they are,
                        a significant number fail rather than pass.    It is
                        quite difficult and for the lay person it must be
                        incredibly difficult.

                        You heard Dr. Slater’s account of death, shall we say.
                        Would you go along with that? - A. I thought it was
                    E   eloquent.   I felt quite nervous!

                        You mentioned this point about unconsciousness and the
                        loss of pain and I think you distinguish slightly
                        there.  Can you give me any idea that if a person
                        becomes unconscious, can he feel pain, and for how long
                        can he feel pain, in your judgment? - A. Again, Dr.
                        Slater put it very clearly.   You all read in the
                        newspapers about patients - particularly when they have
                        had caesarean sections, the ladies as usual - being
                        able to tell what the doctors were talking about during
                        the operation.   Again I have experienced this at first
                        hand when I was doing heart surgery because then it was
                        often very important not to depress the state of
                        consciousness too far because things were pretty tricky
                        anyhow.   When we used to resuscitate the patients we
                    G   used to give them an electric shock.   Lord Brock used
                        to always shout, "Give it two fast ones."   The patient
                        would then ask you the following morning two fast ones
                        were.   Then you would ask, "Did you hear anything
                        else?" and they didn’t, so it is all very much a
                        question of degree.

                          I think slipping from slight unconsciousness to deep
                          unconsciousness in this circumstance, one, because of
                          the compression and two because of the asphyxia and
                          three because as Dr. Slater again explained everything
                          is shoved up into the head and so there is nothing
                          moving around, it would have been very quick, almost as
                          quick as a rabbit punch I would have thought.
                    B          THE CORONER:      Mr. Fraser?

                               MR. FRASER:      No questions, sir.

                                       Cross-Examined by MR. LIMB:

                        Q. Dr. Gumpert you have spoken in terms of passing in a
                           very quick space of time from slight unconsciousness to
                           deep unconsciousness.   Following deep unconsciousness,
                           do the eyelids remain open or are they closed? - A.
                           Either may occur. There is no particular rule.    The
                           thing we all see on the cinema of the person going to
                           close the dead person's eyes.   I don't think I have
                           had to do that more than two or three times in my life.
                           Most of the people I have seen die have died with their
                    D      eyes shut.

                        Q. Deep unconsciousness is associated with no longer
                           feeling any pain or discomfort.   Is then the face of
                           the person who is profoundly unconscious capable of
                           grimaces or expressions which might be taken as showing
                           pain or discomfort? - A. Not in my view, sir.

                    E   Q. Is it in fact capable of any facial expression? - A.
                           Not in my view.

                        Q. Following profound unconsciousness, is it right that
                           the face will become discoloured towards the next stage
                           of the sequence of events, namely, brain damage and
                           thereafter brain death?

                                THE CORONER:     Could you repeat that question?

                                MR. LIMB:   I am referring back to the process, or
                           the sequences of events as outlined by Dr. Slater, sir.
                           Firstly, unconsciousness, thereafter brain damage and
                           thereafter again brain death.   The nature of my
                           inquiry was as to whether following profound
                           unconsciousness, although there may be no outward
                           expressions there is this change that the face becomes
                           discoloured?

                                THE CORONER:     The greyness you are driving at?

                                MR. LIMB:      Sir, that is right.

                                  THE WITNESS:   Are you asking me to say when I
                             think the greyness came on or just the way it changed?I
                             cannot tell you when it came on.   I think probably it
                             came on during the unconscious stage and I don't think
                             the face would change when the moment of death came,
                             total somatic death, I don't think there would be any
                             change.
                    B   0.        MR. LIMB:   Doctor, I am asking whether it happens
                             following the entry into unconsciousness towards the
                             next stage in the sequence, namely, brain damage? - A.
                             I don't think there is a change of facial expression at
                             the time of brain damage necessarily.   This change of
                             expression will be a gradually evolving process from
                             the minute the crush started.

                                     MR. LIMB:      Thank you, sir.

                                  THE WITNESS:   Sir, you cannot tell by looking at
                             a person that they are dead or unconscious, at least I
                             can't.   You can by feeling them but you can't by
                             looking at them.

                    D                            Further by THE CORONER:

                        Q. If a person has been, shall we say, somatically dead
                           for long enough, would you accept or would you agree
                           that sometimes the face goes paler? - A. Oh, it goes
                           paler, and becomes rigid and takes on a stare.   Yes,
                           that is quite different.

                    E                THE CORONER:      Anything else you wanted to ask on
                             that?

                                     MR. LIMB:      No, thank you, sir.

                                     MR. CATCHPOLE:         No questions, sir.

                                  THE CORONER:         Is there anything else we want to
                             ask Dr. Slater?         (No)

                                  Ladies and gentlemen, I will give you a chance.
                             It is emotive but it is also very interesting.   Is
                             there anything else while we have two experts here?
                             You have understood it as far as one is able to
                             understand it?

                                     THE FOREMAN:      Yes.

                                  THE CORONER:   Dr. Gumpert and Dr. Slater, may I
                             say to both of you, you have done remarkably well in
                             explaining what is clearly a very (a) emotive and (b)
                             difficult subject, succinctly and clearly to all of us
                             and I very much appreciate your help.   Dr. Slater has

                        had to come as well, but not quite so far, and I am
                        very grateful to you for taking the trouble and the
                        time to come and I am sure it will be of benefit not
                        just to Kevin's family, but to other people who of
                        course are involved in this tragedy as well.   Thank
                        you very much indeed.

                             MR. FRASER:    Sir, I will certainly make sure that
                    B   Kevin's family have the opportunity to see the
                        transcript of what the doctors have said and I am sure
                        they will feel some benefit from that when they feel
                        able to look at it.    Thank you, sir.

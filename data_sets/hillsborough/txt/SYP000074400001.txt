                    POLICE SERGEANT 7 6 7



                           DIVISION



                    At 8.45 am on Saturday 15/April              1989,    I commenced duty aJ^Woodseats

                    Police Station and was Vransported to the ground at Hillsborough



                    around 9.30 am                                       serial e ft ten men and was

                                                                                 *E2* Division.
                                                                             PAGE       2
                                                                             S1S&&

as scheduled with officers gathered in the North Stand.               Following

this briefing all officers took a packed meal which I collected for my

serial   from the gymnasium.      I also collected a radio and tickets for a

meal which was to b e     provided later in the day.



At about 11. 15 /Lm , my serial,    together with others, w e r / g a t h e r e d on

the Spion Kojp, where we were again b riefed by Superintendent Greenwood

as to the^sarticular      problems which we were likely to encounter           in the

part of the ground.        It was the responsibility of these serials to

Police this part of the ground for the duration of the match,               with

individual    serials undertaking specific tasks.



At approximately       11 .30 an><as per the instruction of the day, my

serial were deployed j/utside the ground on Penistone Road N o r t h .             We

were to Police tu^n^tiles 43 to 54 which gave entrance to the kop.



Throughout the next few hours we remained at the turnstiles

supervising the entrance of supporters which,           as time went on,

gradually built up to quite a large crowd.            Despite   this there were no

problems with the crowd and apart from the odd drunk or spectator

trying to gain entrance without tickets,            they were very well behaved

and quite jovial.       It never got to the stage where the crowd could

have been considered unruly or out of control.



As the start of tfoe game       a p proached,   I could hear messages over the

radio relating J u t   the other end of the      ground but was unaw.afre of any

real   problem^;    However,    shortly after the start of th* match I

received instruction via        the radio for my serial      Xgr go onto the

piaying a / e a .   I c a n ’t remember the exact   contend of the message

received,    but I formed the opinion that spectators at the Leppings
                                                                          PAGE       3
                                                                          S18&&

Lane end had invaded the playing area and that reinforcements were

required at that end.       I entered the ground with my serial and went up

to the side of the kop nearest to the South Stand.



On reaching a position^where      I could see the iyKp pings Lane end,       I saw

a large number of^/^eople on the playing aM^gfa, the game had obviously

been stopped       I saw what    I first thought to be fighting in and

around the goal mouth area at that end of the ground.            I entered the

playing area via a gat>?^*in the fence at the kop ant^-fan towards the

,Leppings Lane end.y' I   saw peop 1e still    comingyiWer the fence, Police

Officers ortf th^/fence apparently tryind to/stop people coming over and

what appeared to be a skirmishes      in various      parts of the playing area.

Spectators were coming towards me from that end and I assumed that

some of these were attempting to get at the Nottingham supporters who

were on the kop.    I honestly beleived at this time that we were on the

point of having to deal with a major          riot.



I also saw some people laying on the          ground who were obviously

suffering from some distress,      but again I thought that they had been

hurt as a result of fighting both on          the terrace and on the playing

area.   Messages were     coming over the     radio but there didn't appear     to

me to be anything that at this time I could comprehend,           it seemed as

though everyone wanted to used the radio at the same time.



It must have been a full      five minutes before      I realised the true

nature of the problem and by this time some of my officers h a d ’gone

forward to assist at the fence.       For myself,      I helped witly the injured

giving what first aid I could and also helped to carry Wrne of the

injured to the casualty area which had been set up at the North East

corner of the pitch.      I was still aware of the possibility of
                                                                           PAGE   4
                                                                           S1

fighting breaking out between those on the playing area and those on

the kop.     Many of those who had managed to escape from the Leppings

Lane terrace were very angry and abusive to nobody in particular.

Some had been drinking and were,          in my view,   drunk.   Some were so

angry and frustrated at what had happened that I felt that they were

itching for a fight and that they did not particularly care who they

fought with.



Once general order,1nad been restored,         I gathered my men togeth4$r and

then we ^.formed part of a cordon/that had been placed a c r o s y the pitch

as there stiLd seemed to be\ a/real         danger that rival supporters were

ready to clash at the first opportunity.



When the decision/was taken to abandon t h e ^ a m e , my serial was

instructed to /evert to the arranged scharalule and that was to

supervise t#e loading of the Nottingham? Forest supporters onto the

trans po y y that was waiting     in Penist|o/>e Road North.     This was done

with no problems and when finally the area was clear we attended a

debriefing    in the North S t a n d .   We were eventually stood down at

about 6.30 pm and were       returned to Woodseats Police Station at a b o u t 7.

15 pm where    I went off d u t y .

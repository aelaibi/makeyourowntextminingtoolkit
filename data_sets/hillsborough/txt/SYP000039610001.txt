  _§.     — K?S.— Anderson - Asst. Chief Constable                           18th September 1989.


Dear Mr. Anderson,


I    am    writing     to   you   as    I    understand       that    you   are   responsible    for
discipline within the South Yorkshire Police Force.


I am the father of Adam Edward Spearritt who was tragically lost in t-hft
disaster and




I wish to complain that an officer (whom I believe to be P.c.                            Illingworth
of   the track side serial             ) neglected        to discharge his duty,         in that he
failed     to   open   Gate   4   in   the   perimeter       fence,    despite my       loud appeals
directly to him and his close proximity to our position.


I consider      his    failure    to act      had   a direct      bearing    on   the    loss of my
son.
Please record my complaint and place in hand the neccessary procedures.


Yours Sincerly,                              80U TH YORK8. POLICE

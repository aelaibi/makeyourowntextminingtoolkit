               On Saturday 15th April             1989 (150489)       I paraded on duty at Main St at

               7.45 am (0745) and with other officers was then conveyed to the pre-

               match briefing at Hi Ilsbo/ough Stadium.

               end of the ground.

                                                              first made aware of a problem

          Sho rt ly aTter arriving the re , Serial 5(;               directed into the ground

          through entrance C.           The forecourt at that time had been partially

          cleared,     but it was obvious something serious had occurred by the

          conduct of supporters.             I personally was approached by several youths,
                                                                    /
          obviously angry and annoyed, and was subj^dted to verbal abuse,

          because in their view, we were late arriving.                    I was then physi cally

          manhandled towards the ttranel benealH the West S t a n d .
                                           X E / -------------------
          On entering the ttinnel / A was met with several people carrying

          ’bo di es ’ oul/and jny f^/st d u t ^ ’was to assist two fans with one such

          person whom they Iwe r/k TtarviTng difficulty with because of his size.

          This person at that time was still alive and on reaching the

          forecourt. I commenced resuscitation before being relieved by an

          a mbu lanc eman .     /

          I then re-entered the tunnel a nd went to the terracing,                  referred to as

          Pen 3.     T/hy f^rst/^hing that struck me was the stench of stale

          pers pi ration, ^ n d     ^ri'cfoho 1.    Fans were screaming at me and other

          officers to ’get summat do ne .’              I went to the foot of the terrace and

          saw a ’pi le ’ of persons.               It seemed to me they were at least 5 or 6

          deep.    Entwined in these bodies was part of a crush barrier which had

i % t ^ £ ,'°Ilap5ed
          I then began to remove the firjjft / boc^ ’ I could get hold of which was

          partly trapped by the cruslxXa r r *er/l Eventually it was released and

          dragged through the perimeter fence gate on to the pitch.                    I was

          satisfied that person was dead and could be no further helped.                       I,

          therefore,     went back onto the terrace and assisted in the recovery to

          the pitch,     of a further 4 persons.             In my view,   they were beyond help.
                                                                             PAGE        3
                                                                             S2SS4

    By this time advertising hoardings were being made into make shift

    stretchers and fans were placing      'bodies’ thereon and conveying them

    to the Penistone Rd end of the ground.

    In my view their efforts were doomed to failure,         but I did not

    consider it prudent to try and tell them that at that time.            They were

    obviously very angry,    distraught and upset, and most of them were

    influenced by alcohol, and would not have listened to reason at that

    t ime .

    I, therefore, assisted one such party JErtT convey a youth to the stand

    near to the entrance to the gymn ^ ^ Ki m .   I supervised the placing of

    the stretcher under the stand and made an examination of the person,

a   but satisfied myself that life appeared to be extinct.           One of the

    fans with me at that time obviously knew the deceased,          so I advised

    him to remain with the body.       I then returned via the pitch to the

    Leppings Ln end.

    By that time, as far as I could see, all the bodies had been removed

    from the terraces either onto the pitch or out of the ground.

    I was then involved for what seemed a lengthy period in generally

    trying to placate    irate Liverpool supporters.

    At one point,   I had to intervene to prevent a newspaper ^hfotojyf'apher

    being physically assaulted for trying to take pi cture s / o | M e c e a s e d and

    grieving relatives.     In my view,   their conduct was repre'foenj

    is not justified by them stating that they are         'just doing their j o b . ’

    There was a brief moment also when the Forest fans taunted the

    Liverpool   fans which caused the latter to run towards the Penistone Rd

    end of the ground and,     in my view,   had not the fences been in place at

    that end, there may well have been a serious law and order situation

    break out as well.     This appeared to be later      controlled by a line of

    officers across the pitch.

    During this time,    I became separated from the rest of Serial 53 a n d

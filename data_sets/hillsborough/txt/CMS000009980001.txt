Encs
I am writing in reply to your letter of 11 May to John Patten
about the setting up of the Football Licensing Authority                                      (the
FLA) . I have also seen your letter in the Independent of 4 June.


The Government remains committed to appointing the FLA as soon
as possible.         It has taken longer than we had expected but I hope
that we shall be able                  to    make      an       announcement          about       its
membership quite soon.


I should stress that we have never implied that the FLA would
become operational on '1 June.                    In fact for entirely practical
reasons it is unlikely that the new licensing system will become
fully    effective      for     some    months.             A    considerable         amount       of
preparatory work has been completed in consequence of the changed
emphasis       in the    role    of    the Authority,                 but    the    FLA    will    be
exercising       entirely     new      functions        and       it will          take    time    to
recruit and train its staff and inspectors.


I   can understand        that    the       football        authorities            will    wish    to
discuss a range of issues with the FLA as soon as possible.                                       But
it would be quite misleading to suggest that the football clubs
must wait for the FLA to be set up before making the improvements
to their grounds proposed by Lord Justice Taylor.


The     Government's       view       has        always         been    that        the    primary
responsibility          for     responding             to       Lord        Justice       Taylor's
recommendations on all seated accommodation rests with the clubs
themselves.          The Taylor report is quite clear in recommending
that standing accommodation should be progressively removed by
1993,    1994 or 1999, depending on the nature of the matches for
which    the    grounds     are used.             In   order       to meet         that    overall
timetable,      clubs will need to be planning -indeed should have
been planning for the past 6 months - on how they will achieve
it.


The     FLA   will    itself     have       no    powers         to    require       all    seated
accommodation unless the Home Secretary makes                                 a direction          in
respect       of a particular          football        ground.          When the licensing
scheme is in operation, we shall be looking to the FLA to advise
us   on the progress which               is being made by clubs                  towards    all
seated accommodation, but in the first instance at least it will
be   for    them      to    decide     whether       to       simply       reduce     standing
accommodation or to make proposals for additional seating using
t^eir own funds or those which the Government has made available
through the Football Trust in consequence of the reduction in
pools betting tax.


Only in those cases where progress is unsatisfactory should it
be necessary to resort to a formal direction.                             We hope these will
be few.


I have      already        indicated     to    representatives             of   the   Football
Association and the Football League that we shall not insist on
strict adherence to Lord Justice Taylor's interim timetable if
satisfactory progress is being made.                         The interim timetable as
you will know envisaged reductions of standing capacity by 2 0%
or 10% a year depending on the type of match being played but
regardless       of     the     amount        of   seated          accommodation        already
provided.


We accept that there may be a need to prioritise the available
funds.      We also recognise that it might suit some clubs to make
major    changes      to    their     grounds which           will     exceed     the    Taylor
recommendations.            We also want clubs to make use of the available
money      to   improve       their    accommodation,               not     simply     to   make
piecemeal       changes,        particularly            if    they        are   unlikely      to
contribute to improvements in safety or public order.                                 This does
not mean that we shall expect the interim timetable to be ignored
altogether.        For example it will not be open to a club to avoid
reducing standing accommodation for no reason other than that it
has plans for major redevelopment at some ill-defined date in the
future.


I have now had discussions with representatives of the Football
Association,          the     Football        League,        the     Football       Spectators
Association, the National Federation of Football Supporters Clubs
and the Hillsborough Family Support Group.        We are all committed
to the improvement of safety and amenity at football grounds.
The creation of the Football Licensing Authority should provide
an   effective   new   means   of   monitoring   safety   standards   and
ensuring that satisfactory progress is made.          But it would be
wrong to infer that that process of improvement cannot start
until the Football Licensing Authority is appointed.

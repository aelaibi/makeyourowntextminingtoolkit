               queuing          by that        I mean    it was    quite     orderly.     I got    to the    front         of

               the turnstiles                 before    I realised that we were           in the wrong area.                We

               all    then made our way back and went                        to the    next   block    of turnstiles.

               At these           turnstiles       there was        no queuing    it was more a mass            of    people.

               We joined the mass,                 as we got        nearer    to the    turnstiles      it became          very

               s e parated from my brother and                      cousin.     I could see my brother               by the

               blue        corrogated fence             lifting a young        lad up onto       the   fence.        There

               was a surge              forward.

             th© horse          out.    The   next     thing    I knew       I was kicl-Vedvfn the head,                     I.

             looked       round and saw that            it was       the    p o l i c e m a n ’s foot.      The      horse was

             becoming        uneasy and        I was wa r n e d that         it might       rear up.           The     policeman

             was    trying       to get    the >f5Vse out and as               it m o v e d forward the horse

             stood on my left             f o^ft.     I then went          into a daze and the              next       thing       I

             remember        I wasN-arp against         the    bar    of the turnstile,              I handed my ticket

             in and as          1 was   going through the turnstile                    I was    pushed and             I fell          to

             the    ground.        I got up and walked               through       into    the yard.           At    the

             turnstiles          I received no directions                  from a Police Officer                 or a

             Steward.           I. waited at/uhe        back of the          t u rnstiles      for               and

             to    come    through,       ymey      a p p e a r e d about    five minutes         later and we all

 CAr         then made our              y to the       tunnel.        1 had a free          passage along              the

             tunnel       and nar Police         or Stewards         were    present       in the tunnel.



             At the end of/Che             tunnel      we went       into the       left hand        pen,      which       I now

             know       :ts Pen A .     At this       time    it was       reasonably empty,             the     pen to the

             right wa\yf'ull.             My brother was          upset and he m a r c h e d down to the                      front

             of the       pen.     My    cousin grabbed me and said                  "This     is not the way we

             went       in last",       I shouted      to my brother and we all                 three       then went             back

             out    through the tunnel,               it was    now about 7 minutes               to three           (1453

             hrs) »       The    tunnel    was      quiet anm     I followed rny cousin and went                        round

             into Pen 7.           I got      into Pen / at 2 .55            pm    (14-35 hrs)       and the         players

              still     a bit winded from what                  had happened,           I looked across           the    pens

              b ehind the goals and                could see       people      climbing       out,      I saw the kick

              off and then tried to                 concentrate         on the      ground,         I then saw a

              Po 1 i ceman       run onto     the    pitch,      I again       1(3oked to the         pens t e h i n d the

              police were           telling     them to get         back      in.     I w a t c h e d for about 5

              m inu t e s    but    it all    became       too much for me,            so    I .left the       pen and went

              out    of the ground,            W hen    I was going           through the          court yard     I could

              see a large           number    of    people      lying on the         ground wit h first aid

              a tten d a n t s     around    them.      It must        have    been about 3,20           pm    (1520 hrs)

              when    I left        the   ground,       I then made my way              back       to the Pub where we

              had been for a drink,                 as this was where we had a r r a n g e d                  to meet.



              Throughout           the whole       incident      I did not witness                a criminal     offence.

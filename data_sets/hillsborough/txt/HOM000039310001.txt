FILE NOTE OF TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MATTHEW PYNE ON 16
SEPTEMBER 1998



I spoke to M Pyne this morning to follow up the request o f 10 September. He said that all the
statements had been returned to South Yorkshire Police following the Scrutiny’ and that the
Home Office were not holding any material.

He said that he had asked South Yorkshire Police for all the material we had asked for, and
referred me to Ian Daines’ letter regarding SYP awaiting legal advice.

     Dear Sir

     J refer to previous correspondence, and in particular my letter to you of 24th July (copy
     enclosed) which detailed the statements and parts of statements which we have still not
     received.

     Despite reminders and a telephone conversation there is a substantial amount o f material
     outstanding and this causes great concern. I have, therefore, requested Maria Eagle MP to
     help us expedite matters and I know that she has been in touch with you.

     I trust that this matter can be resolved quickly and I look forward to an early reply.

     Yours faithfully

FILE NOTE


CONVERSATION WITH MATTHEW PYNE - 20 JULY 1998




I asked if there had been any progress with the requests for information from
SYP. MP said that there had not been any further response from S YP and that
he would chase them up.

I asked about the request o f 21 May for details o f the abbreviations used in the
statements, as on 28 May Ken Greenway assured me he had replied to the Home
Office. MP said there certainly had been no reply as it would have been
forwarded to us immediately.

I rang a second time with a request for a copy o f the Taylor Inquiry transcripts of
evidence for June 7th am. He said that the Home Office did not have a copy and
we should try the Public Records Office.

Thank you for your copy correspondence to Matthew Pyne, which resulted in the discovery of
 separate tiles which ‘ by genuine oversight’ had not been included in the material disclosed
to us earlier.

 enclose a copy o f a letter sent by Ann Taylor to one of her constituents, in which the Home
 ecretary states that as much as possible documentary evidence was now in place in the House
lbraiy realise that you have not had a response to your letter, but wondered if it would be
possible to ascertain whether or not the transcripts o f PS Appleton and others' meetings with
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith were available?

Thanks again for your help.

 Dear Sir

Thank you for your letter of 12th June and the enclosed statements. Statement number R566D
(Brooke) was not included, is this one of the outstanding issues with SYP? In addition to
those statements I have requested, R109 (Wallace) and R336 (Huckstepp) also appear to be
missing.

You refer to Sergeant John Morgan’s statement being allocated two document numbers, yet in
other examples of the same error occurring, both numbers have a copy of the same statement.
(Eg QOR2 and QOR46). You also include the statements of QOR59 Sanderson as already
being registered under R306. We have not yet been informed of the relationship between the
QOR and ORMNF files, but I query'whether the same statement could be included in both
systems.

With reference to R293 (Illingworth), the copy we received from you was the amended
version, and I should be grateful if you would forward a copy of the original unamended
statement.

Thank you for your assistance.

Yours faithfully

 Dear Ms Adlington


 I am sorry that you have not received an earlier reply to your earlier letters about the police
 statements on Hillsborough.

 I have now received the enclosed statements from South Yorkshire Police relating to:

   QOR497 JO H N SO N                                 R233 MARSHALL
   QOR89 NEILD                                        R232 MURRAY

   R239 DELANEY


  I am sorry for the delay in supplying this material. It appears that these statements were held on
  separate files from the remaining statements and, by genuine oversight, were not included among
  those disclosed earlier.

  I understand that, due to an error, Sergeant John Morgan’s statement was allocated two document
  numbers- R30 and R267. They refer to the same statement and you should have already received this
  document.

  Likewise, QOR59 Sanderson was already registered as R306 and should be among the documents
  already disclosed.
You indicated that it was impossible to say who the author was in respect of statements QOR86,
QOR93 and QOR96. The author will be the officer named on the front of the reports. To the best
of our knowledge the reports were complete. You may care to liaise with PC Greenway at South
Yorkshire if there is any difficulty with this.

I understand that the statements of QOR95 Cropley and QOR145 Drabble should be both the
original and amended versions, attached together.

I am not clear about your letter of 21 May which indicates you are missing statements R1 to R93.
Can you clarify whether you are referring to the index or the statements themselves?

I am still awaiting a response from South Yorkshire Police on the outstanding issues.

                                           Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Pyne

Re: Hillsborough Family Support G roup

I have a copy of your letter of the 7th May last to the above, and Inote              it’s
contents. I would, however, seek clarification on the following points:

       1) Has all the material placed in the House of Commons library beencopied'
         also to the Hillsborough Family Support Group?

       2) Is this all of the material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,
          including transcripts of meetings of him with witnesses, and/or members
          of his staff, with witnesses?

       3) Can you itemise which pieces of material have not been lodged in the
          HOC library, and the reasons for their omission?

       4) Can you itemise that material awaiting the confirmation of agreement
       " tO'disclosure by interested parties?

Your assistance in these matters would be greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely

I refer to previous correspondence and in particular my letters of 24th April, 28th April, 1st May
and 6‘ May. I should be grateful if you would supply me with a copy of the statements
referred to therein as a matter of urgency.

Further, the index of the documentation previously supplied and entitled “Officer Reports

statements R1 to R93. Could you please provide me with a copy of the same.

Also, I am still awaiting a response to my letter of 7th May.

Finally, could you please ascertain from South Yorkshire Police what the abbreviations
“Q.O.R” and “F.I.O.” stand for.

I thank you for your assistance.

           Dear Peter

          As you are aware the HFSG is anxious to secure a copy of all material considered by Lord
          Justice ^art-Smith together with transcripts of his meetings with witnesses and other people
          w o assisted him However the Home Office are insisting that Jack Straw’s undertaking
          extends only to placing material in the House of Commons Library. (Please see attached
           etter;. i he Group cannot even ascertain what has been placed in the Library and would ask
          you to obtain a copy of all supporting material, if possible.

          Thank you for your assistance.


          Yours sincerely

  Dear Ms Adlington



  Thank you for your letters of 28 April and 1 May about the disclosure of evidence considered by
  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

  The Home Secretary’s undertaking on the day of his statement was to publish as much of the
  material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith as possible, by placing it in the House of Commons
  Library. This has been done other than where we are awaiting confirmation that the parties
  concerned are content for disclosure to take place. In response to a specific request from Peter
  Kilfoyle MP, copies of all the original and amended police statements were also sent to the Family
  Support Group on 16 April. I am not aware of any further undertaking in relation to the supply of .
^piaterial to the Family Support Group.

 You refer in your letter of 28 April to one specific item of correspondence from ACC Mervyn Jones
 to David Brummell, the r e p l y to which is contained in Appendis 8, p213 of the Scrutiny Report. I
 enclose a copy of ACC Jones’ letter of 7 June 1989 as requested.

 You enclosed with your letter signed authorities from 11 Members of the Hillsborough Family
 Support Group for the disclosure of material which forms Appendix 9 of the Report. I understand
 that you are still awaiting w ritten confirmation that the family of Kevin Williams are content for the
 publication of the appendix. If this can be confirmed, we should be able to arrange for it to be placed
 in the House of Commons Library. In the meantime, it is, of course, a matter for the families
 concerned to decide whether to publish the constituent parts of appendix 9.




 f:\oppu\complnts\letter\mp-0557.doc
I am sorry that you did not receive copies of the police statements referred to in your letter of 1 May.
I understand from South Yorkshire Police that, in error, Sergeant Morgan’s details were actually
recorded twice. His statement should appear as document R267. Please let me know if you have any
difficulty locating this. Superintendent McKay’s statement and that of Inspector Hand-Davis are
being obtained from South Yorkshire Police and I will forward copies as soon as possible. Neither
statement was among those amended before submission to the Taylor inquiry.

                                            Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

I refer to your telephone conversation with Kathy Durham on 20 April regarding the
disclosure of all the evidence considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

You will recall that when the Home Secretary announced the establishment of the
Hillsborough Scrutiny to the House of Commons on 30th June 1997, he was asked whether he
would publish all the evidence considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. He replied that he
would do his best to ensure that this would be the case. He stressed, however, that there may
be good reasons why such evidence could not be published, “for example, in respect of
criminal or disciplinary proceedings.” Given that the Report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
advises against the taking of either type of proceedings, I await your confirmation that, the
Hillsborough Family Support Group will be supplied with a copy of all the evidence including
transcripts of all meetings with witnesses and others who assisted Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in
the Scrutiny.

In particular, families would also like to see a copy of the letter from ACC Mervyn Jones
dated 7th June 1989 which is referred to in the Treasury Solicitor’s letter of the same date
(Appendix 8, page 213) together with details of the personal undertaking given by Mervyn
Jones to the then Chief Constable of South Yorkshire.

I would remind you that in his statement to the House on 18th February, Jack Straw stated as
follows:-

“As I told the shadow Home Secretary, I am arranging for the other material considered by
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to be placed in the Library of the House, save where there are
overriding reasons for doing otherwise. Let me make it clear that the material that will be

                                          Page 1 o f 2
published will include all the original statements made by South Yorkshire police officers,
together with the amended versions submitted to the Taylor inquiry.”

Finally, as previously discussed I am enclosing signed authorities from all members of the
HFSG confirming their agreement to the publication of Appendix 9 in its entirety. Can you
please supply me with a copy of the same and confirm that this Appendix will also be placed
the Library of the House.

Yours faithfully

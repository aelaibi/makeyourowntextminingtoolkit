           I am a single man and live at the above address with my parents.On

           Saturday 15 April     1989 (1504895,   I attended the FA Cup Semi Final

           match at Hillsborough Football Ground, Sheffield played between

           Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.        I am a Liverpool Supporter all my

           life and have been a regular attender at matches for many years, and

           rnainly go to away games.

           1 went to the match in a privately organised party travelling by mini

           bus to the match from Liverpool        the trip was organised by



           1 don't know everyone that travelled in the party but on the mini bus

           were           and his son,        they live in Maghull they have already

           been seen by the Police, Gary Jones,                               , he died a!

           the match,         ne was Gary's cousin, the others were friends of
                                                                           PAGE   2


theirs.

                       I got my t i eke t f romI paid   6 for it and it was for

the Lappings Lane standing area.

We left Liverpool at about 10.30 am and we travelled directly to

Sheffield, we did not stop on the w a y .      We were siightly delayed by

heavy traffic and road works on the M62 motorway.           We arrived in

Sheffield at about 1 pm.      We parked on the A61 6, about 1 mile from the

ground.     We all went for a drink and 1unch at a pub, I can *t remembe r

its name.     People wre obviously drinking a'lochol but I saw no

drunkeness it was just high spirits.

We left the pub at about 2.15 pm and walked down to the ground.

Whilst walking down I received no directions or escort from the

Police.     I saw at no time any drunkeness violence or disorder.

I got to the ground at about 2.30 pm.         When we got there it was

packed.     There were no queues,   it was just a mass of people.       Nobody

was trying to get it by pushing we just trying to get to the

turnstiles,    but it was just a bottleneck.      The crowd despite this was

good   humoured,   people were swaying and        ?     It was bit confusing at

first to see which turnstiles to use, but I

quickly figured out which ones to use and made my way towards them.

Our party had split up by this time, and I was on my own.           There were

four Police horses there trying to control the crowd, but as time went

on they became agg itated w :!.th the c rushi ng and in fact I

was butted in the head twice by one of the horses.           People were

beginning to get concerned with the horses and trying to get away from

them and that increased the crushing.         I became crushed up agaisnt the

metal barrier to the right hand side

of the terracing turnstiles,     this was at about 2.43 pm.       The crushing

became unbearable with people pushing from my left to get to the right

People were screaming by now for the gates to be opened to relieve the

pressure.    I became crushed against the wall next to the turnstiles,

but I managed to squeeze into the turnstile and handed my ticket.

Other than the four Police horses 1 saw no other Police or Steward

diretions outside the ground. Whilst trying to get into the ground I

saw others climbing onto the wall above the turnstiles and obviously

climbing into the ground.    Once in the turnstiles the mechanism that

lets you through had jammed,    probably due to the mass

of people pushing against it.    1 in actual fact had to climb over it

to get in.As I entered the ground I saw a PC standing next to the

turnstile.    I started shouting at him to open the gate on the right of

the turnstile as you come out of them.     The Officer said nothing to me

he just stood there blank featured.I went back to the turnstile and

helped a couple of people back over the barriers there as they were

getting crushed.This was about 2.50 pm.     I then saw the gates being

unlocked and opened by a Police Officer.     I turned to go into the

ground and headed towards the tunnel, as far as I was concerned it was

the only way into the terracing.

As 1 was in the tunnel I saw the terracing was already packed and I

turned to see if I could get back out, but I saw a large number of

people coming down behind me, although they wasn't running it was just

a rnass of people.

As I reached the bottom of the tunnel    I went .left.   I saw no Police

Officers or Stewards at any point in the tunnel either at the entrance

or at the end.

As I entered the terracing the flow of the crowd took me forward and

left.

Eventually I came across a barrier,    but I managed to go round it, but

I. was continually pushed forward.    The crushing was getting worse and

was becomming far worse than normal.     I thought the only way out was
                                                                          PAGE      4


towards the front,    but I couldn’t get there as I just came up against

a barrier of people and we stopped,       but the pressure was continuing

from behind.

I knew nothing of what was happening on the pitch.          X was just

concerned with my own safety.       Suddenly there was a massive surge from

behind.   I d o n ’t know what   caused it, butI’ve heard   since     that it was

Peter Beardesley hitting the bar.

This surge knocked the breath out of me there was no relief from it.

The only part of my body I       could move were my   eyes. Myhands      were

against my chest and a man       in front of me hadhis elbow     in my neck.

It was become very difficult to breath.        My body was being pushed one

way nd my head was being pushed the other way.         By now I wa s n ’t

breathing at all.     I began to feel my self becomming drowsy and

sleepy.   Other people were screaming to open the gates and let them

out.   I tried to but no sound would come out.        I thought I was dying,

my eyes felt heavy,    I remember thinking how tired I was,         I thought

that I should stop struggling.

I knew a man n e t   to me, his name is                     he lives in

                        its on the corner of

He has since told me that he managed to pull the elbow away from my

throat, although I didn’t see that.        I remember then my head flopping

to the side and my face was pushed into this mans PVC coat and I then

began to panic as I felt as if I was suffocating and. I managed to

struggle my face away from his coat.

My body was still being pulled to the left and as I struggled my head

free I fell down onto the floor.       As I fell 1 was right by the side

railings into the next pen, the small one.        I was able to start

breathing again but people were standing all over me and I managed to

curl up into a ball.

The people were standing on me and using me as a springboard to jump
                                                                       PAGE    5


over this side fence.      I grabbed the leg of a man who was jumping over

and as he went up he pulled me up and I grabbed the railings and

between being pushed from behind and being pulled from above I was

pulled over,

I sat down for a while I don't know how long and I saw the gate out

onto the pitch open, as 1 headed towards it I saw        man impalled on the

side fence trying to get over,     I helped them over.    I then saw a man

standing on the corner of the front fencing and the

side railings he was pulling people out and I instinctively jumped up

and joined him and helped him pull others out.

All I could see was a sea of hands all waving and asking to be pulled

out.     This was about 3.20 pm.   I could see there were fans and some

Police all along the fence at the front pulling people out, but there

only 6 or 7 police,     lots of others were standing around,   but just

didn't seem toknow what to do or comprehend      what was   happening.

Whilst helping      people out I began to go weak again and collapsed and

fell backwards.      I think it was a policeman that caught me, the next

thing I remember is being on the pitch being treated by a St Johns

Ambulance man and woman.

Next to me was      man being give mouth to mouth and heart massage by two

police officers.     The man being treated was a white man about 30-33

years,    the had   collar length ginger coloured hair, hehad blue eyes

that turned grey, his     face had gone blue and his body   was white, he

was wearing canvas trousers

                         He had freckles all over.     We were lying on the

pitch just to the right of the goals as you look at them from the

pitch.This man appeared to revive,                           and the

officers asked for a mouth piece from the St Johns man, he fumbled

about for one but I don't think he found one.        The officers continued

to try and revive him, but they lost him and he died.
                                                                       PAGE   6


I just lost my self control then with seeing this        man die and seeing

others being pulled out obviously dead,       I    walked round ina daze I

couldn’t speak and I was crying uncontrollably.        I was taken to the

side lines by the North Stnd and sat down.

I remember an ambulance coming past me,      it    almost ran over my foot.   I

remember se ing a mate standing -r.ear me cal 1ed

                     I think he was in the North Stand and came down to

help.

The next thing I remember is being rushed to the Northern General

Hopstial in Sheffield.




My views the whole incident are that it appepared so badly organised

in that the crowd were n’t controlled outside the

ground, although I w a s n ’t there last year,    I have heard there was a

cordon round the ground controlling the flow of fans to the ground.

That wa s n ’t there this year,   everyone was allowed to crowd round the

turnstiles.   The people in the control     room should have seen the

crushing in the terracing and should have been able to communicate to

the people outside the ground what was happening and have been able to

control the flow into the terracing and control the way the place was

filled.

The escape routes that existed when trouble started were non existant.

I had to climb over railings to escape from the crush, escape routes

should exist be it for crowd crushing or any other disaster.

Why were we penned in as that is an area used exclusively for away

supporters why do we need separated.       I thought that once down the
                                                                     PAGE      7


tunnel we would be able to fan out as at Anf ie1d .

The emergency drill didn’t seen to exist, all public places have

emergency exits in case of fires or bomb scares, but they didn’t exist

at Hi 11sbo rough.

The first aid provided w a s n ’t sufficient, there wa s n ’t enought basic

equipment, although you d o n ’t expect a disaster like this, there were

so few pieices of equipment like stretchers or mouth pieces.

The fans needed more basic information to help evacuation,       nobody knew

what was going on or what to d o .   They needed to have loud

hailers or use the scoreboard or a better PA system,      no one was told

anything.If we are penned in like animals then we deserve the

rights given to animals in that they are allowed to walk round freely.

I accept that fences are needed because of the idiot element at

matches, but these fences need to be able to be safe and not prevent

one thing and cause another.

The vast majority of terracing fans like to stand behind the goals, so

why at Hillsborough is there a fence right down the middle of that

area and its only led from one place the tunnel.

All grounds in the future must ensure better safety facilities we pay

ever week and deserve to be treated like human be ings.

             I live at the above address together with my common law wife *

            For the past twelve years I have worked at Sheffield Wednesday

            Football Club as a programme seller.          Although I am not directly

             employed by the club,     I worked on a commission basis and rny wages

            depend upon the amount of programmes that 1 sell.

            Last year I again was working as a programme seller and the semi

            final was between the same two clubs Liverpool and Forest,               Although

             I was at the same location with my father, we didn’t have the

            portacabin.       On the 13th of April   1989 (150489)    I was again selling

             p rogramme s b ut t hi s t ime I was in the company of my f r iends

                      end another friend named                                as doing the

             running between the cabin and my father who was located at the gate

            which is situated on your map between turnstiles A/G and 1 16,               The
                                                                          PAGE


system that we had in operation was such that              '/ouId go to my

■Father with an empty b ag , collect the takings that my father had.

together with a                      he would then return with the money

into t h e .partacabin,   which would remain locked thus being a place of

safety for all the takings.       The portacabin had been placed in such a

position as to give not only myself but to both of my friends a clear

view of the turnstiles numbers      1-16 and to gate *8 *, which as you

look through the windows is located to my left,.

On that day I started work at about IQ ,30am (1030) ana a few minutes

later the club van arrived carrying the stock of programmes,             I gave

the driver some assistance to distribute them between the various

sellers near to the cabin.       During the rest of the morning Liverpool

fans began to arrive in       small numbers and I think the gates were

officially opened about twelve o ’clock.

It would be about one o'clock      (1300 hrs) that I began to notice that

more fans were arriving and a queue had started to form at the

turnstiles, although this could have been caused by the police who were

searching them as they arrived at the ground.         The general mood of the

fans appeared to be good humoured and a 11hough I c a u 1d smel1 a 1 cohol

on the odd fan,    nobody appeared to be the worse for drink,

It was about an hour later that things started to          get out of   hand,

the crowd had increased       and there were big qu©ues f o rmi ng at   the

turnstiles.,   I noticed then that people were starting to get

impatient and I saw at least 10 12 fans climbing over the wall above

the turnstiles and they just sat on the wall,         I saw and heard various

Policemen ask the fans to come down, which they did and the policemen

asked them for their tickets.       Some of them just shrugged their

shoulders and from their gestures it seemed to me that they didn't

have any tickets and in fact I didn’t see any tickets taken from

anyone,.   Although I would like to point out that in my opinion at
                                                                                    page:



this stags the situation was such that there wasn't enough room or

time to eject the fans back into Leppings Ln.                   It was then I saw a

senior police officer who I would describe as being about 5 ’9 - 5"10

wearing a fiat cap,            I think he either had a moustache or was clean

shaven and he was aged between late thirty’s or early forty’s..                      I

didn’t notice what             rank he was but I saw him carrying a radio          in his

right hand,         The officer climbed onto the roof of the turnstiles

number 1 16 and was close to gate ’B ’,.               I didn’t hear what

ins t ruc tions he gave to t he radio but he wass pea k ing             int o it   for

quite a bit,         While he was there, more and more fans kept coming

over and he was shouting for the fans to get down,                    I would estimate

that at least another 30-40 fans again got in that (.May,                   While this

was going on I could hear fans walking on our portacabin roof and 1

can only assume that more fans got in without tickets.                     Because of

the situation which seemed to be getting out of hand,                          •©fused

to go and collect any more money from my father,                  so we asked a

police officer who did what we asked,                 while    all this was taking

place,     I heard a crash and a fan had trod on               the edge of some

as be s t a s g u 11 e r ing   artd thewho 1e 1o t 1"!ad come c ras h i ng down,   !h &

police again tried             to move the crowd away from the debris but          there

was no way for them to go, so I can only assume that the police

themselves moved it away from the fans,

I began to notice by this time a change in the mood of the crowd,

there were more people arriving aged between 15 30, where before it

was mainly family groups and older fans.                 Some of the tans smelled

strongly of boose and there was one or two very drunk, although I

didn’t actually see anybody drinking from cans.                   There was one youth

who came to the portacabin window who 1 would describe as follows?

aged between 20 S "f y ears, !::;•*10, scruffy appearance, with a bit of

stubbie and 1 think he may have had a moustache.                   His hair was
                                                                         PAGE        4


unkempt,,   it appeared to be very dry and it didn't appear to have been

washed for some time,       it was shoulder length and was light brown,.

He was wearing a denim coloured sweatshirt, it had two or three

buttons at the front and a white collar,        and he may have been wearing

either a white t shirt or shirt under it.,        He was also wearing very

baggy denim jeans,      1 particularly noticed the jeans because the

seat of them was nearly on the floor.        This youth had a strong

Liverpool accent and after speaking to him he either was very drunk

or thick.     The youth,   upon reaching the cabin window,      first asked for a

programme, but didn't offer any money.        When 1 asked him for a pound,

which was the cost of the programme,        he told me no and he told me to

give nim a programme,       1 refused and 1 think he went to            who was

to my right.,

It would be only a few minutes later that the same youth came back to

me,   He had his fist clenched and again asked me for a programme -              I

asked him for his money and from his clenched fist he dropped 2p

into my hand*       1 gave it him back and I told him the price of the

programme.      He just looked at me with threats in his eyes trying to

stare me out and he then I think tried the same approach on

He then came back,      threw the 2p into the cabin and said,

"Programme" *      I picked up the two pence piece and gave it him back..

He then stared at me again and then said,        "Never mind,    I ’ll get you

at half t ime *"    He then grinned at me and left.,    I noticed then that

he just stood about ten yards away from the cabin waiting for friends

and I started to get worried in case he returned with some of his

ma te s»

After the incident with the youth,      I   lost track of time,    but anyway

the fans kept coming and we were kept b u s y all the time and I heard

fans shouting from behind the turnstiles and everybody was just trying

to get in.,     I did notice then that gate *8 ’ being opened by the
                                                                       PAGE


gateman and a Policeman was present.      The construction of the gate is

such that one half of the gate opens towards the portacabin and the

other half towards turnstiles T--16,     When the gate was opened,     the

reason I believe was to relieve the pressure from outside, about

200-300 fans ran through the gates and from where I was I then lost

sight of them,

There then seemed to be a silences     which was very strange after all

the noise and shouting.,     The gates were then almost closed, just

allowing no more than two people at a time to enter or leave,          closely

supervised by a Pal iceman and Gat©man.

From what I could see between the gap, there appeared to be no more

fans waiting to get in from that particular area, although people

were still coming in a bit at a t ime through the turnstiles,          I think

I made some comment to the other two in the cabin to the effect that

it appeared as if ail the crowd were in and that we would not sell

many more programmes*

We all then started to check what programmes we had sold and to start

counting the takings.      We were joined then by my father and

They first of all   came in with their money and they then returned

unsaid   programme which they passed to us through the window.

While we were counting the money)_____ left to go and watch the match

and 1 think thats when I heard over the P/A system for a Nr MEADOWS

and then there was a message which I didn't hear,.

The reason I can remember the words MEADOWS,     that is the key word

that is used by the Club in an emergency and that’s when Police have

to go to a particular area,     when the message came through,    I saw at

least 10 12 Police Officers run from the turnstiles I-16 through the

gate at the right hand side of the portacabin and disappear from out

of my view,    I remained in the cabin with the programmes as the other

thres had taken a 1 1 the taki ngs to the gymnas ium fo r che cking,
                                                                               PAGE   6


It was only a few minutes later I saw people coming back from the

West Stand area.         Some of them were obviously in pain, others were

just complaining         aboutbeing squashed.       They started to ask   me for

drinks and water         and I think I was then joined by my father       who then

left either with programmes or more money.               I gave some of them orange

and from the general conversation I had with them,              the general

complaints were of overcrowding and of being badly squashed.

As more people began to come out there were then conversations about

deaths or the possible bad injuries and people were being aggressive

towards any groundsman or anybody in authority.

People were saying and showing tickets with them intact, stating that

there had been no control over people corning in without tickets.

At the same time         I saw a group of about six youths carrying       a lad

face down,.       They   walked across the back of the West Stand away from

me., they then returned with the youth still             in the same position,,

walked across the front of the cabin , through gate B and into

L e p p ing s L n ,

The youth they were carrying appeared to be of heavy build,.               He was

wearing a black sweatshirt,              black jeans and he may have had either a

white lining or white t shirt underneath.               I would estimate his age

as being about late teens or early twenty’s.,              The lads who were

carrying him all appeared to be of the same age group and also

appeared to be friends of his.              From the brief glimpse I had of him,

I couldn’t see if he was dead or what injuries he had,.

After they had gone,        I was joined b y ________and from the crowd who

were coming past the portacabain,              I felt that the mood was getting

very ugly and there was a feeling that somebody was going to get

•s.e r io u s 1y h u rt by the crowd,.

I 1o eked the portacabin and I went wi th                   to the North Stand

Gym; and it was then I realised the extent of what had happened and I
                                                                               PAGE         7


saw a large group of people who were obviously dead outside the gym,

most of whom were covered by their own clothing,

I waited at the entrance of the Gym until I could enter without

getting in anybody’s way,,              Once inside I again saw bodies along a

third of the gym and they had been covered by whi te sheets „

The far end of the gym were the rest of the programme sellers,

i n c 1u cl.in g m y fat h e r .,

After a brief conversation with my father,                 1 discovered that         nad

not returned so I went looking for him.                  I went through the side

entrance,       back under the North Stand and onto the track by the side

of the Spion Kap,              I then saw a line of Police Officers across the

full width of the pitch,               I walked towards the West Stand an through

a g roup of Po Ii cemen.

Upon returning back towards the Kop en d, I was stopped by a

Policewoman who asked me where I was going.,                 I told her who I was and

that I was looking for a friend,                She let me through and I saw dead

and injured people being cared for by the various emergency

services,         I then returned to the gym where 1 spoke to my Dad and we

both agreed to leave.,

On the 23rd of Apri1, <230489>,               1 was reading the                    ind in

the                      were pictures of the people who had been killed at the

g round,      The               pi c ture on the page,                         the

youth shown looks like the same youth who had thrust the 2 pence

piece in my hand and had threatened me,

I have been shown a map of the Sheffield Wednesday Football ground

and I have indicated where the portacabin is situated (Exhibit

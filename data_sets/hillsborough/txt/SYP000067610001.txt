crowd      I've      e x p e r i e n c e d at a football           match            before,      although      I've       never

been     to a Liver p o ol/Notts Forest match                          prior          to this       one.     About        this

1 1 me    I saw a couple             of young           fans age d a b o u t "i4 15 y r s old being

passed       over     the    heads      of fans         stuck    in the             crowd.        I saw a m a n aged

about     30~35yrs          behind      us,      he    looked unwell,                and    complained       of     feeling

faint.        hy     friend                           Dried to make             him some          space    in the     crowd.,,

I heard       people        s h o uting     “Get       them turns t i l e s           open.n        I c o u l d n ’t see

whet h e r    they were          open or         closed.        I assumed             they were        closed       because

we w e r e n ’t moving a n y w h e r e            at all.

At about 2. „45 pm we were                  still       in the     crowd trying                  to get--in.        There

were about           3 or 4      y o u n g lad s o n t h e t o p o f a walrt— on h o t h side s                       o f ih e

^.ver the w a l l .          Some      young      lads were        passed            over    the    heads    of     the

crowd      to these         on   top of the wall             and      then helped over                the wall        into

the     ground.          Also    a bout     this time        X saw a           policeman to the right                 hand

s i d e of t h e t u r ns 1 11e s .           He had a flat            cap on             (not a helmet        like       the

o t h e r s ) and     bIack      gloves .         He    s h o uted,    "Get          t h r o u g h here,    the     gates

rushed over           towards       him and to where               there's            a gate.        I d i d n ’t see

was      open by about 3ft wide.                      I think          there was a s t e w a r d on the              1 ns i a &

of the       gate       but    I ’m not        sure.         I d o n ’t remember         seeing any          policemen

i ns i de the area once                 I'd got           t h r o u q h the   turns t i 1e .

Once      I was        through      the    tu r n s t i l e      the   crowd w a s n ’t too bad.              We    headed

towar ds the            tunrie 3., I thi nk            i t was     p r o bably about 2.55prn , I dibn* t

know      there were           other      routes          to the terrace          other       than the       tunnel.           I

d i d n ’t see any signs                either,,

The      tunnel        w a s n ’t too     bad       crowd wise,         it was       busy but     not     squashed.                1

think       people were           u r i na t i n g i n t h e t u n n e I u p against             the wall.,          It was

very      dark,        and    I seem      to       remember       there was a light at each end,,                         1

had to       look       down at      the       floor       to make      sure    there were        no steps          coming,,

I w a s n ’t aware            of any      slope       either       up or down.           At    the end of          the

tunnel       I     literally ended                 up witn the central            railing        (separating             pen 3

and      four)     in front of m e , leaving me                        a choice.,

Ws were          all    just    d e c iding         w h i c h way to go,        into     either       pen 3 or 4,

w he n    1 felt a big            push from           the     crowd beh i n d me.             I was    pushed       forw a r d

and      sligh t l y     over     to my        left as        I looked at         the    piten.        1 ended       up       in

pen four more                than half way            down.        I realised                 had been       pushed       int o

jSe n 3 , and ^                was wit h me           in pen 4 about            3 feet away.,           We    both nad

managed          to grab hold of each others arms                             just    before     the    push occur r e a ■,

3y    now there was             no way         1    could move a n y w h w e r e ,       I'd lost       grip with

             arm.        People      were          crushed and s q u a s h e d all            around me.           I die

not      become aware           of any         further        surges      but all       the time       it was       tighter

and      tighter,        never     getting           any easier.

I was      stuck        in this      crowd          for about 20 m i n u t e s          till    about     3 . 2 0 p m when

I found myself                i n ,f r o n t of a era s h ba r r i e r „             I was     crushed       right       up

against          it tight.         It was           pressed       right across          my    ribs,    1 c o u l d n ’t

move      my hands           to help at all,,                I knew     I had     to get       under    the    barrier.,

                       I managed        to duck       clown into           the    crowd and under              the    barrier.          When      I

                       went    down     it was       pitch black,             you      could smell           everyone's       sweat,       it was

                       boiling        hot.     I don't           know how        long    I was        on the    floor       but   I had to

                       get    up by turning            like a corkscrew                 in the        crowd and       pushi ng upwards,,

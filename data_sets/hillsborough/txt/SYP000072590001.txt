               I have supported i£iverpool for the last 3 years and go to every match,

               On Saturday 15 fHpril 1989 (1504-89),                 I attended Hillsborough Football

               Ground to see the Liverpool,              Nottingham Forrest match.           I sent off for

               a ticket to Liverpool Football Club which cost me £6.00 which was for

               the Leppings Ln terrace.

               I arrived at the ground at              1.15 pm <1315) and entered through the
5    o .e.
               Leppings Ln turnstiles.             There were only a few other supporters at the
    U , L .
               turnstiles at this time.              There were police officers at the

               turnstiles who were searching               people as they went       in,   I handed my

               ticket to the turnstile operator and entered the ground,  I then went
                       T c w / v ^        vst a t v D
               through the tunnel to the terrace and into pen 4.  There was no-one

               else     in the tunnel.       There were quite a few people already in pen 4

               and pen 3 but there was hardly anybody in the other pens.                          It was now
                                                                                            PAGE     i
                                                                                            SI 685

        about   1.30 pm <1330).             S O.£.                  'P ^N lj~
        As time went on, more and more people came into the pen.                    People

        started to surge backwards and forwards,               just like it usually does,

        but there was no crush.             However,    by 2.30 pm (1430),   it started to get

        packed and,      by S . 45 pm (1445),      I just couldn't move at all and I knew
                          ■             -                                       »


        something was wrong.          I remember the players coming out onto the pitch

        but I c o u l d n ’t see them because of the people around me.              I had

        actually turned sidewards to the^fJitch and I was just thinking about
                                                   /'
        getting out of the pen.             They^ame kicked off but I still      co ul d n’t see

        anythi n g .

        People around me started shouting and screaming to the police on the

        pitch side of the fa-nce that they were being crushed but the police

        did nothing at all/, only look down at us.               People at the front started
OVI
P£aH.   to climb up the /encing a n d , as they did             this, I was able to get

        nearer to the f e n c e .     I don't know how 'they do this but people were

        actually climbing along the headsVarrtf^shoulders of the crowd towards

        the fencing and one person kicked me in the head as he went along over

        the top of us.                                     S
                         *rT                  f :<£s±Q&-
        Someone had opened the gate on'Ur the pitch and people were shouting to

        move to the right to get out/of the per*.               The match was still going on

        and I was praying t^at np^Dody scored a goal              or we would all have been

        killed in a crush.

        I was gradually moving along             towards the   fence and the gate.      I

        eventually managed to get my             hand on the   fence over the heads of

        people crushed up against            it and worked my way towards the open gate.

        There were people         leaning over the fence from the other side trying to

        pull us over but I was too weak to try and climb up.

        The game was stopped as I could see the players walking off the pitch.

        I got nearer to the open gate and saw that a Liverpool                supporter was

        blocking   it.        People shouted at him to move but he wouldn't.            He said
                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                           S 1685

         *
             he wouldn't move until a little boy, who was crushed against the wall,

             was freed.      I saw this boy eventually get out and then people started

             to carry on     out of the gate.       I can't really      describe the fan who

             blocked the gate or the little boy.            All   I    could see was the backs          of

             heads of people in front      of me.

             By now I was next to the      fence and next to       the open gate but I had to
                                                              < ^ rr  i/vcn>£j££>
             squeeze along the fence to get out.             The crush against the fence was

             so great that my ribs were pushed up against               it and were bruised and

             I struggled to get out.      As I started to go through the gate, a

C a -T       policeman grabbed hold of it and I panicked as I thought he was going

GrJTTtS      to shut   it.   He shouted to everyorve,       "Get back,     get back."   I scraped
     i                                              /
 J           past the fencing and, as I d i d ^ h i s , all the buttons on my shirt were

F'£*4l(j£-   ripped off.     I then managed   j/o   step out onto       the pitch as the police

             officer asked me if I was /alright and to sit              on the pitch.

             All    I remember about thi/s policeman is that he had a dark moustache,

             about 30 years old,     slim build.

             Another    policeman then asked me if I wanted to go to hospital             but       I
             didn't want to go.

             I sat and regained my breath for a few minutes.

             I then saw that the supporters and police were leaning over the

             fencing trying to pull     people over so I decided to do the same.                I
                                                        /
             leaned over and grabbed the hand/bf a lad in the crowd and a supporter
                                             1-------------------------- ,— --------------
             beside me also grabbed his hanid■ I tried to pull him up but the

             spikes on the top of the fencing were sticking               in my stomach and I

             just    couldn't pull up anymore so I jumped back onto the pitch.

             A person in the crowd shouted that someone was               lying on the floor and

             I went over to tell a policeman and he went over to the fence.                 Some

             supporters starred to pull the hoardings away from the fence and

        hoarding with a person lying on it and ran across the pitch with it.

        There were about ten others holding on to the hoarding but I c a n ’t

        describe anyone.

        We took him across      to the corner of the North Stand and out of the

        ground and put him on the floor.        I remember that he was still moving

        but I can't describe him.       As we put    hirn on the floor I looked up and

        saw bodies,   with coats over their heads,        lined up on the floor.

        We all then ran back onto the p>Cch to help more people.            I helped

        carry another three      p e o p l e ^ ”1 hoardings out of the ground and put them ,

        in the same place         V*® first man.     I only remember one of them.        He

        was about   16 years,   wearing dark blue jeans and a blue shirt,         slim

        build and wearing trainers.        They must have been white.      I went back

        onto the pitch to see      if there was anything else I could do.

        I remember the Liverpool supporters         running towards the Hop and the

        police stopping them.       I also heard someone talking through the

        loudspeakers about ticket stubbs.           Isaw that the blue fencing had

        been cut and I just looked around          to see if there was anyone   I knew.

        About 4.30 pm (1630),      people started leaving the ground and I left

        through the Penistone Rd entrance and made my way hgfne,

        I would like to say how badly the po/i ce handled the situation from

        when people started shouting th\tythey were being crushed.              The police

        took no notice of what was happening.

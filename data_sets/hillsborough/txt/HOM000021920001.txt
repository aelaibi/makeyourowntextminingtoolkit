Dear Sir,

Re:   Part II Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.

Further to previous correspondence, we have pleasure in enclosing a file
containing representation and submissions to the Inquiry made on behalf
of our injured and bereaved clients.

It would be appreciated if you could in due course let us know when publica­
tion of the final report is to be expected.

In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact the undersigned if we
can be of further assistance to the Inquiry.

Yours faithfully,                                                       ,




Nicola C Harrison (Committee Member)

            I am a Press Photographer working for the Today Newspaper                    covering

           mainly sporting events usually in the Northern part of the

            country but at times anywhere that sporting events are taking                    place.

           On Saturday      15th April   1989   (150489)    I went to Hillsborough Football

           Ground, Sheffield t o cover the semi final between Liverpool                    and

           Nottingham Forest.

            I was allocated the Press bib number 22 by the Football Association

           and made my way to the Leppings Lane end of the ground at around 2 pm

            (1400).     I set up my camera and equipment            in the position I always

            like to get which is just       inside the eighteen yard line           (18 yds) which

            on this occasion was to the right of the goal,                 looking towards the

            pitch because the light was better that side.                 Towards 2.30 pm (143u)

            I noticed that the pen behind me,           pen 3 was absolutely full with the
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 52922A

          pen to the side of it,     p e n ^ T was fairly empty.   The fence at the

          front of pen 3 was beginning to bulge under the weight of the crowd a

          the front.    At tbfs time I also saw people climbing from pen 3 over

          the dividing fence,    into pen 2.    As time went on,    I heard people
                                                 X"
          shouting to the Police to let th&ffl out and also started to climb up

          the fence at the front.        I saw one or two policemen on the perimeter

          t rack and they did ncjt spr&m to realise what was happening and how

          serious   it was.   As soon as they did they opened the perimeter gate

          and let people over the top of the fence.        Nobody behind the goal

          realised how serious it was and I personally would notbLafhe anyone

          there.    I have been shown video film reference numt^gr MAP9 and I

          identify myself wear in^y"’bib 22 at time referenoe 1503-57 .      I have

          marked on a plan ofyChe Hillsborough foot bal 1 ground my position at

          the match Exh No jSOI.

                       I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police, and presently

                       carry out supervisory duties                      in the Force Operations Room.

                   On Saturday 15th April 1989 ®y tour of duty was from 0600 to 1800.

                   Shortly after 3p.®. that date, following information and requests

                   received fro® the Hillsborough Footbal Ground, I commenced certain

                   administrative duties in alerting Police Personel for a variety

                   or roles.

                   I also attempted to contact the Police Surgeons for the Sheffield

                   area to attend at the ground.                           My recollection is that I had little

                   success in this area, hut several messages were left with relatives

                   for the Police Surgeons to attend at Hillsborough, if they could be

                   contacted within a reasonable period of time.

                   Shortly before 1530 I contacted both Radio Sheffield and Radio Hallam,

                   and asked that an urgent message was broadcast to the effect that

                   any^edical Doffiftrq who wer^^vailable should attend at the Penistone

                    I was assurred by each Radio Station that this request would be broadcast

                    as soon as possible.

                    I am unable to say when the broadcasts were put out, or the response to

                    them.

                     X recorded the particulars of the calls both to Radio Sheffield and

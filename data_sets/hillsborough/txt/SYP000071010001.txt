               At 8 . 45am on S a tu r d a y           15 April         1989       I paraded at Wo o d s e a t s Po l i c e

               Station,        Sheffield         for    transport           to     the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football            Ground,

               I was     conveyed there               t o g ether with other                officers       from W o o d s e a t s         by

               means     of a double            decker    bus.

               S h o r t l y after my arrival             I was         told to a t t e n d         the North S t a n d where a

               b riefing       took      place       by several         senior          o f f icers wit h       regards      to the

               vents     of the day,            this    being       the F.A.            Cu p Semi       Final    betw e e n L i v e r p o o

               and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

               At a p p r x o m i a t e l y    11.05am after            consuming a packed meal                     I attended             the

               S p i o n Hop,     where       a further          briefing was             given     by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

               GREENWOOD         (Ground Comma n d e r )           and          Inspe c t o r s B OO T H and CALVERT.

               I was     informed that Liv e r p o o l                fans        had o b t a i n e d    tickets        for the

               Nottingham           end and      that    there was a space at                     the N o r t h e r n     end of the
                                                                                                                  PAG E
                                                                                                                  S 1527

Kop had been set aside                       for    them,,   this a rea was            to be kept        cordoned

off.       I commenced my duties at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 11.15am my serial
                           54^
S e r g e a n t being PS MARPLES, and after a short while took up a position

in the       sterile area,              which separated             the Liverpool            fans    from       the

No11 ingham         fans.

As    the kick        off    time       drew closer          both the Kop and the area set

aside      for the L i v erpool               were    packed,       both sets          of supporters            being

reasonable.

At 3 . 0 0 p m the game            c o mmenced and           shor t l y after w a r d s        I saw

Liv e r p o o l    fans a p p a r e n t l y        invade    the    pitch.       The si t u a t i o n a p p e a r e d      t

get worse w ith further                      fans and Police O f f i c e r s            milling a r o u n d       the

goal     m outh area.             The    players       then    left    the     pitch and          it became

apparent          that   the      incident was more                than just       a pitch        invasion.

I saw      injured Liv e r p o o l            fans    carried      from the Leppings                Lane    End of th

gr o u n d to the Kop end of the                      ground.       These      fans were          placed almost

di r e c t l y    below me        by the main entrance                to   the     pitch.

T hey    had been        carried         by both Po l i c e O f f i c e r s and football                   fans       on

stre t c h e r s and a d v e r t i s i n g          hoardings,      some     of them a p p e a r e d to           be

dead.        1 saw Police O f f i c e r s             St Johns      A m b ul a n c e    men and      fans

administering            first aid            to the     injured fans.

There was a lot              of    police a c t i v i t y      on the      pitch wit h offic e r s               forming

a cordon across              the w hole            of the    pitch and along the stand,                     however I

was     instructed to hold my                      position as there was w still                  fear      of

disorder          breaking        out.

F rom my         position      1 could see a m b u l a n c e s         behind          the N o r t h S t a n d

aw a i t i n g    the arrival           of    the    injured.        I held my          position      until       the

fans     were      released        from the          ground at w h i c h       point PS         1203 M A R P L E S too

The     vehicle       took     up a position             in M i d d l e w o o d Road,        on s t a n d b y    but was

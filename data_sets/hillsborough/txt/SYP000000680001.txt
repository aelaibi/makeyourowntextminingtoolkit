are all     friends      that, we have met at P r e v i o u s L i v erpool                  games.

About- two weeks         before       the Semi     final my mother              applied        by post for

three m a t c h tickets         for    herself,                     and me,       but    because     of the

numbers     of our season         tickets       only two a r r i v e d these were                for myself

a n d my mother.

My mother made a r r a n ge me nt s w ith S t e p h e n O A T S , P h i l i p G O O D M A N and

H a r i a m so that we     could meet          them at S h e f f i e l d R a i l w a y Station.

On S at u r d a y   15Q489 at a bo ut a quarter               to six         in the morn i n g       I left

home with my m o t h er,        we w a l k e d to Go 1de rs G r e e n           tube S t a t i o n and

caught a train to L o nd on Eu s t o n S t a t i o n .                  We a r r i v e d at about 0 6 . 1 Q

hours,     we    changed train and a rr iv ed at Kings Cross Stat i o n at about

0630.      On the train we            had something         to e a t , my mother            had a cup of

coffee and a sandwich.                At Kings Cross S t a t i o n we boarded an                     inter

City    train so that we          could get        to Sheffield.               We a r r i v e d at

S h e f f ie ld S ta t i o n at about     10.00.        We w a i t e d outside           the   train

S ta t i o n for another        of my mums       fo o t b a l l i n g    friends      called            he    is

about 21 years and          lives      s o mewhere      in L in c o n s h i r e .       We w a i t e d for

about    one and a half          hours and heard that                   the train we e x p e c t e d

to be on had been delayed,                so my mother             d ec i d e d that we should make

our w a y to H il l s b o r o u g h Football        G r o u n d.        We   caught a b u s to the

football        ground and w ai t e d     for my mothers                friends     outside     the gro u n d

at    the Leppings Lane          end.     1 w o u l d like to point out that my mother

and    I met Ma r i a m and P h i l i p G OO D M A N at K i n g s c r o s s Stat ion and

t rave lied wit h them from             that    point     o n , to Hill b s o rough f o o t b a l 1

ground.

We w a i t e d at the ground for about                half an hour and then me and P h i l i p

went    to have a walk a ro u n d         the ground.              T here a lot of Nott i ngharn an d

Liver pool       supporters a b o u t , the        t ime was a bout            half     twelve.      After      a

w hile P h il ip and      I cams back          to J_eppings Lane              I told my m o t h e r     who

was    still     there   that    I was    going     into      the       gr o u n d w i t h Philip,     She

                   said    it was     okay and       so we went         in t h r o u g h the t u r n s t i l e s .    T here was

                   no    problem getting         into      the    ground      because a l t h o u g h there were a lot

                   of    people about,        non of them were              quing.        W h e n me and Phil        got

                   thro u g h the     turnstile we were              checked     by the Police.              There were         a

                   lot of    police after we              got thro u g h the t u r nsiles            but very few

                   supporters.          We headed for the              t u n n e 1, as we wa l k e d      towards     the    tunnel

                   I remember        seeing     some      signs     to my     right.       Some were       saying     things

                   like    ’refreshments''          and one small           sign said s o mething            like    entrance.

                   Once we got t hrough the                t u n n el and onto       the terrace we went              to the
        nf
                   right    of the goals and              stood halfway up from               the front       fencing.          We

                   w a i te d on the terrace           for about        fift e e n minu t e s       until my mo t h e r and

                   her friends        came    in,    at    this     time there were           quite a few         people     in

                   the    terrace     but    it wa s n ' t    full,     some    people were          sitting      down     reading

                   papers    but     they stood        up as more         people     came     in.       My mother     an d her

                   friends also         stood to the          right of the goal              mouth      in front     of me but

                   not    right up at the           fence.        As the      terrace      got rnoore full          at a bout

                   1430pm I made my wa y             right       to the     back with                and Phil.        W h i 1st         I

                   was at the        back    I was     unable       to see a n y t h i n g    for a w h i 1e and         then       I

                   saw the game         start    but      that was      it.

                   A short       time after,        someone who         I had been s q u a s h e d against            m o v e d and

                   me            and P h i l i p m ov e d w ith him.           I looked up and saw that                  people

                r\y j/ were c_ 1 imbi ng up over the fence onto the jriitch I could see that,---------

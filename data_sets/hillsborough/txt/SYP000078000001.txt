An officer       from our serial          greeted each coach and they were all

d ir e c t e d towards     the    football     stadium.       These    buses   contained a wide

cross    section      in ages      of Liverpool       s upporters a nd I can state           that

from this       section of supporters whilst                 they were    in this    location?

they a p p e a r ed to be well         behaved and        in good spirits.

At    1345 hours Clayw he el s L.n was            completely full        of supporters       buses,    I

recorded a total           of 32 buses and 2 mini             buses at this       location.

At    1425 hours we were           further     deployed to the junction of C l a y w h e e l s

Ln with P e nistone Rd N o r t h .

We    positioned outside a public                house    named The Gate,      and our duties

were    defined as s u p e r v i s i n g the arriving          fans who were walking          down

Hali f a x Rd towards        us.

We were      instructed to form a filter                 lane of officers and to inform the

supporters       that all        a l co ho li c drinks w ould be       left at this    location.

F rom   this    position you         can see a good distance            up this Hali fa x Rd and

as far as the eye           could see       I saw that there was a continuous                flow of

L i verpool     supporters        in groups approx.          10 abreast    on both sides       of the

carriageway.

The m a j o r i t y of    these were males          in the    lower age brackets,      it was       very

a pp arent     to me that a large amount              of alcohol      had been     consumed by the

vast    m a j o r i t y of these men.

A    large   number      of them were       still    drinking       on their way towards       the

ground and a large           number of them were halted and a sked to                  leave    their

intoxicants at this              location.       Some of them        left their    drinks?    others

insisted on consuming              them at this       location.

G e n e r a l l y they were all       of good b e h a v i o u r ,   they were drunk    but    not

incapable       or disorderly.

Fro m me and the other             officers      taking    up this     position the thing       that

became most a p parent            to me other       than their drunken states was how

late thousands           of them had      left    it to go to get        into the ground.           This

                                                                                            S2226
heavy mass       of    persons    continued without any significant               gaps a pp earing

until    about    1510 hours.

At    1455 hours       I went w ith other officers          to The Gats Public House a s a

result of a report            of fi ght i ng inside.      The   premises were       locked and

entry was       found with some difficutly.

U pon entering         I saw that    it was    full    of football     supporters all

s porting      red and white       colours,,   the a t mo sp he re was hostile.         The

L a n d l o r d was a pp ro a ch e d and the   persons     present    requested to leave the

premises.

Our    serial    then    returned to its static          point.      At this time     the

passage of fans          had now t hinned out         but there was     still     a number    of

L iverpool      fans still       making    their way to the ground.

About    1510 as a result of a request                by PS S HE RR AT T we    returned     into

this    public    house a nd there a s s i s te d      in clearing the        premises.

About    1515 we were able          to    resume from these        premises and upon doing

so,    I was    informed of       radio messages       of trouble     inside    the ground.         At
      N2~?TOG>
this PC GOSS returned to join us and                   informed us all        to atten d at     the

ground.

Our    serial    then    proceeded to the ground and we entered via the                     large

gates adjacent          to turnstiles 77 to 78,

It was    there       that   I saw two ambu la nc es      parked    in the corner    close     to

the    corner of the S p i o n Hop.

T here were      two    persons    being    d eposited beside       these a m bu la nc es and       1

saw that an attempt was             being made at       chest massage.         I o bs er ve d that

this    failed    to revive       this    person.

We were     then directed to the            pathway    into the S pion Kop and        it was

there    that    I was a p pr o a c h e d by a number      of Notts.     Forest    supporters

who    offered their         services.

Wit h members         of our serial       1 then went     wit h these    volunteers       to the

passageway between the N o rth S tand and                 the S pion Kop and      it was      there
                                                                                                         PAGE            4
                                                                                                         32226

w here      I saw a number           of bodies      being    carrled up that            passageway

towards        the gymnasium a rea by supporters,                    and also       police    officers.

At this        I went with other           officers     onto    the       playing a r e a .    There       I saw

bodies        of dead and       injured       laying all      over    the     pitch.      The m aj or i ty       of

them were           blue    in the face and were            dead.

There were           loads of fans       running about         the    pitch.

I then a s si st ed as best as                I could and made a large number                  of    carries

wit h      the deceased,        taking     them up to the gym area,                 it got    to the stage

where      the area was         so    littered that space            ran out and there was

nowhere        to    put the    injured.

After       this     I went    over    to the Leppings Ln end,               I saw that       there were

still      piles of foodies still             trapped behind          the fencing area.              I was

unable        to go and assist          them any further            due    to the    large number

a lre a d y    in attendance.

A S up e r i n t en d en t    then d ir ected a number          of us to go down the                players’

tunnel and           circumnavigate       that area to assist               in the      rear of the

Le ppj. ngs Ln terracing.

W ith other          officers    I went       to the   rear    of the Leppings Ln end of the

ground,        but this       time    I was    completely detached from all                  of my own

serial.

I can recall           being    inside     the terracing at           the Leppings Ln end.                 I am

at this        time    unable    to    recollect what         I a ct ua l ly did        in this area.            I

can recall           later    being    in another area         in that same          stand where          the

ambul a n c e s      had    congregated,       this area was         to the     right of the West

S ta n d    running        parallel    wi t h the    river.

This was where a few bodies                    had been      carried and          laid.       There was a

number        of    persons    present who        I took     to be from the medical

profession.            The y were all         busy trying      to revive          the    injured.        1know

in my own mind that              1 a ss is t ed     in the    removal       of a number       of b odies,            I

can     recall       that all    of the ones         I dealt with were           deceased.          My
                                                                                            PAGE         3
                                                                                            S2226
r ec o l lection will         not at this       time a llow me to     recall much more,           This

area was       heavily    congested with e me rgency vehicles and                large    numbers

of Liverpool          supporters       who did not assist       the a lr ea dy   chaotic

situation,          a large    number    of them were       o bviously very drunk and were

v er bally abusing        every Police Officer             present.

We   had a difficult           task    in moving    these    persons to allow for         the

m o v ement    of the a mb ul an ce s        carrying away their      injured.    None     of these

so called       fans seemed       concerned with as si st in g        such movement,       they

seemed    bent on abusing             the Police.

After a while a Police                Inspector    ordered me    into his Police         van and we

were   d e spatched      to at te nd a fight.

The whole area was a seething mass                      of persons?   we found no fight

taking    place so we          returned to the L ep pings Ln end.

By this       time    the ground was         emptying     further and we were getting

similar hostile abuse             from a large number of such persons,                   We stood

our ground and a cc ep t ed            this abuse,      we had no alternative,       crowd

control       was    totally    impossible.

As the    crowds       began to thin out we entered             the ground via the

c oncertina gates at the Leppings Ln end and made                       our way on s tandby

into   the North Stand.

I then took          no further       part    in this    incident.

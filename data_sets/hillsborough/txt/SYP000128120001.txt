                              I caught           the      train        from                                                   to Waterloo.,

The    train was              empty        and      I did       not     see       any      football             supporters               on    t hi s

At    Waterloo           we     got      the     tube      at     7.30       am     (0730)           to St P a n c r a s            to    catch

the    train          to S h e f f i e l d       which         wa s    due    to        l e av e     at    9.00 am             (0900)»

At    St    Pancreas            Station          I saw         a group           of L i v e r p o o l / L o n d o n            supporters

about       30    in n u m b e r s         who      were       waiting        to        catch        the     same         train.

The    train          left      St    Pancreas            at 9 , 0 0        am     a n d a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d              at      the

At    the    main        entrance           to S h e f f i e l d        Station            I was          aware          of    a heavy

Police       presence,               one    of      whom       stopped        us a n d a s k e d             us w h e r e         we w e r e

Myself       and                   t h e n walked, f r o m             the       train         station          into S h e f f i e l d

T o w n,     We       decided         to    go      for    a    drink        in o ne           of    the     public            houses,           I

c a n ’t    remember            the      name       of    place        but    we        sa w    it w a s        full          of F o r r e s t

fans       so we       had a         pint      of    lager        each and              left        to a v o i d         any

confrontation                 between          supporters.

We    then       went      to a       pub w h i c h        I believe              was      called          the M a r k e t          Tavern,           it

appeared          t ha t      we     were      the       only     supporters               in t h a t        pub         so we      stayed           for

about       an    hour        and. a h a l f         and       drank        about        two        pi nts      of       lage r     each and a

number       of       vodka        and     oranges.             I c a n ’t        remember               hoM,< many.

We    left       the     pub at          about       1,43       pm     (1343)         to       go    to    the       football            ground,

We    were       both      merry         and     happy         but- not       drunk,,               We    got    a tax.i f r o m

outside          the     pu b      straight          to    the        football           ground.             Th e        taxi     d r o p p e d us

On a rrival            outside           the     ground         I could           see      there          were       a    number         of

supporters             spread         all      o ve r     Leppings           Ln     end,        approximately                    1000     in

nnmbers,            n o ne      of       whieh were              q u s u e i n g to      get       in but          were      just, h a n g i n g

around         near       to      hot         dog     stands          and    t ha t     and    in a n d         around           nearby           sho p s.

I sa w        that       there           were       about        four       poll, ice    officers,              all     male,          who       were

standing            by the           la rge         gates        to    the       entrance          to    the       ground.             Th e       gates

were     o p e n as          those            gates       gave        access       to    the       turnstiles.

I remember               seeing           on the          big     gates          a sign which                r ea d    ’L i v e r p o o l

Supporters               Only’.               The     tickets          that                  and    myself            had were          for        the

stands         in the           *B*       section           so we w e n t          to    one       of    the       turnstiles                which

w as    marked           with        a    lar ge       *B*       and     T. w e n t     in f ir s t -           I gave           my    ticket           to

th e    attendant               who       t or e      off    the       stub       and    gave       me       the      main       part        back.

On     th e    otherside                 of    the     turnstiles                were    about          six     to     eight          male        police

officers,            one        of w h i c h          did a body             search          on me.           Whilst         searching              me

he a s k e d        me          if   I had been              drinking.                 I stated         I had         to w h i c h       he       then

stated         that             I l o o k e d a bit              drunk       to him.          I said          I wasn't           and        he     let
                \

me     through,              I waited a while                         whilst                  ;.'as s e a r c h e d a n d             he was

asked         the    s a me       questions               and was           also       let    through.                Once       past        the

turnstiles               I could              see     the    tunnel          in f r o n t      of       us.

There         were       about           100 L i v e r p o o l         supporters             milling           about        in b e t w e e n           the

turnstiles               and      the         tunnel.            Together          with                  we     went        to    the        toilets

and     then        returned.                   I saw       that       there       were       about          four      or    five        Liverpool

stewards            I knew           that        they were             Liverpool             stewards           as     they wore                 bibs

stewards            were        directing              fans       to    the       stands       via       the       tunnel         and        in fact

one     of     them             tried          to d i r e c t     me    and              that       way       but      as we          ha d       visited

the     ground           before           we        knew     where          to   go.     I did          not     see a n y         sign s

directing            me      or      other          supporters              around       the       ground          after         passing           the

stewards.Myself                      and                  then w a l k e d         through          the       tunnel         to       the

terraces.                T he     tunnel            was     in    no w a y        congested             it w a s       o n l y w h e n we           got

back      to    the       tunnel.                I did       not       see       any    police          or    stewards            or    signs           at
the    end       of       tunnel         directing                supporters              where         to    go-      Myself         and

wanted          a good          view      p o in t       of       the     match        so we        worked          our      way     into w h a t

is P e n 3           r i gh t      up    by    the       left       hand        fen ce ,       working           through           the     crowd         to

about       10 y a r d s           from       the    front          fence           ne a r    the       pitch.         We      managed         to    get

to w h a t       I think            was       the    second             safety         rail        ba ck      from     the      pitch and            sat

on t h a t       to       get      a good          view       of    the        game.          The       stand       was      p a ck e d.       This

was    not       unusual            in    itself          as       I had        been         there       the     year        before        and      it

was    this          packed         then       but       that       was        at    kick      off       time       not 2 . 1 5       pm     (1415)

like       now.At          about         2-35       pm    (1455)             the     players            came     out      onto       the    pitch

and    I stood             up      on the          bar    to       ge t      a good          view       of    them.          Somehow        I got

pushed          down and            sat       on the          safety           bar     again-            I was        aware        it was

packed          as    the       crowd were               swaying             backwards             and       forwards.             I could          feel

this       as    I w as         being         pushed          forwards              and      backwards -              Th e     crowd were

singing          and       everything               appeared              to    be a l r i g h t         apart        from      the      amount          of

people          th er e .

The    game          started            and    after          a    couple           of m i n u t e s         Liverpool          hit      the

crossbar             with a         shot,          the    c r o w d all             shouted         in a n t i c i p a t i o n        of a g oa l

and    that          caused         a    big       push       from        the       back      which          c a u s e d me     to    be     pushed

off    the       safety            rail       and. o n t o         my     feet       in f r o n t        of     it-       I turned          round

to    see       what       was      happening             and       saw a man                who    was       behind         the     bar wa s

I would          describe               this       m a n as        white,           20-21      years          with     long        black       curly

hair       and       he    ha d a L i v e r p o o l               shirt        on.        Upon      seeing          t h is     I was       in f e a r

of    it    happening               to me          and    I began              to w o r k      my       way    through          the      crowd

forwards             towards            the    fence          to    climb           over      to    get       out.        At    this       t i me    I

lost       sight          of                   I cl i m b e d           up     the     front        fence        which         was    just       to m y

right       hand          s i de    of    the       goal          and     jumped          o n to    the       shingle          pathway         around

the    pitch.

I saw       that          there         were       other          Liverpool            supporters              on     the      pitch       looking

back       into         the       stands.               I s a w a p p r o x irnately six                     police          officers

standing            behind            the        goal.            With      others        we    went         up    to    them asking               them

to    do      something               as     there           were      people        dying         in there.,                The     officers

didn't          do a n y t h i n g           as       they        were      unaware        of w h a t         was       happening            at    that

t ime .

A    couple         of m i n u t e s             later        one      of    the     stewards             got      a small           gate      open         at

the      front          and       people          began           spilling          out    of      it.        Th e      first        person        I saw

came       out      of       the      g at e      was        pushed         back     in by         the       one     officer           standing

r ig h t      by    the        gates.             Then        everyone,             because          of      the     pressure,              just

s p i 1 1 ed       out       of     i t .-

After         a while             about          20     of    us     ran     down       the     pitch         towards          the F o r r e s t

End      as     they         were       singing              about       us.        I was       angry and wanted                      to     f i g ht

them       but      I was           stopped             by    police         on     the    pitch.             I then          began         to w a l k

back       towards             the L i v e r p o o l              end and         saw     loads         of    fans       on the         pitch,

some       l y in g       on      the      pitch         injured..               I was     still          with       s om e    of      the     lads

who      I had          ran a c r o s s           the        pitch with             and    it wa s           then       that       I sa w a        pre s s

photographer                   with        a big         camera          lens       taking          pictures            of    the      dead       and

injured            lying          down.           I wa s          o u t r a g e d at      t h is     and      with       other         lads       rushed

over       to      hi m      and      laid        into        him.          I hit       him     in the            jaw,       the     others        all

over       him and             he     fell         to    the        fl o o r . We    then       left            him and            w e nt    over          to

help       the      injured.                 I     knew       he w a s       press        as    he      h a d a big y e l l o w b i b              on

wi t h     5P r sss'           on     it .

I helped            the        injured            by     rolling            up    jackets          and       putting          them      behind

their         heads          on     the      floor           to    support          them.          If     they       were      conscious               I

would         speak          to     them         to m a k e        s ur e    they were             alright.              I ca n't           remember

how many            I went            too        but     I do        remember           going        to      a young          lad     lyi ng       on

the      floor          on     the      pitch           he w a s      about         12-14          ye a r s , w h i t e      lad,      he was

b lu e     in the            f ac e     and        appeared            to    be     de ad.          Three other              blokes          came

over       to      him with             a stretcher                  and     I helped           pick         him     up o n t o        it a n d

carried            it     over        to     the        corner        of     the     pitch         to     the a m b u l a n c e m a n .            I
                                                                                                                          PAGE!     6


             then      ran     back     a n d w ith o t h e r s      assisted      carrying       p e o p 1e on the

           t advertisement              boards         over    to   the   ambulanceman.           Sometime    later       I began

             to    l oo k     fa r               I c o u l d n ’t f i n d   him    so    I made    my way    out    of t he

             ground.

             I was         wearing      my    b lu e    jean    dungarees     and       a blue    jean   shirt     with    bl ue

             training          sh o e s .

             I left          the     ground    via      the    North Stand        and    along    Leppings    Ln and       then

             onto      a     bus.

           t hi s    match and              to    travel       to S h e f f i e l d    by    trai n.
At           6-30          am         (0630)        on S a t u r d a y        15th A p r i l           1989       <150489),             together            with

                                             I caught          the      train        f r o m _____________________                      to W a t e r l o o .

T he             train              wa s     empty and           I d id       not     see       any     football             supporters               on    this

t ra i n .

At           Waterloo                  we     got     the      tube      at     7,30 am           (0730)          to St          Pancras         to    catch

the              train              to S h e f f i e l d       which         wa s    due     to    leave          at    9.00 am             (0900).

At           St      Pancreas                 Station          I saw a g roup                of L i v e r p o o l / L o n d o n             supporters

about                50        in      numbers           who     were        waiting        to     catch          the       same       train.

The              train              left      St    Pancreas            at    9.00        am and a r r i v e d              at       Sheffield         at    the

scheduled                           t im e    at    11.30 am            (1130)        with        no    delays.

At           the       main            entrance           to S h e f f i e l d        Station           I was          aware          of a h e a v y

Police                 presence,                   one    of     whom        stopped         us a n d        asked          us       where     we w e r e

going.                     I told             him a r o u n d         town.          He    di d    not       say a n y t h i n g            else      and    let

us           carry             on.

iv'i y   s   e   x     a   n   o.                 then w a l k e d       from        the     train          station          into       Sheffield

Town.                  We           decided         to    go     for     a    drink        in one           of    the       public          ho u s e s .     I

c a n ’t r e m e m b e r                      the     name       of     place        but     we    sa w      it w a s        full        of F o r r e s t

f a ns               so we           had      a    pint     of     l ager       each       and     left          to a v o i d         any

confrontation                                between        supporters.

We           then          went            to a     pub whi ch           I believe              was     called          the          Market      Tave r n , i

appeared                       t ha t        we    were     th e      only      supporters              in       that       pub       so we      stayed          fo

about                an        hour          a n d a h a lf        and       drank        about        two       p i nt s    of       ia ger     each and

We           left          the         pub at         about        1 . 45     prn (1345)           to       go    to    the          football         ground.

We           were          both merry                 and      happy         but     not     dru nk .            We    got       a    taxi     from

outside                    the         pub        straight         to    the        football           ground.              The       taxi     dropped           us

right                 outside                the    Leppings            Ln    turnstiles               at    j us t     after          2.00      pm    (1400)

On           arrival                 outside          the      ground         I could           see     there          were          a number         of

supporters                           s p r e a d all        over        Leppings           Ln     end,       approximately                   1000      in

numbers,                       none          of w h i c h      were      queueing           to     get       in but          were       just       hanging

I saw         t h at     there        were       about        four       police         officers,             ail      m a le ,       who       were

standing            by    the        large       gates        to     the      entrance          to      the      ground.              The       gates

I remember               seeing         on    the      big      gates         a s i g n whi ch            read        "L iv er pool

was      marked          with a         large       *B * a n d         I went          in fir s t.            I g av e          my    ticket         to

the      attendant              who     tore       off    the        stub and           gave       me     the      main         part       back.

On     the     otherside              of     the    turnstiles                were      about        six      to      eight          male       police

officers,              one      of w h i c h       did a        body       search         on me.           Whilst           searching              me

he a s k e d        me    if      I had       been       drinking.                I stated           I had         to w h i c h         he      then

stated         that       I looked            a bit       drunk          to      him.        I said        I w a s n ’t a n d              he     let

asked         the      same       questions            and      wa s     also       let      through.              Once         past       the

turnstiles               I could           see     trie t u n n e l         in    front       of     us.

There         were       about        100 L i v e r p o o l          supporters              milling          about         in b e t w e e n         tne

and      then       returned.                I saw       that there              were     about         f o ur        or    five Liverpool

stewards            were        directing           fans        to     the       stands       via       the      tunnel          and       in fact

one      of    them       tried         to d i r e c t   roe       and                  that       way     but      as      we       had v i s i t e d

wanted         a    good       view       p o in t      of       the      match            so we            worked              our     way       into       what

is P e n 3          r i gh t    up       fay the        left         hand          f en c e ,         working               through              the      crowd         to

about       10 y a r d s        from         the     front           fence             n ea r        the      pitch.              We m a n a g e d           to     get

to    what         I think          was      the     second             safety             rail           back        from        the       pitch and               sat

on t h a t         to    get    a good            view       of      the          game.              Th e     s tand was                p a cked.            This

was      not       unusual          in    itself         as       I had             been        there            the        year        before            and      it

was      t hi s     packed          then       but      that         was          at    kick          off        t i me         not     2.15        pm     <1415)

like      now.At          about          2.55      pm     (1455)             the        players               came          out       onto        the      pitch

and      1 stood          up    on       the      bar    to       get        a good             view          of      them.             Somehow            I got

pushed         down       and       sat      on    the       safety               bar      ag a i n .            I was           aware           it wa s

this      as       1 was       being         pushed          forwards                  and       backwards.                      Th e      crowd were

singing            and    everything               appeared               to        be a l r i g h t             apart           from       the a m o u n t             of

people         there.

The      game       started          and       after         a     couple              of m i n u t e s             Liverpool               hit        the

crossbar                w i t h a shot, the              c r o w d all                 shouted              in a n t i c i p a t i o n             of      a goal

and      that           caused a          big. p u s h    from           the           back          which         c a u s e d me           to     be      pushed

off      the       safety       rail         and     onto         my       f e et       in f r o n t             of      it.          I turned             r ou n d

of    it h a p p e n i n g           to me a n d         I began                  to w o r k          my w ay           through             the        crowd

forwards            towards          the       fence         to      climb             over          to     get        out.           At    this          t i me    I

lost      sight          of              ,     I climbed                up the             front            fence          which           wa s     j u st      to m y

right       hand         side       of    the      goal          and      jumped             o n to         the       shingle              pathway           around

the      pitch.

I sa w      that         there       were         other          Liverpool                 supporters                    on      the       pitch          looking

back, into              the    stands.             I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y                        six       police            officers
standing            behind          the       goal.           With      others        we    went         up    to     them asking               them

to    do      something             as    there          were      people       dying          in t he r e .             The      officers

didn't          do a n y t h i n g        as       they       were      unaware        of w h a t         was       happening              at   that

time.

A    couple         of m i n u t e s          later       one      of    the    stewards             got       a small            g at e    o p e n at

the      front          and       people       began          spilling         out     of      it.        The       first         person         I saw

c am e     out      of       the    ga t e     was       pushed         back     in by         the       one    officer            standing

right         by    th e      gates.           Then       everyone,            because          of       the    pressure,               just

spilled            out       of    it.

After         a while             about       20    of    us     ran     down        the    pitch         towards           the      Forrest

End      as     they were               singing          about       us.       I was        angry         and wanted               to      fight

them       but      1 was          stopped          fay p o l i c e      on    the      pitch.            I then           began        to w a l k

back       towards            the       Liverpool             end and         s aw    lo ads        of    fans        on    the      pitch,

some       lying         on       the    pitch       injured.                1 was     s ti l l      with       some        of     the      lads

who      1 had          ran a c r o s s        the       pitch with            and      it w a s         then       that        I saw           f*re.$s

photographer                  with       a big       camera          l en s    taking          pictures             of     the     dead and

injured            lying          down.        I was          o u t r a g e d at      t hi s    and with              other        lads         rushed

over       to      him a n d        laid       into       him.          I hit        h im   in the            jaw?,      the      others        all

over       him and            he    fell       to     the       fl o or .      We     then      left          him and          went        over          to

help       the      injured.              I    knew       he w a s       p r e ss     as     he     h a d a big           y e l l o w bib       on

I helped            the       injured          by    rolling            up    jackets          and       putting           them      behind

their         heads          on    the    floor          to    support         tnem.           if    1 hey w e r e          conscious                i

would         speak          to    them       to m a k e       s u re    they were             alright.               1 c a n ’t r e m e m b e r

how many            I went          too       but    I do        remember            going      to a y o u n g             lad     lying        on

the      floor          on    the       pitch       he    wa s    a b o u t I E - 14         years, white                 lad,      he wa s

b l ue     in      the       face       and    appeared            to    be dead.              Three other                blokes           came

over       to      him w it h a s t r etc he r                   and     I helped           pick         him    up       o n to    it a n d

carried            it    over       to    the       corner        of     the    pitch          to    the       ambulanceman.                     I

then       ran      b a ck        and    with       others        assisted            carrying            people           on     the

           to     look    for               I couldn*t          find   him    so   I made    my way    out   of    the

Dear

              Thank you for your letter of 7th December.

      I can assure you that The Football Association is opposed
to and will continue to oppose the government's ideas on a
compulsory membership scheme.

      The one thing that may well persuade the Minister for Sport
that his views are misguided is a sack-full of letters from the
public telling him so.  May I suggest you write direct to
Mr. Moynihan at the following address:

                                           House of Commons
                                           London
                                           S.W.1.




                                                         Yours sincerely

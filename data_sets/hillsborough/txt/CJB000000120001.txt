                                 RESOLUTIONS to DLP 10.10.89.
1. EMPLOYMENT-TRAINING - Hal lam CLP
   This DLP -reiterates its' opposition to ET, reiterates Party policy on the~,r£
   Principles"? and therefore requires?                                                 "** ”*  '
   a) that any involvement, .with the Traj.nlng 'and Enterprise' Council -is in. line with that
      policy?.
   b) that Labour nominees withdraw from the TEC if that policy is subsequently "breached.
EC REC* ‘SUPPORT        '

2. ROE WOOD SCHOOL - Brightside CLP.....                               ’                   " ::
   This Party believes that Roe Wood School is a real assert tc the area, and as such
   should be .improved and expanded, -not closed.
EC NO REC.

3. CCA REDUCTIONS - Hallam CLP & Womens Section.
   This CLP is seriously concerned about the reductions in the number of child care ‘
 .-assistants (CCAs) in Sheffield.schools. We believe that these cuts are having a
   serious effect on the early education of a large number of young children in this city,
     articularly those with Special Educational Needs.- CCAs should be seen as an integral
   ^<art of a. front-line service. ■' Furthermore, women on low pay are the..victims cf the.
   cuts for which the Government is ultimately to blame.
   We therefore request that Sheffield City Council abandon this action and reinstate .
   redeployed CCAs.                                                                   ■
EC j^ jC: s&Ps. Jones Report .                               —            .     •
                                                                                .
4. RESIGNATION OF CHIEF CONSTABLE - Hillsborough CLP
   This DLP abhors the decision made by the S.Y.Police Authority not to accept the
   resignation of the Chief Constable, in the wake of the Hillsborough Disaster.
   We express our concern at the way the decision was reached and support the efforts of •
   Sheffield’s Labour representatives oh the Police Authority to discuss the matter
   properly before a decision was made.
   We therefore call upon the Police Authority to reconsider it's decision .and accept the
   original offer to resign by the Chief Constable cf S.Yorks.
EC REC: SUPPORT


   5.      RESIGNATION OF CHIEF CONSTABLE! - Central CLP.
     lis DLP condemns the decision of the S.Y.Police Authority not to accept the
- resignation of the Chief Constable, Mr* teter Wrighti     We believe that;
   1. The decision was made before the Report had been fully Studied by some members.
   2. The decision shews, -or implies, a reluctance to accept the results of an Independent
       Inquiry.
   3. It implies that the Police Force may deliberately distort the truth and be "evasive
       witnesses" - even in a Judicial Inquiry - and yet remain unaccountable.
   4.. By keeping Mr Wright in his pest, after he had publicly assumed responsibility for
       Police actions, the Authority is confirming hard Justice Taylor's "anxiety” that the
       lessons of Hillsborough have not been learnt and that the refusal to face
       responsibility is not "seemly (or) encouraging forthe.xuture^ <.
   5. This DLP therefore passes a Vote of No Confidence in the Police Authority, and
       agrees to send'a letter stating our position to Liverpool Football club, the
       Supporters' Club and t n Liverpool City Cuncil.
EC REC SUPPORT                -                             -                  '', w

       HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER: LETTER FROM GEORGE HOWARTH MP


       I am responding to your minute of 14 November covering a draft
       reply for Lord Ferrers1 signature to the letter from George
       Howarth MP to the Home Secretary.


       2.     The Taylor Inquiry was set up by G2, not F8.            Lord Justice
       Taylor1s terms of reference were:-


              "To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football
              ground on 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about
              the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events."


       Although    the   Taylor   Inquiry   considered   in   great    detail   the
       policing on the day this was in the context of ensuring safety.
       These points are relevant to the penultimate paragraph of the
       proposed draft reply.      The third sentence of that paragraph could
       be taken to suggest that Taylor1s Inquiry was one where the whole
       conduct of a force in relation to the community it policed was
       in question.      As the next sentence of the draft acknowledges,
       this is not the case.        I think it may be a little misleading,
       therefore, to go on to suggest that the Taylor Inquiry would be
       regarded by the Home Secretary as having already covered "these
       issues" - whatever is meant by this broad formulation.
3.    The penultimate paragraph of the draft might be re-cast as
follows:-


      "Your main concern however in writing to me was, if I have
      read your letter right,                the feeling that there should be
      some    further       investigation          of     police      operations     at
      Hillsborough as a whole.                 In the light of the very wide
      ranging and thorough investigations which have already been
      conducted,       it       is     difficult        to     see    that   another
      investigation at this time could be productive."


It is for you to consider whether the third and the first half
of   the   fourth    sentences of your draft paragraph need                       to be
retained in the draft at all.                 The draft should certainly avoid
any possible implication that the Taylor Inquiry was concerned
with "the whole conduct of a force in relation to the community
it policed".


4.    On another matter, the last sentence of the second complete
paragraph    of     page    3   of     the    draft     says   that   neither     Chief
Superintendent        Duckenfield            nor   Superintendent        Murray     has
"committed any crime".               It might be better to say that neither
"has been charged with any crime".                    The sentence, amended as I
suggest, might fit better at the end of the preceding paragraph,
the first     full paragraph on page 3.


5.    Incidentally Mr Duckenfield1s name is spelt with an "e" in
the second syllable throughout the Taylor Report.                      You may know,
which I do not, whether this or your version is a mis-spelling.


6.    In the light of G2's interest in the Taylor Inquiry you may
wish to show relevant papers to Mr Miles.

Dul^irto the d e n s i t y of the                crowd,        observations          regarding           pickpockets;

befcarnse centred a r o u n d              the area          immediately          in front         of the metal

Whilst      at this         l o c ation      I recall          moving      numerous         bottles       of    both

officer         (female)       were       constantly moving                the    crowd on who were                 just

standing about,               these       people       obviously          had    no t i c k e t s .      This was

.interf erring w i t h              the   op e r a t i o n   to     catch offenders           so much so            that

several         likely      suspects         were m o v e d         on by the      officers.

At 2 . 20.pm (1420)            or      t hereabouts          the     crowd became           very dense,            so much

so that         the    observations            team      including         myself was         forced        to move         out

from the area a d j a c e n t              to the metal              fencing      to an area of             relative

                I spoke       to several          fans    saying        "Don't        go forward,       stay    b a c k ’.     Many

                i g n a red this.

               At     this    point       I saw several           people        climbing       on the fences          around        the

                helping       others       up onto       the     fence     tops..       I then saw one          fan    c i imb over

                 tywas       obvious at          this    stage      that m a n y       people were       being     crushed at

 The M d u n t e 4 o f f i c e r s       s t r e n g t h had been          increased,,        and saw that         those

 other     obvious        Po l i c e m a n p o w e r      deployed         in that area.

 people      pushing a g a i n s t          i t ,'the front         of the horse             started      to    rise with

 The -mood of the              crowd was            now very d e sperate and becoming more and

 more    hostile.

 pushing,        some     of     these m e n were            crying        in what       1 believe        was

 was    par t i a l l y successful,                 five Police          horses       completing         the    line,

 however as         the     crowd        pushed       forward       the     horses were          pushed        towards

     At 3 0 5 pm        ( 1505)       or th e r e a b o u t s        whilst    in the        gym having        rneal ,

     i n f o r m a t i o n was       r e c eived        that    the    crowd was        on the      pitch and           that all

     ava i l a b l e    uniform         personnel           to at t e n d     that area.         T o g e t h e r with both

     D C ’s Lock i n g and A s k e w               left     the      gym and    took     up a p o s ition near                to

     the       entrance        to    the     pitch,       however,       having       been there        only a short

     time,       together           w i t h the- other          officers       I was     instructed          to    return to

     the gym to await                 casualties.

     wh.i. 1st    in    the gym         J. was      informed          that    there    had been deaths              in the

     ground and was                 told     to    clear       the    gym by Chief          Inspector     Beal' and to

fJ^make it ready                to    receive           corpses.

If   ihe bodies          then        began        to arrive          within    the    gym,    the    f irst       person

     having       been    carried            into    that area was             thought        to be dead however                   it

     was       found   that         he w a s n ‘t dead and the r e f o r e was m oved to one                         side.

     Ihe a rea w i th i n            the   gym was         now       ready to    receive       the    bodies       and those

     that* were        brought         in were          blue      in the      face,    many o b v i o u s l y     dead,       some.

END Of ftL FOR I
Evidence relating to incident Sheffield Wednesday football ground 15th

April 1989.




   At 9•00am on Saturday the 15 th of April 1989* I commenced duty at Hammerton
Road Police Station, my duties on that being one of a number of C.I.D officers,
who were to work under the direct control of Detective Inspector TOWELL as part
of a Pick pocket team*


   At § ,45am that same day I attended the Sheffield Wednesday football ground
and together with other officers I was briefed in relation to the forth coming
Semi final football match between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC*


   At 1 1,30am that same day, I commenced observations regarding the pick pockets
in the Leppings Lane turn stile area along with Det Sgt McSLOY, Det Con HALT.AM,
Det Con LOCKING, a further team was also operating in that area, those officers
being Det Sgt SMITH, Det Con LILLSX and Det Con LINDSAY*
At that time   our brief was to identify travelling pick pockets and if possible
to carry out   a surveilance on those persons*
Due to this Det Con HALLAM was in possession of a wallet alarm, and the remainder
of the team were to be in a position in order to respond &o a signal to be
given by DC HALLAM.


On Taking up   our positions in the area of the Leppings Lane Turnstile and padock
area, the area was very quiet and the corwd being sparse, Uniform officers were
on duty in that area, officers were at each turnstile entrance gate, and officers
were on duty at a barricade on the drive way to the rear of the south stand.
Further officers were on duty as a coach reception party in the area immediately
in front of the Turnstiles, It appeared at that time the number of uniformed
Police officers was in the region of 40,
At this time the crowd which had started to gather was mixed with many families
being present, the behaviour of the fans was good humoured.


As the afternoon wore on the crowd steadily built up and the mood became fairly
hostile, because numerous fans were milling around without tickets, at this
time I lost count of the number of people v/ho approached me and asked whether
I had either tickets to sell or just spare,
I personally saw a number of men selling tickets with large groups of people
stood around them, v/ho were obviously trying to buy tickets for the game.
Due to this the area around the corner shop which is directly adjacent to the
football stadium became particulary congested.


The vehicular traffic along Leppings lane itself appeared to grind to a halt, wi
                       Page two


the odd vehicle passing, although it should be said, that numerous coaches and
Public service vehicles came along that road under Police motor cycle escort to

the reception area*
The uniformed officers in that location attended those vehicles and a search of
persons leaving the vehicles was undertaken*
I recall seeing two coaches arrive at the same time, two officers appaoached one
vehicle and the remainderofhe serial 6 or 8 officers approached the other vehicle,
I recall thinking that there was less officers in that area, than there had been
in previous years* However I must say that I had seen several arrests take place
and belive that this may have drawn strength away from the reception party.
At this time there were no problems and no real cause for concern involving public

disorder.


It should be pointed out that Mounted officers were operating in the Leppings lane
turn stile     and padock area, the number of officers being Tito sergeants, one of thos.
being a South Yorkshire officer, four Police Constables, two of those being male

Mersey side officers*
The Mersey side officers operating in the area directly in front of the Padock and

turn stiles.


    At around 1 .15p.m, together with the other members of the Pick pocket team,
I walked along Leppings Lane, due to reports of pick pockets operating further
along the road, at this time numerous people just     hanging about, sat on the
pavement leaning against th-} walls, sat on the parapet    of the bridges, many cf
these people were drinking from cans and bottles of assorted intoxcants.
I even recall seeing a very attractive young young with two friends, drinking
from cans of lager, in the space of approximately     half an hour I saw this one giril
open and sirink four cans of lager.


   At around 1.30p.m, together with Det Con HALLAM and remainedr of team, I walked
down Leppings Lane, in the direction of the Round about, the observations went as
far as the Chip shop situated at the junction of Leppings Lane and Bickerton Road,
at this location we loitered. The crowd at this time was quiet dense, still
numerous fans approaching people including myself and asking to buy tickets, many
of the fans in the area the worse for drink, quiet a lot of litter mainly beer

cans*
Whilst walking back to the original observation area in front of the Padock area,
I identified one particular fan as being a ticket tout, I apporached him, enquired
how much he was selling the tickets at to which he replied £>~30 . 00p , I immediately
approached Inspector SYKES and informed him of the situation, I believe that that

man was arrested.
                                 Page Three


     Due to the density of the crowd, observations regarding pick pockets, became
centred around the area immediately in front of the metal fencing in front of the Padock
turnstile area. The observations team loitering around the corner shop and the entrances
to both the North Stand and the Leppings Lane end standing entrances.
Whilst at this location I recall moving numerous bottles, of both alcohol and soft drinks
which had been discarded underneath the fencing and behind, in order that they would-be
out of harms way.


     The Mersey side Mounted officers together with One South Yorkshire officer(female)
were constantly moving the crowd on who were just standing about, these people obviously
had no tickets. This was interfering with the operation to catch offenders so much so,
that several likley suspects were moved on by the officers.


    At 2,20p,m or thereabouts the crowd became very dense, so much so that the observations
team including myself was forced to move out from the area adjacent to the metal fencing
to an area of relative calm beneath the the signs on the metal fencing further along,
towards the entrances to the West stand.
Whilst at that location repea&edly asked for spare tickets or tickets for sale, those
persons obviously now getting very worried about seeing the football match, the majority
of those persons having enquired about tickets, moved into the padockarea and towards
turnstiles, which by now had large queue*s.
At the present location I liased with Det Sgt McSLOY, who reported seeing an Asian wearing
glasses and sheepskin coat plus one other, constantly moving in and out of queue&s in the
padock area. It appeared that these men were pick pockets, the two men had disappeared
from view having come out of the padock area, therefor it was suggested that the entire
pick pocket team would sfblit up and search for the two males,
Det Sgt McSLOY, DG*s LOCKING and ASKEW moved off from the area which we had now taken up,
which was directly adjacent to the road way and is on a lipwhich afords a view which is
slightly elevated and looks down on the heads on the persons queing to gain entrance to
the football stadium.
After a short time, the entire observation team re-joined in the aforementioned area,
the ccowd at this time now being very dense and it seemed that from the area near to the
shop some considerable distance away right upto the ground was totally blocked by people
moving towards the ground. By this tine vehicular traffic had ceased and the entire carr-
aigeway was blocked by ppople.


    Whilst stood with DC's HALLAM and LILLEY and looking down into the padock area which
was now totally full with people and still more walking towards the ground, I saw groups
of jrhang men pushing into the crowd, the majority of these being the worse for drink,
I saw several carrying and drinking from large 2 litre bottles of both Lager and Beer,
At this time I noted that the police horses were moving amongst the dense crowd in front oj
the padock area trying to elevate the situation.
                    Page Four,


My impression of the situation was that the crowd was becoming desperate due to having
no tickets and with no hope of getting tickets, also the fact that the ones who had
tickets would miss the start of the game due to large amount of peopel. trying to gain
entry to the stadium.


      I cannot recall the time, but whilst stood at this location a Police Land rover
cam along the Leppings Lane, with Blue Light and two tone hornsoperating, the vehicle
stopped near to where we were stood.
I looked both down and up Leppings Lane and the area was totally blocked ia both
directions with people moving towards the foot ball ground.
I was now stood to one side of the land rover with DC*s HALLAM and LILLEY, and whilst
there we were joined by a uniform Inspector identity unknown.
P.G BUXTON the driver of the vehicle, alighted and stood on the body of the vehicle
and whilst doing so he was using the vehicles P.A system, repeatedly stating PLEASE
STOP PUSHING THESE ARE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT BEING CRUSHED, I noted several large
groups of young Liverpool fans?, who were pushing into the crowd and making some head­
way towards the turnstiles, these fang pushing others out of the way.
I spoke to several fans saying DON'S GO FORWARD STAY BACK, many ignored this.


     At this point I saw several people climbing on the fences around the padock area
once climbing into that position those people were then helping others up onto the
fence tops. I then saw one fan climb over into the actual ground, he was then followed
by others, I then saw Inspector BENNETT appear on the roof of the turn stile area,
I saw the officer asrist several fans to climb into the ground area.
It was obvious at this stage that many people were being crushed at the turnstiles,
people were not moving throught the actual turnstiles, and I recall thinking that I
couldJi*t see any Police Helmets at the turnstiles.
    Both P.C BUXTON and the unknown uniform Inspector were now using the P.A system,
repeafledly asking the crowd to stop pushing and that there was people being crushed
I recall one of the officers stating that game was going to be delayed.
The people .till approaching the ground and turnstiles were tailing no notice
whatsoever and were continuing to push forward.


     The mounted officers strength had been increased, and saw that those officers
 were attempting to get nearer the turnstiles to enable people to gain entry to the gr
 ground. Still no one taking any notice and still more people pushing forward.
 At this time there was no other obvious Police Manpower deployed in that area.
     I observed the Police Mounted Inspector, obviously shouting at the crowd, I noted
that his horse seemed to be going under due to the people pushing against it, the fron
of the horse started to rise with the read end disappearing from view, it appeared tha
the officer was falling backwards, however somehow he regained his footing.
The mood of the crowd v/as now very desperate and becoming more and more hostile.
                            Page Five*


 The anger of the crowd now being directed at the -uniformed officers present, I noted
 several people coming towrds both PC BUXTON and the Inspector, pushing at those
 officers, saying do something, stop the pushing, some of these men v?ere crying in
 what I believe was frustration at the situation*
            P.C BUXTON who was continually using the P.A system then directed the mounted
 officers to form a line in front of the Padock area, this was partially successful,
five police horses completing the line, however as the crowd pushed forward the horsee
were pushed towards the ground#
P.C BUXTON still attempting to reassure the crowd stating that they would all get in
and to stop pushing#
I recall seeing Inspector BENNETT who was still on the roof of the turnstiles and
was still pulling people onto the roof*
By now I couldn't actually see the turnstiles due the vast sea of people      and still
no sign of police helmets, P.C BUXTON still attempting to re-assure the crowd*


Whilst stood at that location a large Roar from within the ground, it appeared to me,
that the football teams had come onto the pitch, this being around, 2,55p.m, the mood
of the crowd being desperate, more and more fans pushing forward, still many carrying
both cans and bottles of drink*
           Together with the other officers of the observation team knowing that we
couldn't help the situation I moved off down Vere Road,
’
Whilst walking- down that road another large Rora from within the ground was heard,
I noted that football fans were running up that road in the direction of the Leppings
Lane end, those fans obviously coming from Liverppol*
Having walked down that road and into Penistone Road, I noted that there was very
few spectators in that area, together with the other officers I #hen went into the
gym.


           At 3.05p.m or thereabouts whilst in the gym having meal, information was
received that the crowd was on the pitch and that all available uniform personell
to attend that area. Together with both DC'S LOCKING and ASKEW left the gym and
took up a position near to the entrance to the pitch, however having been there
only a short time, together with the other officers I was instructed to return to
the gym to await casulties*
Whilst in the gym I was informed that there had been deaths in the ground, and was
told to clear the gym by Chief Inspector BEAL and to make it ready to receives
corpses*


           The bodies then began to arrive within he gym, the first person having been
carried into that area was thought to be dead however it was found that he wasn't dead1
and therefor was moved to one side.
The area within the gym     was no   ready to receive the bodies, and those that were
                        Page Six.


brought in were blue in the face, many obviously dead, some of which were still
being attended by first aid personell, I noted that several of the bodies(deceased)
had vomited and soiled themselves and I recall seeing one which had blood coming
from his head body orifices.
All the deceased which were brought into the gym were accompanied by Police Officers,
some being carried in on make shift stretches and others actuall being carried,
I recall seeing one Female police officer and some spectators struggling with the
body of a small young male, I went to her assistance and took hold of the boy and
serried him into the main hall and placed     him o n the floor along with the many others,
the female officer then stayed with the deacsed.
Many of the bodies I saw obviously had broken limbs and many were in some form of state
of undress*
         Together with other officers mainly C.I.D F1 personel, I moved amongst the
bodies and Police officers, instructing the officers to stay with the deceased and to
make a brief description of the body and to search the body for both personal}, effects
and identification, I handed the officers plastic bags and labels*
Having completed this task, again together with other F1 G.I.D personel, I searched
several bodies placed them into body bags, making sure that the head was the first
thing to be   seen once the bag was opened, the bodies were then lined up in rows of
twelve, the   attending officers were again instructed to stay with the deceased*
         I cannot recall the tins but it some considerable time later certainly
after Six 0<?clock, I was instructed to convey the very distruaght relatives and
freinds of the deceased to Hammerton Hoad Police station, I did this by using a
coach and together with other officers D.Insp TOl/SLL and DC LOCKING, on arrival
at Harnraerton Hoad Police Station the relative ware -...ulnA to rcsiain in th«; care of the
social services who were by now in the Hillsborough Boys club.


From that time until 8,00pm on Friday the 21st of April 19&9, I was a member of the
exhibits team under the direction of Det Sgt McSLOY dealing with all the personal
effects clothing and othereEhibits, at that time stated the entire exhibit side of
disaster was handed over to the W est ^idland Police enquiry team*


        With regard to the day of the disaster I cannot recall the time of the trunstil
 being opened but I recall being told that the gates would be open at 12 noon in order
 for spectators to gain entry to th     ground,
        I have just over 10 years police service, and during that entire period I have
 worked at the Sheffield Wednesday fooi ball stadium and may others, and during that
 time on every match bar say a couple I have completed duty in or around the Leppings
 Lane turnstile area* I recall thinking at one stage that the number of officers on
 for the actual coach reception was fewer than normal in particular with regard to
 larger matches.

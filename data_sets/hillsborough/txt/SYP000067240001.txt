              a great     deal     of trouble             finding       our      speck    just at that        stage    the

We s tood there for a short while and the                              players       came out          onto    the

p i t c h , t h e y were kicking        the ball a ro un d and that was when                           I first

felt    crushed from all              four      sides.        I knew something was wrong and was

tota ll y unable to move.                   This    crushing wasn't            a gradual          thing       it just

happened.         As    I was    being       crushed my mates all               got sep er at ed from me.

1 could hear           people    scr ea mi ng an d fans              climbing      over     the    perimeter

fence and            people were even clirnbing/tfver my head to get to                                 the    fence

and out        onto    the     pitch.        Ic o u l / h e a r    people    s creaming at a P o l i c e m a n

to open the gate              onto    the    o^fch,      but he w o u l d n ' t , I even saw the

Po li ce    throwing         people    tykcV.    into the Pens who had got                   out.        I then saw

a Policeman           c ome oveij/and open the gate                   to   let fans onto the               pitch.          I

game    had kicked off until                 I got      out of the ground,                I then saw another

P o l i c e m a n trying      to shut       the g a t e on fans at            this       point    I got       pushed

onto a crash barrier and                    I knew      I *had to get a wa y from                it.     I tried

pushing        back with my hands               but the       pressure       from behind was             too    great

me total        strangers       were    s ho uting at me to keep my head up and breathe,

the    crush eased s li gh t ly and                I m a n a g e d to get a        coupole        of breaths

then    I beleive a load of Pol ic e                    came down the tunnel                and over          towards

time and        I think       the Po li ce       got    people       out   from behind us an d                some

onto    the     pitch.        I was    gett in g       turned a r o u n d and ended up facing                       the

        I h on estly didn't           realise what was happening,                       I thought       I'd just        had

        the w in d knoc ke d out me nothing more                           but as the        crush eased

        bloke      up off the ground.             I put my hand on his shoulder and

        looked up at me,             a P o l i c e m a n then        pushed me out of the way and took

        over      from               and w ith that                         and     I wa lk ed back     t h ro ug h the

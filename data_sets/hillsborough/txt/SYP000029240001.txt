Dear Sir,

R e : Barrier Testing

Further to our Fax of 16th June, 1989 in connection with the above
we enclose copies of our methods for testing barriers together
with test results from Odsal and Aston Villa which help to illus­
trate the two methods used.

With regard to your second question we have no experience in deter-
mining ground capacities.   However we suggest you contact
Mr.           I _____________________________________ I City of
Bradford Metropolitan Council, Jacobs Well, Bradford.BDl.5RW.

Thirdly we would like to add the following observations regarding
barrier testing:-

a)   The code refers to peak viewing areas but only defines those
      for football.  Where are the peak viewing areas for other
      sports ie: Rugby, Speedway etc.?

b)   There is a lower test load for new barriers as                opposed to old -
     why?

c)   The code does not appear to include any requirement to check
     that recommendations contained in a test report have been imp­
     lemented.  We raise this point as there have been instances,
     when returning the following year for further testing, where
     we have found that our recommendations (either wholly or partly)
     have not been carried out.

d)   Whilst we consider ourselves capable of designing and adapting
     equipment to pull or push Barriers/handrails, some are extremely
     difficult, if not impossible, to test.  Designers of sports

d)   cont.
     grounds should be more aware that testing is necessary.

We would like to point out that we are, at present, in the barrier
testing season and, should you have any constructive suggestions or
ideas, we would be very pleased to receive them in order that we
may give them consideration during the course of our work.

Should you require any further information, or assistance please
do not hesitate to contact us.

Yours faithfully,

       PROCEDURE FOR TESTING BARRIERS. METHOD No.       1.

      This method is used at Barnsley and Aston Villa F. C's.


1.    Determine the load    to be applied.

2.    Measure the length    of the barrier   to be tested.

3.    Calculate the load    to be applied.

4.    Set up the rig and    zero the scales.

5.    Ap ply the load.

6.    Measure the deflection.

7.    Wait 5 minutes and release the load.

8.    Measure the return and calculate the       percentage recovery.

9.    App ly the load.

10.   Measure the deflection from new start point.

11.   Wait 5 minutes and release the load.

12.   Measure the return and calculate the       percentage recovery.

13.   Apply the load.

14.   Measure the deflection from new start point.

15.   Wait 5 minutes and release the load.

16.   Measure the return and calculate the       percentage recovery.

17.   If th e last test is less than 75%, retest as 4 to 16.

18.   Move the rig.

19.   Whilst the tests are being carried out the following observations
      are m a d e :

               a) Watch for cracking of concrete around stanchion
                  bases.

               b)   Inspect welds for defects.

               c) Look for defects on barriers such as rust, holes
                  in tubular sections and po o r base plate details
                  where applicable.

 6      The general appearance of the barriers on the Northern
        Terrace is poor.   Rust is evident, particularly on the
        non-galvanised sections (N.B. some of the new tubular
        barriers are not galvanised and are rusting).
        The equipment used to test the barriers is by necessity
        quite heavy and damage to the b a r r i e r s ' protective coating
        is inevitable.   We recommend that a maintenance programme
        be instigated and that barries tested each ye a r are repainted.
        This would result in a barrier being repainted every 5 years.

 7     We consider the scaffolding segregation barriers on the
       Northern Terrace to be ineffective and dangerous.   We
       recommend it be removed and if necessary repla ced by a
       proper segregation fence.

 8     The scaffolding segregation barriers on the South Western
       Terrace have dangerous protrusions on wh ic h people could
       become impaled. These should also be removed or replaced
       as a b o v e .

 9     For the purpose of this document the following result
       sheets are titled as follows.

10     When first tested there were several barriers which failed
       to achieve the required standard, these were re tested
       and are marked such in the report.
       It was generally found that the reason for failure was
       the i-BS'dsk of and defective grout at the base of the
       gta nc hio ns . We would recommend that where the grouting is
       defective the stanchion base be scraped of all loose or
       defective debris and the core repacked with concrete to
       fill.all voids and achieve a reasonably wa t e r tight seal
       around base of stanchions.

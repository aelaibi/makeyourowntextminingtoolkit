POLICE CONSTABLE 3173




HEADQUARTERS PROSECUTION




On Saturday          15 April       1989 I commenced duty at the Hillsborough Football

Ground    at    9-^0       am,   I was    assigned      to Serial     63      with Sergeant 2777 Ian

Johnson      in charge.          I attended the briefing given to all officers in the

North Stand of the ground and then went with the Sergeant and five other

male Police Constables boarded a transit van to begin general public order

patrol    in the vicinity of Bradfield Road,                     Langsett Road,         Infirmary Road

and Penistone Road.                We visited a number of public houses and                    whilst most

were     full       with    supporters       and     even    spilling      out   onto    the     pavement,

everyone       was    in    good    order    and     good    spirits, some       had    even    got   mixed

supporters       but there         was no trouble       until    approximately          2.20 pm when we

attended       at    the    Royal    Hotel,    Bradfield Road/Penistone Road                where      rival

fans   had      entered      and    broken     the    pool    table     and    thrown    glasses.        The

Licensee was spoken to and the fans were                      asked to leave as it             was getting

near kick off time.                At this time I did         speak to some of the             fans asking

if they      had got       tickets,      some of them had,        others hadn't.           Although not

drunk, all these fans had consumed a great deal of alcohol.

The public house was closed and another Serial of officers stayed to make

sure   that the broken glasses                and bottles and all the rubbish outside was

cleared by the staff.
At approximately 2.^0 prn we attended at the Horse and Jockey Public House,

Wadsley    Lane,   where    on    arrival        I saw     about     100 Liverpool       fans   drinking

outside   the pub,       and as before the person in charge was seen and advised

and the sale of intoxicants was stopped.                       On this occasion I did speak to

a gentleman      who     informed      me    that it was       he    who had    telephoned      for    the

Police    to attend      as the       situation in relation to people urinating in                     his

garden and that of the empty house attached next door had got out of hand.

At this public house there were children who had come with relatives who

really had drunk         too much alcohol to be in control of them.                        As the      time

was   getting very       near    to kick off the fans were                asked to vacate the          pub

and make their way down Wadsley Lane to the Ground.                            This they did, and we

followed in the Transit Van.                At this point we were requested to pick up a

Police Officer         and prisoner at the bottom of Wadsley Lane and transport

them to Hammerton Road Police Station and this request was complied with.

At approximately 3-10 pm we were requested to attend outside the Ground at

the Leppings Lane end, none of the Officers in the back of the van at this

time were aware what            was    happening.        We    travelled along Middlewood Road

picking     up   other    officers          on   the   way     and    arriving    at     Leppings      Lane

alighting the van just below the traffic lights of Catchbar Lane.                                We were

not told anything of what had happened inside the stadium just to wait and

see if we were needed,           there seemed to be confusion everywhere.                       I walked

down to the outside gates of the ground and was asked to wait there until

emergency    vehicles      had    arrived,         still      no    one   could   tell    me    what   had

happened or didn't want to.

Supporters then started to come out of the ground, some were in a state of

distress, shock, ill and drunk.                  They were shouting at the Police Officers

that it was all our fault, spitting at us, trying to fight, the scene was
one of pandemonium.              People were asking where        they could telephone home

and were       pointed    in the direction of the public              call boxes.     Others had

lost    their       belongings    including tickets    home     and    their shoes.     At this

point I was still unaware of what had happened.                   A space was made for the

emergency vehicles to get as far into the ground as possible.                       During this

time a far, handed to me a Seiko watch and just shouted to me he had picked

it     up on    the   terraces.      This was   later handed      in.     Fans   that had lost

relatives       or friends tried to get back into the ground to look for them,

all this seemed to go on for a very long time, bodies were brought out of

the ground and laid at the side of the river until vehicles could get to

remove them.          It wasn't until about 4.30 pm that I found out the enormity

of what had happened and was given the emergency number that we could give

people to ring for enquiries.              Throughout all this I did not have a radio

nor did any of my colleagues around me.                I did hear one message come over

the tannoy from the ground at approximately 4.20 pm but cannot now recall

the text.

At approximately 6.00 pm I was asked along with a male officer to go to

the     directors      entrance.      I   was   informed   by   two     reporters   from   Radio

Sheffield and Hallam that            the then Lord Mayor,        Mrs Smith, had requested

that they attend the directors suite in order to speak to her and that she

was to give an interview to them on what had taken place.                     I requested the

reporters      to wait outside and I went in search of Mrs Smith.                   I spoke to

her,    and informed her of the two people             from the radio stations awaiting

her interview.          I was informed by her that this was not the case and that

she had never asked to see them and I was asked to inform them that there

would    be    no    interviews    whatsoever   that   night.     Mrs Smith's message was

relayed to these two people.
Before     being posted        to    the    directors      entrance,        Serial   63   with   Sergeant

Johnson     had   all    met    up        again    and    had    been   directed     to    incidents   of

fighting on Halifax Road.                 At the White Horse Public House, Halifax Road/

Southey Green Road, young fans, 16-20 years old, were buying lager/beer at

an   off    licence     and    were        being   videod       by   some    freelance     journalists.

Because     the youngsters had obviously been drinking previously and because

of the situation they did not                 take kindly to this so they tried to start

fighting but fortunately we were on hand to stop the situation before it

got out of hand.         The video people were asked to get into their cars and

leave    the area.      The youngsters were put into their transit van with the

help of their friends who were sober and told to go home.

My colleague and I were relieved from the post at the directors entrance

at   approximately      8.15        pm,    when    we    were   instructed      to go     to Cl ay wheels

Lane.      At approximately 9-00 pm we were                     instructed to standby at Niagara

and at 10.00 pm told to stand down.

            I am                                       and I live at

                                Sheffield.         I have                          in the Hillsborough

            area for twenty four years.

            I have been going to                                                 for twenty two years,

            At about seven O'clock                (0700 hrs) on the morning of Saturday 15th

            turned on to Leppings Ln I saw a group/of about five or six football

            supporters near to the petrol garage                        ipposite Farndale Rd.

            The supporters were all                carrying             appeared t of be cans of beer.        At

            least one of the group was drinking from a cary

            All the people I describe as football supporters                        in my statement     I

            assume that the majority were Liverpool ^s up po rt er s.                   The supporters

colours of Liverpool and Nottingham Forest but I also saw a lot of

scarves with Liverpool written on being worn and I also saw a lot of

supporters wearing the Liverpool           team shirt with ’Candy"      written

across the chest,

I continued driving along Leppings Ln towards Mi^tdlewood Rd.                 At the

junction of Middlewood Rd and Wadsley Ln I s                 a group of about six

supporters who were all         carrying cans of bjf e r .    There were three or

four more supporters a short distance be/find but they were not

carrying anything.

I then left the general area of the football ground and continued

             which is in Loxley and Middlewood.

After completing                    I returned to                  collect my own

motor car and drive home.

I left                  and drove back along Leppings Ln onto Middlewood Rd

and up Wadsley Ln.          It was now about ten past eleven <1110 hrs> and

there were large numbers of supporters building up in the area.

I reached the top of Wadsley Ln and I stopped at the junction with

Dykes Hall Rd.         My view to the left w a / o b s c u r e d by parked cars.

I looked to the right and saw the Hoa^e and Jockey public house.

There was about one hundred foptba^rl fans standing outside the pub

dr i nk in g .

I tried to pull away from the junction but ms/"view to the right was

obscured by a group of about thirty suppoiyjnsrs who were standing                 in a

bus   layby.       They were jumping up and dovyf and shouting.         Many of the

group were drinking from bottles and earns,             From their general

appearance and demeanor they appeareVT to be drunk.               I am unable to

describe         individuals, all   I can say but they were all men who varied

in age from about eighteen to forty.

I shouted out of the window and I asked them to move but I was                   ignored,

I eventually managed to pull out and continued on my journey.

         A few minutes      later I drove past the Wad«^fey Jack public house on

         Rural Ln.

         I saw about fifty or sixty supporters outside the pub drinking but

         there was no disorder-            v   *                        ^    ^    ~

         I then drove past the Sportsman public housjf on Warral Rd.        There were

         about thirty supporters standing outside j f r inking but again I saw no

         d is o r d e r .

         I then made my way home.

                                                                              SIGNED

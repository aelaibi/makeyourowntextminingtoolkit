All      the      bodies          seemed             to    have        been        sick       and          it       had       run      down

over      the       bodies         into          the       well        beneath           the       wall             ami       it    was

swilling            around         my       feet.            I       could        just      about              stand          in     the

the      legs       of     the     fat       man,          everybody               had      urinated                 themselves

I    became         aware         of    a    st r o n g          and        obv i ous       s m e 11           of    b e e r / 1 a g er

some      had       even      defaecated.

As     I was        pulling            legs          and     moving           the      boai.es             up       so    they         could

bottom         of     the     pile          of       bodies           grabbing           my       trousers                -    somebody

was      still        alive.            The          pulling           on     my     trouser               leg       stopped.

Ch.      Supt.        Neshit           was       by       the        gate     on     the      pitch             organising

officers            to     pull        bodies             away,         I    could       hear          Supt.             Greenwood

he     was     pulling            them       away.               A     large?        black man                 suddenly              came

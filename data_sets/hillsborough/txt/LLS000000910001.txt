 D.O.B.          telephone number                 will say as
 follows:-


 On the 15th April 1989 I went to Sheffield to see the F.A

 Cup semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham

Forrest.     The match was due to start at 3.00 pm at

Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield.            I arrived in

Sheffield at 2.15.        I was in a car with                of

                                         of
and                  of



We parked the car about 1^ miles away from the ground.             It

was a fifteen minute walk away.   We went straight to the
        >
ground and arrived there at the Leppings Lane end.   There

was complete mayhem when we arrived.           There was a small

area outside the turnstiles and there appeared to be a

system of three or four small gates in the yard outside

all moving the crowd.       I got into the crowd and attempted

to move towards the turnstiles.           We never actually made it

and in the process              was split up from us.



Things got very tight indeed and we became trapped and

and I and some others fell over.           I was very frightened.       I

considered myself to be in a position of danger.



Suddenly I noticed that the crush eased off. . Someone pointed

out that some gates to the right of the turnstiles were opened

It was about 2.50 to 2.55 pm.          The crowds began to move off
 and into the ground through the gate.             There was no stampede

 There was no crush outside and we just walked in.               We met    '

 up with |
         ______ on the other side.          I can remember a Policeman

 telling us all to walk and emphasising that we had plenty

 of time.      Nobody was running and we made our way towards

 the     tunnel which was opposite the gate and whi’ch ran under

 the stand in the terraced area.            There were no directions

given whatsoever.       There were no stewards or policeman

giving directions as to where we should go.



We paused just outside the tunnel.             I     [stopped to tie his

shoe lace.     We then got in the tunnel and were still walking.

Half way down the tunnel we found that suddenly could not move.

People were coming in from behind and I was locked in.                We

moved en masse down the tunnel into the terrace pen slightly to
the right of the tunnel.       There was a huge crush of people

         and I were carried along by it and down the terracing

towards the small gate to the right of the goal on the football

pitch.      Progress was slow.         I could not move about.     My feet

were off the floor as I was moved down.            Within a minute of the

game starting I got out of the gate and onto the pitch on the

perimeter path.



I think about 20 or 30 people got out of the gate that way from

what I saw.     Once out through the gate I was directed by a

Policeman onto some tarraces at the side.            I.can remember

telling the Policeman to do something about 'the problem.             I

told the Policeman that someone would die inthere.               He just

ignored it or at least he gave no reply and directed us by a


                           _   2   -
hand signal to go up to the other terraces.             I do not know the

Constables name or even his number.              There was plenty of space

in the side terrace where we went and we could see the situation

developing in the pen where we had been.             The gate that we fcad

got out of was shut and a policeman was gesturing the crowd

behind to get back.       They could not.



        and I then saw absolute carnage.            People were being pushed

over the fences and the gate was re-opened.             We saw a number

of people in distress and dying.            I found it difficult to believe

what I saw.      People's heads were covered.          Bodies were pulled out

without trousers and I could see that many had emptied their bowels

in shock.      it was horrible.       We stood there in shock for

something like thirty minutes.
         1




I did not turn away when this was happening.             The people that

this was happening to were only about eighteen yards or so away.

I could not look away.        I could not look away.        I felt a part of

it.     I think that I felt that I should have done something.              I

could have got onto the pitch if I had to and indeed I

eventually found           who had been separated from us on the

pitch in a distressed state.



We left the ground and came home at 4.30.             It took some time

for I        I to get himself together.         The Club actually requested

over the tannoy to stay put so as not to restrict the ambulance

services.



My job is a I         '    [with |        |in            My take home pay



                              -   3   -
is about £250.00 per week and I live at home with my mother.

                                                                   /*



I have been away from work since 17th April.        I am hoping to'

go back to work on 10th May.



I am extremely distressed over what happened and feel very

mixed up.



My GP Dr               of                        las diagnosed

anxiety state.        He has not given me any medication but

simply recommended that I take two weeks off work.        During

the first week I felt very strange.       I was vomiting and had

diarrhoea constantly.

I would like a copy of this statement to be supplied to the

Public Enquiry.

NAME:       Qualified Ambulanceman

VEHICLE:    R601

SHIFT:      0900 - 1630 hours Day Duty (15 April 1989)


DATE AND TIME OF nmSRYIEIt:      18th April 1989, 1240 -        1430 hours




On Saturday 15 April 1989 I was working on ambulance call sign R601 along
with Ambulancewoman                      working day duty 0900 - 1630 hours.            At
approximately 1515 hours we were returning from Doncaster and were close to
Maltby Station when control          contacted us by radio      and told usto proceed
immediately to Hillsborough           Football Ground,    Sheffield, where there        had
been an incident with a lot of casualties.


We arrived at the ground at approximately 1535 hours, after coming down
Herries Road we were not able to turn right, we had to turn left because of
extremely heavy crowd congestion.          We entered the Ground by the entrance
off Penistone Road and travelled to a point near the 'Ozzie Owl Club' and
adjacent to the South Stand.          Ambulancewoman            H was driving and she
was able to turn the vehicle         partially round whilst parking.


I left the vehicle and came          across a man who wasclutching his chest            and
having     difficulty   breathing.      I was   able     to   walk   the   man   into   the
ambulance.     I sat him down and gave him Oxygen.


We both then saw a policeman close to the ambulance doing cardiac massage
to a casualty on the floor.           He asked me to get a suction unit, I did
immediately and I aspirated the man's airway with the Laerdal unit.




                                                                                 /continued

    A stretcher from the ambulance was brought to us and with the help of
    several bystanders we placed the casualty on the stretcher and into the
    ambulance.     Whilst we were dealing with this casualty the other patient
    which I had placed on the vehicle earlier had got off the ambulance and
    disappeared.


    At that stage we left the Ground with one stretcher patient who had a
    feeble pulse and was breathing faintly.          The Police Officer travelled with
    us and assisted me with the patient.           We travelled to the Northern General
    Hospital with a police motor cycle escort.


    On arrival at the hospital we took the patient on our stretcher inside and
    were met by a female doctor who examined the patient on our stretcher and
    told us that there was nothing else that we could do and that the man was
    dead.    The    doctor   directed    us   to   the   Plaster   Room   in   the   Casualty
    department which was being used as a temporary mortuary.                   We placed the
    body in this room where there already were approximately five other bodies.


    We placed the stretcher back in the ambulance and all three of us, myself,
    ambulancewoman             and the policeman returned to the Football Ground.
    We were able to turn right at the bottom of Herries Road and joined a queue
    of ambulances on Penistone Road.          The policeman whose first name was
    thanked us, shook hands with us and left our ambulance.


    We were stood by on Penistone Road for approximately 10 minutes and were
    then instructed by an ambulance officer, I think it was Mr Jones, to go to
    Herries Road Bus Depot and stand-by there with other ambulances.                 We stood
    by there for quite some time until the West Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and
    Derbyshire Ambulances were returned to their own areas.               We were directed
    to go the the Gymnasium car park back at the Football Ground where we were
    briefed by Mr Jones on what was to happen next.



                                                                                  /continued

We remained at this location until 0200 hours Sunday morning, during this
time we conveyed three bodies back from the Northern General Hospital to
the Gymnasium Mortuary at the Ground, and made approximately six journeys
with bodies     from the   gymnasium to   the Medico Legal Centre.       We   also
collected the body of a ten year old boy from Northern General Hospital to
the Gymnasium Mortuary.


We   eventually   completed our   duty finishing   and   signing   off at Maltby
Station 0300 hours on Sunday morning.

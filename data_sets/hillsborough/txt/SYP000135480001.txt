 ADDRESS                                                          Chester



 I am the mother of Jonathan Owens, who lost his life on the Leppings Lane

 terraces at the F.A. Cup semi-final at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April

 1989.



 I make this statement in connection with the evidence given to the Resumed

 Inquests by Michael Robertson that Jonathan went to the F.A. semi-final with a

 West Stand seating ticket, intending to swop it with friends for a Leppings

 Lane standing ticket.

 Michael Robertson went on to give evidence that Jonathan was unsuccessful as

 his friends did not arrive and he went onto the terraces with a stand ticket.



 In April 1989, shortly after the disaster, my husband John and I were shown a

 fully intact Leppings Lane standing ticket which was found among Jonathan's

 effects by an Officer of the West Midlands Police Force.



 The fully intact Leppings Lane standing ticket (No. 150489/LL3/48/23) was

 eventually handed over to me, I recall, during the course of a visit to my

 home in late March/early April 1990, by two female West Midlands Officers, one

 of whom was P.C. Parkes.

 During the course of this visit it was again explained that this ticket was in

 Jonathan's possession at the time of his death.

    I retired as a Police Inspector from South Yorkshire Police Force on the

    10th of December 1989, having served 27% years.

    I came to Sheffield as a Police Inspector in February 1982, and first

    worked at Hillsborough Football ground in that season, up until the

    1984-85 season.             I worked outside of the ground, generally in close

    proximity to the ground but at various locations.

    At the start of the 1984-85 season, I generally was posted to the West

    Side of the ground.                   I worked on this position for most matches,

    circumstances permitting, ie, if it was a low category fixture and                                                    I was

    not on duty, then I would not work the match.

    At normal league matches with a 3 pm kick-off, myself and the Serials

    which came under my command, would take up position at the West Side at

    between 1 pm - 1.30 pm.                    The Serials under my command would normally

    consist of 4 Serials, upto kick-off, and a further                                          2-4Serials from

    outside after kick-off, depending on the fixture.

    The duties of my Serials were to search for offensive weapons, to make

    sure the supporters had paid to come in, to check for drunkenness and to

    distribute the supporters onto the terraces and into the West Stand.

    With regards to distributing the supporters, my normal way, depending on

    the anticipated numbers, would be to fill the centre two enclosures first

and if necessary the enclosures nearer to the South Stand next.

I would do this by placing barriers across the building line of the West

Stand at its ends giving access to Pens 1 and 2 and at the other end

leading to Pens 6 and 7.               These barriers would be manned by a Police

Officer who would direct supporters to whichever direction they were

supposed to go.            At the same time, I would have Police Officers on the

gates at the rear of the enclosures on the radial fences, they would have

these gates closed and bolted but not locked and they were there for

evacuation purposes.

When the central enclosures were full, I would close the blue gates

leading from the concourse onto the tunnel, to show the incoming fans that

the central enclosures were full.                  These gates would be manned by a Police

Officer, who would then re-direct the incoming fans.                             These gates could

not be kept closed for more than a few minutes, and in any case whilst

they were closed they were always manned by a Police Officer.

Prior to the semi-final on the 15th of April 1989, I had worked two

previous semi-finals, the Leeds Utd V Coventry City semi-final in 1987,

where I was posted outside the ground, but I cannot remember where, and

the Liverpool V Nottingham Forest semi-final in 1988 when I was posted

again outside the ground in Penistone Road at Neeps End.                            In neither year

did I enter the ground or the West Side of the ground.

On the 15th of April 1989, I worked the semi-final at Hillsborough between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, I was posted to the West Side of the

ground with two Serials.

I took up post at about 10.45 am.                  At about 11.25 am, for the first time I

briefed Stewards as to their duties.                   At about twelve noon, the turnstiles

were opened and I saw that the Serials under my command were in position.

On this occasion, there was no filling of the pens as I have previously

described because firstly it was an all ticket match, and secondly at a

league match in April 1988, Superintendent MURRAY had observed me filling

the pens as I have described, and he told me that I was not to do it in

this way and that the gates of the rear of the terraces in the radial

fences were to remain open bolted against the wall and that the fans would

find their own level on                 the terraces.

Once supporters started                 to enter the ground, I monitored them asthey

entered by walking along the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, and

10-16.      I would also have gone around the side of the West Stand and I

climbed onto the steps of ±he Police Control box to get an elevated view

of the West terraces as they began to fill.                               The central enclosures were

filling quicker than the outer enclosures, this was quite normal and I

could see no problems.

Throughout the afternoon, I continued to do a circuit of checking the

turnstile areas, the terraces, and also the refreshment bars, because at

the semi-final the previous year, there had been a cash snatch from one of

the refreshment bars.

During the course of one of my circuits, I saw a young Policeman having

difficulty with a drunk, and as a result I assisted the Officer to take

him to the Police Room.

At 2.45 pm, I left the Police Room, I know this because I remember

checking my watch.

There was some radio traffic at this time, concerning incidents outside

the Leppings Lane turnstiles, so I returned to the concourse area behind

turnstiles 10-16 via a route under the North Stand.

Continuation of statement of   Harry WHITE



Upon my arrival, the situation was as I described it in my previous

statement.         It would have taken me a matter of minutes to come from the

Police Room to behind these turnstiles.                     Whilst at this location, people

were coming to me complaining about the situation outside the turnstiles

and as a result, I attempted to convey a message to the Police Control

outlining the difficulties, I was still in the concourse behind the

turnstiles 10-16.              I got no response from Control.              I then became aware of

a determined movement of people from the A-G turnstile area towards the

South side of the West terrace.                 As a result, I entered the concourse area

behind the turnstiles A-G, because it appeared abnormal to me.                                   Having

entered this area, I saw that Gate ’C ’ was open and the situation was as I

have described in my previous statement.

I have been asked about the deployment of Police Officers to the tunnel

area and the gates at the rear of the radial fences on the terraces.                                        The

situation was such that although Police Officers had been identified to
                                                                            J
take up these posts they never did because circumstances did not allow it.

I have also been asked about the gate in the dividing wall between the two

concourses, to the best of my recollection, there was no Police Officer

allocated duty to this area but it was quite possible that a Steward was

present.       However, his duty was to assist and direct the crowd and not to

prevent movement.

As for the direction for the opening of Gate ’C ’, I did not give an order

for it to be opened and I did not hear an order given for it to be opened,

I just saw it open.

All my recollections from then are as per my previous statement.

          X   K 0B E S T 1 T L LL IA S COBB   of                                           Sheffield,
                      will say as follows



         T was born on the                                    and am now retired          I have "been
          involved with Sheffield; Wednesday Football Club for over twenty years.                      I

         hav^ always worked as a- gateman.               I worked on 0 Gate      forj   a short while

         then was transferred to A Gate where I have worked for th!
                                                                  e last twenty-

         two, years.         "A" gate is also manned by Jack Stone,                               anH

         another nan whom I know as                    | i assumed charge on A date because of

         my long service with the club/               We are also responsible for mmm-T-ng the

         perimeter gate which provides access between the West StaJd compound and

         access passage to the North Stand.                                         !



         Oar^role is to ensure that these gates are manned at all tjimes.                    We must

         only allow access to police and Cltib officials and we are responsible for

        the. opening of A Gate before the end of a game.               We are also responsible

        for-opening the gate in .the event of an emergency.                   We have developed a

        practice whereby all four gatemaa are in position at the kick-off.                      Jack

        Stohe and I man A Gate                 itself and                     and           xoan the
        perimeter gate.          Once the game starts we operate a rota system whereby

        the'two on the perimeter gate go to watch the game and, after a period of

        time, they, return to their positions and Jack Stone and I                      to watch the

        match* Shortly before half-time we are all back in position behind our

        before the final whistle A gates are opened fully to enable supporters to

wish to be let through it.                             The purpose of the perimetjer fence is to

segregate; supporters in the North and West Stands.                                                   J

An! annual meeting is held before tbe start of each seasoni                                               There are two

sessions * one for the stewards and one for the turnstile men and gatemen.

representatives from the police and fire brigade.                                            Someone from the club

also spealts to us.                      Dong Lock is always present at tbe meetings so that

any problems can be addressed to him.                               The meetings operate very much on

a two—way basis.                    If I notice that anything needs doing I simply report

it; to Doug Lock and he sees that the problem is rectified immediately.                                                 A

 Dig-match.        Generally, :at a small game, tbe gate is shut and tbe police

.keep an eye on it to prevent supporters climbing over heirween the West

" and Horth Stands*



 A Gate .is. kept shut until the police tell us to open it-                  ijor    example3 if

 a person is arrested outside the ground ve will open the galte so that the

 police can bring him through to the police room.-                  If someone is arrested

 in the West- Stand compound the perimeter gate -will he openejd to allow, the

-P 9 ^ ce        take that person through to the police room, j We also have

 caterers coming through from time to time.                In the first instance anyone

■wishing to come through the gate will have to show their ID.                       Once in the

 ground the-caterers do not need to show their ID passes in order to get

 through the perimeter gate as they often have large trays to cany.



A Gates are a- double concertina type gate.               There is a smai; glass window

in the- Sat® through whxch we can see the area directly outside o£ the
gate.' "




Once] the game starts we; operate the rota system referred to earlier in

the" Statement.        At some stage during the game our money will be brought

arbtrnd to up.       I am given a packet containing all of our wages and I Tia-gH

these out.         Our pay tends          to be delivered when convenient and not

    necessarily at the end of the match.                                          At the end of the game somebody,

    usually Jack, will take the key hack to the office.                                                 The gate is left

    open- and I presume it is closed and locked sometime later,                                                   We are then

    free! to go home.

    fox in the crowd.                               The briefing was very similar to the briefing given

       supporters asithey arrived.



       I noticed that there were two stewards assigned to the barrier between,

       the turnstiles.                          One of :the stewards was                               [ one o       £   '     '

      to stop supporters who had tickets for the West Stand jnnrpipg over to the

      North Stand side.                          These two stewards were not part of my usual team.

      The ,police inside the turnstiles can see right through to the outside of

                ;ground.               Xt was therefore possible for them to search L n y supporters

      coming through who had Been missed by the police outside.                                                 I noticed that

      stationed inside A Gate, to assist us.                                           I did not recognise them.             At an

      police are usually available if they are needed.                                                          j

      Qtiisitly.             I remember that at 2.10 pm a police inspector came up to me

good-. Up to 2.10 pm we bad just been letting the police through the gate

.when!,necessary-                  About ten'minutes later I noticed that there was a crowd

o£ people waiting outside A Gate to set                           in through th^ turnstiles *

The crowd appeared to have arrived all at once*                       Ten minutes earlier they

simply were'not there.                         People were coming through the turnstiles and I

 could see through the window in A Gate that it was becoming very crowded

 outside. : A second police inspector came by at about this time.                          I said

 to hiia "if I were you I should clear this lot out because- they haven’t

 got-tickets".                    He told me that he did not have the manpoweij to do so,        I

knew; the-crowd did not have tickets because they were waiting outside and

waving £20 notes in front of my window hoping that I vouldj let them in.

Neither Ij nor any of the other gatemen opened the gate in order to adna-t

 any fans.



 The atmosphere outside the gate was becoming tense and the supporters

were!,                threatening to smash the gate in.           They were becoming verbally

 abusive.The crowd outside the gate was solid.                                      ]



 Ihiriag this time Liverpool fans were coming up to me at A Gate asking to

 be let out*                      They had come through the turnstile with j full tickets

We are instructed .that if someone has to leave the ground to use the

telephone dr if the police call him out to. his car the procedure is for

the j gat email to take his ticket and to let him out of tlxe ground. The

supporter -will retnru via A Gate and will be given back his ticket upon

his return.      This is the approved Club procedure.            j



Somejtimes supporters try to trick their way into tlie grotmc .      The system

is for a number of people to get in through the turnstiles.          One person

will; i-Tn*n collect their’ tickets and approach, the gateman to be allowed

out.       The gatemen is not allowed to search that supporter ifor tickets so

will not fcaovhov many tickets he is holding.        One ticket jis offered to

the jgateman tb be allowed out and the gateman will let him out.           Once

outside the supporter would distribute the tickets he is holding amongst

his friends and they, will gain entrance.      The supporter will then return

to the ground himself through the gate to request his ticket.              This

practice is popular with certain teams hut only really tends to happen at.

Semi-Finals.       As I have explained we were wise to these tricks and were

doing ,our. best to prevent it from happening.          In any event3 once the

crowd was building up outside we were not opening Gate A.



The tumstiles were becoming very busy.        The police attached -to. us would

be helping:to search supporters as they came through the iurnstiles.          I

recall one. specific incident.        I was facing out looking through the

window when, all of a sudden , some people started running towards the

    tBa gate from the inside. Two people made it over Che gate and I am not

    sure about the third, a girl.         Someone latex told me that she had managed

    to get over.        We did not see them in time to be able to stop them.          The

    Sate is .some, twelve to fourteen feet high.          I believe that these fans

    must have known the set-up and were attempting to pass tickets back to

    their friend? on the other side.



    Xt |»as at about this         time that I noticed people       climbing over      the.

    tnj.ustiles in order to get into the ground.         The police   veixe   occupied in

    dealing with these supporters.         It was at about this time jthat we could

    see C Gate being opened.         I then recall somebody saying that C Gate has

    been- opened. , We wexe just able to see it from where we W e               standing.

    The •policeman came ovek-        and told us to open A Gate.       back,     who' was.

    holding the    keys, refused to do so because of thecrowd outside pxessing

    on fhe gate.        Throughout the whole of this time we wexe |being offered

money to let fans in.           1 noticed chat the whole of the gatejwas beginning,

-to move from side to side.             It was swaying very noticeably.         I looked

    through the     glass windowand could see no tools, hammers        iox    bars being

used' by the       supportexs tobreak the gate down.       The whole ojf the gate was

moving because of the pressure being placed on it from ioutside.'                     It

appeared to        me    that the supporters wexe rocking the gate on purpose

trying to break it down.            A police sergeant then came -up tjo us and told -

us" that he new had official authority to open the gate.                bn tiiat basis

therefore told the police sergeant that there was no way that the gate

could be opened without;extra help.                   He went away and shortly thereafter

•he came back with about thirty policemen.                   He liad been in charge of the

ikey^ to the gate as soon as Jade had given them to him. j He lined up

about half of the policemen along by the vail and the other half forming

.a row away from the turnstile number 1.                   Then the policeiaan stood at the

end of the line facing the gate.                   I stood behind a coloured policeman out

of the way;by the wall as 1 had a very good idea of what was. about •to

happen.            Jack      and the others stood on the other side but also out of the

way.' The policeman gave the order to open the gate.                     The police had the

key land they o p e n e d it. There was then a massive influx of fans in.

stewards at the stairs to the aisles leading to the North Stand who would

refuse them entry because they did not have the correct tickets-,- or more

likely, had no tickets at all,



^Pkare was a great deal of noise at this time and there was a lot going on

around me.                  I recall that there were people trying to climb j.over the wall

 from! Vere Road and. from behind a shop on Leppings lane-                   I jlost count of

     I must say that the conduct of the fans was very bad, both before and

     after Gate A was opened,- I noticed that many of them had tjeec drinking.

     The crowd in general were very       difficult to control.                 They wereignoring

     all commands given to them    by the police.                I recall that at one       stage,

     I did not consider that :the police decision to open A Gatje was a good

     not have tickets.     I considered that it would be more sensible for the

         the; pressure.   However, tlie police took over from •us and jthe matter was

         out of onr hands.    Jack did not want to hand the keys over but when the

         order came from the inspector there was not a lot he could do.                      We were

         instructed; by the cluh that if there is any trouble or if jwe are in any

        difficulty we must always rely on the police to assist ujs.                        If we are

        with a serious situation then it is appropriate                  to wait          for higher

        authorisation: and, in those circumstances, we do not just jblindly follow

        :the;orders, of a police constable.         We wait until he has rjeceived higher

        authority.    Once the police officer came back with the important and

        higher authority there was nothing we could do.              The police simply took

        oyer.the situation.



        .1 have never seen anything like this              at   a Semi-Final jin the past.

        'Normally at a; Semi—Final the supporters are in by 2,50 pm ajnd no problems

        are experienced.     In my opinion the supporters arrived late and did not

Stadium , S h e f f i e l d in Jan u a ry 1989 and I a l s o a tte n d e d th e F.A . Cup s e m i - f in a l
game t h e r e on th e 15th A p ril 1989.


 P r i o r to my v i s i t to th e H ills b o ro u g h Stadium in Jan u ary 1989 I had n o t been

t h e r e b efo re.

 In Ja n u a ry I t r a v e l l e d to th e ground by c a r w ith two o f my f r i e n d s , we a r r iv e d
 in Sheffield w ith tim e to p ark th e c a r and walk to th e ground to a r r i v e a t
 a b o u t 2 .4 5 p.m.

 We had t i c k e t s f o r th e Leppings Lane t e r r a c e s and a lth o u g h we d id n o t know th e
 l a y o u t o f th e ground we c o u ld see th e shape o f th e Stadium as we approached i t
 and we knew t h a t we wanted to ta k e up p o s i t i o n s b ehind th e g o a l on th e te r r a c e d
 a r e a which we knew many L iv erp o o l fan e had t i c k e t s f o r and i t was obvious
  t h a t th e Leppings Lane t u r n s t i l e s were im m ediately behind th e t e r r a c e s towards
  which we where making our way.


  We a r r i v e d a t th e t u r n s t i l e s and g o t through them w ith o u t any d i f f i c u l t y , on
  emerging on th e in n e r s id e o f th e t u r n s t i l e s we found o u rs e lv e s in an e n c lo se d
  •rea.

  We cou ld see a tu n n e l d i r e c t l y in f r o n t o f th e t u r n s t i l e s and s l i g h t l y to ou r
  r i g h t and because o f th e shape o f th e Stadium we b e lie v e d t h a t t h a t tu n n e l
  would g iv e a c c e ss to th e t e r r a c e d a re a im m ediately behind th e goal and i t was
  our i n t e n t i o n to go thro u g h th e tu n n e l to see where t h i s would b rin g us o u t.
We approached th e mouth o f th e tu n n e l which we could eee was 'g u a rd e d ' by two
p o lic e o f f ic e r s .   As we g o t c l o s e r to th e mouth o f th e tu n n e l we c o u ld see
t h a t t h e r e w ere.tw o m etal g a t e s , one was c lo s e d f u l l y a c r o s s h a l f o f th e mouth
o f t h e t u n n e l , th e o th e r g a te was abo ut h a l f c lo s e d and th e two p o l i c e o f f i c e r s
where s ta n d in g d i r e c t l y in f r o n t o f th e p a r t l y c lo s e d g a te .


As we approached them one o f th e o f f i c e r s waved h i s arms and s a i d to th e th r e e
o f us words t o th e e f f e c t ' t h i s a re a i s f u l l , you w i l l have to go t o th e sides*
a s he s a i d t h i s he used h i s arms to d i c t a t e t h a t we c o u ld go to e i t h e r s id e
and we e l e c t e d t o go our r i g h t .


There were no s i g n s d i r e c t i n g us to th e s id e t e r r a c e s b u t we fo llo w e d th e w all
o f th e Stadium on our l e f t a s f a r as we c o u ld and we emerged around a c o rn e r
o n to a s te p p e d t e r r a c e d a r e a a t a c o rn e r o f th e p i t c h .


 I r e c a l l s e e in g a b lu e c o lo u re d o b s e r v a tio n box o r s u c h lik e to o u r r i g h t aa
 we e n te r e d t h i s a r e a (pens 1 and 2) and a lth o u g h th e pen was f a i r l y f u l l a t
               end we made o ur way to ou r l e f t h e ad in g toward what I l a t e r d is c o v e re d
 t o be Y f tte e l fe n c e d iv id in g o ur pen f r o m 'o th e r one t h a t was n e a r e r th e g o a l.

 t h a t ;fche pen on th e o th e r s id e o f th e fe n c e i s pen 3.


 We s to o d a b o u t h a l f way down th e t e r r a c e a b o u t 10 y a rd s from th e fe n c e on
 o u r l e f t and we had a good view o f th e match.


 We l e f t t h i s match when i t f i n i s h e d s h o r t l y b e fo re 5 p.m. by th e same r o u te
 t h a t we had fo llo w e d on ou r a r r i v a l and l e f t th e stadium w ith o u t i n c i d e n t .


 Whan th e o f f i c e r s a t th e mouth o f th e tu n n e l t o l d us t h a t th e a r e a a t th e end
 o f t h e tu n n e l was f u l l we d id n o t q u e s tio n t h a t , we sim ply a c c e p te d t h a t we
  c o u ld n o t go th rough th e tu n n e l and fo llo w ed th e a d v ic e to go to one o f th e
I a tte n d e d th e s e m i - f i n a l on th e i s t h A p ril 1989 w ith th e same two f r i e n d s .


We g o t t o Hillsborough much earier on                       t h i B   occasion we arrived at th e turnstiles

a t a b o u t 2 .1 0 p.m .

There was no l a r g e crowd, we d id n o t have to quenue to g e t in and we p a sse d
th ro u g h th e t u r n s t i l e s w ith o u t any d i f f i c u l t y .


P r i o r g o in g th ro u g h them we were search ed by a p o lic e c o n s ta b le who found t h a t
one o f vis ( I t h i n k i t was me) had a can o f coke.                           He t o l d us t h a t we would
'have t d d r in k t h a t b e fo re we g o t i n t o th e ground and th e t h r e e o f us s h a re d
th e d r in k b e fo re g o in g through th e t u r n s t i l e s .


The p o l i c e o f f i c e r who spoke to us and sea rc h e d us was very f r i e n d l y , th e
atm osphere o u t s i d e th e t u r n s t i l e s a t 2 .1 0 p.m. was r e la x e d and th e r e wee no
l a r g e crowd.


Having g o t th ro u g h th e t u r n s t i l e s three o f us were s e a rc h e d a g a in by • p o lic e
s e r g e n t . I n my view t h e r e was no need f o r                  t h i B   to have been done, we had

been s e a rc h e d o u t s i d e th e t u r n s t i l e s .


 When we had a l l been s e a rc h e d we made outTway t o g e th e r tow ards th e mouth o f
 th e tu n n e l which t h i s time was n o t 'guarded* by e i t h e r policem an o r ite w a r d s .
 We knew t h a t th e tu n n e l gave a c c e s s to th e pen (we d id n o t th e n know t h a t
 t h e r e were two p en s) a t th e back o f th e g o a l and t h i s i s where we wanted to
 be w atch t h i s m atch,

 When we emerged from th e mouth o f th e tu n n e l we saw t h a t i t gave a c c e s s to
 two pens and we went to o ur r i g h t i n t o what                           now know i s pen 3_.


 There were l a r g e number o f people in t h a t a re a a l r e a d y , X r e c a l l sa y in g to my
 p a l s t h a t 1 d id n o t th in k i t would be very long b e fo re th e y c lo s e d th e g a te s
 ( a t th e mouth o f th e tu n n e l) because th e r e were a lre a d y a l a r g e number o f people
 i n th e pen.
We made o u r way to a p o s i t i o n about a q u a r te r o f th e way down th e t e r r a c e and
a c r o s s to th e r i g h t , p ro b a b ly about h a l f way between th e s t e a l fe n c e s which
form th e s i d e s o f pen 3.         Although th e re were a t t h a t tim e a la r g e number o f
p e o p le i n th e pen i t was n o t uncom fortably f u l l b u t as tim e went on and more
and more p eo p le came i n t o th e pen we were slo w ly pushed to o u r r i g h t tow ards
th e s t e e l a lth o u g h we managed to m a in ta in our p o s i t i o n abo ut a q u a r t e r o f th e
way down th e t e r r a c e .


By a b o u t 2 .4 0 o r 2 .4 5 p.m. th e p re s s u re was b e g in n in g to b u i l d and I saw people
b e h in d and to th e r i g h t o f me clim b in g up i n t o th e balco n y above us to escape
t h e p r e s s u r e and ab o u t 3 .10 p.m. th e p r e s s u r e around me had become so in te n s e
t h a t i t became a lm o st im p o ssib le to move and I was v e ry h o t so I managed to
clim b up t h f fe n c e d iv id in g pen 3 from pens 1 and 2 and I was l i f t e d i n t o
      balco ny above by one o f th e p a ls I had t r a v e l l e d t o th e game w ith and some
o t h e r p e o p le . . . my mate had a lre a d y clim bed up t h e r e b e fo re me and about
10 m in utes l a t e r we d is c o v e ry th e t h i r d member o f o u r p a r t y who had a ls o
clim bed up.

Looking down from th e s ta n d a re a to th e f r o n t o f pens 3 and 4 we could see
t h a t t h e r e were p e o p le in ju r e d and d ie d , by t h a t tim e t h e r e were bo d ies ly in g
<in th e p i t c h and we d e cid ed t h a t we sh ould le a v ed th e Stadium . . . we l e f t a t
a b o u t 3.45 p.m.'    I r e c a l l h e a r in g an annoucement o v e r th e tannoy from Kenny
D a l g l i s s h j u s t a s we were le a v in g th e ground a lth o u g h I can not now r e c a l l
e x a c t l y what he was s a y in g .


We made our way t o o u r c a r and drove home.


 I c a n n o t u n d e rs ta n d why t h e r e sh ould be a d i f f e r e n c e in th e p o l i c i n g o f th e
mouth Of th e tu n n e l f o r th e January 1989 League                    gam e   and th e A p ril s e m i - f i n a l .


 I f by 2 .4 5 p.m. a t th e January game th e p o l i c e were aware t h a t pens 3 and 4
 were f u l l and were d i r e c t i n g fa n s to th e s id e pens why d id th ey n o t have th e
 same r e a l i s a t i o n a t th e same tim e o r soo ner on th e 15 th A p ril and adopt a
 s i m i l a r p o s i t i o n and is s u e th e same i n s t r u c t i o n to fa n s . . . th e s e m i - f in a l
 game was f a r more im p o rta n t to many fa n s and th e p o l i c e shou ld have r e a l i z e d
 t h i s and a n t i c i p a t e d t h a t more people would be a t t e n d i n g th e game and i t i s a
 n a t u r a l r e a c t i o n to want to s ta n d behind th e g o a l.

                   Cross-examined by MR. GIBSQN-WATT:

 Q. One matter, Mr. Marshall, the question of delaying the
    kick-off.  Is it right that you did not afc any stage
    request hr- Duckenfield or suggest to him- the possibility
    of delaying the kick-off?   A.   That's right.

 Q. Any particular reason for that?, A.    It did not oceur ,
    to me to make that, request.  It never entered my mind
    to make that request.

 Q. Just this:  were you aware of whether Mr. Duckenfield
    had adopted any criteria for circumstances in which he
    would not delay the kick-off, even if there was still a
    crowd outside?   A.   My perception was thst the event
    would go ahead at 3 p.m.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Whatever?   A. Well, not
      whatever.    Clearly there must be circumstances which get
      in the way and I have heard Mr. Duckenfield describe
      in his evidence -the things which ho considered he might
      delay the kick-off and those are the sort of circumstances
      which I would have expected him to consider, i.e. bad
      accident on the motorway, unreasonable delay in transport
      arrangements, that sort of thing, fog on the Pennines,
      those sort of factors.

Q.,         NR- C18S0N-WATT:    I just want to get this clear;
      I think you have answered it-      The situation wss that you
      had a lot to do and it simply did not occur to you to
      request delaying the kick-off, rather than you thinking
      that that would not be any good with the crowd that you
      had at, say, 2.40?     A.   Well, I did not seek for the
      kick-off to be delayed-     1 did not consider thst as an
      option and in hindsight I do not think it would have
      made the slightest difference to the situation at Leppings
      Lane.    I do not want to go over the evidence which I
      gave yesterday but I just felt that people had this
      unreasonable urge to enter the ground and, irrespective
      of whether the kick-off had been delayed or not, . t h e y
      would have gone in.

Q. That is the point I wanted to give you a chance to deal
   with.   Even with hindsight, you do not think that delaying
   the kick-off would have done any good?   A.   No, I do
   not.   The crowd were not responsive to our tannoy appeals
   and were not co-operating with us.

Q.         LORO JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Just on that point, your
      understanding was they were determined to get in beeeuse
      they wanted to be in when the match started presumably?
      A.   Yes.

p. WeLlJU might it have had some effect, do you think, to tell
  " them," “ It is not going to start for another 20 minutes,
    calm yourselves.”?     A.   1 eannot-froneetly--sayjthcjther

              I am the mother of Jonathan OWENS, who lost his life on the Leppings

              Lane terraces at the F.A. Cup semi-final at Hillsborough Stadium on

              15th April 1989 (150489).



              I make this statement in connection with the evidence given to the

              Resumed Inquests by Michael ROBERTSON that Jonathan went to the F.A.

              semi-final with a West Stand seating ticket, intending to swop it with

              friends for a Leppings Lane standing ticket.



              Michael ROBERTSON went on to give evidence that Jonathan was

              unsuccessful as his friends did not arrive and he went onto the

              terraces with a stand ticket.
                                                                         PAGE    2

         In April 1989 (000489), shortly after the disaster, my husband John and

         I were shown a fully intact Leppings Lane standing ticket which was

         found among Jonathan's effects by an Officer of the West Midlands

         Police Force.



         The fully intact Leppings Lane standing ticket (No. 150489/LL3/48/23)

        was eventually handed over to me, I recall, during the course of a

        visit to my home in late March/early April 1990 (000390 - 000490), by

         two female West Midlands Officers, one of whom was PC PARKES.



         During the course of this visit it was again explained that this ticket

        was in Jonathan's possession at the time of his death.



        Dated:     13.3.91

         Signed: P.A.Owens



        This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I

        make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable

        to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know to

        be false or do not believe to be true.

           On 25th February 1991 (250291) I was requested by Dr.Popper, Coroner to

           the Hillsborough Inquest, to produce a composite plan showing the

           locations of some of the witnesses that had appeared at the Inquest.



           The witnesses    had been asked to mark their locations on a plan of

           either the ground or the Leppings Lane Terraces.     It is these locations

           that are illustrated on the plans as accurately as scale allows.



           Where two or more positions had been marked on the witness's plan then

           it is the second that is shown on the composite plan.

             I retired as a Police Inspector from South Yorkshire Police Force on

             the 10th of December 1989, (101289) having served 271/2 years.

             I came to Sheffield as a Police Inspector in February 1982, (000282)

             and first worked at Hillsborough Football ground in that season, up

             until the 1984-85 (000084-000085) season.        I worked outside of the

             ground, generally in close proximity to the ground but at various

             locations.

            At the start of the 1984-85 (000084-000085) season, I generally was

             posted to the West Side of the ground.       I worked in this position for

             most matches, circumstances permitting, ie, if it was a low category

             fixture and I was not on duty, then I would not work the match.

             At normal league matches with a 3 pn (1500) kick-off, myself and the

             Serials which came under my command, would take up position at the West
                                                                 PAGE     2
                                                                 S10

Side at between 1 pm - 1.30 pn (1300-1330).    The Serials under my

command would normally consist of 4 Serials, upto kick-off, and a

further 2-4 Serials from outside after kick-off, depending on the

fixture.

The duties of my Serials were to search for offensive weapons, to make

sure the supporters had paid to come in, to check for drunkenness and

to distribute the supporters onto the terraces and into the West Stand.

With regards to distributing the supporters, my normal way,

depending on the anticipated numbers, would be to fill the centre two

enclosures first and if necessary the enclosures nearer to the South

Stand next.

I would do this by placing barriers across the building

line of the West Stand at its ends giving access to Pens 1 and 2 and

at the other end leading to Pens 6 and 7.     These barriers would be

manned by a Police Officer who would direct supporters to whichever

direction they were supposed to go.   At the same time, I would have

Police Officers on the gates at the rear of the enclosures on the

radial fences, they would have these gates closed and bolted, but not

locked, and they were there for evacuation purposes.

When the central enclosures were full, I would close the blue gates

leading from the concourse into the tunnel, to show the incoming fans

that the central enclosures were full.   These gates would be manned by

a Police Officer, who would then re-direct the incoming fans.     These

gates could not be kept closed for more than a few minutes, and in any

case whilst they were closed they were always manned by a Police

Officer.

Prior to the semi-final on the 15th of April 1989, (150489) I had

worked two previous semi-finals, the Leeds Utd V Coventry City

semi-final in 1987, (000087) where I was posted outside the ground, but

I cannot remember where, and the Liverpool V Nottingham Forest
                                                                  PAGE   3
                                                                  S10

semi-final in 1988 (000088) when I was posted again outside the ground

in Penistone Road at Neeps End.   In neither year did I enter the

ground or the West Side of the ground.

On the 15th of April 1989, (150489) I worked the semi-final at

Hillsborough between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, I was posted to

the West Side of the ground with two Serials.

I took up post at about 10.45 am (1045).    At about 11.25 am, (1125) for

the first time I briefed Stewards as to their duties.   At about twelve

noon, (1200) the turnstiles were opened and I saw that the Serials

under my command were in position.

On this occasion, there was no filling of the pens as I have previously

described because firstly it was an all ticket match, and secondly at a

league match in April 1988, (000488) Superintendent MURRAY had

observed me filling the pens as I have described, and he told me that

I was not to do it in this way and that the gates at the rear of the

terraces in the radial fences were to remain open bolted against the

wall and that the fans would find their own level on the terraces.

Once supporters started to enter the ground, I monitored them as they

entered by walking along the concourse area behind turnstiles A-G, and

10-16.   I would also have gone around the side of the West Stand and I

climbed onto the steps of the Police Control box to get an elevated

view of the West terraces as they began to fill.    The central

enclosures were filling quicker than the outer enclosures, this was

quite normal and I could see no problems.

Throughout the afternoon, I continued to do a circuit of checking the

turnstile areas, the terraces, and also the refreshment bars, because

at the semi-final the previous year, there had been a cash snatch frcm

one of the refreshment bars.

During the course of one of my circuits, I saw a young Policeman having

difficulty with a drunk, and as a result I assisted the Officer to take
                                                                PAGE    4
                                                                S10

him to the Police Rocm.

At 2.45 pn, (1445) I left the Police Rocm, I know this because I

remember checking my watch.

There was some radio traffic at this time, concerning incidents outside

the Leppings Lane turnstiles, so I returned to the concourse area

behind turnstiles 10-16 via a route under the North Stand.

Upon my arrival, the situation was as I described it in my previous

statement.   It would have taken me a matter of minutes to ccme from the

Police Room to behind these turnstiles.   Whilst at this location,

people were coming to me complaining about the situation outside the

turnstiles and as a result, I attempted to convey a message to the

Police Control outlining the difficulties, I was still in the concourse

behind the turnstiles 10-16.   I got no response from Control. I then

became aware of a determined movement of people frcm the A-G turnstile

area towards the South side of the West terrace.   As a result, I

entered the concourse area behind the turnstiles A-G, because it

appeared abnormal to me.   Having entered this area, I saw that Gate 'C'

was open and the situation was as I have described in my previous

statement.

I have been asked about the deployment of Police Officers to the tunnel

area and the gates at the rear of the radial fences on the terraces.

The situation was such that although Police Officers had been

identified to take up these posts they never did because circumstances

did not allow it.

I have also been asked about the gate in the dividing wall between the

two concourses, to the best of my recollection, there was no Police

Officer allocated duty to this area but it was quite possible that a

Steward was present.   However, his duty was to assist and direct the

crowd and not to prevent movement.

As for the direction for the opening of Gate ' C , I did not give an
                                                                       PAGE

        order for it to be opened and I did not hear an order given for it to

        be opened, I just saw it open.

        All my recollections from then are as per my previous statement.

           STATEMENT




           I ROBERT WILLIAM COBB of                                                    Sheffield,

                    rill say as follows

           I was born on the                                           and am now retired.

           have been involved with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for over

             twenty years.       I have always worked as a gateman.          I worked on 0 Gate

             for a short while then was transferred to A Gate where I have worked

             for the last twenty-two years.             "A" gate is also manned by Jack STONE,

                                and another man whom I know as                 I assumed charge on

             A Gate because of my long service with the club.               We are also

             responsible for manning the perimeter gate which provides access

             between the West Stand compound and access passage to the North Stand.
                                                                   PAGE       2
                                                                   S9

Our role is to ensure that these gates are manned at all times.      We

must only allow access to police and Club officials and we are

responsible for the opening of A Gate before the end of a game.       We are

also responsible for opening the gate in the event of an emergency.         We

have developed a practice whereby all four gatemen are in position at

the kick-off.    Jack STONE and I man A Gate itself and                land

      man the perimeter gate.    Once the game starts we operate a rota

system whereby the two on the perimeter gate go to watch the game and,

after a period of time, they return to their positions and Jack STONE

and I go to watch the match.     Shortly before half-time we are all back

in position behind our gates and the same process is repeated for the

second half.    Shortly before the final whistle A gates are opened fully

to enable supporters to leave.     The perimeter gate remains shut at all

times unless the police wish to be let through it.     The purpose of the

perimeter fence is to segregate supporters in the North and West

Stands.

An annual meeting is held before the start of each season.      There are

two sessions, one for the stewards and one for the turnstile men and

gatemen.    It is not compulsory to attend but the meetings are always

very well attended.    At the meetings a briefing is given by a number of

representatives from the police and fire brigade.     Someone from the

club also speaks to us.    Doug LOCK is always present at the meetings so

that any problems can be addressed to him.     The meetings operate very

much on a two-way basis.    If I notice that anything needs doing I

simply report it to Doug LOCK and he sees that the problem is rectified

immediately.    A briefing is given as to emergency procedures, and the

codes would be announced for an emergency over the public broadcast

system.    The fire bridage talk to us about the type of fire

extinguishers in use at the ground    and where they can be found.We are

also given direction on how to use such fire extinguishers.      If we hear
                                                                     PAGE        3
                                                                     S9

the coded message being broadcast over the tannoy we are to make our

way immediately to our positions and wait there for further

instructions.     We are to ensure that the gate is open.   In the event     of

an emergency the gate in the perimeter fence is also to be opened.

The fire brigade also talk to us very briefly about first aid.

The pre-season meeting is also a chance to sign on and obtain our ID

passes for the season.     For this purpose I take two passport size

photographs to the meeting and am issued with my ID pass and a booklet

of match receipts.     I am also given a leaflet relating to match day

instructions.

At a normal league game I will report to the ground at about 12.30 pm

(1230).     I report to the office underneath the North Stand and hand in

a signed receipt from my booklet to the chief steward, Ken CASTLEY.          I

am given a stewards’ vest at the beginning of the season and I bring

this with me.     I tend to keep my vest and take it home with me after

each match.     The chief steward checks off my name on a sheet.     He

checks off each steward and gateman as they arrive in order that he

knows which position has been manned.

I work permanently at A Gate with Jack STONE and the other two,

      ind         , who work on the perimeter gate.   The first person to

arrive collects the bunch of keys from the office.      He will then unlock

Gate A.     The keys are kept by us for the duration of the match and

returned to the office afterwards.     The perimeter gate is also

unlocked.     There is also on the same key ring a key to the small gate

between turnstile 8 and 9.     This gate is not always used in that it is

sometimes opened and a barrier put across the gap between the perimeter

fence and the turnstile.     In this way the club can decide which

turnstile will admit supporters to the North Stand and which into the

West Stand.     It allows the Club a certain amount of flexibility.       This

gate is not generally manned by stewards unless a very large gate is
                                                                    PAGE       4
                                                                    S9

expected at a big match.     Generally, at a small game, the gate is shut

and the police keep an eye on it to prevent supporters climbing over

between the West and North Stands.

A Gate is kept shut until the police tell us to open it.       For example,

if a person is arrested outside the ground we will open the gate so

that the police can bring him through to the police room.       If someone

is arrested in the West Stand compound the perimeter gate will be

opened to allow the police to take that person through to the police

room.   We also have caterers coming through from time to time.      In the

first instance anyone wishing to come through the gate will have to

show their ID.     Once in the ground the caterers do not need to show

their ID passes in order to get through the perimeter gate as they

often have large trays to carry.

A Gates are a double concertina type gate.     There is a small glass

window in the gate through which we can see the area directly outside

of the gate.

Once the game starts we operate a rota system referred to earlier in

the Statement.     At some stage during the game our money will be brought

around to us.     I am given a packet containing all of our wages and I

hand these out.     Our pay tends to be delivered when convenient and not

necessarily at the end of the match.     At the end of the game somebody,

usually Jack, will take the key back to the office.     The gate is left

open and I presume it is closed and locked sometime later.      We are then

free to go home.

I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on the 15th

April 1989 (150489) at Hillsborough.

I arrived at the ground at about 11.30 am (1130).                       |had

already arrived.     I reported to the office and went down to A Gate.

All the stewards were there and some of the gatemen (the others had to

stay on the gates).    A police inspector gave the briefing.     I do not
                                                                      PAGE     5
                                                                      S9

know his name.     He told us what to expect at the Semi-Final, and what

to watch out for in the crowd.     The briefing was very similar to the

briefing given before last year’s Semi-Final.       I do not recall him

mentioning specifically the different types of tickets which had been

issued.     However, when I went into the office to sign on I noticed that

a poster had been put up illustrating all the different types of

tickets issued for the game.     I noticed that there was a different

colour for each stand.

After the briefing I went down to A Gate.       The gate was closed but

unlocked.

I noticed that there were already police standing inside the

turnstiles.

At a normal game there are usually a couple of policemen standing

inside the turnstiles to search supporters as they come through.          On

this occasion there were about six policemen.       There were also

policemen outside the ground, some standing near the turnstiles and

some further back by the wrought iron gates.       They were also involved

in searching supporters as they arrived.

I noticed that there were two stewards assigned to the barrier between

the turnstiles.    One of the stewards was                one of

      but I do not know the other one.       They had been stationed there

in order to stop supporters who had tickets for the West Stand jumping

over to the North Stand side.    These two stewards were not part of my

usual team.

The police inside the turnstiles can see right through to the outside

of the ground.    It was therefore possible for them to search any

supporters coming through who had been missed by the police outside.           I

noticed that there were more Policemen outside than usual as well as

inside the ground.    However, at a big league game I would expect a

larger police presence and also at Semi-Final matches.       There were also
                                                                      PAGE        6
                                                                      S9

two policemen stationed inside A Gate to assist us.       I did not

recognise them.     At an ordinary league game we do not have police

assistance directly although police are usually available if they are

needed.

The turnstiles opened at about noon (1200) and everything proceeded

very quietly.     I remember that at 2.10 pm (14.10) a police inspector

came up to me with a policewoman andasked me      how I was getting on.         I

replied "it’s a normal league game".       By that I meant that everything

was very quiet and good.     Up to 2.10 pm (14.10) we had just been

letting the police through the gate when necessary.       About ten minutes

later I noticed that there was a crowd of people waiting outside A

Gate to get in through the turnstiles.     The crowd appeared to have

arrived all at once.     Ten minutes earlier they simply were not there.

People were coming through the turnstiles and I could see through the

window in A Gate that it was becoming very crowded outside.       A second

police inspector came by at about this time.       I said to him "if X were

you X should clear this lot out because they haven’t got tickets".           He

told me that he did not have the manpower to do so.        I knew the crowd

did not have tickets because they were waiting outside and waving #20

notes in front of my window hoping that I would let them in.          Neither

I, nor any of the other gatemen opened the gate in order to admit any

fans. The atmosphere outside the gate was becoming tense and the

supporters were threatening to smash      the gate in.   They were becoming

verbally abusive.     The crowd outside   the gate was solid.

During this time Liverpool fans were coming up to me at A Gate asking

to be let out.     They had come through the turnstiles with full tickets

because the turnstile operators did not have time to tear off the

counterfoil.

We are instructed that if someone has to leave the ground to use the

telephone or if the police call him out to his car the procedure is for
                                                                    PAGE         7

the gateman to take his ticket and to let him out of the ground.        The

supporter will return via A Gate and will be given back his ticket upon

his return.    This is the approved Club procedure.

Sometimes supporters try to trick their way into the      ground. The

system is for a number of people to get in through the turnstiles.          One

person will then collect their tickets and approach the gateman to be

allowed out.    The gateman is not allowed to search that supporter for

tickets so will not know how many tickets he is holding.       One ticket is

offered to the gateman to be allowed out and the gateman will let him

out.   Once outside the supporter would distribute the tickets he is

holding amongst his friends and they will gain entrance.       The supporter

will then return to the ground himself through the gate to request his

ticket.   This practice is popular with certain teams     but only really

tends to happen at Semi-Finals.     As I have explained   we were wise to

these tricks and were doing our best to prevent it from happening.          In

any event, once the crowd was building up outside we were not opening

Gate A-

The turnstiles were becoming very busy.     The police attached to us

would be helping to search supporters as they came through the

turnstiles.    I recall one specific incident.   I was facing out looking

through the window when, all of a sudden, some people started running

towards the gate.    Whilst we had our backs turned they had run up and

clambered over the gate from the inside.     Two people made it over the

gate and I am not sure about the third, a girl.       Someone later told me

that she had managed to get over.    We did not see them in time to be

able to stop them.    The gate is some twelve to fourteen feet

(12’-14’) high.     I believe that these fans must have known the set-up

and were attempting to pass tickets back to their friends on the other

side. It was at about this time that I noticed people climbing over

the turnstiles in order to get into the ground.     The police were
                                                                     PAGE         8
                                                                     S9

occupied in dealing with these supporters.     It was at about this time

that we could see C Gate being opened.     I then recall somebody saying

that C Gate has been opened.     We were just able to see it from where

we were standing.     The policemen came over and told us to open A Gate.

Jack, who was holding the keys, refused to do so because of the crowd

outside pressing on the gate.     Throughout the whole of this time we

were being offered money to let fans in.     I noticed that the whole of

the gate was beginning to move from side to side.     It was swaying very

noticeably.     I looked through the glass window and could see no tools,

hammers or bars being used by supporters to break the gate down.        The

whole of the gate was moving because of the pressure being placed on

it from outside.     It appeared to me that the supporters were rocking

the gate on purpose trying to break it down.     A police sergeant then

came up to us and told us that he now had official authority to open

the gate.     On that basis Jack handed the keys to him.   However, the

only assistance we had at that stage were the two police officers

assigned to us originally.     I therefore told the police sergeant that

there was no way that the gate could be opened without extra help.           He

went away and shortly thereafter he came back with about thirty

policemen.    He had been in charge of the keys to the gate as soon as

Jack had given them to him.     He lined up about half of the policemen

along by the wall and the other half forming a row away from the

turnstile number 1.     Then the policeman stood at the end of the line

facing the gate.     I stood behind a coloured policeman out of the way

by the wall as I had a very good idea of what was about to happen.

Jack and the others stood on the other side but also out of the way.

The policeman gave the order to open the gate.     The police had the key

and they opened it.     There was then a massive influx of fans in

through the gate.     However, there was nowhere for them to go.     There

were stewards at the stairs to the aisles leading to the North Stand
                                                                     PAGE     9
                                                                     S9


who would refuse them entry because they did not have the correct

tickets, or more likely, had no tickets at all.

There was a great deal of noise at this time and there was a lot going

on around me.    I recall that there were people trying to climb over the

wall from Vere Road and from behind a shop on Leppings Lane.     I lost

count of time because there was so much going on.     I do not recall

having heard the kick-off.

After the initial influx of people there was no-one left outside the

gate.   However, we left the gate open.    I knew that there was something

wrong when an ambulance arrived.     A policeman came by and said that the

match had been cancelled.    We therefore decided to leave the gate open.

Those who had run into the ground had to stay where they were because

they could not go up into the North Stand because they did not have

tickets.     People then began to drift out.   The police stopped them

leaving the ground for a while in order to leave the roads clear for

the emergency services.

I remember seeing an ambulance arrive and Jack went off to direct the

ambulance round to the pitch where it was needed.

I must say that the conduct of the fans was very bad, both before and

after Gate A was opened.     I noticed that many of them had been

drinking.     The crowd in general were very difficult to control.     They

were ignoring all commands given to them by the police.      I recall that

at one stage, although I cannot remember exactly when, a St John’s

Ambulance man wanted to get in through Gate A.      This must have been

 sometime before the kick-off.    I told him that I could not let him in

because of everybody else around the gate from the outside.      I

 therefore sent him around to the office.

 I did not consider that the police decision to open A Gate was a good

 decision.    I knew that many of the people waiting outside the gate did

 not have tickets.    I considered that it would be more sensible for the
                                                                      PAGE     10

police to move them back outside the wrought iron gate in order to ease

the pressure.   However, the police took over from us and the matter was

out of our hands.   Jack did not want to hand the keys over but when the

order came from the inspector there was not a lot he could do.         We were

instructed by the Club that if there is any trouble or if we are in any

difficulty we must always rely on the police to assist us.         If we are

given orders by the police we must try to oblige them.         If we are faced

with a serious situation then it is appropriate to wait for higher

authorisation and, in those circumstances, we do not just blindly

follow the orders of a police constable.         We wait until he has received

higher authority.   Once the police officer came back with the important

and higher authority there was nothing we could do.         The police simply

took over the situation.

I have never seen anything like this at a Semi-Final in the past.

Normally at a Semi-Final the supporters are in by 2.50 pm (1450) and no

problems are experienced.     In my opinion the supporters arrived late

and did not care how they got into the ground but were determined to do

so.   I did not think that the gate was going to break but I believe

that those outside were trying to break it down.

After the match I went up to the wrought iron gate to look at the fire

engines and ambulances.     Announcements were being made over the tannoy

but I was not able to hear what was being said.

I did not see B Gate being opened and could just catch a glimpse of C

Gate from where I was standing.     I   remained in the vicinity of A Gate

until about 3.40 pm (1540).    At this stage there seemed to be nothing

more for me to do and I went home.       I   did not wait to collect my pay.

I have been interviewed by and have provided a statement to the police.

This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

           I am 25 years of age and employed as a machine setter.



           I have been a regular attender at Liverpool F.C. heme and away games

           for approximately 10 years.

Prior to my visit to the Hillsborough Stadium in January 1989 (000189),

I had not been there before.



In January (000100), I travelled to the ground by car with two of my

friends, we arrived in Sheffield with time to park the car and walk to

the ground to arrive at about 2.45 pm (1445).



We had tickets for the Leppings Lane terraces and although we did not

know the layout of the ground we could see the shape of the Stadium as

we approached it, and we knew that we wanted to take up positions

behind the goal on the terraced area which we knew many Liverpool fans

had tickets for, and it was obvious that the Leppings Lane turnstiles

were immediately behind the terraces towards which we were making our

way.



We arrived at the turnstiles and got through them without any

difficulty, on emerging on the inner side of the turnstiles we found

ourselves in an enclosed area.



We could see a tunnel directly in front of the turnstiles and slightly

to our right and because of the shape of the Stadium we believed that

that tunnel would give access to the terraced area immediately behind

the goal and it was our intention to go through the tunnel to see where

this would bring us out.



We approached the mouth of the tunnel which we could see was 'guarded'

by two Police Officers,    As we got closer to the mouth of the tunnel we

could see that there were two metal gates, one was closed fully across

half of the mouth of the tunnel, the other gate was about half closed

and the two Police Officers were standing directly in front of the
                                                                 PAGE      3
                                                                 S8
 partly closed gate.



 As we approached them, one of the Officers waved his arms and said to

 the three of us words to the effect 'this area is full, you will have

 to go to the sides' as he said this he used his arms to dictate that we

could go to either side and we elected to go our right.



There were no signs directing us to the side terraces but we followed

the wall of the Stadium on our left as far as we could and we emerged

around a com e r onto a stepped terraced area at a co m er of the pitch.



I recall seeing a blue coloured observation box or suchlike to our

right as we entered this area (pens 1 and 2) and although the pen was

fairly full at the rear end we made our way to our left heading toward

what I later discovered to be a steel fence dividing our pen from other

one that was nearer the goal.



I now understand that the pen we were in is referred to as pen 1 and 2

and that the pen on the other side of the fence is pen 3.



We stood about half way down the terrace about 10 yards from the fence

on our left and we had a good view of the match.



We left this match when it finished shortly before 5 pm (1700), by the

same route that we had followed on our arrival and left the Stadium

without incident.



When the Officers at the mouth of the tunnel told us that the area at

the end of the tunnel was full we did not question that, we sirrply

accepted that we could not go through the tunnel and followed the
                                                                          PAGE    4
                                                                          S8
         advice to go to one of the side pens.



         I attended the semi-final on the 15th April 1989 (150489), with the

        same two friends.



        We got to Hillsborough much earlier on this occasion, we arrived at the

        turnstiles at about 2.10 pm (1410).



        There was no large crowd, we did not have to queue to get in and we

        passed through the turnstiles without any difficulty.



        Prior going through them we were searched by a Police Constable who

        found that one of us (I think it was me), had a can of coke.    He told

        us that we would have to drink that before we got into the ground and

        the three of us shared the drink before going through the turnstiles.



        The Police Officer who spoke to us and searched us was very friendly,

        the atmosphere outside the turnstiles at 2.10 pm (1410), was relaxed

        and there was no large crowd.


j
    ^   Having got through the turnstiles three of us were searched again by a
|

        Police Sergeant.    In my view there was no need for this to have been

        done, we had been searched outside the turnstiles.



        When we had all been searched we made our way together towards the

        mouth of the tunnel which this time was not 'guarded' by either

        Policemen or Stewards.   We knew that the tunnel gave access to the pen

        (We did not then know that there were two pens) at the back of the goal

        and this is where we wanted to be to watch this match.
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S8

           When we emerged from the mouth of the tunnel we saw that it gave access

           to two pens and we went to our right into what I now know is pen 3.



A   ^   s j There were large numbers of people in that area already, I recall

f a * I /^^aying to my pals that I did not think it would be very long before

^         they closed the gates (at the mouth of the tunnel) because there were

          already a large number of people in the pen.



          We made our way to a position about a quarter of the way down the

          terrace and across to the right, probably about half way between the

          steel fences Which form the sides of pen 3.    Although there were at

          that time a large number of people in the pen it was not uncomfortably

          full but as time went on and more and more people came into the pen we

          were slowly pushed to our right towards the steel although we managed

          to maintain our position about a quarter of the way down the terrace.



          By about 2.40 (1440) or 2,45 pn (1445), the pressure was beginning to

          build and I saw people behind and to the right of me climbing up into

          the balcony above us to escape the pressure and about 3.10 pm (1510)

          the pressure around me had become so intense that it became almost

          impossible to move and I was very hot so I managed to climb up the

          fence dividing pen 3 from pens 1 and 2 and I was lifted into the

          balcony above by one of the pals I had travelled to the game with and

          sane other people ..... my mate had already climbed up there before me

          and about 10 minutes later we discovered the third member of our party

         who had also climbed up.



         Looking down from the stand area to the front of pens 3 and 4, we could

          see that there were people injured and dead, by that time there were

         bodies lying on the pitch and we decided that we should leave the
                                                                PAGE    6
                                                                S8

Stadium       we left at about 3.45 pm (1545).   I recall hearing an

announcement over the tannoy from Kenny DALGLISH just as we were

leaving the ground although I cannot now recall exactly what he was

saying.



We made our way to our car and drove hone.



I cannot understand why there should be a difference in the policing of

the mouth of the tunnel for the January 1989 (000189) League game and

the April (000400) semi-final.



If by 2.45 pm (1445), at the January game the Police were aware that

pens 3 and 4 were full and were directing fans to the side pens why did

they not have the same realization at the same time or sooner on the

15th April (150400), and adopt a similar position and issue the same

instruction to f a n s     the semi-final game was far more important to

many fans and the Police should have realized this and anticipated that

more people would be attending the game and it is a natural reaction to

want to stand behind the goal.



I am willing to attend the Public Enquiry in Sheffield to give evidence

if I am required to do so.

            1.     I am a




            2.     I have lived in                                     for 3 1/2 (three and a half) years.

            In that time I have observed many football supporters en route to

            Hillsborough Football Stadium.




            3.        On 15th April 1989 (150489) I spent the morning in Sheffield Town

            Centre shopping with my son                                and returned home to                                         at

            1.15 (1315) by taxi.                  The taxi took an unusual route back because of

            the expected congestion in Middlewood Road.                                  We came through the

            Wisewood area and down
                                                                    PAGE        2
                                                                    S6

4.   All the way from the Rivelin Valley the roads were very congested

with traffic and a large number of people were walking along the

pavement.     This is approximately 1 1/2 miles (one and a half miles)

from the football stadium.     They looked like football supporters -

mainly Liverpool supporters as far as I could tell from their colours.




5.                  was very busy - both sides of the road were full of

parked cars.     Supporters were walking down the road even at that stage.

I didn’t notice anybody carrying cans - there aren’t many shops where

you can buy alcohol round there.     The fans were well behaved and were

in good humour.     They were very like a normal football crowd.      In fact

there was less chanting than on other days at this time.




6.          likes to stand at the window and wave to football supporters

on match days.     Most people waved back.   This was from 2pm (1400) for

about 30 - 40 minutes.     It’s a good way of entertaining him before his

sleep.    He went to bed at about 3pm (1500).




7.     I do not recall seeing any Police Officers in                  on that

day.     Sometimes I see mounted Police Officers going down

but not on that day.



8.     About 3pm (1500), I started some work in the dining room.      I put

the radio on and heard about the disaster.      I put the TV on and

watched developments then saw people walking in                    away from

the ground.     There were 2 young men, 17 - 18 year olds who had parked

just outside the house.     They were in distress and I invited them in

to use the telephone and have some tea.      We watched the TV for news.

They stayed for about 1/2 (half) an hour - they became more upset as

developments unfolded.

9.     By the time they left there were as many people walking up _________

        away from the ground as walking to the ground earlier.     This must

have been about 3.30    - 3.40pm (1530 - 1540).




10.     On 11th February 1989 (110289) I attended    a league game at

Hillsborough between Sheffield Wednesday FC and Manchester Utd.           I ’m

not a regular attender - that was the first time for about 10 years.




11.    I arrived at Hillsborough at 2.45 (1445) intending to go into the

Man Utd end.     I had hoped to meet a friend but was late.    We were going

to go to Leppings Lane.     Quite a lot of people were milling about -

obvious you weren’t going to get in for 3pm (1500).



12.     There were mounted Police and foot Police.    There were quite a

lot of them,     probably because of Man      Ut d’s reputation.There      were a

large number     of fans - around 500, maybe more.    They

spilled onto the roadway and bridge.       Others were still arriving

coming along     Leppings Lane from both      directions.    Coacheshad dropped

off in Leppings Lane which I thought was quite odd.




13.     I decided there was no chance of       gettingfor 3pm (1500)       kick off

so walked around the stadium next to the river and got in at the Kop

end.



14.    I recall it was raining and I joined the mass of the crowd.         I

took up my position about 2 - 3    minutes before kick off.




15.    There had been no attempt to stop me walking round the back         of the
                                                                     PAGE      4
                                                                     S6

South Stand from Leppings Lane to the Kop.      I recall being surprised by

that.



16.     At about 3.05 - 3.10 (1505 - 1510) or so I recall seeing some Man

Utd fans being escorted around the pitch in front of the Kop end.           This

sticks in my mind because there was a lot of jeering from the Sheffield

fans.



17.     At first I thought there had been trouble and they were being

ejected - perhaps because they had been in the Kop, but then they were

let into the West Stand where the other Man Utd fans were.      There were

20 - 30 fans at least and they walked in a crocodile

escorted by Police Officers.



18.     The fans were let into the corner pen of the West Stand (pens 6 &

7).     I could see that the Leppings Lane end terrace was crowded and I

recall seeing some fans being pulled up into the seating area of the

West Stand.



19.     I also recall seeing a handful of Man Utd supporters being

escorted around the pitch, also to pens 6 & 7.      I am not sure where

they came from.      I assume the reason for this was that fans could not

get into the game in time because of the situation at the Leppings Lane

turnstiles.




20.     When                                 back along the rear of the

South Stand.      In Leppings Lane there were coaches picking up the Man

Utd fans.      There was a heavy Police presence - both mounted and foot

Officers.

           I am a bar person by way of occupation working at the

                  situated                                               I started work at this pub on

           31st July 1989 (310789) and prior to that I was employed as a bar

           person at                   Public House situated                             Sheffield where
           I had been employed since February 1988 (000288).

           I am aware of the tragedy- that occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on

          Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) and on that day as far as I can

          remember I went to work at________Public House arriving at about ten

          to twelve (1150) in the morning, just before lunch time.

          When I arrived at the Pub I saw a very large group of football

          supporters outside the Pub. I knew they were football supporters

          because they were wearing red and white coloured scarves and hats and

          as far as I can remember they were Nottingham Forest supporters. I
                                                                    pa®:     2
                                                                    S5

thought nothing of this crowd being outside the Pub drinking because it

was a nice day and it was a large football match. By that I mean that

the two teams playing had a large following.

I went inside the Pub and into the lounge area which is to the right as

one enters through the front door. The pub was packed with football

fans in the lounge so I went straight to behind the bar where I started

serving customers. I didn't notice any local customers in the room at

this time, in fact it was so full and busy I can't even remember seeing

or serving a regular customer that lunch time.

As far as I could see there were four of us behind the bar when I

started serving, the arrangements being that these two lads named

                   tfould serve in the bar area whilst myself and

              uould serve in the lounge area but to be fair I was on my

own for most of the time because           ^as trying to keep the beer

flowing by changing barrels and stacking the shelves with bottled beer.

It was so busy that time meant nothing to me and in fact the next thing

I remember is seeing           and      ccming into the pub at about half

past twelve. Until then I can say that everybody in the lounge had been

well behaved and as far as I can remember the fans were Nottingham

Forest Supporters.

       ind         joined us behind the bar and started helping out, in

fact         and                     ivere collecting glasses and stacking

the shelves with bottled beer for most of the time along with the

changing of the barrels.

This went on until about half past two (1430) that afternoon when the

pub just emptied slowly as the supporters left for the match leaving

about a handful of customers in the pub at about three o'clock (1500).

This was the first opportunity that I had had to have a break and by

this time we had more or less run out of beer. It was at this time that

I spoke to three Nottingham Forest supporters who were standing at the
                                                                        PAGE
                                                                        S5

        bar and they stated that they were not going to the match as they

        didn't have any tickets and knew that they wouldn't be able to get in.

        I have been asked   about theprocedure for serving beer at the public

        house and I can say that all the beer pumps are electrically operated

        providing a measured half pint of beer every time one presses the

        switch other thanfor two pumps which   were of the pull kind. I have

        been a bar person   for about ten years and at a rough estimate it would

        take me about thirty seconds to pour a pint of beer and then about

        another thirty seconds to take the money. On the day in question it was

        so busy that the till was left open and they money just placed in the

        tray thus there is no record by way of a till roll as far as I can

        remember.
        The stock that I served the customers on that day was the stock that

        was kept behind the bar which I had seen        and

        provide. I did not serve any person with canned beer or any other beer

        which is not regularly stocked at the Public House.

        I remained at the Pub until about six o'clock (1800) that evening but

        the Pub was closed at about half past three (1530) when we learnt of

        the tragedy and no person entered between these times. That is all I

        can remember about that day.

          I am the joint owner of the Owl Public House, which I co—owned with my

          wife Kathryn; my wife is the Licensee for the purposes of the Licensing

          Act.



 O        My wife and I purchased the Owl Public House in February 1989,

          (000089), at which time neither of us had owned or managed a Public

          House previously, although my wife had worked in a Public House and a

          Hotel serving intoxicants.    I have been a musician for the last twenty

          years and my employment was always in Licensed premises of one sort or

          another.



          The Owl Public House is situated about one mile from the Hillsborough

          Football Ground, although it is not on a direct route to the ground and
                                                                PAGE     2
                                                                S4

as such does not normally attract football fans in any significant

number.



Until June or July 1989 (000689 - 000789), my wife and I did not reside

on the premises although we do now.



Between approximately March 1989 (000389), and June 1990 (000690), my

wife and I employed a Keith Norman OLLERENSHAW asa barman and

cellarman.    On occasions he was left in charge ofthe Public House for

short periods, but he was not employed as a Manager and I have never

said anything to him that might give him that impression.



I would regard my Saturday trade at The Owl as falling into two

categories.



1)   Normal Saturday - no Football Match.

2)   Normal Saturday - with local Football Match (Hillsborough).



On a Saturday, my opening hours are 12 mid-day (1200) until 11.00 pn

(2300), and the only time that I have varied these hours was on

Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489).



Takings at the Public House are recorded by me every week, although I

would have a daily record of takings from my till receipts.   I do not

possess the till receipts or weekly records for 1989 (000089), as these

will have been passed to my Accountant.



As far as category one (normal Saturday) is concerned, I would estimate

that the following would apply:-
                                                                  PAGE   3
                                                                  S4

Number of staff serving behind bar - 1 or 2

Number of customers during afternoon period say 12 mid-day (1200) until

7 pn (1900) - 12 persons

Sales - #40 (forty pounds)

Sales of Beer - say 12 pints and 2 bottles (no Spirits are normally

sold in an afternoon period).



As far as category two (normal Saturday with local football match) is

concerned, I would estimate that the following would apply: -



Number of staff serving - 1 or 2

Number of customers during afternoon - 40 persons

Sales - #90 (ninety pounds)

Sales of Beer say 80 pints and 5-10 bottles.



The above are estimates and may vary slightly, it is not possible to

prove these figures by a stocktake as this would not produce a

breakdown of individual sales of particular stock on any given day.



I can say from my experience and from delivery notes in my possession,

that my maximum stock of beer at any given time is as follows:-



Mild Keg Beer - one

Bitter Keg Beer - three

Larger Keg Beer - three

Bottled Beer - say ten crates (240 pint bottles).



Kegs vary in size, but the maximum size keg that I purchase in any

given beer is 22 gallons.
                                                                  PAGE    4
                                                                  S4

 I may increase ray stock of keg beers for special occasions, for example

 a private party, that would be by only one keg of any given beer.



 In addition to the above beers, I would hold one keg of Guiness and one

 of Cider.



 I understand that Keith OLLERENSHAW has indicated a stock of 7 kegs of

Mild being held at The Owl on 15th April 1989 (150489).     This is

untrue.   Mild is not a popular drink in this area, and I have never

held more than two kegs of Mild at any one time.



On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489), because of the impending

football match to be held at Hillsborough between Liverpool and

Nottingham Forest, I was informed by Keith OLLERENSHAW that we could

expect an increase in sales of beer and the possibility of some damage

within the Public House as a result of behaviour of some football fans,

this latter warning was also given to me by other local people.



As a result of this, I took certain precautions including moving all

loose furniture, ashtrays and pictures from the public area of the bar.



As far as increased beer sales was concerned, I had assumed that Keith

(whose responsibility it was to order the beer), would have ensured

that extra kegs of beer were ordered in advance.



I now find, from examining the delivery notes for the relevant period,

that no increased order was in fact made.   I produce the following

delivery notes to support this:-

                                                                    S4

Delivery Note 13th April      1989 (130489) (Ref: RHS/4)(Exh:       ).

Delivery Note 17th April      1989 (170489) (Ref: RHS/5)(Exh:       ).

Delivery Note 20th April      1989 (200489) (Ref: RHS/6)(Exh:       ).



The above Delivery Notes   also support ray estimates of maximum stock

held at any given time.



Having discussed the impending football match with Keith, I arranged

for extra bar staff to be present, four in all, including myself and my

wife, although the arrangement was that my wife and I would not arrive

at the Public House until 1.00 pm (1300), Keith was to open up the

premises prior to our arrival.



At about 12 mid-day (1200), on 15th April 1989 (150489), my wife

received a phone call at our home requesting we attend as the Pub was

very busy; I do not know who made that call.



My wife and I arrived at The Owl at about 12.20 pm (1220), and on

arriving I saw about 30-40 persons outside the Pub mostly drinking; I

saw no mis-behaviour.



I went into the Pub itself and found what I would estimate as to be

between 100 and 200 people.     There were deep queues at the bar

counters of people waiting to be served.



Although I would describe the Pub as crowded, there was space between

the groups of people in which to move through the bar which my wife and

I did to get behind the bar counter.

                                                                   S4



 At this time one of my staff,           was serving and two regular

 customers were assisting her.     Keith OLLERENSHAW was not present, I

 understand he had gone to a nearby premises to obtain extra drinking

 glasses as we had run out of clean glasses.



 My wife and I assisted serving.    The Pub remained busy until about

 2.45 pm (1445), when a large number of people left the premises.



About 50 persons remained in the premises and this gradually diminished

to 20 persons at about 3.00 pm (1500).



The fans were generally well behaved, there was seme singing and

chanting and I heard seme bad language, the sort I would expect to hear

at a football match.



The only instances of note was when the juke box stopped playing and

when I checked someone had pulled the electrical wires out of the plug.

The machine itself was not damaged.



A while later a group of three youths were abusive to ray wife and

barmaid, and ray wife warned them about their behaviour and they stopped

the abuse.



At about 3.30 pm (1530), one customer who appeared drunk and had

remained in the premises, after the majority had left, was involved in

an argument with another customer and threatened to throw an empty beer

crate through a window.   I called the Police who attended and ejected

him.
                                                                 PAGE    7
                                                                 S4

 I would estimate that the football fans present that afternoon were

 about   1/2 (Half) and 1/2 (Half) Liverpool/Notts fans.   I make this

 assumption from accents overheard and supporters scarfs worn.



At some stage during the afternoon, I think about 2.00 pm (1400), we

had sold out of keg beers and lager and were selling only bottled beer

some of which was purchased by the crate; either 12 or 24 bottles to a

crate depending on the brand of beer.



I finally closed the Pub at about 5.00 pm (1700), having heard of a

disaster at Hillsborough; there were no customers in the Pub at this

time the last ones having left just prior to this.



Whilst I do not possess the till receipt or stocktake covering the

15th April 1989 (150489), I am able to say that the takings, from

memory, were about #1,200 (twelve hundred pounds). This figure does

not include the evenings taking; I re-opened the Pub from 9.30 pm

(2130), until 11.00 pm (2300), that same evening (150489), selling the

only beer that was left which was bottled.   In fact I had managed to

re-stock some bottled beer, buying from a local Working Mans Club.



In April 1989 (000489), my beer price was about #1 per pint, and lager

about #1.20p per pint.   Taking into account bottled beer which was sold

in pint and half pint quantities at #1.12p and 97 pence respectively

I would estimate that I sold 1200 pints of beer/lager.



I am prepared to give evidence at the Coroner's Court if it is

necessary.

                               Statement

           John McBRIEN was ray son and I appear at this court to represent our

           family to present facts which answer the question why John died on the

           15th April 1989 (150489) at Hillsborough.

           The Police, acting as agents for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,

           were there to operate the Club's system by the rules of the Green Guide

           Safety at Sports Grounds.        The Safety certificate was issued to the

           holder of the ground - this was a Statutory Authority and Binding

           Document.   The Police thought the system did work and agreed to Police

           the 1989 Semi-Final and provide 801 officers.       On the 15th April

           (150489) it was not a failure of the system but a failure of the Police

           to operate the system.       The Club had a duty to its visitors.    They

           trusted the Police to carry out the rules of the Green Guide.

           It was never foreseeable by Dr. EASTWOOD & Partners (Engineers for

           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club) that the Police would open an

           outside gate.     Dr EASTWOOD designed the ground to allow for entry by

           turnstile only - Green Guide - rate of admission but also dispersal so

           that no unduly crowds came in all at once.

           The 1989 (000089) Semi-Final was a capacity match so it was vital to

           know the number of fans entering the ground.        This had to be done at

           the turnstiles.     There had to be a maximum limit.     If the rules of the

           Green Guide had been followed, then capacity would not have been

           exceeded.   Numbers must be controlled (P21 Par 66) - People should
MCBRIEN                 JOAN                                                 2


have been counted in.     Admission should have continued by the normal

system of turnstile entry (Par 63).      There was overcrowding to a

serious extent.     This was a causative factor for who is to blame.    An

unlimited number was allowed in, causing over-crowding, hence serious

discomfort because numbers had been exceeded.

The rate of admission at an all-ticket match is usually 1,000 persons

per hour per turnstile. But fran 2.52 pm (1452) to 3.03 pm (1503),

2,000 fans were admitted through Gate C.      The wrong decision was made

to open the gates, probably caused by anxiety, but this was negligence

and the density of the crowd caused the disaster.      To throw open the

gates and let the fans in, in an uncontrolled way was disastrous.

No-one would think that someone would throw open the gates and let

everyone in.

What means of control did Dr. EASTWOOD provide?      Control was at the

perimeter of the ground in the form of turnstiles.      H.S.E (Blown-up

Photographs of Pens 3 and 4 showed 643 and 678 before the opening of

Gate C) Time?     In Pen 3 at 3.03 pm (1503) when John was identified

alive there were 1,576 after 2,000 fans had been let in through Gate C

at   2.52 pm (1452).   The majority went down the tunnel as it was

directly in line with Gate C after they crossed the concourse.

Consequently, the Pens became hopelessly overcrowded as seen by the

figures above and this caused the deaths.      This was negligence and a

breach of duty. The system "find your own level in the Pens" had

always worked providing fans went in through the turnstiles.      The

Police would never know when to close off the tunnel.      The fans

automatically make it comfortable themselves when they come in by the

usual system of turnstiles.      If they came in by the ordinary system,

they would either go in and try to find a place or they will be turned

away as in 1988 (000088).      As a lot of people were coming back out of
MCBRIEN                 JOAN                                                  3


the tunnel that year, a decision was made to close off the tunnel.

The reason it was not done in 1989 was that people were not coming in

in the usual way.     John had attended the 1988 (000088) Semi-Final and

another match early in 1989 (000089) at Hillsborough and had

encountered no problems then. The consequences in the 1989 Semi-Final

were that the pens became completely unsafe as there was no means of

escape as the tunnel was blocked solid by this enormous mass of fans,

thus causing severe crushing and deaths.        The only normal and quick

exit route was via the tunnel and that is why it was usually left open

to allow exit frcm the terraces in an emergency.

As the crushing developed, the fans could only go forward and were

relying on the police to let them out via the gate in the perimeter

fence.     But action was taken far too late.    The Police were not

expected to count the numbers in the Pens but it was their duty to

respond if they saw danger or trouble in the Pens.

The question is - 'Ought Gate C to have been opened at all?       The answer

is - 'Definitely Not.    Safety Certificate (P21 Par 66)     Exit gates have

to be padlocked and at all times have to be manned.       They can only be

opened to let people out of the ground.    The rate of flow was

dramatically increased when gate C was opened compared with turnstile

entry and this caused the disaster.    There was a conflict of flow in

1989 (000089) after opening Gate C.    Providing gate C remained closed,

there would not be a collision (cross flow) - there would not be a

problem.    So the opening of Gate C is causative.     The system was to be

operated as usual, providing radial gates were left open (1989)

(000089).    These gates - one requirement is that gates are to be manned

by active Police Control. (Taylor Report P184).

Why did the build-up happen at the Leppings Lane end which led to the

opening of Gate C?    What control did the police assume there?     They
MCBRIEN               JOAN                                                4


were to regulate the queues.   The Police's job was to make sure

visitors had a right to be in the ground so the Police had to comply

with the rules of the Green Guide.   The Police accepted responsibility

to try to make the system work.   What about segregation of fans when

they approach the ground - filtering out of ticketless fans?   The

Police should have controlled the monitoring outside the turnstiles.

Measures should have been taken to prevent the build-up, to check the

advance of the crowd by having various stop-points.   Barriers could

have been erected very quickly and easily.   Instead, sudden congestion

arose after 2.30 pm (1430) (closing of the road)   Supt MARSHALL'S

request.   The material cause of the build-up was bad policing, bad

planning and bad execution.

The solution was not to break the safety rules and get the fans in by

3 o'clock (1500) come what may but simply delay the game.

I have here a copy of P28 and 3 lines of P29 from the Transcript of

Supt. MARSHALL'S evidence.

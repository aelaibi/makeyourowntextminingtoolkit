                    i am not a Liverpool            supporter and do not follow any team                             in

                    football.         I decided to go to the H i l l s b or o ug h game                     because       it was my

                    last    chance     to see a good match before                      the start       of the     cricket

                    season.       I did not a ct ua l ly have a m a tc h ticket and                         it was my

                    intention to try and            buy a match ticket at                  the ground           prior to the
                                                                                                            PAGE

               At the time of H i l l s b or o ug h     1 was    resident at my S h e f f ie l d ad dr es s and

               X t r a velled to the ground from the m ain                railway station        in She ff ie ld

               by way of a special           football       bus that was     laid on for       the match.         I

               t r avelled to the ground wit h the following                  people"

               1»

               2   .
               The     reason for    initially going          to the    railway station was         because

               s om ebody had      told us that we may be able             to buy m at ch tickets         from

               people getting        off    trains    there.     We weren't able         to buy tickets at

               the     station so we tra ve ll ed to the ground by bus,                  a rr iving at the

               L ep pings Lane      end of the       ground at about       quarter     past one     (1315).

               Having a r r i v e d at     the    ground,   we spent     the ne;<t forty five minutes

               walk i n g around     the general are a of the ground,             looking       for a n yb od y

               that may be offering              tickets.     There wasn't a n yb od y offering          tickets
\
               at the L e p pings Lane           end of the ground,       so we went ar ou nd towards             the

               F orest    end of the ground and started walking along                     the mai n P en is to ne

               R o a d to see     if there were any tickets an offer              there.

               It was about        two    o'clock    (14QO)    while we were     looking       along Pen is to ne

               Road,     that we saw a man who was             o b vi ou sl y offering    tickets.       The man

               was     near   to the mai n gates       that    lead into Hillsborough.            The man

               a p p e a r e d to have a    lot of tickets,       all    for the Kop end of the ground.
    O fT
               We each bought a kop ticket              off    the man.      As best     I remember,      1 paid
T)UC£—
               the man        ten pounds    for    the ticket which was for the kop terraces.                         1
t o o      T
               did not know the man who was                 selling    the tickets and all        I can

               remember       of him was     that    he was of average        height and       possibly had a

               beard.         It was about       the same time     that we    bought the       tickets    off     that

               man,     that we were       joined by two friends          of ours from S he f fi e ld

                also    bought       two Kop tickets          off    the man,    and he and

        After    buying       the tickets,          we started       looking ar ou nd again,          this    time

        to see     if we      could swop our Kop tickets                for Leppi ng s Lane         tickets.         A

        few minutes          later,       while   still     in the Pen is to ne Road,          I heard a lad

        say something          like       I*ve got to get a Kop t i c k e t 11          It t ra ns pi re d that

        the    lad had a ticket             for   the Leppi ng s Lane         terracing and we did a

        straight       swop.        The    others were       still    looking    to swop their            tickets

        an d were      having difficulty.              Because       of this,    I left them and started

        to make my way towards                the L ep pings Lane         end,   thinking      that the others

        w ou l d have to w a tc h the m atch from the Kop end.

        I a rr iv ed at the L ep pings Lane turn st il es at some                       time   between five
SO.£_   past and ten past two.                    (1405)    (1410).     There were a lot of               people

        milling about          in the area outside              the outer      iron gates.        Most      of these

        were asking about             spare tickets          I went straight          to a turnstile and

        wi th i n about       two minutes,          I was    inside the ground.           A l t ho u gh    there

        were a lot of          people       outside    the    turnstile area,          there were         only a

        few a c t u a l ly    entering       the ground.

        There were Police             officers       in the area of the turnstiles who were

        engaged     in controlling            the    crowd.      However,     at that time        there wasn't

        any    problems at that             time and the Police w e r e n ’t required               to do much

        at the time          that    I entered the ground.              As    I remember       I saw two

        stewards       standing       by the       little    corner shop to the          left of the

        turnstile area.              The    stewards who were wearing             fluore sc en t      bibs,    were

        leaning against a wall                by the shop,          not a ct ua ll y doing anything.

        During    the time          that    I spent walk in g ar ou nd the ground,               1 did not         see

        an y   fighting       or any disorder.              I did not a ct ua ll y see any drunkeness

         but    I saw a lot of supporters                   drinking    cans of beer        in the

        street.        It was m ai n ly Liverpool             supporters       that    I saw drinking         in

              the street and the         presence          of alcohol       was    very evident

              I did not see any u na ut ho r is e d entry                 into    the ground at a l l .

              As   1 went through the turnstile,                   I handed my ticket             in to the

              operator and was         given the stub             portion back,       which       I have      retained

              to this day.

              I did not see any signs indicating the way to the terracing,                                      but    I

              was aware    of the      central       tunnel       that    runs unde rn ea th the West S ta nd                I

              have   been to the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground before,              when 1 have a tt en de d

              league games      I was aware          that entry to the             side terraces          could be

              gained by walking ar ou nd the stand.                       However,     I was of the           impression

              that   the side wings were             only used as an overspill                   when the

              central    pens were      full.        I    had been diver te d to a side wing when

              a ttending a S he f fi e ld W ed n es d ay - Manch es te r Un it ed                 league match.

              Having    entered the ground at about                  ten past two          (1410),      I thought

              there w ould be sufficient                 space    behind the goals and that                the side

              wings would      not yet       be    in use.        Because       of this,    I went      to the toilet

              to the    left of the      tunnel,          prior    to making my way along               the   tunnel

              to the    terraces.

              As   1 left the       toilet    I looked towards             the    tunnel   and saw

                              and                 They had all           just    entered the L ep pi ng s Lane

              end of t he ground,        a p p ar e nt l y by using         their Kop tickets.

              We   then all w al k ed along          the    central       tunnel    towards       the   central

              terraces.       We had a free          passage along          the tunnel,          it was

N &   o   T   r easonably quiet        inside      the tunnel.            I did not see any Police               or

              stewards    either at      the entrance             to the tunnel       or anywhere          inside      it

              Once   inside    the ground,          I did not see any             people    drinking       or any

              drunkeness.       I did not         see any fighting              or any sort of disorder.

              At   the end of the       tunnel      we all went           to the    right hand side,            into

              what   I now know to       be       pen number       three.        It was    busy    in the      pen

              wh e n we entered w hich was at about                  q u a r t e r past    two    (1415).       I was

                                                                                                        S3645

s u rprised at how busy                it was at that          time.     The    front    quarter       of the

pen was       fairly empty,            whilst    the    rest of the          pen was    quite    full.        We

all made       our way towards               the front    of the       pen.     We had to       push our

way through the             crowd,      but without       any great          difficulty.        When we got

towards       the   front       of the       pen we took up a position behind a crush

barrier.        It was       the    crush barrier         nearest       the front       of the    pen,    the

one    nearest the dividing                  fence   between        pen three and       pen four.        We

were     standing      behind the            right hand section thats as you                   look at

the    pitch.       It w a s n ’t too         busy where we were,             and we had a fair bit of

room.      I have mar ke d this               position on a separate             grid plan using          the

figure     one.       We    remained         in position one          for about    fifteen

minutes,       during which time               the   pen was        c ontinually filling         up.     After

about    fifteen minutes                       said he did not want             to remain behind

the    barrier.        1 think                 did not want          to be pushed to the          front

of the     pen.       Fro m where we were,              our    view of the       pitch was       ob str uc te d

by the front          perimeter         fence.       The m es h was      that small       that    it was

difficult       to see       the    pitch      properly.        For    these    reasons we all

d e c i d e d to try and get a position towards                        the    rear of the       pen.     We

started making             our way back through               the    crowd,    towards    the    back of

the    pen.     I thought          it w ould be a struggle              getting    back through the

crowd,     however,        we    put             at the       front and       I think this made          it

easier     to get through              the    crowd.     We got       towards the       rear    of the

pen and took          up a position w hich was about                    three    to four feet          from

the    rear wall an d about              eight to ten feet from the                dividing       fence

between       pen three and            pen two.        I have ma rk ed this        position on the

separate       grid    plan using            the figure       IA.     We took up P o s it i on      IA at

a bout    twenty to three              (1440).       It was     very busy       in the    pen by now and

there was a lot of atmo sp he re all a ro u nd the ground.                               I was    being

m oved around by the               crowd      in there,       but    it was    nothing    to    cause any

concern.        During       the    next fift ee n minu te s           or so,    the movem en t        of the

crowd g r adually m oved us towards                    the    rear of the          pen,    up against        the

rear wall,       I have ma rk ed this            p os ition on the separate                 grid plan

using    the figure 2.              From five       to three        (1455)       onwards    it became        very

tight    in the       pen.        With the a tm os ph er e         in the    pen and the          prospect

of the m atch starting               shortly,       you tended not to notice                 the

discomfort.           I w a tc he d the      players        take    the    pitch just       before       three

o c 1o c k (1500)     and    then w a tc h ed the       game       kick    off.     My a tt e nt i o n    from

three oclock          (1500)       onwards was on the              pitch and the game             being

played.        There was          still    movement a ro u nd the           pen in front          of me and

very oc c a s i on al y      1 w ould avert my view from the                      pitch a nd have a

quick    look at the          crowd to see where              the    pushing was          coming     from.

During    the first four             or five minutes           of the m atch there were a

couple    of obvious          surges       in the     pen,    but    it never o cc urred           to me        that

something was wrong.                  1 remember Liverpool                hitting    the Forest

crossbar,       1 could not see w hi ch Liverpool                     player       it was,     but      I saw

the    ball    strike       the    crossbar.        F o ll ow in g the ball         hitting       the    cross

bar    there was anot h er           obvious     surge       in pen three.           As    I remember           it

was more       of a sidewards             surge as opposed to a forwards                    one.        It was

about    the    same    time       that Liverpool           hit the Forest          bar,    that     I saw

people    spilling          out of the front           of the       pen and going          onto    the

playing area.            1    could not u nd er st an d what was happening and

thought       it was     a small          overspill    from the       front       of the    pen.        Shor tl y
                                                                                ' OV«£ ^ £ L
after    this,       the m at c h was       stopped and more              people started          climbing

out over       the    front       perimeter     fence,       and onto       the    playing area.            1

could then hear shouts                 from the front          of the       pen.     People were

shouting,       "Get back,          get    back."      We    couldn't       get    back any further we

were    right    up against          the     rear wall.        People aro un d us were               saying

that    there    dead       people at the front              of the       pen.     I could not

believe       that was        the    case.     There was a lot of panic all aro un d                        and

people    saying,        " W e ’ve got       to get out, just get out."                   Looking

above.        I remained at the            rear     of the    pen and together with

and              I a ss is t ed another         few people       up    into the stand above

remained at the           rear       of the    pen as     the scale      of the disaster            became

apparent       below me.

I did not witness an y deaths                   from my position          in the       pen and      I cannot

describe       any bodies        in any detail.

As stated above,              I remained       in the     pen and did not go down onto the

pitch at all.           I did not assist any of the dead or                      injured      in pen three

Together       wit h            and                 I remained at the           rear    of   pen three

until    some time        between five oclock               (1700)    and quarter        past five

(1715).        We were        three    of the very        last   people    to    leave.

I did not        sustain an y         injury at H il lsborough.

I did not see a crush barrier                     break     in pen number        three and         I was       not

aware    that a barrier              had broken until        about      three    thirty      (1530)       that

afternoon.

I can accept           that    there were a number            of factors w hich          contributed

towards       the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster. 1' have no real criticism of the

duty    that day.         I felt       that    the L iverpool         supporters       beha ve d    in an

over    zealous manner           that a ft e rn o on and alcohol           certainly         played a

part.        I m e n t i o ne d earlier       in this     statement      that alcohol         was very

evident       that afternoon.            The    public      tannoy system        could have been used

to more       effect and kept           people better         informed as to what was

h a ppening that afternoon.

               It states            earlier    in the statement     that   I saw a lot of people drinking

               in the street,,             it wasn't a lot      ie not   the majority,     but   I w it n es s ed a

               number       of people drinking           in the street.       In fact,    I w ou ld also    say,

               that whilst            inside     the ground,    I also   saw Liverpool     s upporters who

               were under            the   influence    of drink,   perhaps    not out and out       drunk,     but

               certainly under             the    influence    of alcohol,    which was    very evident       that

               afternoon.

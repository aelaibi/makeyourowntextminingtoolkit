Q17„     DID YOU WITNESS ANY UNAUTHORISED ENTRY TO ANY PART OF THE GROUND?:

         (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



         I do recall seeing a Police man helping a couple of young fans

         over above the turnstile away to my right 1 thought that was a

         refreshing     change of tactics for Police at the ti m e .



CHS,,   DID YOU WITNESS ALCOHOL BEING BROUGHT INTO THE GROUND OR                   BEING

         the motorway junction we come off on for Sheffield North there

         BELIEVE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DISASTER?



         The centre area seemed excessively full with gaps at either

         side,,    I saw gaps in the

         Spion Kop end where Notts Forest fans were which tends to

         support my view that ticket allocation were not right-

        FOOTBALL TRAGEDY?             (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



        Yes Heisel - but            the comparison I would draw is that with both

        t h e p Ia n n irig a n d   c o n t rol we r e g ro s s 1y i nade q uate 5t h e P o 1 i ce

        at Hillsborough weren't              prepared for any tragedy.                There

        w e r e n ’t enough Police at the Lsppings Lane end

        either     inside or        outside the Ground as I saw it.                  It was the

        same at Heisel         that    is the only comparison I would draw however

        the causes were entirely different.

        SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU 'THINK IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR

        TO THIS DISASTER?            (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



        I remember an eerie silence on the way to the ground as we walked

        down and it seemed the Football Specials h a d n ’t arrived,,                        There

        was a back log getting             in when we went through and there were

        undoubtedly grounds tor delaying the kick off.



Q36.    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO M A K E ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FANS IN THE

        STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?



        There seamed to be no stewards or control of fans inside the

        ground to direct them away from the centre which was packed

        f u 11 into ths s ;l.des of the ter racing area whi ch were empty „



337.    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

        FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



        No   I h ave m a d s m y p o i n t s   it   just   wasn't   easy   to   f i n d y ou r   way

        around the ground despite having been there twice before,,



038„   IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

       TO THIS JUDICIAL         INQUIRY?



       I would make a point that at neutral ground the situation fac:l. nq

       any fan is unique because the allocations of space can be anywhere

       as there i sn ’t any Home team or any away team                     thus the

       necessity for e;-;tra clear sign posting and steward! nq becomes

       paramount

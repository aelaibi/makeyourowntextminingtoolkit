time     it wa s      but       it got          into       Sheffield           Railway         S t a t i o n at a b o u t           two

pm on     the    same           day.         We w a l k e d       f r o m the S t a t i o n part          of the            way

and     then    got a           taxi        the      rest    of    the way,         it wa s a b l a c k taxi                   that

we     flagged       down.           Th e    fare was            only about          one       pound     fifty         between

th e   three     of      us.         Alth oug h most              of     the    pubs      between        the

Railway        Station          and      th e     ground were             s h ut    I did       see    a few

supporters           drinking            from        cans    of    b e er      as   they were          walking,             they

were     supporters             of    both        clubs      but       t h e y w e r e n ’t r o w d y      or a n y t h i n g

they were        just           walking           along      like.

                 When           I got        off     the     train I only              saw a few         coppers            in

the C i t y C e n t r e         and      they        looked       like      just     being        there       so    no r m a l ,

not    because        of       the m a t c h         but    we    d i d n ’t se e      any      others        on the w a y

Coppers        I saw were             two       on    horses       when        I got      to    the    ground          at

                 Because             I had a ticket                for      Entrance           ’B ’ L e p p i n g L a n e

 and       the    other        two    had S t a n d          Tickets         for W e s t       Stand Lepping                Lane

 we      s o rt   of     split       up at       a small          bridge        near      to    the    g r o u n d a n d we

 arranged            to m e e t      there       after        the m a t c h        had    finished           although

 there were a                lot     of    people        mi 1 1 i n g a r o u n d    I didnt          see a n y o n e

 obviously             drunk        and    I didnt          see     any      fighting.

                       I must        have     got      to    the     g r o u n d at       half      two     in the

 afternoon             and     as    I walked          from       the     bridge         I could       see       the

Lepping           Lane       e n d of      the    ground and although                      I could         see     the

 turnstiles             there were            no q u e u e s       there        it just        seemed        like       th ere

was      a solid mass                of    people       outside           the    ground.            Although           there

were       loa ds      of      people       all      a r o u n d me       I could        s t il l    walk        towards          the

turnstile            area without                much       difficulty-             As    I said          before        I only

saw      two      Coppers           on horses          at    this       time     and     I didnt          se e a n y

stewards           and      there         were    no    persons          telling         us w h e r e      to go        or w h a t

to do        or    anything.

                     About      this        t i me     the    people         behind       me     started          to    push

and      the      crowd      started         to m o v e       forward           then     it all       seemed           to       turn

to m y      righ t       away       from     the       turnstiles,              I didnt        know where              I was

going       and      I couldnt            stop myself             from       being       pushed       so     I j u st           went

along       with       the     crowd,        I wasnt          being       crushed         or    anything           like

t ha t    because         at    this       time        it w as      just      a steady          push-         Then          I saw

I was       actually           inside        the       ground,        not       outside        it a n d      I still             had

both      p a r ts     of m y       ticket       w it h me        nobody        had asked           for      it   or t a k e n

if    off m e .          I didnt          see a n       open      gate       I didnt       see      on e     being

opened and             I didnt        see a n y b o d y        trying         to    get    into       the     ground

illegally            like      climbing          walls        and    that,         all    I know        is    that          I

didnt       go    through a turnstile                        I didnt         get    the    chance          to.

                     Once      I knew        I was       in the         ground,          inside       the     turnstiles

I saw       the      crowd      in f r o n t       of me a n d          to    the    side       of m e       heading

 towards        an      opening          and       I could        see      the     goalnets            of      the      pitch

 through        the         opening          and    the       crowd     surge          just      c a r r i e d me         on

 bothering            me     that      much        because       this        sort      of     thing          has      happened

 at   a few        of      these       grounds          but     always        coming          out      because            people

wanted        to      get     home-          Getting          back      to    the      tunnel          I didnt            see a n y

or    people          drinking          while         I was      in t h e r e       because            it was           j us t a

solid mass              of    people         and      nobody        ha d     r o o m to       do a n y t h i n g          el s e

except        walk.           At     the     time       I was       in the         tunnel         I was          in the

middle        of      the     crowd        but w h e n        I got        out     onto       the      s t a n d as y o u

look     at    the         ground       from       th e     tunnel         I wa s      on t he         left        of     the

tunnel.

                     Once       out     on the          terracing            I didnt          think          it wa s        to     ba d

I got     pushed             r ight     down       towards          the      front       of      the       terracing and                  I

thought        something               was    wrong        because           the    p e o p l e at          t he b a c k

were     still        pushing           forward           and    I had        nowhere            to    go      I was        being

pushed        onto      a white            guy     in f r o n t      of me         but      I wasnt           anywhere             n ea r

a barrier            but      I started            to     get   a    pain a cross              my      c hest         and      it got

more     difficult             to      breath         because        I w as        breathing               out     I couldnt

then     breath            in b e c a u s e      of     the     crush        I heard          a ’girl          who      was      two

or    three        people          to m y     r ight       screaming             but     I cant            remember            much

about     her       but       I do      remember           that      there were               about         eight         to     ten

line s    of       people          b e t w e e n me       and   the        front       fence          by    the       pitch.

E v e r y b o d y was         shouting           for      the    people          behind          to    get       b a ck     and

they were          shouting             back       "We     ca n t" .       Then        I saw a             l o o se     l in e     of

uniform Police                 about         a yard        away      from        the     fence         but       not      actually

said     "Do      you     know       t h is        lad"      and       he     said     "No,        I've        never

HARRY WHITE

You asked me to chase ex-inspector Harry White about replying to the letter we sent him.
This asked him what he thought about the changes to his ‘recollections’.

2.       I rang Mr White. He told me he was half-way through writing the letter and would
post it this evening (he has no fax machine). I asked him if he would summarise what he
was going to say. He told he was saying that he remembered Mr Duckenfield suggesting that
officers write up their ‘recollections’ rather than marking up their pocket books, because they
had such a lot to write.

3.      He said he didn’t remember who had asked him to put the ‘additional notes’ at the end
of his recollections. But he had done that a little while later.

4.     He thought the ‘additional notes’ and the other things deleted from his recollections
were all quite irrelevant. He doesn’t remember being asked about removing them. But if he
had been asked to do that he would not have had to be put under any pressure before he
agreed. He has no problem with them having been taken out.

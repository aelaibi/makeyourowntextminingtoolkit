    Im m ed iately. There appears to be no material difference between the terms “immediately” and
“forthw ith” and the latter was in fact used in the Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926, s 2(1), (2), Vol 11,
p 372 (replaced by sub-s (3) above).
    A provision to the effect that a thing must be done “forthw ith” or “immediately” means that it must
be done as soon as possible in the circumstances, the nature o f the act to be done being taken into
account; see Re Southam, ex p Lamb (1881) 19 Ch D 169 at 173, [1881-5] All ER Rep 391, CA ; Re

v Abeyewickrema [1963] AC 597, [1963] 3 All E R 382, PC. Provided, however, that no harm is done,
“forthw ith” means “at any reasonable time thereafter”, and in the absence o f some detriment suffered
by the person affected failure to act “forthw ith” does not invalidate the action taken; see Hillingdon
London Borough v Cutler [1968] 1 Q B 124, [1967] 2 All ER 361, CA. See, further, 45 Halsbury’s Laws

being entitled to act, eg, when it “thinks fit”, or when it is “satisfied” or it “appears” to it that a
prescribed state o f affairs exists, but the inherent jurisdiction o f the courts to determine w hether such
powers have been exceeded is not readily ousted by the use o f such language; see further 1 Halsbury’s

   (2) The council o f a non-metropolitan county may, and shall if directed to do
so by the Secretary o f State, after complying with such requirements as to notice
and consideration o f objections as may be prescribed, submit to the Secretary of
State a draft order providing—
        (a) for such alteration o f any existing division o f the county into coroners’
               districts as appears to them suitable; or
        (b)    where there is no such division, for the division of the county into such
               coroners’ districts as they think expedient;
and the Secretary o f State, after taking into consideration any objections to the
draft made in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed time, may make
the order, either in the terms o f the draft submitted to him or with such
modifications as he thinks fit.
   (3) If by reason o f any order under subsection (2) above it is in the opinion o f
the Secretary o f State necessary that the num ber o f coroners for a non-metropolitan
county should be increased,
         (a) the council shall appoint such number o f additional coroners for that
               county as the Secretary o f State may direct; and
         (b)   section 1(3) above shall apply with respect to any such appointment as
               if a vacancy had occurred in the office o f coroner for that county.
    (4) Where a non-metropolitan county is divided into coroners’ districts, each
o f the coroners for that county shall be assigned to one of those districts; and
where a non-metropolitan county is not so divided, the following provisions o f
this Act shall have effect as if the whole o f that county were a coroner’s district.
  (5) Except as provided by this Act, a coroner appointed for or assigned to a
coroner’s district—
         (a) shall for all purposes be regarded as a coroner for the whole
               administrative area which includes that district; and
         (b)   shall have the same jurisdiction, rights, powers and authorities
               throughout that area as if he had been appointed as coroner for that area
               or, as the case may be, had not been assigned to that district.
   (6) The power to make orders under this section shall be exercisable by
statutory instrument; and a statutory instrument containing an order under this
section shall be laid before each House o f Parliament after being made.
   (7) An order under subsection (2) above shall be published in the London
Gazette and particulars o f any order under that subsection shall be published by
the council of the non-metropolitan county in such manner as may be prescribed.

      Inquest under any other A ct. By the Capital Punishment A m endm ent Act 1868, s 5, Vol 3, title
 A rm ed Forces (Pt 1) (as applied; see the Introductory N ote to that Act) an inquest must be held upon
 the body o f an executed prisoner within twenty-four hours o f such execution, and a copy o f the
 inquisition delivered to the provost officer.
      W hether the cause o f death arose w ith in his district or n ot, the coroner s h a ll. . . hold an

  Yorkshire Coroner ex p Smith [1982] 3 All ER 1098, [1982] 3 W LR 920, CA , where it was held that a
 coroner was obliged to hold an inquest where the death occurred abroad but the body had been
 brought to England and was lying w ithin his district. The Coroners Act 1887, s 3(1), Vol 11, p 354,
 which is replaced by sub-s (1) above, prescribed the circumstances in w hich a coroner was obliged to
 hold an inquest “w hether the cause o f death arose within his jurisdiction or not” and s 7(1) of the 1887
 Act, Vol 11, p 359, replaced by s 5(1) ante, merely specified w hich coroner was so obliged, ie the one
 w ithin whose jurisdiction the body was lying. The coroner was not, however, required to inquire
 into the reasons for the death o f a person whose body was outside England and Wales.

   R ecurrence. On the true construction o f sub-s (3)(rf) above, a coroner is required to sum m on a
jury to sit with him at an inquest if the circumstances o f death are such that similar fatalities m ight
occur and it is reasonable to expect that proper action ought to be taken by some responsible public
body to prevent that happening; see R v Hammersmith Coroner, ex p Peach [1980] Q B 11, [1980] 2 All
 ER 7, CA, where it was held that the fact that there was reason to suspect that the deceased had died
from the unauthorised use o f a potentially lethal weapon by a police officer was a circumstance that
required the coroner to sit with a jury, since confirm ation o f the suspicion would make it reasonable
to expect the police authority to take steps to prevent such use in the future.
   Sub-s (5): A n y part o f an inq uest h eld w ith o u t a ju ry. W here a coroner recalled medical
evidence for the jury, his earlier decision as to the cause o f death could be set aside, because that
decision ceased to be effective once he recalled evidence and thereby left the decision as to the cause o f
death to the ju ry (R v Surrey Coroner, e x p Campbell [1982] 2 All ER 545, [1982] 2 W LR 626).

        (a) does not, after being openly called three times, appear to the summons;
              or
        (b) appears to the summons but refuses without reasonable excuse to serve
            as a juror,
the coroner may impose on that person a fine not exceeding £40 0.
   (2) W here a person duly summoned to give evidence at an inquest—
       (a) does not, after being openly called three times, appear to the summons ;
            or
       (b) appears to the summons but refuses without lawful excuse to answer a
            question put to him,
the coroner may impose on that person a fine not exceeding £4 0 0 .
   (3) The powers conferred upon a coroner by this section shall be in addition to
and not in derogation o f any other power which the coroner may possess—
        (a) for compelling any person to appear and give evidence before him in
            any inquest or other proceeding; or
        (b) for punishing any person for contempt o f court in not so appearing and
            giving evidence;
but a person shall not be fined by the coroner under this section and also be
punished under any such other power.
   (4) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions o f this section, a
juror shall not be liable to any penalty for non-attendance on a coroner’s jury
unless the summons requiring him to attend was duly served on him no later than
six days before the day on which he was required to attend.

N O TES
    This section contains provisions formerly in the Coroners Act 1887, s 19(1)—(3), (3A) (as amended
in the case o f s 19(1), (2) by the Criminal Penalties etc (Increase) O rder 1984, SI 1984/447, art 2(3),

    D oes n o t . . . appear to the su m m on s. Attendance o f a witness is secured either by a message or
by a formal summons. The summons is limited to the area for which the coroner has jurisdiction and
if it becomes necessary to secure the attendance o f a witness w ho is not within the coroner’sjurisdiction
it may be necessary to apply for a C row n Office subpoena (as to which, see RSC O rd 38, r 19 and
O rd 57, r 5). If a person summoned as a witness refuses or neglects to attend, a w arrant may be issued,
but there is no power to execute such a w arrant outside the jurisdiction.
    Reasonable excuse. See the note to s 9 ante.
    Fine. A fine imposed under this section is treated for the purposes o f its collection, enforcement
and remission as having been imposed by the magistrates’ court for the area in w hich the coroner’s
court was held and the coroner is as soon as practicable after imposing the fine to give particulars
thereof to the clerk o f that court; see the C rim inal Justice Act 1967, s 49(1), Vol 27, title Magistrates,
as renumbered by s 36(1) and Sch 3, para 14 post.

and Sch 3, para 17 post.
    L aw ful excuse. In order to establish that he had a lawful excuse it is necessary for a person to show
 (i) that he honestly, but mistakenly, believed on reasonable grounds that the facts were o f a certain
order, and (ii) that if those facts had been o f that order his conduct w ould have been lawful; see
 Cambridgeshire and Isle o f Ely C C v Rust [1972] 2 QB 426, [1972] 3 All ER 232. It is clear that an
 innocent motive alone is not sufficient to constitute a lawful excuse; see Dickins v Gill [1896] 2 QB

    S ittin g o f the inquest. An inquest is open to the public, though the coroner may exclude the
public from an inquest or part o f it on the grounds o f national security; see the Coroners Rules 1984,
SI 1984/552, r 17. The taking o f photographs, etc, in and about the court is prohibited by the Criminal
Justice Act 1925, s 41, Vol 27, title Magistrates.

Evidence, and the relevant enactments noted to s 1 o f that Act.
    Sub-s (3): Inquest h eld w ith a ju ry. References in this Act to an inquest held w ith a ju ry include
an inquest part o f which is held w ith a ju r y ; see s 35(2) post.
    The coroner may only communicate w ith the ju ry in open court (R v Wood, ex p Anderson [1928]
1 KB 302, [1927] All ER Rep 707). See also R v Divine, e x p Walton [1930] 2 KB 29, [1930] All ER
Rep 302, and R v Reynolds [1945] KB 30.
    E vidence. The duty is to inquire how, when and where the deceased came by his death; it may be
permissible, therefore, for the coroner to hear matters that would not strictly be admissible in evidence
at a criminal trial (see per Wills J, in charge to a grand jury; The Times 18 M arch 1890). The ju ry is
limited to evidence which establishes facts and to finding such particulars as have been proved (R v
Huntbach, ex p Lockley [1944] KB 606, [1944] 2 All ER 453 at 455).
    W hen directing the ju ry as to the standard o f proof required generally and when directing a ju ry
on manslaughter comprising unlawful killing alleged to have occurred because o f neglect on the part
o f police the coroner should observe the rules laid dow n in R v West London Coroner, ex p Cray
[1987] 2 All ER 129, [1987] 2 W LR 1020.
    V erdict. As to verdicts by a majority o f the jury, see s 12 post.
    A rider is not part o f the verdict (R v Harding (1908) 25 TLR 139), nor is a copy o f the verdict
admissible as evidence o f the cause o f death (Bird v Keep [1918] 2 KB 692; Barnett v Cohen [1921] 2
KB 461, [1921] All ER Rep 528).
    N o verdict should be framed in such a way as to appear to determine any question o f criminal or
civil liability on the part o f a named person; see the Coroners Rules 1984, SI 1984/552, r 42, and see
also sub-s (6) above. In R v Surrey Coroner, ex p Campbell [1982] 2 All ER 545, [1982] 2 W LR 626, it
was held that a verdict o f “lack o f care by another or others” did not contravene this requirement; see
also R v West London Coroner, e x p Gray [1987] 2 All ER 129, [1987] 2 W LR 1020. It would appear
that if any conflict arises between r 42 and the duty under this section to inquire into how the death
o f the deceased was caused, it should be resolved in favour o f the statutory duty under this section to
inquire into the cause o f death, whatever the consequences o f that m ight be (R v Surrey Coroner, ex p
Campbell above).

              fraud, rejection o f evidence, irregularity o f proceedings, insufficiency o f
              inquiry, the discovery o f new facts or evidence or otherwise) it is
              necessary or desirable in the interests o f justice that another inquest
              should be held.

   (2) The High C ourt may—
       (a) order an inquest or, as the case may be, another inquest to be held into
           the death either—
                (i) by the coroner concerned; or
               (ii) by the coroner for another district in the same administrative area;
         (b) order the coroner concerned to pay such costs o f and incidental to the
             application as to the court may appear just; and
         (c) where an inquest has been held, quash the inquisition on that inquest.

  (3) In relation to an inquest held under subsection (2)(<*)(ii) above, the coroner
by whom it is held shall be treated for the purposes o f this Act as if he were the
coroner for the district of the coroner concerned.

   The court is not entitled to use the wide powers contained in this section to quash a coroner’s
verdict if the Attorney General has refused to make or authorise the application. An inquest is a court,
not a tribunal, therefore the wide supervisory powers over statutory tribunals are not available and
consequently the court can only order judicial review o f an inquest on the grounds o f error on the

 14 Inquest out o f jurisdiction
    (1) If it appears to a coroner that, in the case o f a body lying within his district,
 an inquest ought to be held into the death but it is expedient that the inquest
should be held by some other coroner, he may request that coroner to assume
jurisdiction to hold the inquest; and if that coroner agrees he, and not the coroner
 within whose district the body is lying, shall have jurisdiction to hold the inquest.
    (2) If the coroner who has been requested to assume jurisdiction declines to
assume it, the coroner who has made the request may apply to the Secretary o f
State for a direction designating the coroner who is to hold the inquest.
    (3) On the making o f an application under subsection (2) above, the Secretary
o f State—
         (a) shall determine by which coroner (whether one o f the two mentioned
             in that subsection or another) the inquest should in all the circumstances
             be held; and
         (b) shall direct him to assume jurisdiction or, as the case may be, to exercise
             his jurisdiction to hold the inquest;
 and where a direction is given under this subsection directing a coroner to assume
jurisdiction, he, and not the coroner within whose district the body is lying, shall
have jurisdiction to hold the inquest and shall hold it accordingly.
   (4) Where jurisdiction to hold an inquest is assumed under this section, it shall
not be necessary to remove the body into the district of the coroner who is to hold
the inquest.
   (5) Any request made or agreement given, any application for a direction and
any direction under any o f the foregoing provisions o f this section shall be made
or given in writing.
   (6) Notice o f the making o f an application under subsection (2) above shall be
given to the coroner who declined to assume jurisdiction and notice o f the
direction given pursuant to such an application shall be given—
        (a) in a case where the direction is given to the coroner who made the
            application or the coroner w ho had notice o f it, to the other coroner;
            and
        (b) in a case where the direction is given to some other coroner, to the
            coroner who made the application and to the coroner who had notice
            o f it.
   (7) On the assumption by a coroner o f jurisdiction to hold an inquest under
this section, the coroner—
        (a) shall also assume, in relation to the body and the inquest, all the powers

   (1) Where a coroner is informed that the body o f a person is lying within his
district and there is reasonable cause to suspect that the person has died a sudden
death o f which the cause is unknown, the coroner may, if he is o f opinion that a
post-mortem examination may prove an inquest to be unnecessary—
        (a) direct any legally qualified medical practitioner whom, if an inquest
            were held, he would be entitled to summon as a medical witness under
            section 21 below; or
        (b) request any other legally qualified medical practitioner,
to make a post-mortem examination o f the body and to report the result of the
examination to the coroner in writing.
   (2) For the purposes o f a post-mortem examination under this section, the
coroner and any person directed or requested by him to make the examination
shall have the like powers, authorities and immunities as if the examination were
a post-mortem examination directed by the coroner at an inquest into the death of
the deceased.
   (3) Where a post-mortem examination is made under this section and the
coroner is satisfied as a result o f it that an inquest is unnecessary, he shall send to
the registrar o f deaths a certificate under his hand stating the cause o f death as
disclosed by the report o f the person making the examination.
   (4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as authorising the coroner to
dispense with an inquest in any case where there is reasonable cause to suspect that
the deceased—
        (a) has died a violent or an unnatural death; or
        (b) has died in prison or in such a place or in such circumstances as to
            require an inquest under any other Act.

  summons and the end o f the inquest, direct the medical witness to make a post­
  m ortem examination o f the body o f the deceased.
    (3) W here a person states upon oath before the coroner that in his belief the
 death of the deceased was caused partly or entirely by the improper or negligent
 treatment o f a medical practitioner or other person, that medical practitioner or
 other person shall not be allowed to perform or assist at the post-mortem
 examination o f the deceased.
  ,        in     case o f an inquest with a jury, a majority o f the jury are o f opinion

 medical practitioner or o f other witnesses brought before them, they may in
 writing require the coroner—           .
         (a) to summon as a witness some other legally qualified medical practitioner
              named by them ; and
         (b) to direct a post-mortem examination o f the deceased to be made by a
              practitioner summoned under this subsection, whether or not such an
              examination has been previously made;
and if the coroner fails to com ply with such a requisition, he shall be liable on
conviction on indictment to a term o f imprisonment not exceeding tw o years or
to a fine or to both.                                                      1
   (5)    Where a medical practitioner fails to obey a summons o f a coroner issued

22 R em oval o f body for post m ortem exam in ation
   (1) Subject to subsection (2) below, where by the direction or at the request of
a coroner, a post-mortem examination o f a body is to be made, the coroner may
order the removal o f the body to any place which may be provided for the purpose
either within his district or within an adjoining district o f another coroner.
   (2) A coroner shall not order the removal o f a body upon which a post-mortem
examination is to be made to any place other than a place within his district
provided by a local authority except with the consent o f the person or authority
by whom the place is provided.
   (3) The removal o f a body in pursuance o f an order made by a coroner under
this section to any place outside his district shall not affect his powers and duties in
relation to the body or the inquest into the death nor shall it confer or impose any
rights, powers or duties upon any other coroner.
   (4) Where a coroner—
        (a) orders under this section the removal o f a body to any place outside his
             district; and
        (ib)         does not authorise the disposal o f the body after examination,
he shall order the removal o f the body after examination to a place within his
district.
   (5) The expenses o f any removal ordered by a coroner under this section shall
be defrayed as part o f the expenses incurred by him in the course o f his duties.
   (6) In this section—
        “disposal” has the same meaning as in the 1953 Act;
        “local authority” means the council o f a district or London borough or the
             C om m on Council.

   G eneral N o te. The Coroners (Amendment) Act 1926, s 24(2), Vol 11, p 383, which is replaced
by sub-s (4) above, gave a coroner power, w hen he had ordered the removal o f a body to a place
outside his jurisdiction, to authorise the burial o f the body after examination, or, if he did not authorise
burial, to order the body to be removed to a place within his jurisdiction. S 24(3) o f that Act, Vol 11,
p 383, which is replaced by sub-s (3) above, stated that the removal o f a body by order o f a coroner
to a place outside his jurisdiction did not affect the coroner’s powers or duties concerning that body.
It was said by the Law Commission in their Report on the Consolidation o f the Coroners Acts 1887
to 1980 and certain related enactments (Law C om N o 167) (Cm 178) that the relationship between
s 24(2) and (3) o f the 1926 Act was not at all clear and that in order to clarify this the first lim b o f
s 24(2) should not be re-enacted and that the case for the second lim b should be stated in terms o f a
disposal by burial, cremation or any other means rather than simply a burial. Effect is given to this
recommendation in sub-s (4) above and by sub-s (6) above in so far as it applies the definition o f

the propriety o f holding the inquest (R v Carmarthenshire Justices (1847) 10 Q B 796), but it has been

29 Coroner o f the Q ueen’s household
    (1) The coroner o f the Queen’s household shall continue to be appointed by the
Lord Steward for the time being of the Queen’s household.
   (2) The coroner o f the Queen’s household shall have exclusive jurisdiction in
respect o f inquests into the deaths of persons whose bodies are lying—
         (a) within the limits of any of the Queen’s palaces; or
         (b) within the limits o f any other house where Her Majesty is then residing.
   (3) The limits o f any such palace or house shall be deemed to extend to any
courts, gardens or other places within the curtilage o f the palace or house but not
further; and where a body is lying in any place beyond those limits, the coroner
within whose district the body is lying, and not the coroner for the Queen’s
household, shall have jurisdiction to hold an inquest into the death.
   (4) The jurors on an inquest held by the coroner o f the Queen’s household shall
consist o f officers o f that household, to be returned by such officer o f the Queen’s
household as may be directed to summon the jurors by the warrant o f the coroner.

             Queen’s household.

   G eneral N o te. Sub-ss (2) and (3) above remove a possible ambiguity in the Coroners Act 1887
s 29(2), (4), Vol 11, p 366, regarding the extent o f the jurisdiction o f the Queen’s coroner. U nder
those provisions it could be argued that the coroner o f the Queen’s household only had jurisdiction in
respect o f an inquest into the death o f a person in one o f the Queen’s palaces if the Queen had been in
residence at the time o f the death. The Law Commission, in its Report on the Consolidation o f the
Coroners Acts 1887 to 1980 and certain related enactments (Law C om N o 167) (Cm 178),
recommended that this ambiguity be removed, and sub-ss (2) and (3) above take into account that
recommendation by om itting the words which gave rise to the ambiguity.

    Ref: AJC/
    While speaking to John Evans on third August he told me that Mr.
    Maplebeck (the DGM) at Sheffield had asked the Region Consultant
    with the District before putting in proposals in relation to the
    second phase of the Hillsborough Enquiry. He said that he (John
    Evans) thought this was sensible, in particular, because of the
    procedures for calling out medical teams by the police.

Date: 3 August, 1989
Matter: Hillsborough

Ref: AJC/
Miss           telephoned from the Home Office. She said that there
would b e t w o copies of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report
available for collection by us tomorrow at 9.30. They would be
ma r k e d "Final Revised" and they would be embargoed for
publication until 11 am. We can either collect these from the
Home Office, or from Committee Room 4 at Sheffield, but she
needed to know where we would collect them from. I told her that
we would collect them from Committee Room 4 at Sheffield Town
Hall. She asked who would be collecting the reports. I told her
it would be Mr.                She said that he should collect the
reports from Chief Superintendent Cornmill and must bring some
identification with him.



I telephoned John Evans, but he was not available and I left a
message for him to ring me back. He had rung me earlier in the
day in relation to the publication of the Hillsborough report and
I had told him that I would contact him once I knew of the
details of publication.

Dear John,
Hillsborough Inquiry
Thank you for your letter of 1 August. I return the account duly
receipted, together with a credit note in the sum of £38.50 plus
VAT. I imagine that the error in the account arises from a typing
mistake, because Andrew Chappell's time ought probably to have
been 19.5 hours.


Yours sincerely,


A.J. CALLAGHAN

                      Dear Sir,
                      Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
                      Our clients: Trent RHA/SYMAS
                      We refer to paragraph 105 of Lord Justice Taylor's interim
                      report, the last sentence of which is:
                                   "They had one ambulance outside the ground and one on
                                   standby."

                      We believe that there has been a printing error and that the
                      sentence should be:
                                   "They had one                           ambulance inside the ground and one on
                                   standby."

                      We would be grateful if an appropriate correction could be made
                      and suggest that the most convenient way to do this would be in
                      an appendix or addendum to the final report. Could you please
                      draw this request to the attention of Lord Justice Taylor and
                      then inform us of his intentions.


                       Yours faithfully,

                   Dear Sir,
                   Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
                   Our clients: Trent RHA/SYMAS
                   We refer to paragraph 105 of Lord Justice Taylor's interim
                   report, the last sentence of which is:
                                 "They had one ambulance outside the ground and one on
                                 standby."

                    We believe that there has been a printing error and that the
                    sentence should be:
                                 "They had one                           ambulance inside the ground and one on
                                 standby."

                    We would be grateful if an appropriate correction could be made
                    and suggest that the most convenient way to do this would be in
                    an appendix or addendum to the final report. Could you please
                    draw this request to the attention of Lord Justice Taylor and
                    then inform us of his intentions.

                       Dear Don,
                       Hillsborough Inquiry
                       I hope that you have now had a chance to see Lord Justice
                       Taylor's interim report which adopts most of our recommendations.

                       I was in London on Friday and bought a copy of the Evening
                       Standard on the way home. I enclose a photocopy of the front
                       page. You will see that at the top of the second column it states
                       "Everyone except the emergency services comes out badly."

                       As far as recommendations 35 to 38 are concerned you may now feel
                       it appropriate to review the emergency plans with the police,
                       fire service and the clubs, using the SYMAS plans as a basis for
                       discussion.
                        I should be grateful if, as a matter of urgency, you could let me
                        know whether there are any representations that you would like to
                        make to phase II which we did not make in phase I.

                        Finally you will have noticed an error in paragraph 105 of the
                        interim report and I enclose a copy of a letter which I have to
                        today sent to the Secretary to The Inquiry.


                        Yours sincerely,

Dear Michel,
Hillsborough Inquiry
I enclose a copy of the Interim report together with a copy of a
letter which I have sent to Mr. Whalley w h i c h is self
explanatory.
Mr. Mapplebeck (who, as you know, is now the DGM at Sheffield)
has requested that the Region consult him before putting in
proposals to Phase II of The Inquiry. His principal concern is
apparently related to the calling out of medical teams by the
police.
I had thought that there would not be anything to add to our
Phase I recommendations, but in view of Mr. Mapplebeck's request
I have asked Don Page to let me know if he has anything more to
add, and I will probably speak to you later this week.

Yours sincerely,



A.J. CALLAGHAN

Dear Sir,
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
Our clients: Trent RHA/SYMAS
We refer to paragraph 105 of Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report, the last sentence of which is:
       "They had one ambulance outside the ground and one on
       standby."

We believe that there has been a printing error and that the
sentence should be:
       "They had one ambulance inside the ground and one on
       standby."

We would be grateful if an appropriate correction could be made
and suggest that the most convenient way to do this would be in
an appendix or addendum to the final report. Could you please
draw this request to the attention of Lord Justice Taylor and
then inform us of his intentions.


Yours faithfully,
AJC/

Dear Don,

Hillsborough Inquiry
I hope that you have now had a chance to see Lord Justice
Taylor's interim report which adopts most of our recommendations.
I was in London on Friday and bought a copy of the Evening
Standard on the way home. I enclose a photocopy of the front
page. You will see that at the top of the second column it states
"Everyone except the emergency services comes out badly."
As far as recommendations 35 to 38 are concerned you may now feel
it appropriate to review the emergency plans with the police,
fire service and the clubs, using the SYMAS plans as a basis for
discussion.
I should be grateful if, as a matter of urgency, you could let me
know whether there are any representations that you would like to
make to phase II which we did not make in phase I.
Finally you will have noticed an error in paragraph 105 of the
interim report and I enclose a copy of a letter which I have to
today sent to the Secretary to The Inquiry.


Yours sincerely,


A.J. CALLAGHAN

TO: AGC,
FROM: AJC
DATE: 7 AUGUST, 1989.

SUBJECT: HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY


     I have spoken today to John Evans, the Regional Legal
Adviser at Trent who tells me that Trent and SYMAS are very
pleased indeed with the result of Phase I of the Hillsborough
Inquiry and with the manner in which the matter has been handled.


     He specifically mentioned that the way in which witnesses
were interviewed and statements were prepared is greatly
appreciated. Many SYMAS personnel have said that they found it
helpful to discuss their experiences in some detail with someone
who was sympathetic.
     Trent and SYMAS had expected to receive criticism from NUPE
and COHSE, the health service unions, for "pestering" the
ambulancemen; instead they have received praise for the way in
which the unions' members were treated, which helped considerably
with the counselling of the ambulancemen.
ATTENDANCE NOTE

MATTER:   TRENT REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY
           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

DATE:     3RD AUGUST 1989

]




I telephoned Mr            the Assistant Treasury Solicitor, to
inquire as to what to do with the two cassette tapes which deal
with the South Yorkshire Police's control room records between
1449 and 1609.     I was advised by Mr          1 to return the
cassette tapes to the West Midlands Police.
I then enquired of Mr        1 as to whether we were to receive a
copy of Lord Justice Taylor's interim report prior to
publication, bearing in mind the information that I had just
received which indicated that the report was to be published on
Friday 4th August.   Mr          informed me that, as is practice
in all public inquiries, the treasury solicitors do not provide
copies of such documents.     His advice was simply to obtain a
copy of the interim report from HMSO as quickly as possible.

Dear Sirs,
HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
OUR CLIENTS: TRENT REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY

Upon perusal of the large    number of documents and papers which
we have collected during    the course of this inquiry, we have
come across two cassette    tapes which record the events taking
place at South Yorkshire    Police Headquarters between 1449 and
1609 hours.
The cassette tapes were actually loaned to ourselves at the
request of our Counsel, Michel Kallipetis QC.   We take this
opportunity to return both cassette tapes and should be
grateful if you could acknowledge safe receipt.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Don,

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
Andrew and I have now had the opportunity to sift through all
documentation corrected in relation to this inquiry, and we
have come across a number of documents which we would like to
return to you.
I understand that you are seeing Andrew some time next week,
and so Andrew will take the opportunity to hand the relevant
documents back to you at that time.
I understand that you still retain two videos in relation to
the inquiry and perhaps you can arrange to collect the same and
hand them over to Andrew when you meet next week.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Eason rang.   He had received a telephone call from Hammond
Suddards to inform them that it would not be necessary for them
to attend Court in Manchester next week.       Ap parent ly some
agreement has been reached whereby their statements will be read
out.   He will ensure that Paddy Higgins and Lawrence Yoxall are
informed. He will also tell Roger Morley.

NOTE OF A MEETING AT FOUNTAIN PRECINCT

Attended by:

AJC

Roger Morley
Lawrence Yoxall

I went through the matter with Mr Yoxall and explained to him the
same points that I had explained earlier in the week to Paddy
Higgins and Paul Eason.   I also discussed the position generally
with Roger Morley.   He asked if it was likely that any other
civil proceedings would be commenced and I told him that I
thought that it was extremely unlikely.
I said I would be in touch with him as soon as I learnt anything
further in relation to the inquests.

             Dear Sirs
             Hillsborough - Civil Contribution Proceedings
             Our Clients: SYMAS
             We refer to your facsimiles of 28th September addressed to our
             clients and to our conversation of yesterday with         I
             We are instructed that Mr Higgins, Mr Eason and Mr Yoxall will
             attend on a voluntary basis to give evidence.
             We confirm that the three witnesses are generally available
             during the week commencing 8th October 1990.   Having said that,
             however, it is important that they be given as much notice as
             possible of when they are required, not only for their own
             convenience, but also to minimise the disruption to the ambulance
             service.
             The witnesses will travel together to and from Manchester and,
             therefore, arrangements should be made for them all to give
             evidence on the same morning or afternoon.
             We should be grateful if you could liaise with Mr Morley of SYMAS
             to make the appropriate arrangements.    If you need to speak to
             him outside normal hours his home telephone number is 0709
             545161, alternatively he can be paged or contacted on his car
             phone by SYMAS control.

                               ATTENDANCE NOTE


    FILE:            TRENT - HILLSBOROUGH

    DATE:            2 OCTOBER 1990

    ATTENDING:       ROGER MORLEY
                                                               AJC/

    Roger Morley came into the office with Paul Eason and Paddy
    Higgins.
    Mr Morley said that Yoxall had said that he did not want to
    attend Court and would not do so.     I explained the nature and
    effect of a subpoena. I told him that if we did not say that the
    witnesses would attend voluntarily, then Alan Suddard ought to
    arrange for personal service of the subpoenas upon the witnesses
    and that failure to attend, following service of the subpoena,
    was a contempt of Court.   I said that, in some circumstances, it
    was possible to apply for a subpoena to be set aside but that I
    was satisfied that that could not happen in this case.

    Mr Yoxall's unwillingness to attend the ground arose out of his
    view that the Police were not at all co-operative on the day of
    the Hillsborough disaster.   I explained that that was wholly
    irrelevant.
    We agreed that Roger Morley would come and see me with Mr Yoxall
    on Thursday, 4 October at 10.00 a.m.   He would also speak to Mr
    Yoxall and will ring me later this afternoon to let me know
    whether or not he is going to agree to attend voluntarily.    We
    agreed that if Yoxall did not say he would attend voluntarily,
    then I should tell Hammond Suddards that Eason and Higgins would
    come voluntarily but we could not say the same for Mr Yoxall.

    I explained that it appeared to me that the evidence which they
    would be asked to give would relate to what they saw happen on
    the day of the disaster but would not include anything relating
    to the activities of the ambulance service.     I said that this
    seemed obvious to me because the three witnesses who had been
    called were the three who were at the ground from the very start.

    I explained that as they were witnesses, and not parties to the
    litigation, they were not entitled to any legal representation as
    such.   I said that we could arrange for someone to attend Court
    with them but there seemed to me to be no point.      I said they
    would not be "defended" by Hammond Suddards but they should be
    looked after by them as it was Hammond Suddards who were calling
    them to give evidence.
     ■


We agreed that arrangements for them to attend should be made
through Roger Morley who gave me his home telephone number (I
      |). I said I would try to persuade Hammond Suddards to give
us as much notice as possible of when they would be called to
give evidence.
I also said that there was still a possibility that they would
not actually be called because Sheffield Wednesday FC's refusal
to agree the statement would have been a knee jerk reflex, before
they had had the opportunity to consider the matter in more
detail.   I said it was certainly possible that the two parties
would agree that an edited version of the statements or
transcripts from the Taylor enquiry would be put in instead.

I gave Eason and Higgins copies of the transcripts of their
evidence to the Taylor enquiry and gave Roger Morley a copy of
the transcript of Yoxall's evidence.  I said that there would be
minor differences between the statements and the transcripts and
that they should have a look through them to consider these. □
        | went through some of the differences between the
statements and transcripts.
I told them that if they were questioned upon any of these
discrepancies, then it was perfectly reasonable for them to say
that the statement had been drafted over a period of weeks and
they had considerable opportunity to consider the matters which
had gone into the statements whereas, when giving evidence, they
had not had a lot of time to consider their replies and where
there were minor discrepancies, the statements were more likely
to be correct.
We agreed that if, after having been through the transcripts,
there were any points which they wanted to discuss, then we could
arrange to talk over the telephone or in a meeting.



Roger Morley asked for a transcript of the evidence given by all
of the witnesses and I said that I would let him have these when
I saw him on Thursday.
They said that they still had videos and photographs and other
materials relating to the disaster which they wanted to use for
training purposes and for which they had received requests from
other ambulance authorities, also for training purposes.    Roger
Morley said that when they had last asked the Coroner's office if
these materials could be used for this purpose, the answer had
been no because the matter was subjudice.    That had been before
the DPP had decided not to pursue any prosecution.    I said that
it seemed to me that I could not see any good reason for not
being allowed to use those materials for training purposes now
but they should speak to the Coroner's office again to see
whether they expressed any opinion.

Hillsborough - Civil Contribution Proceedings

As you may know, we represent the Chief Constable of; South Yorkshire
in civil proceedings which are currently being taken against
$hci:field Wednesday Football Club and Messrs, Eastwood And l’artners
arising out of the Hillsborough stadium disaster. Three of your
Officers, namely, Messrs. Higgins, Eason and Yoxall have been named
on our list of witnesses, on the basis of the statements which they
submitted to the Taylor Inquiry.
The trial is due to commence in Manchester on Tuesday, 2nd October,
with n six week time estimate.
Unless one of: the Defendants requires these witnesses to Attend,
their statements will be read out and there will be no need for them
to appear at Court. At present, Messrs, Eastwood and Partners have
indicated that, they do not require these Officers to attend but,
unfortunately, we have not, yet heard from the Club.

Whilst we would imagine that their evidence will be able to be read,
w<s have had to take the precaution ©£ issuing Subpoenas, of which we
are sending copies herewith, and we shall be grateful for your
confirmation that these Officers will attend voluntarily to give
evidence, if need be, without the need for formal service of
^ U b p o o n a .o   .

                                                                                                                         /... contd.

   The cours^of the/trl>il is not easy' to predict, but the likelihood
   is that^hey would-be called (if at all) during the week commencing
   Monday; 8th October. We would not expect more than half a day in
   Court: to be involved./
   A reply by return wjj^ld be appreciated/ together with a telephone

I rang John Evans.     He is on holiday but I spoke to his
assistant, Mrs         . I told her of the subpoenas which had
been received and I said I could see no basis on which to object
to them but I wanted to know what the general policy was.    She
said she understood, from a previous conversation with John
Evans, that there is no general policy to try to object to
subpoenas in cases where they did not think they could be
challenged.
I then rang Mrs |        1 at Hammond Suddards and I asked her
whether the witnesses would be examined on the basis of their
statements to the Taylor inquiry or to the evidence which they
actually gave. She said that they would be examined by reference
to both the statements and the transcripts of their actual
evidence. I told her that it was likely that I would be able to
confirm to her that it was not necessary to have the subpoenas
personally served but I also told her that it would be helpful if
arrangements could be made for all three witnesses to attend on a
specific day.   She said they would try to do this as far as
possible but they may only be able to give notice on the day
before the three are required to attend.     She said that they
understood that they would have to pay the costs involved in
arranging for other people to fulfil the duties of the three
witnesses and that she had previously discussed this with Don
Page.
I then had a further three conversations with Roger Morley.     I
told him that the witnesses should attend Court and that I did
not think it necessary for them to be accompanied by anybody from
DLB&P.   We agreed that the three of them (if they are all
available) will come into the office on 2nd October at 10.00 a.m.
with Roger Morley for me to explain the procedures.     I said I
would give them copies of the transcripts of their evidence to
the Taylor inquiry and that they should compare these against
their statements because, if there were minor discrepancies,
these might be drawn to their attention at the trial.           I
explained that the proceedings were contribution proceedings in
which the police were seeking to argue that Sheffield Wednesday
F.C. and Eastwood & Partners were, at least, partly to blame and
should therefore contribute towards any successful claims made
against the police.

Roger Morley telephoned.     They had received subpoenas for
Higgins, Eason and Yoxall to attend the trial at the High Court
in Manchester which is due to start tomorrow.    They had been
asked to attend at some stage during the week commencing 8th
October for half a day each.
He will fax copies of the subpoenas through to me.

He said that Don Page thought it would be helpful if I could
speak to each of the three to inform them what was involved. He
also wanted my view as to whether or not they should be
accompanied.

Dear Sir
Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough Disaster
Our Clients:    Trent Regional Health Authority/South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service
We refer to recent correspondence.   We would wish to be present
for the re-opening of the Inquest and to be present when any
witnesses from the Ambulance Service give evidence.   In addition
we should like, if it is possible, to have advance notice if it
appears that any witness is likely to say anything which reflects
upon the Ambulance Service or its personnel, so that we can be
present when that evidence is given.
If you do intend that any Ambulance Personnel should give
evidence we should be grateful if you could let us have a list of
those proposed witnesses as soon as possible.   It would also be
helpful (if this is possible) for all those witnesses to be
called on the same day.

Yours faithfully

I spoke to John Evans.      He said that SYMAS have now been
transferred to Rotherham District Health Authority and so really
instructions should come from them but we agreed that I could
write to the Coroner to say that we did not wish any particular
individuals to be called but we would wish to be present for the
re-opening of the inquest as well as being present when any SYMAS
personnel were giving evidence and we would also like, if
possible, to have advance notice if any other witnesses were
likely to say anything relating to the conduct or involvement of
SYMAS.
He will speak to John Hinchcliffe (the District General Manager
at Rotherham) to arrange for me to have formal instructions and
he will notify Don Page of the position.

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only-limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
          attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
          names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
          to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

          I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
          submit

          Yours faithfullj

Dear John
Hillsborough - Inquests

I have now heard from the Coroner who informs me that the
inquests will be resumed on 19th November, and he wishes to know
whether you will wish to be represented at the resumed hearings.

The Coroner informs me that he has not yet decided precisely how
the inquests will proceed but he has said that it is quite
possible that he will be asking SYMAS personnel to give evidence.

Could you please let me know whether or not you would wish to be
represented at the resumed hearings.      You may consider it
appropriate for us to be present only when our own witnesses are
giving evidence.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

         You will probably be aware by now that I am resuming the Inquests into the
         deceased at Hillsborough on the 19th of November 1990.  I would be grateful
         if you could please let me know whether you will wish to be represented at
         the resumed hearings.

         I have not yet finalised my thinking on witnesses, but it is possible that I
         will be asking some members, particularly the South Yorkshire Metropolitan
         Ambulance Service to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.


         Yours faithfully,

Dear John

Hillsborough - Inquests

Following the announcement by the Director of Public Prosecutions
not to initiate any prosecutions I have written to the Coroner to
obtain information in relation to the inquests which will now
have to be re-convened.   It is quite possible that the families
of the deceased would wish to go into evidence in great detail at
the re-convened inquests and I have asked the Coroner if he has
received any indication that this is likely to happen.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Disaster - Our Clients:      Trent Regional Health
Authority/South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service

We assume that, following the decision of the Director of Public
Prosecutions not to prosecute anyone as a result of the
Hillsborough disaster, the inquests will be re-convened.      We
should be grateful if you could let us know the arrangements in
relation to the re-convened inquests.
It would also be helpful if you could let us know whether it is
anticipated that further detailed evidence will be called, or
whether it is likely that there will be little to add to the
evidence taken earlier this year.

Yours faithfully

Hillsborough - Inquests
I enclose, for your information a copy of a letter which I have

Dear John

Hillsborough - Inquests

I attended the first day of the Hillsborough Inquests and about
an hour of the second morning.
Most of the first day was spent by the Coroner explaining how he
intended to deal with the inquests, and evidence from the police,
the blood analyst and a pathologist of a general nature.      The
Coroner confirmed that no evidence would be called, no questions
allowed, which related to how the deaths had occurred (other than
the medical cause of deaths) or which involved criticism of any
individual or organisation.

The Coroner said that, despite what he had said at the "pre­
inquest review" he did not intend to circulate the case summaries
other than to the solicitors representing the families.

I, and a number of other lawyers, had informed the Coroner that
we intended to be present for the first day and then to attend
only the inquests where it appeared that something might arise
which was relevant to our clients.    I explained that, if I did
not have access to the summaries, it would be difficult to be
selective about which, if any, inquests to attend, and the
Coroner decided to make the summaries available after all but
stated that the evidence actually given may not correspond
exactly with the contents of the summaries.

Because of the preliminaries and the general evidence there was
only time for one inquest on the first day so I attended the
first three on the following morning (the Coroner intends to deal
with eight each day).

23 April 1990

In the ca se of e a c h of the      inquests   which   I attended   the
following evidence was called;

1.       The pathologist who carried out the post mortem gave the
         medical cause of death.
2.       The police officer who had been assigned to the particular
         fatality gave details of the information which he had
         obtained from witnesses, so far as it was available, of the
         deceased's movements from leaving home on 15th April 1989 to
         being received at the temporary mortuary at the gymnasium at
         Hillsborough; this was all hearsay evidence.
3.       The police officer who had examined photographs and video
         recordings gave details of each of the sightings of the
         deceased.
The Coroner confirmed that each of the inquests would follow this
pattern.  Each of the inquests was adjourned.

I have read the 95 case summaries and in each case where SYMAS
personnel are mentioned I have compared the contents of the
summary against our statements and the two are consistent.  In
fact the references to SYMAS personnel appear to be based upon
the statements which we took.
The solicitor representing the families of the deceased has
informed me that he has no questions to put which relate to SYMAS
involvement.
In the circumstances, unless something new arises,           I do not
intend to attend any more of the inquests.

I am sending a copy of this letter to Don Page.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
Hillsborough Disaster
Our Clients: Trent Regional Health Author!ty/South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service

Thank you for your letter of 3rd April, the contents of which we
note. Would it be possible for us to collect copies of the case
summaries early in the afternoon of the day before each of the
Inquests is to take place so that we can then decide whether or
not we should attend on the day of the Inquests to which those
summaries relate?

We have also received your letter of 9th April. Mr Callaghan and
Mrs        of this firm will attend on 18th April, and, where
appropriate, thereafter.

Yours faithfully

        Dear Sir or Madam,

        Re:   18th April 1990 - Interim Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough

        I am writing to inform you that the venue for the above will be the
        Memorial Hall, Barkers Pool, Sheffield, and we are scheduled to commence
        at 10.30 am.

        I anticipate that the second date, 19th April, will also be at that
        location but after the 19th, we plan to hold the Inquests at the Medico
        Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield.

        It would be appreciated if you would confirm to me as soon as possible
        whether you intend to be present on 18th April, and also let me have, if
        known, the name of the solicitor or Counsel who is representing your
        clients.

        Yours faithfully,

Bear Sirs,

Thank you for your letter of the 28th of March. There is one
problem with your letter and that is that I in fact do not
intend to circulate the case summaries prior to the Inquest
apart from sending them to the representatives of the bereaved.

I hope this will not inconvenience you too greatly.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Disaster
Our Clients:   Trent Regional Health Authority/South Yorkshire
Metropolitan Ambulance Service
We refer to the pre-inquest review which took place on 6th March,
at which you granted our clients representation.

At the review you indicated that the inquests would resume on
18th April in a limited form and that a timetable and case
summaries will be circulated in advance.    We look forward to
receiving the timetable and case summaries.

We write to inform you that we intend to attend the first day of
the resumed inquests, but thereafter we probably shall attend
those inquests where there is something in the case summaries
which suggests we should be present or where our clients
personnel are called to give evidence.         We hope this is
satisfactory.

Yours faithfully
   *

Dear Don

Hillsborough - Inquest
I attended a pre-inquest review last week with my colleague,
     (. I enclose a copy of      note of the review.

You will see that the inquests are to resume, in a limited form,
on 18th April.    I have agreed with John Evans that I should
attend on the first day,   largely to see what the format of the
inquests will be but that I will probably notattend    thereafter
unless there is anything in the case summaries which suggest that
we ought to be present, or unless any SYMAS personnel are called
to give evidence.
I should be grateful if you could let me know if       any SYMAS
personnel are requested to attend the inquest.

Yours sincerely

Police Force

The Coroner introduced Mervyn Jones who is the Assistant Chief
Constable of the West Midlands Police. He is to act as Coroner's
Officer.
The Coroner explained that the purpose of this meeting was to
explain to all interested parties his proposals in relation to
resuming the inquests and to get confirmation from the legal
representatives of the various interested parties that what he
was proposing was an acceptable way forward.
The Coroner said that he had had preliminary discussions with Mr
Fraser and Hammond Suddards about this matter and that the
meeting indicated that they thought it would be helpful to resume
the inquests.
The Coroner stressed that the fact that the meeting was being
held and that he was thinking of resuming the inquests did not
mean that the DPP had informed him of any decisions or indeed,
taken any decisions.    He emphasised that the DPP has not
notified him of any decision that he might be taking in this
matter.
 V
He said that the Coroner's Officer had in fact advised him that
the DPP was not yet able to take a decision as all the paperwork
had not yet been delivered to him such that he was not yet in a
position to consider the evidence.

The Coroner said that subject to any representations that may be
made at the meeting, it was his intention to resume the inquests
shortly after Easter. He said there was no magic in the timing.
It was just a convenient time to resume.       He said that the
present time schedule for the submission of papers to the DPP was
such that if the inquests were resumed after Easter, the papers
would not yet have been submitted in full to the DPP.     He said
that he was stressing this because he did not want people to
think that something was going on which he was not letting on.
This is not the case.   He said that his reason for revising his
opinion as to the possibility of resuming the inquests was
because he had received a letter from Miss        of the Steering
Committee and also a letter from Hammond Suddards.     In view of
those letters, he considered that it was appropriate to
reconsider his earlier decision not to deal with the inquests
until the DPP had made a decision. He said that there were clear
advantages to the bereaved families in resuming the hearing.

The Coroner said that there were three possible scenarios for
dealing with the inquests
1.   Having considered all the paperwork and the evidence, the
     DPP decides to bring a prosecution for a major offence which
     falls under Section 16 of the Coroner's Act.    He said that
     the only offence relevant under Section 16 is corporate
     manslaughter.
     If the DPP decides to bring such a charge, then the
     procedure under Section 16 of the Coroner's Act requires him
     to adjourn the inquests sine die pending the outcome of the
     proceedings brought by the DPP.         At the end of the
     proceedings, he would then have an option to resume the
     inquests. He said that he has in practice never resumed an
     inquest which has been adjourned under Section 16 and
     therefore, it is quite possible that at the end of the day
     he would not do so in this case.
2.   Having considered all the paperwork and the evidence, the
      DPP decides to bring no prosecution but one or more persons
     decide to bring private prosecutions. The Coroner said that
      if that occurred, Section 16 of the Coroner's Act would
      apply with the same consequences as in 1. (above).

3.   Having considered all the paperwork and the evidence, the
      DPP decides to bring no prosecution and no third party wants
      to take proceedings. The result would be that the inquests
     would be resumed and completed within the ambit that the
      Coroner considered appropriate to the circumstances.
The Coroner said that if he were to resume the inquests before
the DPP had made any decision and if a Section 16 situation were
then to arise at a subsequent time, as soon as possible
thereafter, the inquests would be resumed but purely to comply
with Section 16. The inquests would then purely be a formality.
The Coroner said that following his reconsideration of his
earlier decision not to resume the inquests until the outcome of
the DPP's investigations, he had contacted the DPP to see if he
would agree to the inquests being resumed on a limited basis.
The Coroner said that he proposed that the inquests be resumed
only for the purposes of medical evidence (ie to ascertain the
alcohol levels of the deceased) and to find out where the various
individuals were at various stages and if possible, how the
individuals got to the stadium.
The Coroner emphasised that if the inquests were resumed, what he
would not do would be to decide how and why the deceased died and
who was to blame.   He said that so far as blame was concerned,
this in any event fell outside his jurisdiction.     The Coroner
said that he certainly did not want to deal with controversial
matters because:-
1.   The DPP would not agree to the inquests being resumed if
     controversial matters were dealt with or if any person/
     anybody were thereby attacked/criticised.
2.   It was not in the interests of justice to deal with matters
      which would impede the DPP's investigations or the scope of
      action which the DPP might want to take.
3.   He did not wish to prejudice the outcome of any        criminal
      proceedings which may be taken.   In any event, the   bereaved
      families would not wish him to do this.
The Coroner then once again emphasised that if the inquests were
resumed, they would be of a limited nature.     He said that the
resumed inquests would be designed to be non adversarial and the
object would be to present factual evidence and not to decide how
the deaths had occurred and who was to blame.
The Coroner then went on to deal with the way that he intended to
present the evidence if the inquests were resumed.
He said that the first thing that would be dealt with was the
post mortems. He said that he had originally intended to call a
pathologist to each of the individual inquests but he said that
there may be some individual cases where the post mortem finding
could be dealt with by way of documentary evidence.
He said that they would then deal with the alcohol level of the
various deceased. He said that all except one of the ninety five
deceased had had their alcohol levels investigated. He said that
Dr Forester who carried out the alcohol level investigations
 t?
would be present on day 1 of the resumed inquests to formally
prove his evidence for all of the ninety four deceased. However,
he said that if there was any individual case where the alcohol
level was controversial, he may then also be called at a later
date when that individual case was heard to prove his evidence.
He said that a mini inquest would be held for each of the ninety
five individuals who had died.
The West Midlands Police Force were preparing folders for each of
the deceased.   These were not yet complete because when the
disaster occurred, the first priority was to deal with the
deceased as individual human beings and allow their families to
take them away to bury them etc.   Then, Lord Justice Taylor was
appointed to carry out the enquiry and wanted to start quickly.
Therefore, a major effort was undertaken to service that public
enquiry.  At that stage, the Coroner said that he had said that
he would want all the necessary information before him in due
course but he did not insist that the information that he
required was put together first.    After the publication of the
interim report, the matter was then referred to the DPP and the
Coroner instructed all available manpower to assist the DPP. He
had realised that the preparation of the documentation that he
required would have to come later.
He said that the folder for each of the individuals would contain
a summary by one of the officers of the West Midlands Police
which will summarise factually the evidence of the various
witnesses.   He said that it was his intention to present that
summary to the court and to read the files for each individual.
He said that he intended to circulate the summaries before the
inquests so that the various legal representatives would have
copies and they would then be able to let him know if anything
contained in the summaries was not clear or needed elaboration.
Then, if necessary, the police officer who had prepared that
summary could be called or indeed the appropriate witness to read
the whole or part of his statement on that point.

The Coroner emphasised that under no circumstances, would any
officer of the South Yorkshire Police be called.  He said that
this was impossible bearing in mind the limitations he had
outlined.
He said that the officers of the West Midlands Force would
explain the identification procedures and would make use of plans
for the purposes of establishing where any particular person was
at a given moment.   He said that in view of legal difficulties,
it had been decided not to use video or photo/video stills.

Mr Fraser of the Steering Committee then asked the Coroner about
the timing of the issuing of the summaries.     He explained that
the solicitors representing the various families would want to go
through the summaries with their clients and will need time to
notify Mr Jones' officers of any questions that they have.
 J#
The Coroner said that he was well aware that the earlier the
summaries were released, the easier it would be.     However, he
asked Mr Fraser to bear in mind that he would need to read all of
the summaries first.   However, he assured Mr Fraser that the
summaries would be released as soon as possible.    He said that
that was the best that he could do.   He also asked Mr Fraser to
bear in mind the limitations he had previously outlined.       He
again emphasised that the summaries were designed purely to
present factual evidence.
Mr Fraser asked the Coroner how far in terms of time did he
anticipate that the summaries would go.

The Coroner said that the summaries would at least go up to the
point where the bodies were taken to the temporary mortuary but
probably up to the point of identification.     He said that the
objective of the summaries was to trace the whereabouts of each
individual from the time when he or she left home on that day to
the time when he or she was taken to the temporary mortuary.
The Coroner said that documents called Anacapes would be produced
at the inquests.   He said that these were in effect charts.   He
said that copies of these would be available at the inquests
although he did not expect that they would be able to circulate
them to the various legal representatives.

The Coroner again said that it would be unreasonable to expect Dr
Forester (who had carried out the alcohol level investigations)
to sit throughout the whole of the inquests.       Therefore, he
intended Dr Forester to attend on day 1 and formally prove his
evidence to the various legal representatives.
He said that Inspector Leyton and other officers of the West
Midlands Force would also be available on day 1 to explain the
codings that they had used on charts etc so that those present
would be able to understand the conventions used during the
inquests.
The Coroner said that he was also considering asking Professor
Usher to give an overview of the type of injury that occurred at
Hillsborough on day 1 so that if a pathologist was not then
present at an individual inquest, there had been a general
explanation of the injuries suffered by that individual.

The Coroner said that he was aiming to carry out eight individual
inquests per day.    He said that he did not wish to rush the
inquests because he did not wish that individual deceased's
family to think that the inquest of their family member was not
being dealt with properly. However, he said that he also had to
bear in mind that the jury would have to sit through the whole of
the inquests and this would undoubtedly place them under great
stress.
V
He said that so far as the order of the inquests was concerned,
this would not be done on a numerical nor alphabetical order. He
said that it would be carried out in pathologists' order.
However, he said that if more than one person had died in a
family unit, he would ensure that the inquests for the various
members of that family would be dealt with on the same day.

So far as the jury was concerned, he said that it had been his
initial intention to resume the limited inquests without a jury.
However, he said that he had reconsidered this and despite the
fact that at this stage, the jury will not have a lot do other
than to sit and listen, he thought that he had to have a jury
present.   He pointed out that an inquest is not an adversarial
procedure and that the function of the jury is to reach a
decision on the evidence which they hear in court.

The Coroner said that subject to representations, he intended to
hold the resumed inquests at the Medico Legal centre.    He said
that the proceedings would be transcribed but transcripts would
not necessarily be available on an next morning basis.   He said
that a fee would be payable for transcripts.

The Coroner then asked whether any person present at the meeting
objected to the inquests being resumed. There were no objections
and Mr Fraser of the Steering Committee congratulated the Coroner
(on behalf of the families) for having reconsidered his earlier
decision.

The Coroner said that he therefore intended to resume the
inquests on 18 April 1990 at 10.30 a.m..        Thereafter, the
inquests would start on each day at 9.30 a.m. with an hour for
lunch from 1.00 until 2.00 and then continuing until the inquests
had been completed for that day.   He said that he was aiming to
complete the inquests by 4 May 1990. However, he said that a few
days would be available from 21 May 1990 onwards if the inquests
needed to be resumed.
The Coroner pointed out that the press would be entitled to be
present at the resumed hearings.
AJC then asked the Coroner whether a formal application needed to
be made for representation.            He said that he would grant
representation to all the interested parties present at the
meeting.   He said that he had hesitated slightly as regards
granting representation to Trent RHA/SYMAS but took the view that
if AJC's clients thought that they were interested parties, he
h a d no d i f f i c u l t y w i t h that, and t h e r e f o r e g r a n t e d
representation.

Re             Hillsborough
Ref            AJC/


I telephoned John Evans. He was not there but he rang back later
on.  He had received my facsimile.    He said that Trent did want
to be represented although they would want to keep as low a
profile as possible and he asked me to attend the pre-inquest
review on 6th March.   He did not propose to come himself or to
arrange for anyone else to come along.

He asked that I contact SYMAS to let them know the position.




I rang SYMAS. Don Page was away on a course and I spoke to Alan
Hopkins.  I explained the position to him and said that I would
be in touch with them following the pre-inquest review to let
them know the position.

Dear John

The Hillsborough Disaster
I enclose a copy of a letter which I have received this morning
from the Coroner.  You will see that he intends to hold a "pre­
inquest review" on the afternoon of 6th March.

I suggest that you instruct me to attend the "pre-inquest review"
to seek representation at the inquest.    I would imagine that we
would wish to keep a low profile in the inquest but I think it
better that we be granted representation and ask only a fewa/%
questions rather than conduct a watching brief and have to seek
representation half way through the inquest.

I have not been in touch with SYMAS in relation to the inquest or
the Coroner's letter.

Could you please telephone me in relation to the matter.

Yours sincerely




A. J. CALLAGHAN

Dear Sir,

Re HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

As you will be aware from earlier correspondence, I had decided to
postpone my inquests into the deaths of the persons who died as a
result of this event until sometime after the Director of Public
Prosecution had announced his decision as to what actions if any he
might wish to take.
In the light of certain representations which have been made, I feel
that it may be possible prior to that event to resume the Inquests on a
strictly limited basis in order to take certain evidence relating to
the movement of individuals on 15th of April 1989, as well as the medical
cause of death.
It must be clearly understood that neither the form not the content of
the evidence will be such as could in any way impede or hinder the
investigation being /undertaken by the Director of Public Prosecutions
and/or which might reflect on the conduct of any person or persons
corporate or otherwise. This is the strict condition on which the ,
Director of Public Prosecutions would agree to such a limited inquest
taking place.
Prior to deciding whether it is possible to resume as aforesaid, I
think that it would be helpful if a "pre inquest review" were held.
The intention of this hearing would be to elaborate the contents of
this letter, to deal with any questions of representations, to consider •
administrative matters, to listen to any proposals or suggestions
from legal representatives and to deal with any other matters regarding
the conduct of the inquests which I may feel is appropriate at the time.
The date for this review has been fixed for the 6 th of March at 2p.m.
at the Medico Legal Centre. Watery Street. Sheffield.
Following this review? I will announce whether it is possible to resume
the Inquests on the basis described and to announce the date for such
resumption. For your prior information, it is my present intention,that
subject to being satisfied that the objectives outlined can be achieved
to resume very shortly after Easter.
I understand of course that representation in respect of the large
majority of the deceased will be co-ordinated through the Steering
Committee. In order however to ensure as far as possible that all
parties are aware of what is going on, I am arranging for this letter
to be sent to each firm of solicitors who are on the record with me.
In addition, I am also sending a copy of this letter to those solicitors
of whom I am aware who were represented before Lord Justice Taylor's
Inquiry.
I would be grateful if addressees would let me know as soon as possible
if they wish to attend.

Dear Michel

Hillsborough Disaster

I enclose, for your information, a copy of Lord Justice Taylor's
final Report.   I was surprised at the reference to the Scottish
Ambulance Service in paragraph 230 as Lord Justice Taylor was
certainly aware of the SYMAS major incident vehicle and I had
understood that he had actually inspected it.

Best Wishes.

Yours sincerely

   attending Roger Morley of South Yorkshire Ambulance Service
on the telephone.  He asked if it was possible to obtain a copy
of Lord Justice Taylor's Report today (Friday).   I said it was
very unlikely as it was not being released until Monday but I
told him to give f ''      ' _'   a ring as he was taking steps
to secure a copy.




                  rang later.   He says we can pick up a copy of
the Report from Sheffield Town Hall from 3.45 onwards on Monday.
We should go to Committee Room 4 - a                  |is handing
them out and       [ has told him that AJC will be collecting a
copy.

Roger Morley is going to ring AJC on Monday morning to make
arrangements to collect a copy of the Report from here as
apparently there is a Press Conference at 12 noon the following
day (Tuesday) and he wants to be able to read the Report before
that.

Dear Don,

Hillsborough Inquiry

I am writing to let you know that I am moving to this firm's
Sheffield office with effect from 1st November.

I have written to The Secretary to the Hillsborough Inquiry to
notify Lord Justice Taylor that we have nothing to add to our
earlier submissions save that he should consider extending his
recommendations relating to emergency services and first aid to
any major sporting occasion and large public gatherings.
Yours sincerely.

Our clients have no submissions to make to Part II of the
Inquiry, which would not be more than a repetition of the
submissions for Part I, save to make the general point that
co ns i d e r a t i o n should be given to extending many of the
recommendations relating to the emergency services and first aid
contained in the Interim Report to apply to other major sporting
occasions and certain large gatherings of people, such as pop
concerts.
We acknowledge receipt of your letter of 24th October and note
its contents.

Alan Hopkins from SYMAS telephoned.        He said that he had
received a request from Inspector Layton of West Midlands Police
who is assisting the Coroners Office to interview 17 ambulance
men. He wants to see them purely in order to trace the movement
of bodies from Hillsborough to the hospital and back again and
then on to the Medico Legal Centre.    Alan Hopkins will arrange
for David Jones to be present during all of the interviews and I
said that I agreed that was the best way to deal with the matter.
I told him that if any problems arose during the interviews then
he should contact me.

I telephoned              I.  She said she understood that all
parties had agreed that there were no further representations to
make to the Taylor Inquiry but she wanted to check a point with
Sheffield District Health Authority and ring me back.


She rang back and confirmed there was nothing further to do in
respect of the Taylor Inquiry and there were no submissions to be
made to Part II.

She said that there is to be a meeting between the District,
SYMAS and the police to discuss, and improve procedures.      She
understood that Diane Hallett was involved in that in someway but
did not know why.   I told her that I didn't think there was any
need for me to be involved unless someone had a particular reason
for wishing me to do so.

Dear Sirs


HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
YOUR CLIENTS: TRENT RHA/SYMAS

Thank you for your letter of 25 September regarding paragraph 105
of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report and the positioning of
ambulances.

Lord Justice Taylor has considered the points you have made but
does not consider it appropriate to make any reference to the
matter in the Final Report, which will deal with the wider issues
of crowd control and safety at sports grounds. In any case, as
you say, it is clear to all the parties concerned with the
Inquiry exactly where the ambulances were positioned and it
therefore seems unnecessary to pursue the point further.

                                            Yours faithfully

I telephoned                in response to a message to do so. She
said that she    had received a copy of a memo from John Evans to
Dr. Alderslade   and Mr Kenny about Hillsborough and she was going
to speak both    to Mr           (Mr Mapplebeck's assistant) and to
Mr Page to see   what they wanted to do about Part II.

I told her that I had discussed the matter with Don Page in the
past and we both agreed that there was nothing further that we
needed to say to the Inquiry at Part II and that any other
matters that arose were probably better dealt with in Trent's
internal inquiry.

I told her that I needed instructions one way or the other as
soon as possible.   If we were not going to do anything further
then I should inform the Home Office of that but if we were to
make further submissions then we had to deal with the matter
quickly.

She would speak to Mr                and Mr Page and let me have
instructions as soon as possible.

I telephoned Don Page.   We discussed part 2 of the Inquiry.   We
agreed that all the matters of any interest or concern to SYMAS
had been included in part 1 and there was nothing extra that he
wanted to say in part 2.    I said that I would be suggesting to
John Evans that we don't make any recommendations for part 2 and
that any outstanding matters be dealt with within Trent's own
internal inquiry, including comments made by Jim Wardrope which I
did not go into with Don Page in any detail.    I told him that I
anticipated that the final report would include a recommendation
relating to the provision of first aid facilities and ambulances
at all major sporting events.

I telephoned John Evans.   I told him of my conversation with Don
Page and said that we felt that it was not necessary to say
anything at all for part 2.     I told him of the contents of Mr
Wardrope's submissions which had been sent direct to Lord Justice
Taylor but I said I thought it unlikely that Lord Justice Taylor
would take much account of those submissions in the absence of
formal submissions from us.    He will speak to Mr      ' ^ Dr.
Alderslade, and Don Page to decide what they want to do about
part 2.    He asked that I send him a copy of Mr Wardrope's
submission. I said I would do so.

Dear Sir


Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
Our clients - Trent Regional Health Authority/SYMAS


Thank you for your letter of 14 September.
We have considered the evidence given by Mr Higgins on day 24
of the Inquiry, as set out on pages 35 & 36 of the transcript
for day 24.
We believe it is clear to all parties concerned with the
Inquiry that on the occasions of the 1988 and 1989 semi­
finals, in addition to the 4 SYMAS Officers inside the ground,
the ambulance in which they travelled was located between the
Spion Kop and the North Stand as indicated on the enclosed
plan.    This was made clear by Mr Higgins on page 35 of the
transcript for day 24 when Mr Goldsack requested Mr Higgins to
identify the position of his ambulance at the 1988 semi-final.
Mr Higgins then proceeded to confirm the same arrangements for
the 1989 semi-final on page 36 of the transcript.
As you quite rightly point out in paragraph 3 of your letter
of 14 September, Mr Higgins appears to have used the
expressions "outside" and "inside" the ground to cover the
same description i.e. the area between the Penistone Road
entrance and the ramp leading to the pitch between the Spion
Kop and North Stand.
Our only worry concerns a possible misunderstanding by any
         2

25 September, 1989



member of the general public who reads the report as to the
location of the ambulance if they simply read Lord Justice
Taylor's interim report without having had sight of the
evidence given by Mr Higgins to the Inquiry.     For the most
part Lord Justice Taylor has regarded the area within the
curtilage of the stadium, rather than simply the pitch area,
as being inside the ground.    Bearing this point in mind we
would be grateful if the location of the ambulance at the
1989 semi-final could be clarified either by use of the word
"inside" in place of "outside", or by specifically referrring
to its position being between the Spion Kop and the North
Stand.


Yours faithfully

I telephoned Don Page in response to a message to do so. He said
that a DC        land Sgt           of West Midlands police were
seeking further statements from Ray Clarke and Mr           (who
had partnered             |). We agreed that they would tell the
police that if they had any further questions which they wanted
to ask we would like to know what topics they want to discuss,
but if we did agree to further meetings then it may be sensible
for myself or   H to be present.
I said it was possible that the police simply wanted statements
on the Section 9 forms in which case the statements could simply
be retyped and signed.

I telephoned him again in response to a message to do so. He had
spoken to the police and told them to make any requests to see
his staff through Ambulance Headquarters. He wanted to know the
names of the police officers to whom we had handed over
documents, I told him I thought it was Superintendent Chidley.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
YOUR CLIENTS: TRENT RHA/SYMAS


Thank you for your fax of 7 August in which you draw attention to
paragraph 105 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report. I fear
that the question whether the reference to the ambulance being
outside or inside the ground is not as simple as you suggest.
There has been no printing error. Lord Justice Taylor was guided
by the evidence given by Mr Higgins (Day 24 pages 35 and 36).
You will see that in the course of questioning Mr Higgins was not
asked specifically where the ambulances were at the 1989 semi­
final: there was a detailed description of the 1988 semi-final
and those arrangements were said to have "occurred" this year
also.

In the account of the 1988 semi-final, Mr Higgins said first that
there was an ambulance outside the ground, in an area between the
Spion Kop and the north stand, close to the gymnasium (contrasted
with the four SYMAS officials inside the ground). A few lines
later, however, Mr Higgins agreed with a description of the
arrangements in 1988 as an ambulance inside, with a second one on
standby nearby.

That seems to be where the difficulty has arisen. Mr Higgins
seems to have used the expression outside and inside the ground
to mean the same. Presumably, however, there is no doubt in his
mind where the ambulance was located. In other contexts, Lord
Justice Taylor has indeed regarded the area within the curtilage
of the ground, rather than the playing area and viewing areas, as
"inside" the ground.
I should be grateful if you could look through the transcript and
confirm our understanding of what Mr Higgins was saying, and
whether you agree with us as to how the difficulty has arisen.

Date:         17 August 1989

Matter:       Trent RHA - Hillsborough Inquiry

Ref:          AJC/SO'C

I telephoned Don Page in response to a message to do so. He said
that he had been asked to give a talk to the Lincolnshire
Ambulance Service and he wondered if there were any problems
relating to questions of sub-judice as a result of the
investigations which have recently been announced.    I told him
that nobody had been charged with anything and there was
therefore no problem with sub-judice and, in any event, I
presumed he would be talking purely about ambulance service
involvement and not about the conduct of anybody else.        He
confirmed that was the case and I told him that, in any event,
there could therefore not be any problem.

DATE: 9 August

SUBJECT: Hillsborough Enquiry


I have booked a table for lunch at La Grillade for all of us plus
Mr. Kallipetiks at 1.00 pm. on Friday, 18 August. I have to
confirm the numbers with the restaurant a couple of days
beforehand and I should be grateful if you could confirm your
availability.
    suggested that we should all have lunch at the firm's expense
as a result of his seeing my note of 7 August.

SUBMISION TO THE JUDICIAL ENQUIRY INTO THE MAJOR
INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM ON 15TH APRIL 1989.


     The best way to save lives in a major incident
is to prevent it occurring. However it is a sad
fact that accidents continue to occur and
occasionally they are on a huge scale as in the
case of the Hillsborough tragedy. I will not touch
on the topic of accident prevention as this is the
remit of part 1 of the judicial enquiry. However it
is obvious that steps will have to be taken to
lessen the chance of such an incident occurring in
the future.

     As the Consultant in Accident and Emergency
Medicine in the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield
I was deeply involved in the initial care of the
victims of the incident. I have also taken a keen
interest in the response of the hospital to the
incident and the progress of the patients involved.

Provision of medical equipment and personnel at
              sporting events

     Much has been said and written about the level
of equipment and medical provision at Hillsborough
stadium.
     Some stadia such as Wembly appear to provide
trained health professionals to cover the large
events (1).
     There is good evidence that the provision of
life support equipment can save lives in this
setting (2).
     It is my opinion that if staff are trained and
used to dealing with small scale emergencies as at
Brighton and Hove Albion (2) then in the event of a
disaster of the magnitude of Hillsborough then there
is much more chance of co-ordinated, effective
action.

     There would be little point is stockpiling
large amounts of equipment in all large stadia
throughout the country. This would lie in a cupboard
and deteriorate and when the next incident occurred
it would not be effective.

     There is great merit in the regular provision
at large sporting events of health professionals
whose everyday work is dealing with emergencies.
     Most ambulance services have advanced trained
officers who are skilled in advanced life support.
Many senior Accident and Emergency nursing staff
have similar skills. Many doctors may not have the
necessary recent experience in emergency techniques
but members of such immediate care schemes as
B.A.S.I.C.S. do have this training and many hospital
doctors specifically anaesthetists and accident and
emergency medicine specialists will have day to day
experience of emergencies. From this pool of
expertise suitable medical cover for large events
could be arranged. THIS WILL COST MONEY.

     In the incident at Hillsborough there was a
lack of basic life support equipment. Much has been
said of the lack of a defibrillator. In my opinion
this would not have helped in this incident.(However
the Brighton experience shows it is valuable in the
"everyday" type emergency.)
     Almost all the deaths were due to traumatic
asphyxia, the victims could not breathe. Many of
them inhaled their own vomit. Life support is based
on the management of the ABCs; Airway, Breathing and
Circulation.
     Airway    In the Hillsborough incident this was
a major problem. The single most important treatment
of the injured as they arrived in hospital was the
passage of a tube into the windpipe. This allowed
oxygen to be given in high concentrations but
equally important kept vomit out of the lungs.
               This manoeuvre requires
specialised equipment and a skilled person
(advanced trained ambulance man, anaesthetist or
A&E specialist)..
                There is little point having such
equipment at a sports stadium without the personnel
to use it.
           There are simpler airway management
techniques such as the brook airway, self inflating
bags ect. These would have been of some assistance
at Hillsborough but the problem of inhalation of
vomit would have remained
BREATHING
          Most of the points about breathing are the
same as for airway.

CIRCULATION
           In most major accidents the major need of
the circulation care is the provision of adequate
 replacement of any blood loss. Obviously blood
cannot be used in this situation but there are other
intravenous fluids which can be used out of
hospital. Again the siting of intravenous
canullae requires training and skill.
          A defibrillator, is of most use in
patients with NON TRAUMATIC CARDIAC ARREST with
little part to play in the injured patient.


                     2
However the widespread provision of these machines
in large sports stadia would save lives in
"everyday" emergencies.
OTHER EQUIPMENT
          Stretchers were absent at Hillsborough and
there should be some provision of basic stretchers.
          Basic first aid bandages and dressings.
RECOMMENDATIONS

          The level of provision of medical
facilities at sporting stadia is in the end a
political decision since the routine provision of
trained personnel will cost money. However the
following are realistic minimum recommendations.
ADVANCED LIFE SUPPORT PERSONNEL (ALSP)

          To provide cover for large supporting
events two people trained and certified in ADVANCED
LIFE SUPPORT TECHNIQUES should be EMPLOYED the
MANAGEMENT OF THE STADIUM. They should be co­
ordinated by senior person in overall medical
charge.
          They should have training in the special
problems of delivering care in the unusual setting.
          They should be paid for this service.
          They should have easily identifiable
clothing.
          ■rney should have radio-communication with
police/stewards.
          These personnel should be IN ADDITION to
first aid provision such as St. John's Ambulance.

THE HOSPITAL RESPONSE

Communications

          In all major incidents communication is
usually the major problem and Hillsborough was no
exception. The police are nominally responsible for
communications in this setting. It is obvious that
the health authorities must take responsibility for
providing communications for the emergency staff.

          At a very basic level the provision of
such equipment is appalling. As a single handed A&E
consultant I was refused a radio-pager. Fortunately
I provided this equipment for myself and it was
this pager that gave me early warning of the
incident on 15th April.
          ALL A/E on call senior staff should be
provided with radiopagers if not cellnet telephones.

          One major problem for the hospital was the
error in informing them that a major incident was
taking place. This should be the responsibility of'
the ambulance service not the police.

          Better communications are needed between
the site medical team and the hospital. Cellnet
telephones were used to good effect in the M1 plane
crash and should be standard flying squad equipment.

          In the incident the two flying squad
doctors lost contact. Flying squad personnel should
have walkie-talkie apparatus to maintain
communication.

HOSPITAL FLYING SQUAD/SITE MEDICAL OFFICER.

     The major incident plans of Trent Region and
the Sheffield hospitals state that the site
medicalofficer and team are provided by the
hospitals, preferably the hospital not receiving
casualties.
     The site medical officer should be senior,
trained in accident work and triage and be used to
dealing with the other emergency services. Senior
A/E doctors fit this description but the Northern
General has only two senior A/E doctors and the
Hallamshire 4 such doctors. Obviously the first


                        4
priority of A/E staff is to prepare the A/E
department and to receive staff.
        On the 15th of April there were only 4
senior A/E staff available. One was ill in bed and
one other post was vacant. This resulted in
relatively junior staff going out in the flying
squad. Fortunately there were many other doctors at
the stadium and the major accident equipment was
mostly what was needed.By the time the flying squad
arrived most of the seriously ill had been removed
from the ground and the ambulance service appeared
to do a very good job of the triage.
     It is very difficult to give hard
recommendations regarding a site medical officer.
Ideally he should be a senior A/E doctor but thought
should be given to forming a rota of other
interested doctors such as the BASICS doctors to
provide cover and training for this role. Again this
training will require money to be effective.


     Once the hospital had received adequate
information the response was swift and effective.
Large numbers of critically ill patients were
treated and admitted to intensive care units. One
problem was the lack of Computerised tomography on
the Northern General Hospital. This led to anxiety
that some injuries in the head might be missed. Six
patients required transfer for CT scans. Fortunately
no serious injuries were missed.

Summary

     In most major incidents large NHS district
hospitals have shown that they have the staff and
resources to deal with most major accidents which
have occurred in this country.
     The major challenge is the provision of out
of hospital medical help. In "everyday" type of
emergency the flying squad is provided by the A/E
department. The A/E deaprtments of Sheffield do not
have enough senior A/E staff and in this incident
the first priority of these staff was the care of
patients in the A/E departments.
         Other countries provide much greater
resource for out of hospital medical cover. France
and Germany are excellent examples of this system.
However given the current manpower restrictions and
funding problems it is hard to envisage how such a
system can be introduced in this country.

             Dr. E. Brian Lewis, M.A., F.F.A.R.C.S.

     (Chief Medical Advisor, British Red Cross Society and late Surgeon-
     General to the Armed Forces)


     It wss also agreed to invite representatives of the ambulance service
     on to the working party, in order to ensure the canplete
     representation of the emergency medical services. The following
     representatives were duly nominated by their respective professional
     asso c ia ti on s .


     Don Page, J.P., F.A.S.I.
     (Regional Ambulance Officers Group)


     Gordon P. Turnbull, F.A.S.I., F.B.I.M.
     (Association of Chief Ambulance Officers)


     The representation on the working party thus gave a comprehensive
     overview of the medical profession's standards in Irrmediate Medical
     Care and disaster medicine.


     Chris Whalley of The Football League acted as Secretary to the working
     party.


3.   Copies of the Taylor Report were circulated to members of the working
     party and the first meeting was held on 4th April, 1990.   At this
     first meeting the background to the establishment of the working party
     was outlined to members and the Taylor reccnmendations in relation to
     medical matters were addressed.   Further meetings were then held on
     18th April, 2nd May, 30th May, 13th June and 4th July, 1990.


RBCCMffiNDATICN 64 - There should be at each sports ground at each match at
least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. TSie club should have
the responsibility for securing such attendance.
 4.    The working party agreed that the definition of a trained first aider
       should be someone who holds the Standard Certificate in First Aid
       issued by St. John Ambulance and the British Red Cross Society.     The
       latest syllabus for the Standard Certificate is shown at Appendix A.


5.     The ratio of 1 first aider for every 1,000 spectators was agreed, with
       the proviso that there should be a minimum of 3 first aiders at any
       one match.   Local knowledge to be used to determine any extra
       attendance of first aiders for certain matches, such as local derby
       matches etc.


6.    The working party felt it right that the responsibility for securing
       the attendance of first aiders should lie with the football club.


RBCCM®NDATION 65 - There should be at each designated sports ground one or
more first aid roans. The number of such roans and the equipment to be
maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after
taking professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every
Safety Certificate.


7.    The working party felt that at least one first aid rocm should be
      provided to the satisfaction of the local authority and subject to the
      following minimum standard.


8.    The rocm should be readily available at all times when a specified
      event is hieing undertaken and should not normally be used for any
      purpose other than the rendering of first aid.   The rocm should be
      positioned as near as possible, taking into account the location and
      layout of the establishment, to a point of access for transport to
      hospital and with easy access frcm all parts of the sports ground.
      The room should be clearly identified as a first aid rocm, its
      location publicised, and the route(s) to it clearly signposted.
The rocm should be of minimum area 300 sq.ft. and of a regular shape.
The door should be of sufficient width to allow a stretcher plus
attendants to be admitted, bearing in mind the possibility of
stretcher access from a corridor.     The roan ideally should have
provision to treat 3 patients simultaneously with adequate provision
for privacy.     The rocm should be provided with a stainless steel
sink, work surface, wash-hand basin, adequate drainage and supplies
of hot and cold drinking water, soap and hand drying facilities.
Hypochlorite disinfectant should also be provided, effective against
H.I.V., Hepatitis B, etc., for cleaning of blood and body fluids.
Recommended concentrations for use are 10,000 ppm to deal with
spillages;     1,000 ppm for general washing purposes.


The roan should be a designated 'no-smoking' area, be effectively
ventilated, lighted, heated and maintained and it should be provided
with at least 6 x 13 amp. socket outlets.     All surfaces should be
hard, impervious and easy to clean.     The roan should be kept clean and
well maintained and adequate provision made for the disposal at the
end of each event of waste and refuse including clinical and 'sharp'
waste.   The rocm should be in close proximity to a watercloset and
private waiting area provided with chairs. The rocm should be
provided with effective means of ccrrmunication to and from the central
control point and the emergency services.     In most stadia the
appropriate means will be by telephone link with an exclusive external
line.


Paragraphs 8, 9 and 10 contain the ideal recaimendations for a first
aid rocm.    The working party recognises that clubs may have made
provision following the Football League's letter to clubs dated 10th
July, 1989 (copy shown at Appendix B).     In such cases, future ground
developments must take into account the ideal recamiendations
contained in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10.
                                         -5-




12 .   The working party recommends for club first aid rooms a medical first
       aid pack along the lines advised by the Scottish Football
       Association's Medical Canmittee.     The contents of this first aid pack
       are as follows


       50 x Gauze swabs 7.5 x 7.5c.m. 12   ply 5   per pack(Sterile)
       50 x Cotton Wool Balls HospitalQual. Large - 5per       pack (Sterile)
       50 x Gallipots 60ml (sterile)
       50 x Sterile Forceps
       12 x HIBIDIL Sachets
        3 x Saline for eye irregation sterile 300ml
        6 x Crepe bandage 5cm
        6 x Crepebandage 7.5cm
        1 x 100 latex gloves large
        1 x 2.5cm Hypoallergenic adhesive tape
       12 x Eyepads (first aid pack) sterile
       24 x W.O.W. bandage 5cm
       24 x W.O.W. bandage 7.5cm
       24 x W.O.W. bandage 10cm
       12 x First Aid Dressings - (12 x 4 sizes)
        1 x Tube gauze (suitable for fingers)shortest     lengthavailable
        1 x Tube gauze (suitable for ankles and    knees) shortest length
            available
        2 x Elastic adhesive dressings (canposite pack mixed sizes)
        1 x 25 Triangular bandages (not calico, but non-woven disposable)
        1 x Safety Pins (pack)
        1 x Box Large Paper Tissues


       The cost of such a first aid pack should be approximately £220 net of
       V.A.T.


       The need for the Crowd Doctor to check and maintain the club's first
       aid rocm equipment is stressed,     (see also paragraph 24).


13 .   Where there is more than one hospital locally, there should be
       displayed in the First Aid Roan a list of the 'receiving hospitals'.
  14 .     The working party stresses the importance of first aid posts being
           sited around the ground and the need for proper signposting.    This
          would help with public awareness of the presence of first aiders.       The
          working party recormends that the location of the club's first aid
          facilities should be shown in the match programme.


 15 .     In making these recommendations the working party was conscious of,
          and appreciative of, the existing arrangements at clubs, the liaison
          with the voluntary first aid organisations and the statutory ambulance
          service and the many improvements that had been effected post
          Hillsborough.


 REOMffiKDATIGN 66(a) - At every match where the number of spectators is
expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a medical practitioner to
be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground.
He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain
until half an hour after the end of the match. His whereabouts should be
kncwn to those in the police control room and he should be iimediately
contactable.


16 .     The working party recognised that the Club Doctor was primarily in
         attendance at matches to look after the players.   It was felt that
         there should be a further doctor in attendance to handle any medical
         emergency at the ground.   For the sake of convenience we call this
         second doctor the "Crowd Doctor".


17.      Recognising the difficulty that this might cause clubs with low
         attendances, the working party feels that at a match where the number
         of spectators is not expected to exceed 3,000, the role of the Crowd
         Doctor may be taken on by the Club Doctor, providing the latter is
         trained and competent in Immediate Medical Care (see paragraph 18) and
         on the strict understanding that his first priority is to the crowd.
The Crowd Doctor should possess skills in coirmunication and canmand
and control as well as medical skills and he should be not more than
70 years of age.     Doctors having taken relevant courses would be
preferred; doctors without such certification should attend a special
day course in Immediate Medical Care for medical practitioners.


For this purpose, the format of the BASICS one-day course was accepted
subject to the deletion of the sessions on water-related emergencies
and paediatric emergencies and to the inclusion of a special session
to cover inter-service liaison, carmunications, major incident
management and the delegation of duties to voluntary first aid
workers.   (The format of the BASICS course is shown at Appendix 'C').


This day course should be mounted by the Football Association Medical
Carmittee with the assistance of BASICS, the Ambulance Service, the
St. John Ambulance and the British Red Cross Society.    The Chairman of
this working party has made contact with the Football Association
Medical Committee, whose chairman has expressed willingness for the
Football Association Medical Ccnmittee to undertake this task through
its medical/education activity.


Recertification or reattendance on course is regarded as necessary
every 5 years.     The ideal long-term objective is for Crowd Doctors to
possess the Diploma in Immediate Medical Care.
The Crowd Doctor should have available to him the following equipment
at the ground:-

  Most of the above equipment should be contained in light carrying
  cases and stored in a safe place at the ground between matches.      A
  trolley should be available to enable the equipment to be quickly and
  easily transported to the First Aid Roan on match days.   The Crowd
  Doctor should ensure that the arrangements for storing the equipment
_ between matches are to his satisfaction.   Crovd Doctors should keep
  certain items of equipment such as the defibrillator (if this has not
  been supplied by the local Ambulance Service - see next paragraph)
 and/or certain drugs with them rather than leave them in storage at
 the ground.   The working party recatxnends that the Crowd Doctor should
 be responsible for the asterisked drugs listed in paragraph 22.      Those
 doctors who are not ordinarily in possession of controlled drugs may
 need to make special arrangements.


 The Crowd Doctor must ensure that the equipment is checked and
 maintained.   It is suggested that the local Ambulance Service could
 assist by providing and maintaining the more complex items of
 equipment, such as the defibrillator.   The Cro*ri Doctor should liaise
 with the Ambulance Service on this point.


The working party feels that the Crofcri Doctor should remain at the
ground for a minimum of half an hour after the end of the match. If
his attendance is required for a longer period, he must remain until
his work is done.


The Crowd Doctor should familiarise himself with the local Accident
and Bnergency Department's major incident plan and the local
authority's emergency plan.


It is recommended that a full record of all medical incidents at the
ground for each event should be made by the Crowd Doctor.   He should
make an annual return to the co-ordinating officer in the local health
authority (respecting patient confidentiality). The Crowd Doctor
should give an abstract of these records to the club,   making sure
that patients' names have been deleted to maintain confidentiality,

          There should be a supply of NCL referral forms available to the Crowd
          Doctor, so that he can hand a chit to the patient if hospitalisation
          or further medical attention is required and retain
          one himself. For this purpose the working party reccnmends the
          standard A S H form used by the local ambulance services.   An example
          -of this form is shown at Appendix D.


    28.   The Chairman of this working party has been contacted by the
          appropriate British Medical Association carmittee on the subject of
          remuneration for Crowd Doctors. The British Medical Association has
          asked to be kept informed of the outcome of this working party's
          report in order that appropriate remuneration for Crowd Doctors can be
          recommended.


    RECOWENE3A.TICN 66(b) - At any match where a number of spectators is not
    expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make arrangements to enable a
    medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any mpdiral
    exigency at the ground. He should be trained and canpetent in advanced
    first aid. The arrangements made should be known to those in the police
    control rocm.


    29.   In such cases, the Crowd Doctor must be able to get to the ground
          within 10 minutes.   If this is not practicable for geographical or
          traffic reasons, he must be on call in the ground.


    RECOWENDATICN 67. - At least one fully equipped ambulance fran or approved
    by the appriopriate ambulance authority should be in attendance at all
    matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.
    RBCOMEWDATICN 68 - The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches
    where larger crowds are expected should be specified by the local authority
    after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.
                                       -13-

        The working party agrees that dedicated ambulances are required for
        each match with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more; the nutter of
        ambulances at each ground to be determined locally - this will depend
        on the size and geography of each individual ground.     The irking
        party would recarmend that for matches with an expected crcwi of 5,000
        or more, there should be a minimum of 1 ambulance approved by the
      - appropriate ambulance authority and 1 voluntary service ambulance in
        attendance.

       The statutory ambulance(s) will only leave the ground if the patient
       needs immediate hospitalisation and no other vehicle is available,     if
       the statutory ambulance does leave the ground, the Ambulance Service
       cormunications officer present should imnediately order a replacement
       ambulance.   The working party would suggest, however, that the
       voluntary service ambulance (St. John Ambulance/British Red Cross
       Society) could be used to good effect to transport people to hospital.
       Again, these arrangements should be determined locally.

32.
       The equipment carried on the statutory ambulance includes the
       following;-


       2 stretcher trolleys - both multi-posture
      piped oxygen to both; stretcher trolleys
      defibrillator
      paramedic kit
      ambu bag
      resuscitation equipment
      analgesic drugs
      blankets
      burn sheets
      first aid dressings
      carrying chair
      orthopaedic stretcher
      cervical collars
      splintage variety (i.e. inflatable, box, spinal)
      radio comnunications

                    attendance at a match where a cro^ in excess of 25.000 is


33.
        The working party agreed with this recordation, but felt that there
        cou be problems in certain areas of the country if there was more
        than one match with a 25,000+ attendance taking place on the same day
       or if such a match clashed with other large attendance events in the
       area.


G ENERAL




34.    It is recaimended that a liaison feting be held once a year at every
       club lrrmediately before the start of each season.       In attendance at
       this meeting should be the following


       the Club Doctor
      the Crowd Doctor(s)

      the nominated       liaison officer of the local Ambulance Service
      the nominated       liaison officer of the local police
      the nominated       liaison officer of the local Fire Service
      the liaison officer of the voluntary       first aid organisation

                                    (St. John Ambulance/British Red Cross
                                    Society)
      the Accident and Emergency Consultant frcm the local hospital
                               (or his nominated deputy)
      the Club Secretary or Stadium Manager

      a representative of that branch of the local authority that issues the
      club's safety certificate.
                                                  -15-




      35.     At this meting the club's fixtures fcr the forthconing seascn can be
               otified to all parties.      Any subsequent fixture alterations should be

              should                   for notifying any
              Accident and Emergency Consultant.         It would be helpful, at the
            _ liaison meeting, if the local police could identify any ’high-profile'
              matches. This would enable the local Accident and Qnergency
              Department to be pre-warned.


             At every match there should be a meeting one hour before kick-off
             involving the following:-


             the Police Ground Commander
             the Crowd Doctor
             the Senior Ambulance Officer

             the liaison officer of the voluntary first aid organisation
             (St. John Ambulance/British Red Cross Society)
             the Stadium Manager or the club's Safety Officer


             Following this meeting the name of the Crowd Doctor in attendance
            should be relayed to the local Accident and Emergency Department by
            the Ambulance Service, who should also confirm that the arrangements
            are in hand at the ground.


37.         The working party recotmends that this report, which has been compiled
            with football grounds in mind, should be considered by other sporting
            bodies for inplementation in venues under their jurisdiction.


AUTOPSY REPORTS FROM HILLSBOROUGH


38.         The vrorking party required a presentation on the autopsy reports fro,
            Hillsborough and the lessons to be learned.        A full presentation was
        received from the pathologist involved.            Clinical recomendations to
        doctors may follow in due course.

         and medical enKrgencies inspected by the Chairman and Secretary to
           is working party, who were very impressed by what they saw.          These
         arrangements include 2 (or more if necessary) crow] doctors on site
         and a full-tire „urse practitioner, together with up to 120 trained
         first aiders, 80 of whan may be registered nurses.       There are 4
         quadrant-sited medical rooms and there will be this year 5 dedicated
         and equipped ambulances.    On-site training is a continuous process.


 40.    Briefing and debriefing before/after each major event is a routine
        procedure.   The working party recarmends this practice for grounds
        that regularly receive large attendances.


 ONGOING ROLE OF THIS WORKING PARTY


41.     The r e c a n t a t i o n s of this wrking farty, if accepted by the Football
        league M a n a g e d Committee, will need to be comprehensively and
        tactfully presented to the clubs.


42.     If and when these recormendations are in place, it is further
       recommended that a system for the insect ion of medical arrangements
       at grounds be implemented,     it is felt that clubs should be
       accountable to The Football league and this wrking party is prepared
       to carry put inspections and make reports to the League.


43.    The working party v*>uld also wish to see an annual exercise carried
       out, at a different ground each year, whereby a major incident is
       simulated and the staff, first aiders, emergency services etc. are
       tested.   This could be a desk-top exercise or a more extensive and
       expensive option.   Additionally, it vrould enable technological
       advances and advances m    medical procedures to be introduced and
       ensure a regular upgrading of practice.

TO ALL CLUBS




d)    Ambulance

      At least one fully-equipped ambulance should be in attendance at all matches
    w 3n expectecl attendance of 5,000+. The ambulance should be equipped with
defibrillators and resuscitative equipment and be manned by personnel trained
in their use.

     Clubs should be able to hire such an ambulance with two paramedics for
around £90 per match.

e)   First Aid Personnel

      All first-aiders serving at grounds should be fully trained and experienced.
At the start of each season, clubs should be furnished with a complete list of
trained first-aiders by the organisation providing their first aid service; such list
to be regularly updated.

      There should be a minimum of three first-aiders for up to 1,000 spectators,
with one additional first-aider for every 1,000 spectators above the first 1,000,
up to a total of 10,000 spectators. Thereafter an additional first-aider for every
additional 2,000 spectators.

      Clubs will be asked to detail their first aid facilities and their emergency
procedures in a revised local plan; separate instructions on this will follow shortly.
If you have any queries, please speak to Chris Whalley or Jack Crawford.

Dear John

Hillsborough Disaster

I enclose a further note of my firm's charges relating to the
Hillsborough disaster.  This principally covers the work carried
out in relation to the inquests and in advising SYMAS in relation
to requests for witnesses to attend civil proceedings (in the
event the witnesses were not called as the case was settled).
You will see that a significant proportion of the time has been
spent by my articled clerk, a large proportion of that time
relates to liaising with the Coroner's office.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Hinchcliffe

Hillsborough Disaster:   Resumed Inquests

With regard to this matter, Mr Callaghan is       currently awayfrom
the office until 6th March 1991.    In his absence, I am dealing
with day to day matters arising from his files.

During the course of the inquest, we were informed by the
Coroner's office that the only SYMAS witness who would be called
at the inquest would be Mr Paul Eason.       Mr Eason duly gave
evidence on Friday 15 February 1991.   In Mr Callaghan's absence,
M r | o f        this firm attended the hearing on that date. Mr
Eason's evidence and cross examination was quite straightforward
with no adverse matters being raised.

We are currently proceeding on the basis that no further SYMAS
witnesses will be required to give evidence at the inquest,
unless we are informed to the contrary by the Coroner's office.

I will be bringing these matters to Mr Callaghan's attention upon
his return to the office.   I am sending a copy of this letter to
John Evans.

Yours sincerely

had last written to a Mr Hinchcliffe at the Rotherham Health
Authority. I said I proposed to write a letter to him and copies
to John Evans and Don Page.            said Don Page would have
received a report anyway of the inquest as he is in charge at the
SYMAS ambulance headquarters.  However I ought to send a copy of
the letter to John Evans.

    Mr Eason had been called to give evidence on Friday. The Coroner
    examined him in chief, and then he was cross examined.    Only Mr
    1     for the victims' relatives cross examined him in any real
    depth.   There were no questions which needed to be objected to,
    and once Mr Eason had given evidence, he and            stayed to
    listen to the evidence of the St. John's Ambulance Brigade
    witness and then left the inquest.

    He told me to check through the correspondence file to see
    whether AJC had written to John Evans telling him that we would
    send him a report of the inquest once our witnesses had been
    heard. I said I would do that and draft any necessary letter.

NOTE OF A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION

        attending Mr Eason on the telephone.   He was ringing to
enquire whether he was due to give evidence tomorrow at the
inquest. I told him that I had spoken to the Coroner's Support
Team on Friday and they had told me there was a provisional list
already in place for Tuesday and the remainder of the week. They
had told me that whenever Mr Eason was listed they would
telephone us to let us know.    I related this information to Mr
Eason, told him he would not be required tomorrow and probably
not for the rest of the week.      I told him I would certainly
telephone him as soon as I heard anything from the Coroner's
office.

will be called to give evidence on Thursday of this week but he
is not sure. He will let us know when he has a definite time.




Later in the day, Sgt.           rang again.   He said that it is
now likely that Paul Eason will be called to give evidence on
Friday of this week and not Thursday.     The Coroner has changed
the lists.   Again, this is only provisional and he will ring us
back as soon as he has any further details.

Dear Mr Hinchcliffe

Hillsborough Disaster - Resumed Inquests
As arranged I attended at Sheffield Town Hall yesterday on the
first day of the resumed inquests.

The Coroner indicated that he intended only to consider the
events up to about 3.15 p.m. on the day of the disaster.      The
barrister acting on behalf of 43 of the bereaved families argued
that the Coroner should consider the events up to the time of the
certification of death in each case and, in particular, should
review the part played by the emergency services on the basis
that it was suggested that, in some cases, lives may have been
saved if individuals had received treatment more quickly, or if
particular equipment was available.     I argued that it was not
appropriate to seek to use the inquests, in effect, as a means of
obtaining a public inquiry into the involvement of the ambulance
service.

The Coroner decided that the evidence which had been given at the
interim inquest was that each of the deceased died from
crushing/traumatic asphyxia and that, whilst that did not mean
that certain individuals did not survive for some time
afterwards, the cause of death had already been decided and that
he had chosen to limit his investigations up to 3.15 p.m.
principally on the basis of the pathological medical evidence.
The Coroner added that there may be exceptional cases in which he
      2


20 November 1990


would consider going beyond the 3.15 p.m.     time limit but he
thought it unlikely.

From now on I intend to check, each day, the list of the
following day's witnesses and if it appears likely (from the
transcript of the Taylor inquiry) that any of those witnesses
might say something which prejudices the ambulance service, then
I will attend at the hearing of their evidence.      I will also
attend when the SYMAS witnesses are called.

It is therefore possible (although fairly unlikely) that
witnesses will say something which criticises the ambulance
service response, when I am not present (for example not all of
the witnesses will have given evidence to the Taylor inquiry and
so we will not know in advance what their evidence will be). The
alternative is for me, or a colleague, to be present throughout
the inquests, which is likely to be an unjustifiable expense.

I am sending a copy of this letter to each of John Evans and Don
Page.

Yours sincerely

Dear John

Hillsborough Inquests

As you will know we generally increase our charging rates in May
of each year.   I last sent you an account in June although the
work to which that account related was carried out before May of
this year.  I had not discussed increased rates with you because
it seemed likely that there would not be any further work to do.

I now propose to increase the hourly charging rates as follows:-

               Myself:                  £75.00
               Assistant solicitors     £60.00
               Articled clerks:         £30.00

Could you please confirm that these rates are agreed.

The Coroner has indicated that he wants 4 SYMAS personnel to
give evidence. They are the 4 who were in the ground before the
match started and it is therefore likely that they will be asked
to give evidence about what they saw as the tragedy developed,
and it does not appear at present that the Coroner intends to
investigate the role of the ambulance service generally.

Yours sincerely

Dear Alan

Hillsborough Inquests

I acknowledge receipt of your letter of 25 October and its
enclosures.  I have completed the questionnaire on behalf of the
four individuals and have asked that arrangements for their
attendance be made through Roger Morley or yourself. I have also
asked that we be given as much advance notice as possible if the
Coroner does decide to call any of the four, and that they all
give evidence on the same day if possible.

I saw each of Paul Eason and Patrick Higgins when it appeared
likely that they would have to give evidence at the civil
proceedings in Manchester and, of course, they both previously
gave evidence to the Taylor Inquiry.                        ~| and
                did not give evidence to the Taylor Inquiry; if
you would like me to see them to go through their statements with
them and to explain the procedure then I should be grateful if
you could contact me to make the appropriate arrangements.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Inquests
Our Client: South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
We act on behalf of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance
Service in relation to the Hillsborough Inquests.     Four of our
client's employees have received your standard form of
questionnaire.   They are                           , Paul Eason,
Patrick Higgins and                  [ . We have completed the
questionnaire on behalf of each of those individuals and enclose
the completed forms.   Arrangements for their attendance at the
inquest should be made either through ourselves or through Mr
Hopkins or Mr Morley at Ambulance Service Headquarters.

Because of the arrangements which have to be made in relation to
rotas it would be helpful if you could give as much advance
notice as possible if the Coroner does intend to call any of the
four individuals to give evidence.   It would also be helpful if
any SYMAS personnel who are called to give evidence could be
called on the same day.

We are sure you will understand that it is SYMAS policy not to
give the home addresses and telephone numbers of their personnel
and we presume that you have no objection to this.

Yours faithfully

Alan Hopkins rang.   He said that the Coroner had notified him
that he would want to hear evidence from Paul Eason, Paddy
Higgins,                and             (the four who were in the
ground when the disaster began).   We agreed that he should send
all the papers to me and I would deal with them.    We also agreed
that the home addresses of the four should not be put in the

        Dear Sir/Mejdam,

                                         Hillsborough Inquests

        I am actively considering the names of the people who I may wish to
        attend to give evidence at the resumed Inquests which are scheduled to
        commence on the 19th November 1990 and to continue thereafter until
        about 20th December 1990. If the hearings are not completed by then
        there will be a break for Christmas and New Year and I am planning to
        resume on about 7th January 1991.

        It is my normal practice not to issue subpoenas or summonses to
        witness who I wish to attend at Inquests as I find that most people
        are p e r fe c t ly willing to come to Inquests by invitation.

        You will appreciate that with Inquests of the size and complexity
        associated with the Hillsborough Disaster it is very important that
        the attendance of witnesses should go as smoothly as it is possible to
        arrange. I therefore would like to have your confirmation that if I
        were to request you to attend as a witness you will in fact do so
        without a subpoena or summons being served upon you.

        When replying, would you please also let me have certain other
        information which I have set out. on the attached pro-forma. Please
        return this immediately to my coroner's- officer (listing) in the
        envelope provided.

 Dear Sir/M^tefm,

                                    Hillsborough Inquests

I am actively considering the names of the people who X may wish to
attend to give evidence at the resumed Inquests which are scheduled to
commence on the 19th November 1990 and to continue thereafter until
about 20th December 1990. If the hearings are not completed by then
there will be a break for Christmas and New Year and I am planning to
resume on about 7th January 1991.

It is my normal practice not to issue subpoenas or summonses to
witness who I wish to attend at Inquests as I find that most people
are p e r f e c t ly willing to come to Inquests by invitation.

You will appreciate that with Inquests of the size and complexity
associated with the Hillsborough Disaster it is very important that
the attendance of witnesses should go as smoothly as it is possible to
arrange. I therefore would like to have your confirmation that if I
were to request you to attend as a witness you will in fact do so
without a subpoena or summons being served upon you.

When replying, would you please also let me have certain other
information which I have set out on the attached pro-forma. Please
return this immediately to my coroner's officer (listing) in the
envelope provided.

If you have any questions regarding this matter please contact my
coroner’s officer (listing):

    Det. Sgt.                 c/o West Midland Police,
    Hillsborough Inquiry, Nechells Police Station, Birmingham B7 5DA.

His telephone number is                                                 Please do not phone him unless
it is really absolutely necessary.

You will of course be contacted again with further details if your
attendance is going to be required.

Dear Don

Hillsborough Disaster - Resumed Inquests
The Coroner has still not been able to inform me whether he
wishes to call any witnesses from SYMAS, but he has said that if
he does wish any of your personnel to attend to give evidence we
will be given advance details of who will be called, and the
dates on which they are likely to be asked to give evidence.  He
has also indicated that he will do what he can to minimise the
inconvenience to SYMAS.

At present I do not know precisely which points the Coroner would
propose to go into in any detail but I imagine we will have a
better idea of that when we know who (if anybody) he wants to
give evidence.

Best wishes.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Hinchcliffe

Hillsborough Disaster - Resumed Inquests

I understand that John Evans has notified you that the Inquests
relating to the victims of the Hillsborough disaster will resume
on 19th November.

As you will be aware my firm previously acted on behalf of Trent
RHA/SYMAS both in relation to the Taylor Inquiry, and the earlier
stages of the Inquests.   I understand that you wish us to act in
relation to the resumed Inquests but I should be grateful if you
could let me have confirmation of this.

The Coroner has informed me that he is not in a position to
indicate who he might call from the ambulance service to give
evidence at the resumed Inquests, or when it is likely that their
evidence would be given.

Yours sincerely

Michel Kalipetis rang. His clerk had received an approach from
Walker Morris Scott Turnbull to ask if MLK could act for them in
the Hillsborough inquest.    He wanted to know if there would be
any ambulance service involvement in the inquest.      I told him
that I had been in correspondence with the Coroner who had not
been able to indicate whether or not ambulance service witnesses
would be called.   I said that I was not anticipating that any
criticism of the ambulance service would be raised but I would
have a better idea when I knew who would be called as witnesses.
I said that, at present, I did not anticipate having to brief
Counsel.   I said I would have no objection to him acting on
behalf of another party, so long as there was no possibility of
his having to raise any suggestion that SYMAS or any of its
personnel acted in any way other than competently.     He said at
the moment he did not know who the potential client was. I said
that if Walker Morris Scott Turnbull wanted to ring me then I
would be more than happy to discuss the matter with them and help
smooth the path if possible.

IN THE MATTER OF A PUBLIC INQUIRY

INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


LEADING COUNSEL *S SUBMISSIONS IN SUPPORT OF AN APPLICATION BY
TRENT REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY FOR REPRESENTATION



A.   I am instructed on behalf of Trent Regional Health Authority

     (TRHA) which          is   responsible       for   the   management              of   South

     Yo r k s h i r e   M e t r opolitan    Ambulance         Service            (SYMAS)      in

     connection         with     their     involvement        in    the      Hillsborough

     Disaster.



B.   An application for the grant of the right to representation

     was made by my             Instructing Solicitors             at   the preliminary

     hearing on the 28th April and was refused, but you indicated

     that any party whose application was refused could make a

     further      application.           I am    instructed        to    make     a    further

     application.           TRHA    seeks       representation          on   a    number     of

     grounds which are set out in a letter from my Instructing

     Solicitors and in written representations from me.                                I shall

     merely summarize those representations.



1. SYMAS EVIDENCE

The evidence       which    SYMAS    is    able    to   produce         to   the       Inquiry

includes:

     (a)     The observations of on duty officers who were present

             in the ground prior to 3.00 p.m.
(b)    The evidence of two ambulancemen who were off duty at

       the    time    but    who     attended             the    match,     one    as   a

       spectator      and    one     in       his    capacity      as   a   part     time

       caterer.



(c)    Evidence       of    Senior    Officers             and   ambulancemen        who

       attended the ground as the incident developed.                                This

       will include evidence relating to the crush and rescue,

       and the difficulties which were encountered in gaining

       access    to    the    ground          and    in    manoeuvering       vehicles

       within the ground and onto the pitch.



(d)    The    evidence       of    the        Chief       Ambulance       Officer,      of

       another Senior Officer (now with another service), and

       of    two other officers,               relating to SYMAS' desire to

       have     its    officers       (and          in    appropriate        cases      an

       ambulance) present at the ground.



(e)    Evidence relating to SYMAS own Control Action Plan in

       the event of a major incident at Sheffield Wednesday

       and the implementation of a Major Incident Plan.



(f )   The original tapes of radio and telephone messages to

       and    from     SYMAS      Control           and    transcripts       of    those

       messages.       These are relevant to the timing of events


                                          2
            as they unfolded and to the manner in which the police

            and others in authority reacted.   A number of messages

            from the police are recorded.   The tapes are already in

            the possession of the Police.




2.   CRITICISM OF SYMAS



Criticism of SYMAS by a Community Physician and a G.P. who were

present at the disaster were widely reported in the press in the

days immediately after the disaster.    In particular the Community

Physician    is reported to have said there was a lack of control,

incompetence and lack of overall plan and the G.P. is reported to

have said that there was a lack of life saving equipment and in

particular    defibrillators.     Similar   complaints   continue   to

receive mention in the press.



Given the criticisms which have already been made,       it is highly

probable that evidence if presented will be critical of SYMAS.

The Ambulance Service should have legal representation to enable

it to refute any such criticism, and give it the opportunity to

establish the accurate position through all relevant witnesses.



3. ADVANCE WARNING



     (a)    It is difficult to anticipate precisely when adverse


                                  3
      comments or criticism will be made during the course of

      such an Inquiry,        and thus adequate advance notice may

      not always be possible.              However it is often the case

      that such criticism can be anticipated by Counsel from

      the cross examination of the other witnesses by other

      Counsel and that the nature of such criticism is                              such

      that    Counsel       can     establish          facts     refuting           that

      criticism      from    other       witnesses       before       the    critical

      witnesses themselves are called.



(b)   West   Midlands       Police       have     requested,      and       have    been

      supplied with, statements from SYMAS some of which are

      critical       of    Sheffield        Wednesday          Football          Club's

      management.           Pursuant         to      Lord    Justice         Taylor's

      direction      and    the    usual    practice,         advance       notice    of

      those criticisms will be given to the people concerned.

      Inevitably they will            give evidence anticipating                    such

      criticism and will            seek   to answer deflect                or   refute

      this and may well            in so doing          attack the author of

      these criticisms.            It would be invidious if the Chief

      Ambulance Officer and other officers or staff were not

      able    to   put     these     criticisms         to    those         witnesses

      through their own Counsel who can                      test the replies by

      cross examination.           Further,          unfairness may result to

      the    SYMAS    officers       if    they       give    evidence        and    are

      themselves      cross       examined      by    the    representatives          of


                                     4
            those   witnesses      without       having   the   benefit   of    being

            represented themselves.



5. FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS



SYMAS will be in a position to make more cogent representations

to the second part of the Inquiry if it has had the opportunity

to    participate       in   the   Inquiry by      full   legal    representation.

Involvement      throughout         the    Inquiry    will      save   duplication.

Furthermore      the questions which SYMAS will wish to put, so as to

establish    its recommendations          as to what should happen             in the

future,    will not greatly lengthen the proceedings,                  but will    if

put   in the first part of the Inquiry,               make it unnecessary for

such witnesses to return.



C.
I am instructed on behalf of those persons from whom statements

have been taken.         They all wish to have legal representation if

required    to   give    evidence.        That    representation will       be more

meaningful if I am able to represent SYMAS' officers and staff

throughout the Inquiry and in my respectful submission the SYMAS

evidence could not and should not be in isolation from all the

evidence given at the Inquiry.

Each of the SYMAS officers                 and staff involved in the disaster

have been     asked to        supply a statement to the              Inquiry.       Those

statements have been prepared by my instructing Solicitors,                            but

the     officers and staff wish to be legally represented if they

are to be called.             Each of them is an important witness as to

event    I   respectfully       submit     that     it has    at   least    as    great   a

the   Fire    Service       argued   that    they    should     have   representation

since they must be consulted before the Local Authority grants a

licence      to     the    sports    stadium.        The   ambulance       service     has

significant points to make in relation to why it too should be

              IN THE MATTER OF A PUBLIC INQUIRY

              INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


              LEADING COUNSEL'S SUBMISSIONS IN SUPPORT OF AN APPLICATION BY
              TRENT REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY FOR REPRESENTATION



              A.    I am instructed on behalf of Trent Regional Health Authority

                    (TRHA)    which     is   responsible       for   the   management           of   South

                    Yorkshire      M e t r o politan     Ambulance         Service        (SYMAS)      in

                    connection     with       their    involvement         in    the      Hillsborough

                    Disaster.



              B.   An application for the grant of the right to representation

                    was   made by my         Instructing      Solicitors        at   the preliminary

                    hearing on the 28th April and was refused, but you indicated

                    that any party whose application was refused could make a

                    further     application.          I am    instructed        to    make    a   further

                    application.         TRHA    seeks       representation          on   a   number    of

                    grounds which are set out in a letter from my Instructing

                    Solicitors and in written representations from me.                            I shall

                    merely summarize those representations.



              1.   SYMAS EVIDENCE
              The evidence      which    SYMAS    is   able     to   produce         to   the     Inquiry

              includes:
                    (a)   The observations of on duty officers who were present

                          in the ground prior to 3.00 p.m.


                                                         1
(b)    The evidence of two ambulancemen who were off duty at

       the    time    but    who     attended             the    match,     one    as   a

       spectator      and    one     in       his    capacity      as   a   part   time

       caterer.



(c)    Evidence       of    Senior    Officers             and   ambulancemen       who

       attended the ground as the incident developed.                              This

       will include evidence relating to the crush and rescue,

       and the difficulties which were encountered in gaining

       access    to    the    ground          and    in manoeuvering         vehicles

       within the ground and onto the pitch.



(d)    The    evidence       of    the        Chief       Ambulance     Officer,        of

       another Senior Officer (now with another service), and

       of two other officers,                  relating to SYMAS' desire                to

       have     its    officers       (and          in    appropriate       cases       an

       ambulance) present at the ground.



(e ) Evidence relating to SYMAS own                       Control Action Plan in

       the event of a major incident at Sheffield Wednesday

       and the implementation of a Major Incident Plan.



(f )   The original tapes of radio and telephone messages to

       and    from     SYMAS       Control          and    transcripts       of    those

       messages.       These are relevant to the timing of events


                                          2
            as they unfolded and to the manner in which the police

            and others in authority reacted.   A number of messages

            from the police are recorded.   The tapes are already in

            the possession of the Police.




2.   CRITICISM OF SYMAS



Criticism of SYMAS by a Community Physician and a G.P. who were

present at the disaster were widely reported in the press in the

days immediately after the disaster.    In particular the Community

Physician    is reported to have said there was a lack of control,

incompetence and lack of overall plan and the G.P. is reported to

have said that there was a lack of life saving equipment and in

particular    defibrillators.     Similar   complaints   continue   to

receive mention in the press.



Given the criticisms which have already been made,       it is highly

probable that evidence if presented will be critical of SYMAS.

The Ambulance Service should have legal representation to enable

it to refute any such criticism, and give it the opportunity to

establish the accurate position through all relevant witnesses.



3. ADVANCE WARNING



     (a)    It is difficult to anticipate precisely when adverse


                                  3
      comments or criticism will be made during the course of

      such an Inquiry,        and thus adequate advance notice may

      not always be possible.               However it is often the case

      that such criticism can be anticipated by Counsel from

      the cross examination of the other witnesses by other

      Counsel and that the nature of such criticism is                              such

      that    Counsel       can     establish           facts     refuting          that

      criticism      from     other       witnesses       before       the    critical

      witnesses themselves are called.



(b)   West   Midlands       Police        have    requested,       and       have   been

      supplied with, statements from SYMAS some of which are

      critical       of    Sheffield         Wednesday          Football          Club's

      management.           Pursuant         to       Lord     Justice        Taylor's

      direction      and    the    usual     practice,         advance       notice    of

      those criticisms will be given to the people concerned.

      Inevitably     they will        give       evidence      anticipating         such

      criticism      and will       seek to       answer deflect             or   refute

      this and may well            in so doing           attack the author of

      these criticisms.            It would be invidious if the Chief

      Ambulance Officer and other officers or staff were not

      able    to   put     these     criticisms          to    those         witnesses

      through their own Counsel who can                       test the replies by

      cross examination.           Further,           unfairness may result to

      the    SYMAS    officers        if    they       give    evidence       and     are

      themselves      cross       examined       by    the    representatives          of


                                      4
            those   witnesses    without      having     the   benefit       of   being

            represented themselves.



5. FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS



SYMAS will be in a position to make more cogent representations

to the second part of the Inquiry if it has had the opportunity

to    participate     in the    Inquiry     by    full   legal    representation.

Involvement    throughout        the    Inquiry      will      save   duplication.

Furthermore    the questions which SYMAS will wish to put, so as to

establish    its recommendations       as to what should happen in the

future,    will not greatly lengthen the proceedings,                  but will if

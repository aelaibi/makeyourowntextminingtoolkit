CORRESPONDENCE FROM MR JOE BENTON MP


Issue


Whether the Home Secretary should agree to meet Mr Benton and his
constituents, Mr and Mrs Church, who lost their son during the
Hillsborough Disaster. A copy of Mr Benton's letter is attached
at Annex A for convenience. Also attached, at Annex B, is a
letter from Liverpool City Council which similarly requests a
meeting with the Home Secretary (and the Attorney General). We
understand that this latter correspondence was transferred to the
Department of Heritage to consider, but we think it appropriate
for a Private Secretary reply to go to the Chief Executive of the
Council explaining why this was so.


Timing


2. No deadline as such, but it would seem appropriate to reply
as soon as possible.


Summary


3. Mr Benton has requested the meeting to discuss difficulties
which his constituents have faced in seeking answers to questions
about their son Gary's death during the Hillsborough Disaster.
The Liverpool City Council ask for a meeting to press the case
for an independent inquiry. Both letters refer to matters raised
in a recent "Cook Report" concerning the Hillsborough disaster.
The Home Secretary no longer has responsibilities which are
relevant to what appear to be the areas of concern.
Recommendation


4. That the Home Secretary should not agree to meet Mr Benton
and Mr and Mrs Church nor representatives of Liverpool City
Council for the reasons given in the draft replies at Annexes C
and D.


Cons iderat ion


5. The concerns raised by the "Cook Report" programme related to
the time of death fixed by the coroner and to allegations that
some witness statements were altered under police pressure to
conform to the agreed time of death. The Report alleged that the
Coroner responsible for the inquest into the deaths in the
Hillsborough disaster fixed the time of death in the face of
evidence to the contrary, at least as far as some victims were
concerned.   It was also alleged that West Midlands Police put
some pressure on witnesses to alter their statements to conform
to the time of death set by the Coroner.

6. From enquiries which have been made, we understand that there
have been no complaints by the Church family against the South
Yorkshire Police (whose responsibility it was for policing the
match that day) nor against the West Midlands Police (who
investigated Hillsborough).

7.   We understand that a number of parents of those who lost
their lives during the disaster have written to the Attorney
General (as is required) asking him to authorise an application
to the High Court under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988
seeking a direction that there should be a fresh inquest.      We
understand that the Attorney General declined an application by
several of the families (none of which was the Church family)
of the deceased because he concluded that an application to the
High Court would have no reasonable prospect of establishing that
it was necessary or desirable in the interests of justice for a
fresh inquest to be held. Since the Attorney General's decision,
there have been proceedings in the Divisional Court on an
application for judicial review in relation to the inquest. The
Divisional Court took the same view as the Attorney General on
the central issues and refused the application.

8. Following the "Cook Report" there have been renewed attempts
by Liverpool MPs to seek a fresh inquest. However, the Attorney
General has informed them that there is no basis for a further
application to the High Court for this. We are informed that in
some cases it has not always been clear whether the MPs were also
raising the possibility of a further public inquiry.        It is
clear, however, from the correspondence from Liverpool County
Council, that they do wish to press for such an inquiry.

9. Though the Home Secretary is responsible for coroner's law,
they are independent judicial officers over whom the Home
Secretary has no authority. As for the allegations against the
police which were contained in the Cook Report, the Church family
should , in the first instance, make a complaint to the Chief
Officer under Part IX of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act.
If it is the case, that a further public inquiry is what Mr
Benton and Liverpool City Council seek, then this would be a
matter for the Secretary of Sate for National Heritage to
consider since he now has responsibility for safety at sports
grounds.   (At the time of the Hillsborough disaster this was a
matter for the Home Office and it was for this reason that Lord
Justice Taylor was appointed by the then Home Secretary to
conduct his Inquiry.   His terms of reference were "To inquire
into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground......and
to make recommendations about the needs of crowd control and
safety at sports events.")

10. There is accordingly no case for the Home Secretary to meet
either Mr Benton and his constituents or Liverpool City Council.



Handling


11.   There are no special handling issues.

DRAFT LETTER           TO    MR     JOE   BENTON MP        FOR    THE    HOME    SECRETARY'S
SIGNATURE




Joe Benton Esq, JP, MP
House of Commons
London SW1A OAA




Thank      you       for    your     letter      of   27   June    on     behalf       of    your
constituents Mr and Mrs Church who lost their son during the
Hillsborough tragedy.                 You asked for a meeting to discuss the
difficulties           which      have    been    faced     by    your    constituents         in
getting answers to questions surrounding the tragic death of
their son.           You did not say what these difficulties have been.


You also referred to a recent "Cook Report" which dealt with
events surrounding Hillsborough.                      As I understand it, the concern
of   the    programme          related      to    allegations          that     some    witness
statements were altered under police pressure to conform to the
agreed time of death.                Should Mr and Mrs Church have a complaint
to make concerning police behaviour in this respect, it should
be made,         in the first instance,                to the Chief Officer of the
relevant force under Part IX of the Police and Criminal Evidence
Act 1984.


Although         I   am     responsible       for     coroner's        law,    coroners      are
independent judicial officers and Home Office Ministers have no
power to interfere in their decisions.                       The Attorney General has
power under section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 to authorise an
application to the High Court seeking a fresh inquest but I am
aware that the Attorney General has declined such applications
because he concluded that they would have no reasonable prospect
of   establishing            that    it   was     necessary       or    desirable       in   the
interests of justice for a fresh inquest to be held. I am further
aware that a number of Liverpool MPs have been in touch with the
Attorney General asking him to reconsider his decision and that
he has indicated that he remains of the view that there is no
basis for such an application to the High Court.                 I understand
that the Divisional Court,            in considering an application for
judicial review relating to the inquest, took the same view as
the Attorney.


There has, as you know, already been an independent inquiry into
the Hillsborough disaster.            Lord Justice Taylor, as he is now,
was   appointed   by   the    then    Home   Secretary   to undertake    this
inquiry because at the time of Hillsborough, the Home Office had
responsibility     for       safety    at    sports   grounds.      However,
responsibility for this matter now rests with the Department of
National Heritage and any decision to re-open the Inquiry would
now be a matter for them to consider.


I appreciate the depth of feeling of those like Mr and Mrs Church
who so tragically lost members of their family at Hillsborough.
I can only express my sincere condolences to them.               I am afraid,
however, that for the reasons given above, there is no action
which I can properly take in this matter and consequently I do
not think a meeting would serve any useful purpose.
                                                                         Annex D

DRAFT LETTER TO CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF LIVERPOOL CITY COUNCIL FOR
PRIVATE SECRETARY SIGNATURE




The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter of
28 June requesting a meeting with him following a recent "Cook
Report" concerning the Hillsborough disaster. I understand that
you wrote in similar terms to the Attorney General and that you
have received a reply from his Private Secretary on 7 July.


As I understand it, the concern of the programme related to the
allegations        that    some     witness     statements    were    altered    under
police pressure to conform to the agreed time of death.                         As far
as this issue is concerned, should the families of those who lost
their   relatives         at Hillsborough have new evidence of police
misdemeanors they should be reported, in the first instance, to
the Chief Officer of the relevant force under Part IX of the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.


The   Attorney          General's    Private     Secretary      has   explained    the
Attorney General's position in relation to this matter and there
is nothing the Home Secretary can add to this since it is purely
a   matter        for    the   Attorney       General   to    decide    whether     an
application should be made to the High Court for a fresh inquest
to be held.


There has, as you know,             already been an independent inquiry into
the Hillsborough disaster. Lord Justice Taylor, as he is now, was
appointed by the then Home Secretary to undertake this inquiry
because      at    the     time     of   Hillsborough     the    Home   Office    had
responsibility           for      safety   at    sports      grounds.      However,
responsibility for this matter now rests with the Department of
National Heritage and any decision to re-open the Inquiry would
now be a matter for them to consider.                   I have therefore passed
your letter to that Department.
In these circumstances, the Home Secretary has asked me say that
he does not think a meeting with a delegation of city councillors
in relation to Hillsborough would serve any useful purpose.

27 June 1994.

Dear Home Secretary,

Mr.       &      Mrs.          Church,


My constituents named above tragically lost    their
son    Gary  Christopher    Church,    through   the
Hillsborough disaster.   Since then, they have been
trying to pursue some form of justice through the
legal system but without success.     By justice, I
mean answers to questions that would bring forth
the  reasons  for Gary's death and identify the
causes and negligence if any, which brought about
his death.

My constituents are honourable and worthy people
genuinely seeking answers as anyone worthy of the
name parent would seek to do.

Without    going  into   any   detail  at this   stage
concerning   the  frustrations,   prevarications   and
lack of    cooperation they and I have experienced
from various members of the legal fraternity in so
many different ways, I am asking you to consider a
request,   which I now formally make to you, namely
to grant a meeting with myself, Mr. & Mrs. Church
and  their   chaplain  and   spiritual  adviser,   the



                                                   Continued over /




         --------------- 1----------------------------- Representing:. ---------------------------------------------
         Church, Derby, Ford, Linacre, Litherland, Netherton, Orrell and St. Oswald’s Wards.
Continued /




This         request         has     not       just   b een   prompted    by
t e l e v i s i o n ' s r e c e n t ed it i o n of the C o o k Report/   but
obviously             that       programme       does    bring   many    new
q u e s t i o n s r e q u i r i n g answers to the surface.

The h i s t o r y and deta i l s be h i n d that w hich Mr. &
Mrs. Chu r c h hav e had to en d u r e are ver y lengthy, so
muc h so, I felt it more a p p r o p r i a t e to ask for this
meeting         so as y o u ma y hear           at first hand the
d r e a d f u l m a n n e r in w hich m y c o n s t i t u e n t s have been
treated.

I do hope in an attempt               to seek C h r i s t i a n justice
you will give my request               f a v o u r a b l e c o n s ideration.

In conclusion, I take this o p p o r t u n i t y to m e n t i o n I
shall be tabling an E a r l y Day M o t i o n in the Commons
call ing upon you to initiate a J u d i c i a l R e v i e w in
the light of re c e n t events w h i c h do have further
b e a r i n g s on the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster.

EDM : This House, in the light of the recent TV
edit i o n        of   the     Coo k Report and the i n creasing
c o n c erns and c o n s t e r n a t i o n of the r e l a t i v e s of the
v ict i m s of the tragic H i l l s b o r o u g h d i s a s t e r calls
upon         the      Rt.     Hon.      Home       Secretary    to   order

the d i s a s t e r i n c luding recent events w hich have now
emer g e d t h r o u g h the said Cook Re p o r t programme.

I look forward        to your response.

 the o p p o rtu n ity to explain my position a little more fu lly 7

  It was. hot. my intention to encourage the families who you re p re se n t tow ards
  fu r th e r legal action,. When I declined the. application by'several of th e families
  of the deceased under- section 13 of th e Coroners. Act 1988 it was because I had
  concluded that an application to the High C o u rtw o u ld have no reasonable
  p ro sp e ct of estab lish in g th a t it was n e ce ssa ry o r desirable in'the in te re s ts of
  ju stice fo r a fresh in q u est to be held. S in ce.th at time, proceedings have been
; h eard in the Divisional C o u rt on an application for*, judicial review . Lord Ju stice
  McGowan delivered th e judgment of the co urt on 5 November 1993 which'included
  the following:


        ”1 would hold that th e inquisition was c o rre c tly completed and th e
        co ro ner's direction to the jury as to the manner in which th e y should
        approach its completion was' impeccable.               The proceedings were
        solely d irected to ascertaining-w ho the deceased was and how, when
        an d w here he came by his d eath , as th e y w ere re q u ire d to b e u n d e r
        th e s ta tu te . A ccordingly, 1 hairs discovered no good reason fo r
        o rd e rin g a new in q u est for m erely q u ash in g th e ex istin g v e rd ic ts.
          If I had found su c h a reason and had to exercise my discretion th e
          following m atters would have weighed w ith m e. What would be the
          p u rpo se of fre s h in q u ests? ; To get a v e rd ic t c riticisin g th e police?

             a case in "which it would b e rig h t to o rd e r fre sh , in q u e s ts .11

 It. is clear from, 'th a t p assag e th a t only th e most cogent 'and p e rsu asiv e fre sh
 argum ents and evidence would b e likely to 're s u lt in an o rd e r b y .the High C ourt

 carefully a a rsh a lte d an d its p ro p e r form . My position is th e re fo re .a simple one:
 I do.not a t p re s e n t believe th e re to b e a n y b asis fo r an y fu rth e r application to the
 High C ourt. I cannot, encourage y o u r c o n stitu en ts down th a t ro u te . . I remain
 willing., as is my d u ty , objectively to consider an y fu r th e r application u n d e r :
 section 18 but' it would have to be su p p o rted b y evidence in p ro p e r and adm issible
 form.

 It may be th a t you and y o u r c o n stitu en ts have in mind some f o m of fu rth e r
 in q u iry d istin ct from th e in q u est procedure'. T h at would not how ever be a m atter
 for me. It was th e Home' S e c re ta ry who appointed Sir P eter T aylor , now t i e .Lord
 Chief Ju stic e , to in q u ire into': t h e ' tragedy... '      Any question of a fu rth e r

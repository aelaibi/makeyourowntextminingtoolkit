              lived       here        for    25 years.                 I ’m e m p l o y e d      as    a Clerk         for

              On     Saturday          15th April,               1989         <150489)          my    wife     and     I decided           to     go      to

              th e      Red Lion Public                          e for a           drink        due    to     the    FA Cup         semi       f i n al

              being       played and                                   close       proximty           to    the     g r o u n d we       decided

              to     wait      till     2.40                               h r s ) before        going,        as    normally            near ly all

              the       fans       would     be                       ground       by    this        t ime.




              We     l ef t    in the        car    and       drove          toward       the        pub    in M a i n     St,      as    we     got      to

              Fox       Hill,       I saw      hundreds               of    fans    walking           towards        the      g r o u n d -; a    Ij^t of

              them       drinking           from     cans        and        particulary              bottles,        Iwasb^ing
                                                                                      PAGE
        %                                                                             S724

            careful driving as they were walking        in the road and I d i d n ’t want to

            hit a n y o n e .



            This was unusual for a normal       cup match.



            These fans had left it late to get in with time to spare.



            I also want to say that the Fox Public House         in Fox Hill was

            advertising on boards outside for food and drink for f a n s .         The boards

            were situated on the junction of Skew Hill and Salt Box Ln and Fox

            Hill R d , I think this encouraged fans to stop and have drink.



            The Red Lion was open this year to f a n s , but last year they closed

            just a l 1owing regulars   in.

                                                                                     SIGNED

   1.   INTRODUCTION
        On 1st October 1989 Helpline moved from Johnson Street Day Centre,
        Hatton Garden, to accommodation provided by South Sefton Area Health
        Authority at Walton Hospital; when Liverpool Social Services handed
        over the management of the service to Liverpool Council for Voluntary
        Services.


  2.    THE HELPLINE
        Hillsborough Helpline is a 24 hours 7 days a week telephone service,
        designed to provide a confidential response to anyone affected by the
        Hillsborough tragedy.   The service is staffed by volunteers who give
        freely of their time and skills.   All have experience of bereavement
        counselling and have immediate access to information relating to
        material and emotional support services.

        Helpline is an important part of the network of services created to
        respond to the tragedy - contacts and clear lines of communication
        have been formed with workers in Hillsborough Teams and Social Service
        Departments in many parts of the country.

        Particularly strong links have been formed with staff at the Hillsborough
        Centre in Anfield Road, to the mutual support of both.   Some of our
        volunteers have assisted at the Centre and have participated in training
        courses with workers from the statutory authorities.


  3.    USE OF HELPLINE
        Over the period 1.10.89 - 31.3.90 1,533 calls have been made to Helpline

        168 were for help related to Hillsborough.
        17 for help from people having suffered personal tragedy unrelated to
        Hillsborough.
        611 calls were for information related to the disaster.
        477 were of an administrative nature.
        260 were unsuccessful, or wrong number, or nuisance calls.

        A more detailed breakdown of the calls is attached on appendix A.




                                                                       /contd
                                        -   2   -




     Looked at across the period the figures may appear unremarkable, they
     do not, however, represent an even spread of calls.   The broadcasting,
     on 6th February, of the First Tuesday programme on the tragedy resulted
     in a marked increase in the number of calls during the week 4th-11th
     February.   125 calls were received, compared to 74 received the previous
     week, an increase of 68%.

     It is clear that there are a great deal of unresolved feelings related
     to Hillsborough, much has been internalised which may surface when public
     attention is reminded of the tragedy by the media.   An increase is
     anticipated during the Easter weekend, when the First Hillsborough
     Memorial Service will be held at Anfield.   Arrangements have been made
     to increase the staffing of Helpline over that weekend.

     The majority of the calls are from Merseyside and the North West, but
     Helpline has had a number of calls from individual members of the public
     and organisations in other parts of the country.   In addition a
     significant number have been received from people unconnected with
     Hillsborough and Liverpool, calls from people who have suffered a
     personal tragedy of a violent nature, two calls were also received from
     people affected by the Marchioness disaster.

     There appears to be some unmet need for a helpline service unconnected
     with a particular tragedy or event.    Some further research and
     experience will be needed before more informed consideration can be
     given to the viability of a resgional/national service.


4.   STAFFING
     The 724 duties since the beginning of October have been covered by some
     29 volunteers from the following organisations.

     Catholic Social Services                        21   people   -    22   duties
     Childrens Society                               28   people   -    29   duties
     Diocesan Board, of Social Responsibility        99   people   -   107   duties
     Family Link Line                                14   people   -    14   duties
     Individuals                                     25   people   -    25   duties
     Walton Hospital Relative Support Group         163   people   -   348   duties

     The balance of the duties have been covered by both the Co-ordinator
     and the Advisor.

     It can be seen that the service is maintained by volunteers giving
     freely of their time.   It is this element which makes this comprehensive
     service financially feasible.   Our thanks go out to the individuals
     and organisations who have provided the resources.




                                                                              /contd.

5.   CONCLUSIONS
     This has been a very interesting and worthwhile 6 months.    It is clear
     from the useage of the service that it has met, and continues to meet,
     a real need.    It has been the experience of other helpline services
     that the effects of a disaster may take some long time to surface and
     that new cases, needing expert help, may not arise until long after the
     tragedy itself.

     Helpline has also clearly demonstrated that the statutory and voluntary
     sectors can work together in a complimentary way, a measure of the
     confidence both have in their respective roles.

     There will be a diminishing need for the Hillsborough Helpline in the
     future, but consideration will need to be given to the manner in which
     the service can be made available for needs which may arise later.

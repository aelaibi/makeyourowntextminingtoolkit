                  On S a t u r d a y   15 April        1989 I commenced duty at H a c k e n t h o r p e           Police

Con s t a b l e 3170 F ai r c l o u g h    I was    d i r ected                    by    PS Burman to supervise

the S outh entrance             gates      to the upper                    level of the West Stand.                               Our

aim was     to s u pervise         entry by supporters and where                                       nec e s s a r y    prevent

entry by u n a u t h o r i s e d    persons.        This              entrance             consists              of two swing

metal    gates w hich       lead directly            into an enclosed                                stairwell       which

affords     access     into the upper             seated              level             of the stand.               Seven

stewards      employed      by the        club were also                    on duty at                 this entrance.

We were     i n structed      by Inspector White                      to           remain in the              enclosed            part

of the stairs         on the middle          level         and stop fans from                               runnning         up and

down the stairs,           hence     keeping       them           clear and free for access.                                      This

part    of the     ground       is familiar           to myself as my normal                                duties       on       a

Sa t u r d a y m atch are       usually employed                      in this part                   of the ground,,

For a long       period of time           very few fans                     entered this                    particular            gate

and we     chatted wit h the stewards.                           However                fans did begin to arrive

and    people    of varying ages           entered               the upper                level.            At this       point

the fans      did begin to arrive and                     people            of varying ages                      entered the

upper    level.       At   this     point the       fans were                       jovial           and a pleasureto

police with many           families       entering               the upper                stand of our              section.

The    fans were well         behaved and did not appear                                   in drink.

There was       one attempt         by a fan to enter                       the seated area without a

ticket     but he was       spotted by the                steward and ejected by PC F a i r c l o u g h

and myself.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 3 0 p m as the                                     d in a steady stream we

were    beckoned by the            stewards       to the base                      of the stairs who                     pointed

to the turnstiles           off Leppings Lane.                        We           saw a number              of young         fans

who were      climbing      over     the wall       into              the ground above                       the turnstiles.

Despite     requests       to get down by a serial                                 of officers              on the       inside of

the turnstiles         they    continued to               remain on top of the wall                                  and would

not    corne down.
The     inside       of the ground at the              rear    of the West Stand was                 now

heavily        congested with fans making                  their way onto           the     terraces.

At    1440 my a t t e nt i o n was          drawn to a group of a p p r o x i m a t e l y           six men

who were         stood urinating against                the    outside walls         of the toilets                at

the     rear     of the West Stand.                Both PC F a i r c l o u g h and myself           approached

the group.             Several      on seeing       us d i s c o n t i n u e d but one      remained stood

near     to, the wall           urinating.         Both PC F a i r c l o u g h and myself           took hold

of                                           )f

L iverpool         and he was         taken to the        police detention area.                  Because          he

began to struggle                he was     placed     in an arm        lock    by myself w h i c h           caused

some     other       fans      to use and direct         foul     language towards PC F a i r c l o u g h

and myself.

At the       police         room the      circumstances        were     outlined to the            custody

sergeant and               it was   decided to eject                           from the ground.

Details were               obtai n e d and PC F a i r c l o u g h and myself         ejected        him from

the ground.

In company with PC F a i r c l o u g h              I then began to            return to the West

S tand and our              positions.

As we wa l k e d near            to the turnstiles            off Lappings Lane a p p r o x i m a t e l y

ten minutes            later     ( 1450hours ? there was a noticeable                     d i f f e r e nce   in

the atmosphere,               the area      inside the ground was               congested and we saw

ap p r o x i m a t e l y    thirty men standing a l o n g s i d e         the walls        urinating

against        them.         Beca u s e   it was    impracticable         for the       two    of us to

arrest       e v erybody we split            up and a p p r o a c h e d all      those u r inating and

t h r e a t e n e d them wit h e v i ction from the .ground if they did not stop.

Most     did stop but            it was     b l atantly obvious         that most were            in drink.

As we      passed the           turnstiles we were a p p r o a c h e d          by fans who were

demanding         that       something      be done about         the   crowd d i r ectly outside                  who

they had just               pushed their way         through and         into the ground.               We

returned to the bottom of the                       st,eps 1 eadi ng into         the     upper     level      of
                                                                                                               P A G E     ~

the West Stand.                 It was       obvious    on our          return that       the stewards were

struggling       because             of the sheer       numbers          of fans to monitor             the    people

entering       the    stand and             rather    than argue with some                over    the validity

of their       tickets          they allowed them to enter                     the stand.         Some ^yj^s

were    obviously          dr^jnk and ^gurne^rvts 1^o^jDjUice between fans,                              stewards

and ourselves.                 Some    shoved straight             past    the stewards and             because       of

the    congestion          it was       impossible          to    physically stop them from

climbing       the    stairs.

One    of the metal             swing       gates    had been          closed and the stewards                stood

on the    inside          of    it allowing          fans    through the          right    hand one which

was    open.     PC F a i r c l o u g h and mye'lf tried to                    install     some    sort       of

o r de r and     insisted on checking                  tickets.           Those with other          standing

tickets were          d i r ected to the standing area.

Whilst at this             entrance          I noticed       the opening         of a set        of double

sliding    doors          from Lappings Lane.                    The   gates were      opened      for access

by/'fans and         I saw a moun t e d officer                   giving    instructions          to the

:;rowd.    Moments  later a number of fans surged towards                                     our entrance
                   y:.,         ; — _                        ~                                ^
and both PC F a i r c l o u g h and myself were ^umr^d^^^^lrvst                               the metal gates

a nd   it became          impossible          to    restrict access            to the upper        level.

As we tried          to    restore          normality       to the      entrance      a middle aged man

approached       us shouting words                   to the effect          "There are        people dying            in

that    stand,       being       crushed what are you                  going     to do about       it".

At this    point          both PC F a i r c l o u g h and myself               were   still      pinned against

the gates and were                   unable    to move.           I indicated a group of

approximately             eight       officers and a superv i s o r y              officer       who were          stood

in a group near                the    turnstiles and a sked that he go and                        explain to

them as they were                in a better          position to help.               However      he    continued

to shout at me             “One       six    one eight       I want you to do something                   now".

Again     I asked him to seek help from the                              other    officers and he             left.

               a p p r o a c h e d the man again and asked what                the specific        problem was.           He

               c omplained of         people    pushing and shoving and               I said     1 w ould help to

               w hich he a po l o g i s e d    for    shouting at       the    two of us.        However      on

               looking down the             tunnel    at the    rear    of the West Stand            I saw some         fans

               milling about          but did not see any             injured or      indeed anyone         who    looked

               as though they          required assistance.              I began to walk           further      into the

               tunnel    and was       requested to          return by PC F a i r c l o u g h who was

               attem p t i n g   to   radio     through to       control      to advise      them of the

               complaint.         At this       point a number         of serials       began    running      through

               the ground and towards                the    pitch area near       to the      police      control.

               I had heard nothing              on my      personal    radio and a s s u m e d fans were

               fighting.         Both PC F a i r c l o u g h and myself         i^m^^is^jTe^r         the tunrml. and

               and then      returned        to the     rear   of the West Stand.             C^n our                the

               whole area behind the stand was                                                                     on

               floor    surro u n d e d     by other       people and    police       officers.

               It was obvious          that     some were dead         lying    on the floor and many were

               injured and vomiting.                 PC F a i r c l o u g h and myself     split     up and     I went

               to the assis t a n c e         of the    injured as      did PC Fairclough.                Many were

               'placed in the          recovery      position and advice           given to onlookers              on what

               to do.      Some       supporters       were helpful,       others were         obv i o u s l y angry

               with the      police         directing      obscene    comments     towards      other     officers and

               other     officers most          of the      injured were        taken out      of the     ground and

                into an a l l e y w a y at the         rear of the      football       ground.

               Outide the ground              Inspector Sykes and his men were                   carrying      the dead

                to one side,          the    injured were       placed against         the ground walls.              I

          On arrival        of the Fire Service,             they   instructed that the a l l e y w a y at

          the     rear of the       ground should be          cleared and a one way system                be

          this area of         people and vehicles.

          A doctor a p p e a r e d     on the scene and a sked me where              the first aid             point

          was.      I told him that as far as                I was aware    it was    next    to the

          gymnasium.          He   then walked up and down the             injured    categorising             them

          into     priority for        the ambulacnes.

          Once most       of the     casualties were          cleared both PC F ai r c l o u g h and

My full name is STEVEN ANDREW SHEAR,\fOOD, I am a Police constable with eight years service
and I am based at Hackenthorpe Police Station, Occupation Lane, Hackenthorpe,      I am currently
engaged as community constable for the Hackenthorpe area of my sub - division. My Collar number
is 1618,

On Saturday 16th April 1989 I commenced duty at Hackenthorpe police station at 8.30a.m. for
duties in connection with the     F.A. Cup Semi   final between LiverpoolFootball Club and
Nottingham Forest to be held at HillsboroughFootball stadium.       With other officers I was
transported to the football ground from my home station and attended a briefing in the       North
stand where at 10.00a.m. we were spoken to by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield who was in
overall command of the event.
                                                                                                     |
My particular duties on this date    were those employed by serial thirteen under direct
supervision of P.s. 2001 Burman     in connection with the supervision of Liverpool supporters
in the West stand of the ground situated off Leppings Lane. Inspector Bullas was the officer
in overall charge of the stand.

At 11.15a.m. we took up duties in the West stand, which at     this time had no supporters inside.
At 11.50a.m. in company with Police constable 3^70 Fairclough I was directed by P.s. Burman
to supervise the South entrance gates to the upper leve|. of the west stand. Our aim was to
supervise entry by supporters and where necessary prevent entry by unauthorised persons.

This entrance consists of two swing metal gates which lead directly into an enclosed stairwell
which affords access into the upper seated level of the stand. Seven stewards employed by the
club were also on duty at this entrance.


We were instructed by Inspector White to; remain in the enclosed part of the    stairs on the
middle level and stop fans from running r'up and down the stairs, hence keeping them clear and
free for access. This part of the ground is familiar to myself as my normal     duties on a Satur­
day match are usually employed in this part of the ground.

For a long period of time very few fans entered this particular gate and we chatted with the
stewards. However fans did begin to arrive and people of varying ages entered the upper level.

At this point the fans were jovial and a pleasure to police with many families entering the
upper stand of our section.

The fans were well behaved and did not appear in drink.

There was one attempt by a fan to enter the seated area without a ticket but he was spotted
by the steward and ejected by P.c. Fairclough and myself.

At approximately 2.30p.m. as the fans entered in a steady stream     we were beckoned by the
stewards to the basem of the stairs who pointed to the turnstiles off Leppings Lane. We saw
a number of young fans who were climbing over the wall into the ground above the turnstiles.

Despite reauests to get down by a serial of officers on the inside of the turnstiles they
continued to remain on top of the v/all and would not come down.




                                                                                                     J
The inside of the ground at the rear of the West stand was now heavily congested with
fans making their way onto the terraces.

At 14.40 my attention was drawn to a group of approximately six men who were stood urniating
against the outside walls of the toilets at the rear of the West stand. Both P.c. Fairclough
and myself approached the group. Several on seeing us discontinued but one remained stood
near to the wall urinating. Both P.c. Fairclough and myself took hold of
           of                                          Liverpool and he was taken to the police detention
area. Because he began to struggle he was placed in an arm lock by myself which caused
some other fans to use and direct fould language towards P.c. Fairclough and myself.


At the police room the circumstances wjare outlined to the custody sergeant and it was decided
to eject                   from the ground. Details were obtained and P.c. Fairclough and myself
ejected him from the ground.


In company with P.c. Fairclough I then began to return to the tfest stand and our positions.

As we walked near to the turnstiles off Leppings Lane approximately ten minutes later
(1 ^ .5 0 hrs )         there was a noticable difference in the atmosphere, the area inside the ground
was congested and we saw approximately thirty men standing alongside the walls urinating
against them. Because it was impractible for the two of us to arrest everybody we split
up and approached all those urinating and threatened them with eviction from the ground if
they did not stop.           Most did stop but it was blatantly obvious that most were in drink.


As we passed the turnstiles we were approached by fans who were demanding that something be
done about the crowd directly outside who they had just pushed their way through and into
the grouAd.       tie    returned to the bottom of the steps leading into the upper level of the
west stand. It was obvious on our return that the stewards were struggling because of the s
sheer numbers of fans to monitor              the people entering the stand and rather than argue with
some over the validity of their tickets they allowed them to enter the stand* Some fans
were obviously drunk and arguments lookuplace between fans, stewards and ourselves* Some
shoved straight past the stewards and because of the congestion it was impossible to physi­
cally stop them from            climbing the stairs.


One of the metal swing gates had been closed and the stewards stood on the inside of it
alowing fans through the right hand one which was open. P.c. Fairclough and myself tried to
install some sort of order and insisted on checking tickets. Those with other standing
tickets were directed to the standing area.

Whilst at this            ntrance I noticed    the opening of a set of double sliding doors from
Leppings Lane, The gates were opened for               access by fans and I saw a mounted officer
giving instructions to the crowd. Moments later a number of fans surged towards our entrance
and both P.c. *airclough and myself were pinned against the metal gates and it became
impossible to restrict access to the upper level.
As we tried to    restore normality to the entrance a middle aged man approached us shouting
words to the effect " THERE ARE    PE0PL7 DYING IN THAT STAND,BEING CRUSHED WHAT ARE YOU GOING
TO DO ABOUT IT "

At this point both P.c. Fairclough and myself were still pinned against the gates and were
unable to move. I indicated a group of approximately eight officers and a supervisory officer
who were stood in a group near the turnstiles and asked hat he go and explain to them as
they were in a better position to help . However he continued to shout at me "ONE SIX ONE
EIGHT I '//ANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING NOW »

Again I asked him to seek help from theother officers and he left.

Several minutes later the number of fans depleted near to our entrance and P.c. Fairclough
and myself were able to move therefore I approached the man again and asked what the
specific problem was. He complained of people pushing and shoving and I said I would help
to which he apologised for shouting    at the two of us. However on looking down the tunnell
at the rear of the West stand I saw    some fans milling about but did not see any injured
or indeed anyone who looked as though they reuired assistance. I began to walk further into
the tunnel and was    requested to return by P.c. Fairclough who was attempting to radio thr­
ough to control to adiise them of the complaint. At this point a     number of serials began
running through the ground and towards the pitch area near to the police control.


I had heard nothing on my personal radio and assumed fans were fighting. Both P.c. Fairclough
and myself remained near the tunnell and were then approached by a teenage fan who complained
of chest pains.

We took this fan to the first aid point near the gymnasium, left him and then returned to
the rear of the west stand. On our return    the whole area behind the stand was littered
with casualities lying on the floor surrounded by other people and police officers.


It was obvious that some were dead    lying on the floor and many were injured and vomiting.
P.c. Fairclough and myself split up    and I went to the assistance of the injured as did
P.c. Fairclough. Many were placed in the recovery position and advice given to onlookers
on what to do. Some supporters were helpfull , other were obviously angry with the police
directing obscene comments towards other officers and myself and spitting on our uniforms.

I saw groups of other officers carrying and running out of the tunnell with unconscious
people. With other officers most of the injured were taken out of the ground and into
an alleyway at the rear of the football ground.

Outside the ground Inspector Sykes and his men were carrying the dead to one side, the
injured were placed against the ground walls. I attended to these people rendering first
aid.


On arrival of the fire service, they instructed that the al eyway at the rear of the ground

should be cleared and a One way system be operated for emergency vehicles.
Both P.c. Fairclough and myself with other officers attempted to clear this area of people
and vehicles.


A doctor appeared on the scene and asked me where the first aid point was. I told him
that as far as I was aware it was next to the gymnasium. He then walked up and down the injure
catergorising them into priority for the ambulances.


Once most of the casualities were cleared both P.c. Fairclough and myself closed the double
sliding gateefe to hide the sight of the dead on the floor outside the ground* As first aiders
and medical teams arrived we directed them to the gymnasium area*


We left Hillsborough and returned to ^ackenthorpepolice station , going off duty at ?.15p*m*

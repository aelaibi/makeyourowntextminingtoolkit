          HAMMOND SUDDARDS - REQUEST FOR MATERIAL

          I have pleasure in enclosing a letter dated 8 September 1989 from
          Hammond Suddards asking for further copies of material that they have
          already received during the course of the public inquiry.  I have no
          objection to supplying such materials, but would look to you for the
          appropriate approval.  The supply of this material will in no way
          compromise the criminal inquiry.

Dear Sir,

H illsborough

As you may know, we are acting on behalf of the South Yorkshire
Police in relation to the civil claims arising out of the
Hillsborough disaster.

 In connection with this matter, it would be most helpful if we
 could have six further copies of the compilation video and six
 further sets of the two composite photograph albums prepared by
 your Officers for distribution to the inquiry and referenced as
 RAH/Hill/l-L and RAH/Hill/2-N.

We shall be greatly obliged if you can arrange for these further
copies to be provided to us as soon as possible.

 We shall be pleased to pay your charges in this connection.


 Yours f a i t h f u l l y .




                                                                                          A-elL

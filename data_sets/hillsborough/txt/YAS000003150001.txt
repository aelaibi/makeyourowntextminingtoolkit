Ref.      :




Attending at Chesterfield Ambulance Station, with the Officer in
C h a r g e , S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Gerrard, t o g e t h e r wi t h the two
Ambulancemen whose statements require clarification.

I initially attended on       Mr        } who after reading through his
statement again, wished       to stand by the contents, and was not
prepared to alter the         final paragraph concerning the rather
chaotic nature of taking       patients to hospital.

I t h e n a t t e n d e d on Mr  [ whose comments as regards a
defibrillator were of more concern. Mr            actually confirmed
to me that he gave a ra t h e r mor e d e t a i l e d report of his
involvement in the incident (as probably did the other Derbyshire
Ambulancemen), and his report would have been edited down into
its typed written form.

I explained to Mr ^              the query concerning the defibrillator
and he confirm to me that the patient concerned was "Asystole",
i.e. the patient had no cardiac output.          Mr       confirmed the
defibrillator itself was not used, rather two paddles connected
to the m o n i t o r f o r mi n g part of the overall defibrillator
equipment were used to simply check heard action.

Mr Howes stressed that in order to use the defibrillator properly
so as to initiate an electric shock, requires a certain amount of
time to charge up the equipment.     Mr        also confirmed Don
Page's own views in his statement that aetiDrillators should not
be used in a crowed area, although he did point out to me that
the patient he was actually treating was in an isolated area away
from crowds.

Matter     :   Hillsborough - Trent Regional Health Authority

Ref.




Telephone attendance on Trevor Molton, who is the Senior Officer
at WYMAS involved with the Hillsborough incident.

I informed Mr Molton of our involvement with the Hillsborough
enquiry and initially asked him whether there would be any
o b j e c t i o n to o u r s e l v e s d i s c l o s i n g the s t a t e m e n t s of his
Ambulancemen to the West Midlands Police.                      He replied "No", and
then I asked him if he could let me have the original statements,
and he agreed to put them in the post tonight.

I did         query with Mr Molton before other A m bu l a n c e m e n who
a p p e a r e d to h a ve a t t e n d e d the i n c i d e n t but did not give
statements.        Mr Molton informed me that statements were only
obtained from those Ambulance crews who were on duty and who
attended the scene.

I asked Mr Molton whether he foresaw any Ambulanceman objecting
to disclosure of the statements to the West Midlands Police, and
to possibly get each Ambulanceman to sign a consent form prior to
disclosure to the Police.      Mr M o l t o n r e p l i e d that as the
statements had been originally obtained for the purposes of
disclosure to the enquiry there was no point in obtaining such
consents, rather we had the go ahead to disclose the statements
to the Police.   Mr Molton added that if one of his Ambulancemen
then objected to the disclosure it would be a matter for him to
deal with.

                          HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

                    Outline Submissions on behalf of
          Storeth—Yogkshxge-Metropol-i tan-Ambulance- Services - -



Pursuant to the leave granted on 28th April we apply on behalf of

      to be allowed representation at this Inquiry.           There are

three areas of the Inquiry's investigations to whichjj SYMAS^ can

give considerable assistance to the Tribunal:-



A.   PRE-MATCH ARRANGEMENTS

     1.    Although there is no statutory obligation to consult

           the ambulance services as there is as regards the fire

           brigade under Section 3 of the Safety of Sports Grounds

           Act 19^f5, in fact, there were consultations with. SYMAS

           following the publication of the Popplewell Report, as

           a result of which some                          were made at

           the request of SYMAS.



     2.    The co-operation of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

           was limited to providing two season tickets in the

           South Stand from where ambulance officers could see the

           whole ground,    and from which position their portable

           radios had good contact with emergency Control.           This

           concession was not made available for the F.A.. Cup

           Semi-Finals,    as a consequence of which two officers

           ma de             arrangements     with   police    and   were

           positioned on the touch line between the North Stand

           and Spion Kopj     From this position their overall view
     of the ground was limited.



BUILD UP TO THE DISASTER

1.   SYMAS officers were present from 2.15 p.m. onwards and

     observed the build up of crowds in the West Stand.



2.   Tiey were fir                                   lem just a£t^r ki

     o:f    and two/of'                              nvestiga^e.

     realised        /that \th                       rgency /and cller

     Control and,       as                   their    action,   the

     Majyor Accident Pla:               stituted.



3.   Wh^n      the   ambulance      crews    arrived |pursuauft^ to jthe

     initiation           the SYMAS Major7 Acci;             Plan,    their

     opemti;         were directed by those of



FUTURE PLANNING                     ,

1.   S Y MAS                            submissions      concerning      the

     inclusion of the            ambulance   services     as one of the

     bodies who should be consulted under Section 3 of the

     1975 Act.



2.   These submissions would more cogent and pertinent if

     they are in a position to have taken a full part in the

     first part of the Inquiry.
  D.   REASONS FOR REPRESENTATION
               a"
       1.   SYMJJiS ;frd as much, if nbt more, involvement tyith safety

            measures generally at the Sheffield/Wednesday Football

            Club Hillsborough Ground than/the fire services who

       2.   SYMAS   has    bee n    the   subject     i n d i r e c t l y of £ & v & r &

            criticism of two doctors which was reported widely in

            the press.      The allegations were that there was no

            control,   chaos,      lack of plan,     lack of equipment and

            incompetence generally.              If any of those allegations

            are to be repeated,        we submit that it is only right

            that SYMAS should be in a position to challenge those

            allegations in cross-examination, establish the factual

            position through examination of other witnesses, and be

            in a position to call evidence of its own to deal with

            those allegations.



       3.    SYMAS has criticisms of its own of^ Sheffield Wednesday

         have taken details of the Control Action Plan,                 the

         M ajor   Incident Plan,   and   transcripts of the tapes

          recording all messages through to Control.          It is, in

         our submission, only right that if that Plan is to be

          the subject of investigation      by    this   In q u i r y   the

          authors of that plan as well as those who implemented

          it on 15th April should have representation.

I telephoned Mr            at the Treasury Solicitors Office.   I
asked if any special arrangements had to be made for Monday.   He
said not.   He said the room was being set out so it would be
suitable for use by Counsel and solicitors.   Committee Room 3 is
being made available for use by Counsel and solicitors.

I told him that I had provided statements and other documents to
the police and I asked if it was necessary for us to provide
further copies.   He said that all copying would be done by the
Secretariat to the Tribunal.

I asked about copies of witnesses statements.             He said that
statements would be passed to all parties representatives a day
or so before evidence is given by the statement maker. At the ed
of the giving of the evidence copies of the statements would be
a v a i l a b l e for the press.      He s a i d t h a t t h e p a r t i e s
representatives would not see statements of people who are not
called to give evidence and that Lord Justice Taylor will not see
those either.       The intention is to take a representative sample
from the statements.         He said that there are six Liverpool
supporters whose evidence will be heard on Monday including
               the solicitor who was given instructions on behalf or
tne Liverpool Supporters, as he is the chairman of the Liverpool
Supporters Club.

Once we are granted representation on Monday morning copies of
the statements will be handed to us.

the St. John's Ambulance Brigade.      He knew that we had been
refused representation. He is trying to decide whether or not to
arrange for someone to conduct a watching brief for the St. Johns
but he does not know if he should be there every day.      He was
wondering what our position was.

I explained to him that we were to make a further application for
representation and that we thought we had good chances of that
being granted.

He said that he knew that copies of the statements of the
witnesses to be called in the first day or so had already been
p r o v i d e d to the o t h e r p a r t i e s who had b ee n g r a n t e d
representation.

                              STATEMENT


GERALD LESLIE WILKINSON states :

1   I was born on



2   I am employed as the Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer for

     the Hampshire Ambulance Service.



3   I   commenced    my   career   in     the    Ambulance       Service   as    a

     trainee   ambulanceman        with    the    Westmoreland        Fire      and

     Ambulance Service in April           1973.         I took the 6 weeks

     basic ambulance aid training course at West Lea Training

     School run by Lancashire Ambulance Service in September

     1983,   following    which    I    studied     for    the    Institute      of

     Certified Ambulance Personnel.



4    In 1977 I attended a two week supervisor course at the

     Ambulance Training Centre in Keighley and was promoted to

     Leading Ambulanceman in November 1976.



5    During the time which I spent as a Leading Ambulanceman I

     became involved in the training of personnel, both in the

     service and in outside organisations.                     This led to me

     qualifying as a DHSS Ambulance Aid Instructor in 1979.

     After obtaining this qualification I was used regularly

     to   instruct    both    in    service       and     at   West   Yorkshire

     Ambulance Training School, Keighley.



6    In May 1980 I was promoted to Station Officer at Penrith

     Ambulance Station.
I took up a position as Assistant Divisional Officer (HQ)

at South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service on 1st

August 1983 and in late 1986 I was promoted to Divisional

Officer   (Control      and     Communications).            I took      up    my

present position with the Hampshire Ambulance Service in

June 1988.



In    about    early    1986     Mr.    Page   told    me    that     he     was

delegating to me the job of preparing incident plans for

the    5 Football Grounds within the SYMAS region.                          Those

are    the grounds        of Sheffield Wednesday, SheffieldUnited,

Rotherham, Doncaster Rovers and Barnsley.                    It was about

this time that the Popplewell Report was published and we

were    concerned       about     the   safety    at   Sports        Grounds,

particularly in relation to the possibility of fires.



I am the officer referred to in Mr. Page's letter of 16th

January 1986, which he sent to the 5 Football Clubs and I

saw    that letter         shortly before it went out.



The    Chairman of         Sheffield Wednesday replied to theletter

of 16th January by letter of 29th January addressed to

Mr.    Page and Mr.       Page passed      that   letter         to me.         I

telephoned     the     Football    Club   to   arrange      a meeting         and

spoke     to    Mr.     Chester's         secretary         to     ma k e    the

arrangements.             I also wanted the Police to be there

and I believe they liaised with the Fire Service.
The meeting at the ground did not take place until 16th

July     1986.          I    think        the    delays    were       caused    by

difficulties of all parties being available and I think,

although I am not sure, that the Club preferred to deal

with the matter in the closed season.



The meeting of 16th July was attended by myself, Station

Officers,     Higgins       and                 , a Police Inspector and

Police Sergeant,         and two people from the Fire Brigade.

When we arrived, we were introduced to Mr. Chester (the

Club    Secretary)      who       then    left    us    with    Mr.            (the

Groundsman) who showed us round.



It was during the tour of the ground that we discussed

with    the   Police        and    Fire    Service      where    the    casualty

clearing post/mortuary would be in the event of a major

incident, this was agreed to be the gymnasium.



Following        the        tour     we     were       taken     to    see     the

physiotherapist, Mr.                     , in his room.        At that point I

believe that the Police and Fire Service representatives

left.         Mr.     Higgins,      Mr.                  and I spoke to Mr.

         about Ambulance Service cover.                    I told Mr.

that we could provide Ambulance Service resources for the

ground, but that this would involve a charge.                            He told

me that the Club would not wish to pay such a charge and

that they were happy with their current arrangements with

the     St.   Johns    Ambulance          Brigade      which    attended     their

matches and which gave first aid training to the Club's
personnel at the beginning of each season.                          He said that

whenever the Club had needed the ambulance service they

had relied upon making a 999 call.



I told Mr.               that,      if we could not actually provide

an ambulance       at    the ground we would               like     to have       two

officers       inside    the       ground    in   the      interest    of    crowd

safety.         I said that if an ambulance was required they

would     be    able    to    contact       Control      to    arrange      for    an

ambulance more quickly than the Club could do so.                            I was

talking    about crowd         safety,       but Mr.                did mention

that    if a player was             hurt    he would certainly             like    an

ambulance to arrive as quickly as possible.



I   suggested     that       the    Club    should    provide us         with     two

tickets in order that we could put liaison officers in

the ground so that they could get resources to the ground

as quickly as possible.                Mr.              said that if I wrote

to the Club then he could arrange for two tickets to be

provided.



We discussed where these complimentary seats should be.

Mr.     Smith    offered       us    two     seats    at      the   back    of    the

trainers box at pitch level but,                     after discussion with

Mr.    Higgins and Mr.                         I requested two seats in

the Stand.        There were three reasons for this



17.1      communication to Control by radio would be better

          from higher up in the Stand;
17.2      there would be a much better view of other parts

          of the ground from there;



17.3      there would be better access to a telephone and to

          the physiotherapists room.               We suggested two seats

          to Mr. Smith which were behind the directors' box

          and close to one of the exits that went down into

          the Stand.



I   subsequently         wrote      a    letter    in    the    name     of    the

Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, addressed

to Mr.    Chester at the Club,                that letter was dated 6th

August 1986.           I understand that subsequently the season

tickets were collected by Mr. Higgins or Mr.



I   had    pr e v i o u s l y    prepared      a   draft       incident       plan

applicable      to all          five of the Football           Grounds    in our

region.        The station officers assigned to each of the

grounds     then      completed         the   plans     by   filling     in    the

appropriate blanks.                In the case of Hillsborough this

was done by station officers Higgins and



At the meeting of 16th July we had discussed the question

of ambulance access to the ground but not access to the

pitch.       When that meeting took place the Spion Kop was

in the process of being built.
21   Prior to the meeting of July 1986 SYMAS had always had

     two ambulances on stand-by close the ground on the days

     of major matches, but following that meeting it has been

     possible      to   have   one   ambulance   inside    the   ground   for

     major matches and arrangements for this have always been

     made with the Police.



22   Once    the   incident     plans   had   been    prepared   for   all   5

     grounds I put copies into the Control Room.                 I monitored

        the arrangements for Football Grounds for a short time,

     until    my   promotion    to Divisional        Officer   (Control   and

     Communications).

GERALD LESLIE WILKINSON states :

1   I was born on



2   I am employed as the Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer for

     the Hampshire Ambulance Service.



3   I   commenced    my   career   in     the    Ambulance      Service   as    a

     trainee   ambulanceman        with    the    Westmoreland       Fire      and

    Ambulance Service in April 1973.                   I took the 6 weeks

     basic ambulance aid training course at West Lea Training

     School run by Lancashire Ambulance Service in September

     1983,   following    which    I    studied    for    the    Institute      of

     Certified Ambulance Personnel.



4   In 1977 I attended a two week supervisor course at the

     Ambulance Training Centre in Keighley and was promoted to

     Leading Ambulanceman in November 1976.



5   During the time which I spent as a Leading Ambulanceman I

     became involved in the training of personnel, both in the

     service and in outside organisations.                    This led to me

     qualifying as a DHSS Ambulance Aid Instructor in 1979.

     After obtaining this qualification I was used regularly

     to   instruct    both   in     service      and     at   West   Yorkshire

     Ambulance Training School, Keighley.



6   In May 1980 I was promoted to Station Officer at Penrith

     Ambulance Station.
&U,z
I took up a position as Assistant Divisional Officer (HQ)

at South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service on 1st

August 1983 and in late 1986 I was promoted to Divisional

Officer       (Control    and    Communications).            I took        up    my

present position with the Hampshire Ambulance Service in

June 1988.



In    about     early     1986    Mr.    Page   told    me    that      he      was

delegating to me the job of preparing incident plans for

the 5 Football Grounds within the SYMAS region.                              Those

are the grounds of Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United,

Rotherham, Doncaster Rovers and Barnsley.                     It was about

this time that the Popplewell Report was published and we

were    concerned        about     the   safety    at   Sports        Grounds,

particularly in relation to the possibility of fires.



I am the officer referred to in Mr. Page's letter of 16th

January 1986, which he sent to the 5 Football Clubs and I

saw that letter shortly before it went out.



The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday replied to the letter

of 16th January by letter of 29th January addressed to

Mr.    Page    and Mr.     Page passed      that   letter         to me.          I

telephoned       the    Football    Club   to arrange        a meeting          and

spoke     to     Mr.     Chester's         secretary         to     ma k e      the

and I believe they liaised with the Fire Service.

The meeting of 16th July was attended by myself, Station

          IN THE MATTER OF A PUBLIC INQUIRY

          INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


          LEADING COUNSEL'S SUBMISSIONS IN SUPPORT OF AN APPLICATION                                  BY
          TRENT REGIONAL HEALTH AUTHORITY FOR REPRESENTATION



          A.   I am instructed on behalf of             Trent Regional Health Authority

               (TRHA)     which    is   responsible        for/ the   management              of   South

               Y or k sh i r e   Metropolitan       Ambulance         Service            (SYMAS)     in

               connection        with    their    invplvement         in    the      Hillsborough

               Disaster.



          B.   An application for the ^rant             of the right to representation

               was made by my           Instructing Solicitors             at   the preliminary

               hearing on the 28th April and was refused, but you indicated

               that any party whose application was refused could make a

               further     application.          I am   instructed         to make        a    further

               application.         TRHA    seeks    representation             on   a    number     of

               grounds which jkre. set out in a letter from my Instructing

               Solicitors and in written representations from me.                              I shall

               merely summarize those representations.



          1. SYMAS EVIDENCE
                         /
          The evidence /which       SYMAS    is     able    to   produce        to   the       Inquiry
                       i
          includes:

               (a)    The observations of on duty officers who were present

                      in the ground prior to 3.00 p.m.
fc




     (b)   The evidence of two ambulancemen who were off duty at

           the    time     but    who    attended          the    match, , one      as    a

           spectator      and     one    in   his     capacity      as   a   part    time

           caterer.



     (c)   Evidence       of    Senior     Officer^        and    ambulancemen        who

           attended the ground as the/incident developed.                            This

           will include evidence relating to the crush and rescue,

           and the difficulties which were encountered in gaining

           access    to    the    ground      and     in    manoeuvering      vehicles

           within the ground and' onto the pitch.



     (d)   The    evidence       of/ the      Chief      Ambulance       Officer,        of

           another Senior Officer (now with another service), and

           of    two other officers,          relating       to   SYMAS' desire          to

           have     its   ofiicers       (and       in     appropriate       cases       an

           ambulance) present at the ground.



     (e)   Evidence/relating to SYMAS own Control Action Plan in

           the event of a major incident at Sheffield Wednesday

           and the implementation of a Major Incident Plan.



     (f)   The original tapes of radio and telephone messages to

           and    from    SYMAS    Control      and        transcripts       of     those

           messages.      These are relevant to the timing of events


                                         2
            as they unfolded and to the manner in which the police

            and others in authority reacted.   A number of messages

            from the police are recorded.   The tapes are already in

            the possession of the Police.




2.   CRITICISM OF SYMAS



Criticism of SYMAS by a Community Physician and a G.P. who were

present at the disaster were widely reported in the press in the

days immediately after the disaster.    In particular the Community

Physician    is reported to have /said there was a lack of control,

incompetence and lack of overall plan and the G.P. is reported to

have said that there was a lack of life saving equipment and in

particular    defibrillators^     Similar   complaints   continue   to
                              /
receive mention in the press.
                          /

Given the criticisms wpich have already been made, it is highly

probable that evideno'e if presented will be critical of SYMAS.

The Ambulance Service should have legal representation to enable

it to refute any such criticism, and give it the opportunity to

establish the accurate position through all relevant witnesses.
                  /
                 /
3. ADVANCE WARNING



     (a)    It is difficult to anticipate precisely when adverse


                                  3
\
    ;/




               comments or criticism will be made during the course of

               such an Inquiry,             and thus adequate advance notice may

               not always be possible.                   However it is often the case

               that such criticism can be anticipated by Counsel from

               the cross examination of the other witnesses by other
                                                                    /

               Counsel and that the nature of such criticism is                               such

               that     Counsel        can       establish*        facts    refuting          that

               criticism       from     other          witnesses       before    the    critical

               witnesses themselves are caflled.



         (b)   West    Midlands        Police       nave      requested,        and    have   been

               supplied with, statements from SYMAS some of which are

               critical        of     Sheff/eld          Wednesday        Football        Club's

               management.             Pursuant          to     Lord     Justice       Taylor's
                                            /
               direction       and    the       usual    practice,       advance       notice    of

               those criticisms/will be given to the people concerned.

               Inevitably they will give evidence anticipating such
                             /
               criticism anc[ will seek to answer deflect or refute
                                  /
               this and ma^ well in so doing                       attack the author of

               these criticisms.                It would be invidious if the Chief

               Ambulance /officer and other officers or staff were not

               able    to / put       these      criticisms        to    those         witnesses

               through/their own Counsel who can                        test the.replies by
                        /

               cross ^xamination.               Further,        unfairness may result to

               the    S,YMAS   officers           if    they     give    evidence       and     are

               themselves      cross        examined       by    the    representatives          of
               those    witnesses          without       having     the       benefit    of    being

               represented themselves.



4. STATION OFFICERS' PRESENCE                                           /



Two Station Officers were present with an ambulance and crew, in

the    ground    before     the match            startedJ          As       stated    above    their

evidence is relevant to what happened as the incident developed.

It is also highly relevant to the dealings between SYMAS and the

Club relating to involvement of the ambulance service at matches.

They    will    for    example         give      evidence     that          because   the     season
                                                  /
tickets provided to them by the Club did not cover the F A Cup

semi-final a request was made                         for tickets       to be provided            for

their    normal        seats,        but    this       request     was        declined      and    in

consequence they had to make arrangements through the police to

view the match from pitch level - a much less advantageous view

point than their normal seats in the stand ( from the point of

view    of     monitoring        events       and      effective            communication      with

Control).                        j
                            Ii

6. FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS



SYMAS will be in/ a position to make more cogent representations

to the second part of the Inquiry if it has had the opportunity

to    participate [ in           the   Inquiry         by   full    legal       representation.

Involvement       throughout               the    Inquiry     will          save     duplication.
Furthermore       the questions which SYMAS will wish to put, so as to

establish its recommendations                  as to what      should happen in the

future,    will not greatly lengthen the proceedings,                   but will if

put in the first part of the Inquiry,                        make it unnecessary for

such witnesses to return.



c*
I am instructed on behalf of those persons from whom statements

have been taken.
                                                              /
                         They all wish to have Ifegal representation if

required    to    give   evidence.            That     representation will     be    more
                                                        '/
meaningful if I am able to represent/SYMAS' officers and staff

throughout the Inquiry and in my respectful submission the SYMAS

evidence could not and should no^/ be in isolation from all the
                                                   /
evidence given at the Inquiry.                 /

D. FAIRNESS                              /
                                     /

                                 /
Each of the SYMAS officers                   and staff involved in the disaster

have been asked to supply a                   statement to the      Inquiry.        Those

statements have been prepared by my instructing Solicitors,                           but

the   officers and staff wish to be legally represented if they

are to be called.         Each of them is an important witness as to

fact as regards either one or more of the following;



            (a)    the events leading up to the incident




                                               6
      ||       (b)    the    way     the    incident          was     dealt           with       by     the
      0■*
                      ambulance service



               (c)    the   broader        issues       of        crowd           safety    at       sports

                      stadia.                                                 /
                                                                              /
                                                                          /
                                                                     /
                                                                      /
As a matter of fairness where criticisms have already been made

the ambulance service ought to be legally represented.                                               In any

event I respectfully submit that it has an equal if not greater

contribution to make than the Fire Service who have been granted
                                                        /
representation. I understand from m^ instructing Solicitors that

the    Fire    Service      argued       that    thdy       should        have       representation

since they must be consulted before the Local Authority grants a

licence       to   the   sports      stadium.               The    ambulance           service          has

significant points to make in/ relation to why it too should be

consulted.



I respectfully           submit     that        for    the         reasons           which       I    have

outlined      SYMAS      ought     to, have          full    representation                before       the
                                     /

Inquiry.                            /

        Report, of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan. Ambulance Service


        1.    Two Liyison Officers of Station Officer rank were based inside

              Hillsborough with radio communicatione well before the kick off.                    It

              is our normal policy to have one or both Liaison Officers at every match,

              and both a t t e n d   every major game.   The Liaison Officers were stationed

              at pi U ’b level as for major matches the Club does not supply the tickets

              for the south stand which we normally receive.              In addition there was

              a fully equipped emergency ambulance with two crew members at the
              ground and another as back up at Middlewood Ambulance Station, a little
   #          under one mile away.          Both ambulances were specifically assigned to

              thiE match;         that is our usual procedure for major football matches
              at 113.1 lBhorough.



        2.    The first notification received by SYMAS of any need for our

              involvement came at 1508 hours from Police Headquarters when a fleet

              of ambulances was requested to attend at the Leppings Lane entrance
              to the ground;         no notification of the nature of the incident was

              received.


        3.    Within 15 minutes eleven SYMAS ambulances had reached Hillsborough.

              In total forty two ambulances attended, of which thirty one were
              SYMAS vehicles and eleven came from outside areas.                  Most of these

              vehicles made several trips between the ground and the Sheffield

              hospital b .        In addition further vehicles were brought in from

              outside SYMAS and were put on stand by.



              A Divisional Superintendent arrived on the scene before 1515 hours,

              the Deputy Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer and the Senior Duty

              Officer arrived at Hillsborough at 1523 hours and the Assistant Chief

              Metropolitan Ambulance Officer (Operations) before 1600 hours.

    Many thanks for all your and Brian Edwards' help in dealing with the
    numerous enquiries I have had from the Home Office in connection with
    the Hillsborough Disaster.

    The Home Secretary's statement to the House today is expected to refer
    to his request for immediate factual reports on events from the police
    and other services, the local authority and the Football Association.
    Officials at the Home Office have been in touch and asked me to ensure
    that these reports include ones from the local health authority and the
    ambulance service.   When we spoke about this you kindly agreed to set
    the wheels in motion.

   I should emphasise that these reports should be confined to statements
^fcof the facts about their involvement in the rescue operation. They are
^^^not expected to address the many wider issues that are properly a matter
   for the official Inquiry.

^   I have told Home Office that we shall try to provide them with these two
    factual reports as quickly as possible.      Do you think it would be ^
    possible to let me have them by the end of next week?      I realise(the^
    many other calls on everyone's time, particularly at the moment may make
    this very difficult, but do let me know if you feel it is an impossible
    task.

                                                                                            Yours sincerely

 Dear Mr

 I refer to your letter of 17th April, 1989 requesting immediate factual
 reports concerning the involvement of our Hospitals, and Ambulance and
 Blood Transfusion Services in the Hillsborough Disaster on Saturday 15th
 April, 1989.

 As I have already informed you, extensive debriefing is proceeding in
 preparation for our participation in Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry and the
 reports prepared (copies attached) are necessarily of a preliminary and
 factual nature in order to avoid, as I am sure we must at this stage, wider
 issues which are properly in the province of the other Inquiries.

  Apart from our involvement in the official Inquiry, arising from the
  Region’s responsibilities under Circular HC(77)1, we will shortly be
  holding our own Region/District debriefing meeting with a view to
  formulating in due course a report for submission to the Regional and
  District Health Authorities and the Department and consideration of any
  operational matters which need dealing with in advance of the official
  Inquiry.

  Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any further information
  you require.

  Yours sincerely

            BRIEF FACTUAL REPORT RELATING TO THE HOSPITALS RESPONSE TO THE
             HILLSBOROUGH EMERGENCY OF SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 15 APRIL 1989

     1   Activation of Maior Disaster Plan

         1.1 From approximately 15.15 hours on Saturday, 15 April, information
             regarding some form of incident began to reach the Hospitals in
             Sheffield through staff making enquiries following media reports.

         1.2 Northern General Hospital

             At approximately 15.20 hours, a telephone message was received at the
             Northern General Hospital switchboard from police asking the hospital
             to ‘stand b y ’ as there was an incident with casualties at
             Hillsborough.     A further message was received at approximately 15.25
             hours that a paediatric cardiac arrest was on route to the
             Northern General Hospital.     At approximately 15.27 hours the
             paediatric cardiac arrest arrived and proved to be the first casualty
             from Hillsborough.     The ambulance driver stated that there had been
             a major accident at the Football Ground.

         1.3 Charge Nurse Batty at the Northern General Accident and Emergency
             Department arranged for the Accident and Emergency Department to be
             prepared for receipt of a large number of casualties, having
             instructed his staff nurse to commence the Accident and Emergency
             call-out cascade for a major disaster.

         1.4 The Accident and Emergency Department contacted the switchboard at
             approximately 15.35 hours and asked for all available medical staff
             to be called to attend the Department.   This was done.

         1.5 Meanwhile, Mrs B Williams, Assistant Matron, went to the switchboard
             and, at approximately 15.43 hours, she and the telephonist
             implemented the call out of staff for a major disaster.    The
*            Royal Hallamshire Hospital confirmed that it, too, had been asked to
             ‘stand b y ’ by the police.

         1.6 At approximately 16.00 hours, the Consultant in Accident and
             Emergency arranged with SYMAS for further cases to be taken to the
             Royal Hallamshire Hospital (which was, in fact, already receiving
             casualties.

         1.7 The Roval Hallamshire Hospital

             At approximately 15.20 hours, a telephone call was received from a
             Police Inspector by the nurse in charge of the Accident and Emergency
             Department asking the Hospital to stand by and to expect casualties
             from an incident at Hillsborough.   The switchboard, which had been
             monitoring the call, immediately advised key members of staff of the
             receipt of this message.   The key members of staff included the duty
             Administrator, Accident and Emergency staff and duty Assistant
             Matron.   Preparation of the Accident and Emergency Department, in
             anticipation of a possible major accident alert, commenced.    At


                                                       1
   approximately 15.30 hours, police arrived to set up a control room
   and, in response to a hospital staff enquiry, confirmed that a major
   alert was in being and the hospital duty Nursing officer notified
   switchboard which commenced cascade call out for staff in accordance
   with major disaster procedure.

Accident and Emergency Department

2.1 The first casualties arrived in the Northern General Hospital
    Accident and Emergency Department at approximately 15.27 hours and
    the last at approximately 16.45 hours.   The Department was cleared
    by approximately 17.30 hours.

2.2 The first casualty arrived in the Royal Hallamshire Hospital Accident
    and Emergency Department at approximately 15.40 hours and the last at
    approximately 17.01 hours.   The Department waS cleared by
    approximately 18.15 hours.

Site Medical Teams

3.1 SYMAS called the Northern General Hospital for an emergency medical
    team to attend the site at approximately 15.45 hours.    The team, !
    comprising two doctors, was collected by ambulance from the
    Northern General Hospital at approximately 15.55 hours (earlier
    response was not possible because of the volume of casualties in the
    Accident and Emergency Department).   The team was sent back on
    arrival at the Ground but the equipment (resuscitation box etc) was
    retained for use at the Ground.

3.2 There is no record of the Royal Hallamshire Hospital having received
    a request although it had put a team on stand by, ready to respond to
    any request to attend the site of the incident.   No ambulance
    reported to collect the team.

Patients Statistics

4.1 Brief statistics, concerning casualties received at the Sheffield
    Hospitals from the incident are as follows

                                      NGH           RHH             T0TAI-

4.2 The total number of casualties remaining in hospital at 09.00 hours
    on Wednesday, 26 April was 1 (in Intensive Care) at the
    Northern General Hospital and 4 (all in Intensive Care) at the
    Royal
    Hallamshire Hospital.

4.3 It is understood that 3 minor casualties were also taken to Barnsley
    District General Hospital.

Hospital Responses

5.1 Debriefing of personnel involved in the hospital response is
    proceeding, primarily aimed at identifying whether improvements in
    the procedures, either in the individual hospitals, across the
    District or in the inter-face with the other emergency services can
    be made for future planning.

5.2 IT IS, HOWEVER, CLEAR THAT THE NORTHERN GENERAL AND ROYAL HALLAMSHIRE
    HOSPITALS RESPONSES WERE TIMELY, EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE, AND S1AFF
    HAVE EVERY REASON TO BE SATISFIED AT THEIR RESPONSE AND OF THE
    QUALITY OF SERVICES PROVIDED AT THE HOSPITALS.

5.3 Psychological support services have been provided to the hospital
    staff at the hospitals involved in the emergency, as well as to many
    others involved in the disaster.

5.4 Other hospitals involved in support roles were:-

    5.4.1 King Edward VII Hospital to which transfers were made (19
          orthopaedic) early in the emergency to clear beds at
          Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

    5.4.2 Lodge Moor Hospital, which prepared (1 ward) ready to receive
          transfers to clear beds at the district general hospitals; no
          transfers were made, but see also note (5.4.6) below.

    5.4.3 Beds were cleared at the Jessop Hospital for Women, again ready
          for transfers to clear beds at the two district general
          hospitals and to release staff for the district general
          hospitals.   No transfers of patients were subsequently made.

    5.4.4 Children’s Hospital brought its state up to full alert ready to
          receive casualties if required.

    5.4.5 Staff from several hospitals and from District and Regional
          Headquarters departments went to and undertook duties at the
          two district general hospitals.

    5.4.6 The Bed Bureau, on hearing of the major emergency, arranged
          with Chesterfield and Rotherham Hospitals to take general
          practitioner emergency admissions if required and Lodge Moor
          Hospital to take medical emergencies.

    5.4.7 Barnsley District General Hospital received 3 casualties.
          Subsequently, at the request of the Sheffield Hospitals
          Control, Rotherham District General Hospital took on the
          ‘initial receiving centre’ for casualties for any further major
          emergency which might occur, and for which the Sheffield
          hospitals would normally have been selected for response, until
          9.00 am on Sunday, 16 April.   The Sheffield Hospitals Control
          confirmed with Barnsley that the Barnsley District General
          Hospital could stand down at 18.45 hours.

Communications

6.1 Communications within and between the two district general hospitals
    were very effective.   The rapport between the emergency service
    representatives on the hospital sites was good. Many calls from the
    public came to the hospitals because of apparent difficulties in
    contacting the police emergency number.

Volunteers and Other Agencies

7.1 Volunteers from organisations and individuals reported to hospitals
    to give assistance and made effective contributions, as did the
    social work staff of the Sheffield City Council.   Numerous offers of
    help, particularly to provide accommodation and transport, were
    received from Sheffield residents.

Conclusion
                                                                           {.


8.1 Finally, the hospitals would wish to formally recognise the many
    offers of help, condolence and support which were received during and
    after the initial emergency, and the many visits (official and
    unofficial) which contributed significantly to the morale of
    patients, relatives and staff.

8.2 Pre-arranged visits were made to the Northern General and
    Royal Hallamshire Hospitals by the following:-

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - 15TH APRIL 1989


Report of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service



1.   Two Liaison Officers of Station Officer rank were based inside

     Hillsborough with radio communications well before the kick off.        It
     is our normal policy to have one or both Liaison Officers at every match,

     and both attend every major game.      The Liaison Officers were stationed
     at pitch level as for major matches the Club does not supply the tickets
     for the south stand which we normally receive.      In addition there was

     a fully equipped emergency ambulance with two crew members at the

     ground and another as back up at Middlewood Ambulance Station, a little
     under one mile away.      Both ambulances were specifically assigned to

     this match;   that is our usual procedure for major football matches
     at Hillsborough.



2.   The first notification received by SYMAS of any need for our

     involvement came at 1508 hours from Police Headquarters when a fleet
     of ambulances was requested to attend at the Leppings Lane entrance

     to the ground;     no notification of the nature of the incident was

     received.


3.   Within 15 minutes eleven SYMAS ambulances had reached Hillsborough.

     In total forty two ambulances attended, of which thirty one were

     SYMAS vehicles and eleven came from outside areas.      Most of these

     vehicles made several trips between the ground and the Sheffield
     hospitals.    In addition further vehicles were brought in from

     outside SYMAS and were put on stand by.



4.   A Divisional Superintendent arrived on the scene before 1515 hours,

     the Deputy Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer and the Senior Duty
     Officer arrived at Hillsborough at 1523 hours and the Assistant Chief

     Metropolitan Ambulance Officer (Operations) before 1600 hours.
    1519 hours SYMAS was informed by the Police that they had told the

 Royal Hallamshire and the Northern General Hospital of the incident

 at Hillsborough.   At 1520 hours, SYMAS informed Barnsley and Rotherham

 District General Hospitals that the incident had escalated and at

 1523 hours a Charge Nurse at the Northern General Hospital was verbally

 informed by a Leading Ambulanceman that a major incident had been

 declared.


 At 1536 hours the.Royal Hallamshire were asked to supply a medical team.
 At 1538 hours the same request was made of the Northern General and at

 1540 hours of the Barnsley District General Hospital.    The medical

 teams from each o f .the Northern General and the Barnsley District

 General were taken to the ground by ambulance.



 The major incident vehicle arrived at the ground at 1540 hours.



 One hundred and seventy two casualties were taken to hospital by
 ambulance, initially to the Northern General and then to the Royal

 Hallamshire.   Two patients were taken to Barnsley District General

 Hospital.


 All casualties had been removed from Hillsborough by 1620 hours.


 Ninety four fatalities were taken to the Medico Legal Centre in

 Sheffield, some after having been returned from the Northern General

 and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals.    The last of the fatalities left

 Hillsborough at 0528 hours on Sunday 16th April 1989.



incident was closed at 0530 hours on Sunday 16th April 1989.

                   1.1 From approximately 15.15 hours on Saturday, 15 April, information
                       regarding some form of incident began to reach the Hospitals in
                       Sheffield through staff making enquiries following media reports.

                   1.2 Northern General Hospital

                         At approximately 15.20 hours, a telephone message was received at the
                         Northern General Hospital switchboard from police asking the hospital

                  6.1 Communications within and between the two district general hospitals
                    / were very effective.   The rapport between the emergency service
                      representatives on the hospital sites was good. Many calls from the
                      public came to the hospitals because of apparent difficulties in
                      contacting the police emergency number,

            7     Volunteers and Other Agencies

                      offers of help, condolence and support which were received during and
                      after the initial emergency, and the many visits (official and
                      unofficial) which contributed Significantly to the morale of
                      patients, relatives and staff.

GERALD LESLIE WILKINSON states :

1   I was born on



2   I am employed as the Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer for

     the Hampshire Ambulance Service.



3   I     commenced   my   career   in     the    Ambulance      Service   as    a

     trainee     ambulanceman       with    the    Westmoreland       Fire      and

    Ambulance Service in April             1973.         I took the 6 weeks

     basic ambulance aid training course at West Lea Training

     School run by Lancashire Ambulance Service in September

     1983,    following    which    I    studied    for    the    Institute      of

     Certified Ambulance Personnel.



4   In 1977 I attended a two week supervisor course at the

     Ambulance Training Centre in Keighley and was promoted to

     Leading Ambulanceman in November 1976.



5   During the time which I spent as a Leading Ambulanceman I

     became involved in the training of personnel, both in the

     service and in outside organisations.                     This led to me

     qualifying as a DHSS Ambulance Aid Instructor in 1979.

     After obtaining this qualification I was used regularly

     to    instruct    both   in     service       and    at   West   Yorkshire

     Ambulance Training School, Keighley.



6   In May 1980 I was promoted to Station Officer at Penrith

     Ambulance Station.
<




    *1    I took up a position as Assistant Divisional Officer                           (HQ)

          at South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service on 1st

          August 1983 and in late 1986 I was promoted to Divisional

          Officer       (Control   and     Communications).               I took up        my

          present position with the Hampshire Ambulance Service in

          June 1988.



     8    In    about    early     1986    Mr.    Page    told       me   that     he    was

          delegating to me the job of preparing incident plans for

          the 5 Football Grounds within the SYMAS region.                               Those

          are the grounds of Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United,

          Rotherham, Doncaster Rovers and Barnsley.                        It was about

          this time that the Popplewell Report was published and we

          were    concerned        about    the       safety    at    Sports      Grounds,

          particularly in relation to the possibility of fires.



     9    I am the officer referred to in Mr. Page's letter of                           16th

          January 1986, which he sent to the 5 Football Clubs and I

          saw that letter shortly before it went out.



     10   The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday replied to the letter

          of 16th January by letter of 29th January addressed to

          Mr.    Page    and Mr.    Page passed          that   letter         to me.       I

          telephoned       the   Football     Club     to arrange         a meeting       and

          spoke     to     Mr.     Chester's           secretary          to    make     the

          arrangements.              I also wanted the Police to be there

          and I believe they liaised with the Fire Service.




                                                  2
The meeting at the ground did not take place until 16th

July     1986.           I    think        the    delays    were       caused    by

difficulties of all parties being available and I think,

although I am not sure,               that the Club preferred to deal

with the matter in the closed season.



The meeting of 16th July was attended by myself, Station

Officers,      Higgins and                          a Police Inspector and

Police Sergeant,          and two people from the Fire Brigade.

When we arrived, we were introduced to Mr. Chester (the

Club    Secretary)       who       then    left    us    with    Mr.            (the

Groundsman) who showed us round.



It was during the tour of the ground that we discussed

with     the   Police        and    Fire    Service      where    the    casualty

clearing post/mortuary would be in the event of a major

incident, this was agreed to be the gymnasium.



Following         the        tour    we      were       taken     to    see     the

physiotherapist, Mr.                        in his room.        At that point I

believe that the Police and Fire Service representatives

left.          Mr.     Higgins,      Mr.                  and I spoke to Mr.

Smith about Ambulance Service cover.                        I told Mr.

that we could provide Ambulance Service resources for the

ground, but that this would involve a charge.                             He told

me that the Club would not wish to pay such a charge and

that they were happy with their current arrangements with

the     St.    Johns    Ambulance          Brigade      which   attended      their

matches and which gave first aid training to the Club's
personnel at the beginning of each season.                          He said that

whenever the Club had needed the ambulance service they

had relied upon making a 999 call.



I told Mr.               that,      if we could not actually provide

an ambulance       at    the ground we would               like to have           two

officers       inside    the       ground    in   the      interest    of    crowd

safety.          I said that if an ambulance was required they

would     be    able    to    contact       Control      to    arrange      for    an

ambulance more quickly than the Club could do so.                            I was

talking      about crowd       safety,       but Mr.                did mention

that    if     a player was         hurt he would          certainly       like    an

ambulance to arrive as quickly as possible.



I suggested       that       the    Club    should    provide       us with       two

tickets in order that we could put liaison officers in

the ground so that they could get resources to the ground

as quickly as possible.                Mr.              said that if I wrote

to the Club then he could arrange for two tickets to be

provided.



We discussed where these complimentary seats should be.

Mr.     Smith    offered       us    two    seats     at      the   back    of    the

trainers box at pitch level but,                     after discussion with

Mr.    Higgins and Mr.                         I requested two seats in

the Stand.        There were three reasons for this



17.1      communication to Control by radio would be better

          from higher up in the Stand;
17.2      there would be a much better view of other parts

          of the ground from there;



17.3      there would be better access to a telephone and to

          the physiotherapists room.               We suggested two seats

          to Mr. Smith which were behind the directors' box

          and close to one of the exits that went down into

          the Stand.



I   subsequently         wrote      a    letter    in    the   name    of    the

Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, addressed

to Mr.    Chester at the Club,                that letter was dated 6th

August 1986.           I understand that subsequently the season

tickets were collected by Mr. Higgins or Mr.



I   had    pr e v i o u s l y    prepared      a   draft     incident       plan

applicable      to all          five of the Football Grounds in our

region.        The station officers assigned to each of the

grounds     then     completed          the   plans     by   filling   in    the

appropriate blanks.                In the case of Hillsborough this

was done by station officers Higgins and



At the meeting of 16th July we had discussed the question

of ambulance access to the ground but not access to the

pitch.       When that meeting took place the Spion Kop was

in the process of being built.
^1    Prior to the meeting of July 1986 SYMAS had always had

      two ambulances on stand-by close the ground on the days

      of major matches, but following that meeting it has been

      possible      to   have   one     ambulance    inside   the   ground    for

      major matches and arrangements for this have always been

      made with      the Police.



 22   Once    the    incident    planshad     been    prepared      for   all      5

      grounds I      put copies into the Control Room.              I monitored

         the arrangements for Football Grounds for a short time,

      until    my    promotion     to    Divisional    Officer(Control       and

         Communications).

For the Attention of Miss

Dear Sirs,

                            Hillsborough Disaster Inquiry

    I refer to your letter of 26th May to Mr. Whalley, a copy of which you
kindly copied to me.

    May I first confirm that this Inquiry is a non-statutory one, and is not one
to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 applies.

    Secondly, Counsel to the Inquiry, Mr. Andrew Collins, Q.C., does not
consider that the response of the hospitals, once they had received the necessary
information, is really in issue in this Inquiry at either stage. (Stage 1 of the
Inquiry is the oral hearing stage which is currently proceeding and is
concentrating on the events at Hillsborough on 15th April; in Stage 2 Lord Justice
Taylor will be considering what recorrmendations to make as to the future about
the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events).

    Reccnmendations as to possible improvements (if any) in the hospital
response may well be relevant at Stage 2. However, Counsel to the Inquiry
considers that there is no real reason why Mr. Wardrope should be called at
Stage 1. He does not therefore see any objection in principle to Mr. Wardrope's
participation in the Conference to which you refer or to the publication of the
article in question, provided that the scope of Mr. Wardrope's contribution in
both cases is limited to the response of the hospitals and does not extend to
such matters as the response of the ambulance service which are going to be
dealt with at Stage 1 of the Inquiry.

    So long as Mr. Wardrope proceeds with his conference/article contributions
on this basis, Counsel does not see any real danger of prejudice. Indeed, it
might even be thought helpful for interested parties to discuss what ought to be
reccnmended with a view perhaps to sensible suggestions for the future, relating
to the "hospital response", being made to Lord Justice Taylor during Stage 2 of
the Inquiry.

    As you know, Messrs. Dibb, Lupton, Broomhead of 6 Butts Court, Leeds (Tel:
0532-439301; Mr. Callaghan) are representing the Trent Regional Health Authority
   'm
(which includes the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service) at the Public Inquiry,
am sure that, if your clients had any representations to make to Lord Justice
                  ,
Taylor at Stage 2 Messrs. Dibb, Lupton, Broomhead would be grateful if you
would contact than so that your representations can be incorporated with the
submissions they are preparing for Stage 2 of the Inquiry.

                                   Yours faithfully,




                                    Assistant Treasury Solicitor

Dear John,

Hillsborough Inquiry

Oxley & Coward have written to the Treasury Solicitor about a
conference on disasters at which Mr Wardrope has been invited
to s p ea k to e n q u i r e as to w h e t h e r there would be any
objection to his doing so.         The Treasury Solicitor spoke to
M r K a l l i p e t i s and I, and he said that he could see no
objection provided Mr Wardrope was not going to say anything
which expressly or impliedly criticised others (in particular
SYMAS).

I enclose a copy of the Treasury Solicitor's reply to Oxley &
Coward.     You may feel it appropriate to speak to them direct
to r e i n f o r c e the po int and to ask for a d ra f t of Mr
Wardrope's talk.

The Treasury Solicitors also suggest in their letter that the
hospitals liaise with us in relation to any representations
which they might wish to make to stage 2 of the Inquiry;
obviously we should ensure that we are not p u l l i n g in
different directions.

Yours sincerely,

Yours sincerely,

Matter:        Hillsborough

Ref:           AJC/SO'C



I returned Roger Morley's call.       He told me that the W e s t
" idlands Police had been on to SYMAS on Saturday asking for the
  ome address and telephone numbers of Mr       and Mr Yoxall (Mr
        went to the match with Mr Yoxall).     These had not been
given to the police who had been told to ring back on Monday
morning.    He wanted to know what to do when they rang back. I
told him that he should tell the police that if they wanted to
contact Mr Yoxall or Mr Moxon they should make any arrangements
through me or through       and I suggested that he gave them the
Leeds and Sheffield Office telephone numbers.     I told him that
he could tell the police that Mr Yoxall was being called to give
evidence anyway.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough Inquiry
Our Clients: SYMAS and Trent RHA

We confirm the arrangement whereby the eleven SYMAS witnesses
will be called to give their evidence on Tuesday 20th June.
Rotas have been arranged so that all of the SYMAS witnesses
are available on that day with the exception of Mr ________
who is on holiday until the evening of 26th June; we suggest
that Mr         's statement be read out and that he be made
available tor cross examination at a later stage if required.

Our clients, our Counsel and ourselves are concerned that the
SYMAS evidence which is to be called will not give a full
picture of the extent of the SYMAS involvement on 15th April
and Mr Kallipetis will be speaking to Mr Collins to suggest
that other statements be put in as evidence without the
makers of the statements actually being called.

Yours faithfully,

    Matter:       Trent RHA - Hillsborough

    Ref:          AJC/SO'C


    I telephoned Dr. Alderslade (the RMO at Trent) he was not there
    but I spoke to his secretary. I told her that I was now informed
#    hat the doctors would be called on the 20th and 21st June and
     ot the 19th and 21st.   I told her that the SYMAS evidence would
    also be on the 20th, although I did not think that the RMO wanted
    to hear that particularly.   I told her that as soon as I had more
    details as to what sort of times the doctors are likely to be
    called I would pass that on to Dr. Alderslade.    I also asked her
    to tell the RMO that we were now informed that Dr. Phillips would
    not be called because he could not make arrangements to be there
    on those two days although it was possible that he would be
    called on a later day.

                       Dear Sirs

                       Hillsborough Inquiry
                       Our Clients - Trent RHA/SYMAS

                       We refer to the transcript of the Police VHF Channel 1 tape from
                       Snig Hill, reference SA/1 and KWP 30/15/17.    On page 8 of that
                       transcript there is a conversation to which           is a party.
                       From listening to the tape it seems that 'I    is also a party to
                       a number of other conversations which appear on that transcript.

                             is recorded on the transcript as enquiring of PC Ryan at
                       police ground control at Sheffield Wednesday, whether or not
                       there was a requirement for ambulances at 14.59.

                       Our Counsel, both in cross examination of police witnesses and by
                       requests to the West Midlands Police, has tried to ascertain the
                       identity of }     without success,

                        The importance of the evidence which 'I   [ may be able to give,
                        given the fact that the police at Hillsborough did not summon
                        assistance from SYMAS until 15.08, is abundantly clear.

                        We cannot understand why the identity of '____ remains unknown.
                        Would you please pursue the matter with the relevant police
                        authority.


                        Yours faithfully

      Actions of Mr R Clarke, Control Superintendent, on 15th April 1989,
      regarding the Hillsborough Incident




      1400 hours                    I commenced duty as                 Superintendent in charge of Control
                                    covering the South Yorkshire area,                                 I commenced my duty
                                    by     reading        the    necessary            details          associated          to    the
                                    Football          Association         Semi-Final              to    be        held     at    the
                                   Hillsborough             Football        Stadium,          between         Liverpool          and
                                   Nottingham Forest Football teams.


                                   I      did   this      in    order     to     update myself               on    the     Officer

                                   of supporters routes and car parking facilities*                                          These
                                   documents had been supplied                        to Control by the Assistant

                                   them to be read in conjuction with our own internal plan
                                   for     any       incident     which         way     arise      at     the      Hillsborough

                                   time.        He said that people had been pushed and shoved and
                                   there may be people injured*                         I then asked him if he was

                                   "No,     not      at   the moment,            we   will      come      back      to     you   if
                                   necessary” .           There was quite a long pause and he returned
                                   by saying that he was requesting a fleet of Ambulances,
                                   that there were lots of people injured*

                           X told him we would send an initial response and assess
                           the situation from that point.                      He said      that he needed

       Actions    of     Station Officer         F Higgins      at Hillsborough          Football Ground          on
       Saturday 15th April 1989.




       1400 hour 9                       I reported for duty at Longley Aabulance Station and
                                         along    with     Mr   Eason,        ^Ambulancemen                      and

                                         Football Ground*


       1410                              I arrived at Hillsborough and did a radio check both
                                         on   the Ambulance      radio    and    on     the hand      set.       All
                                         radios were in good working condition.


       1415                              I liaised with Inspector             Sewell of       South Yorkshire
                                         Police and was accompanied by Mr Eason in line with
                                         our agreed plan*        I visually checked the Ground from
                                        my position at the            Spion Kop end of           the pitch.        I
                                         could   see     that   the    Nottingham        Forest      end   of    the
                                        Ground,    ie,    the Spion Kop end, was almost full.                      I
                                        viewed    the    Leppings      Lane     Terraces      and    Stands      and
                                        could     see    that    there        were    very     few     Liverpool
                                         supporters in the Ground and that                   there was       plenty
                                        of space to be taken up.              A* some stage between 1415

I                                       and   1450     I remember      Liverpool      supporters       urinating
                                        on us from the family enclosure in the Spion Kop.


       1450 (Approx)                    We moved our position from the Ambulance area at the
                                        ramp, to the pitch in order to gain visual contact
                                        of the stadium and its crowd during the match.


       1503                             I saw what I thought to be a crowd problem occurring
                                        behind the goal in the Leppings Lane Terraces,                          Pens

                                         informed me that he had identified one casualty with

%                                        because of the surge I had seen, I decided to return

       1508:49                               I was      returning to         the Ambulance when my hand set
                                             began to receive a message from Control.                                   They asked
                                             me   to     assess     the    situation                at    the     Leppings       Lane
                                             area,      as     they     were         receiving             various        sets     of
                                             information fro at the Police and it was difficult for
                                             them to assess the Ambulance needs at that time.


                                             I had returned to the Ambulance and was                                    conversing
                                             with Control using the Ambulance radio during which
                                             time a uniformed Police                     Sergeant appeared and                   told


%                                            me of the incident at the Leppings Lane Terraces and
                                             that he      thought there may be                       some       fatalities*        He
                                             was extremely aggressive, was swearing and was in a
                                             state of panic. I informed him that I had called for
                                             10 more Ambulances and that they were on the way and
                                             that      this      vehicle         had           to        stop      as    a     Radio

                                             then left and returned to the pitch area.


                                             By   this    time Mr       Eason was              the Incident Officer on

                                             told      them that       there were            50      to 100 people on             the
                                             pitch,      who      appeared          to       have         been     squashed       and

                                      I then went into the Gymnasium and spoke to a Police
                                      Inspector,        1 did not            recognise him,               I told him of
                                      the situation as I saw it and he immediately cleared
                                      the     Gymnasium           of     all        Police              Officers,        after

          1517:22                     I again returned onto the pitch at Leppings Lane and
                                      spoke to Mr Eason (Video 1517).                               I tried to assess
                                      the casualty numbers, but it was impossible as there
                                      were far too many people milling around and                                   1    could

                                      I     returned        to    the     Ambulance               and     was    unable      to
                                      contact Control             on the radio.                   The vehicle by this
                                      time had casualties in it which had been brought by
                                      the Police and fans,


                                      I     saw   a    male      youth       laying          in    the     Ambulance        who
                                      needed      resuscitation.                    I     immediately             began      to
                                      resuscitate him.               When Mr Eason arrived I asked him
                                      to remove        a female,         from the back of the Ambulance
                                      because     of    the       stressful         situation            she was      in    and
                                      the fact that she was having an asthmatic attack.

                      Mr Easoa placed her in the front attendants seat of
                      the    Ambulance*              I     continued               to     resuscitate           the

                      directed them to take the bodies to the Gymnasium*

                       in the Gymnasium                and that at that                   moment in time I

                      Mr Eason arrived and returned with Mr Hopkins on to
                       the pitch.          1 continued to direct the fans into the
                      Gymnasium          and    organise          casualties              into      Ambulances
                       for evacuation to hospital.


    1530 (Approx)      Superintendent           Dale      arrived,             I    briefed        him    and    he
                      began       to      direct       Ambulances                  in     preparation           for
                       loading      and    evacuation.               He        took      over my         position
                      and    1    then    proceeded back                  to       the pitch        to gain       a
                       further update           assessment            (Video            1535),      I went       to

                      of the Ground, close to the Police box.

                                       I returned to the Gymnasium.                  Mr Hopkins informed me
                                       to    stay with Mr     Dale        to oversee         the   loading     and
                                       evacuation of all casualties as they arrived.


                                       As    far as     I am concerned             there were      always enough

                                       pitch*     No-one    had to wait for an Ambulance. There
                                       was   a   line   of Ambulances waiting                to gain      entrance
                                       into the Ground on Penistone Road North.


                                       I stayed at that position until all live casualties
I                                      had left    the Ground and the Gymnasium and had gone
                                       to    hospital.           Ambulancemen          Edwards      and

        Following the Bradford Football fire and Justice Popplewellfs report I,
        along with Station Off icers                     j(Barns ley),                    Doncaster) and
                 'Rotherham), was asked by Assistant Divisional Officer Wilkinson to
         set tip a working party which he would chair on behalf of the Chief
        Ambulance Officer, to look into how South Yorkshire Ambulance Service could
        draw up an individual incident plan to take account of any disaster within


%       the sports grounds of the five football clubs covered by South Yorkshire
        Ambulance Service.              1 was given responsiblity for the Sheffield Wednesday
        Football Ground at Hillsborough and the Sheffield United Football Ground at
        Bramhall Lane.          At a later     3 tage,   and prior to the finalisation of the
        plans, I was given responsiblity for Bramhall Lane Football Ground and
        Station Officer                      was then brought into the working group and given
        responsibility for Hillsborougl^T                A meeting was arranged in July 1986
        following letters from the Chief Ambulance Officer to each of the Clubs,
        asking for a meeting to be convened in order that the Ambulance Service
        within South Yorkshire would be able to respond to any incident within the
        football stadiums as quickly as possible.                   Contained in that letter was
        mention of the recent Bradford fire disaster.                       Prior to the Hillsborough
        meeting a meeting had taken place at Bratnhall Lane with the Managing
        Director and senior representatives of the Sheffield United Football Club,
I       the Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, and other senior police
        officers, and senior officers from the South Yorkshire Fire Service, as
        well as the Council Planning Department,                  This meeting was very well
        organised*        It was held in the Boardroom and there seemed to be a definite
        interest in ensuring plans were possible in order that all interested
        parties would be able to respond both adequately and professionally to any
        situation where crowds may be injured.

         I have to say that in the meeting held at Hillsborough the following month
         there was a definite lack of interest, and that meeting was held whilst
         walking around the ground*                 There were no representatives of senior police
         or fire officers, in fact the highest rank of police officer was inspector
         and the highest rank of fire officer was Station Officer*                             The club
         representation consisted of Groundsman Mr.                               there were no executives
         present and no senior managers became involved with our visit.                              1   must say
         that                 ~     |the physiotherapist for Sheffield Wednesday, did appear to
         be interested with our involvement, but that interest was confined to a
         professional ambulance service response for injured football players and
         not supporters.             He elaborated by saying that at that moment in time they
         were satisfied with the provision of first aid by the St. John Ambulance
         Brigade, and that the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club would not be
         interested in having a professional ambulance service for supporters and
         that the arrangements with the St. John Ambulance Brigade were
         satisfactory.             During the tour of the ground I discussed with the Police
         and Fire Service representatives and location of a casualty clearing post
         or mortuary should a major incident ever take place.                              It was generally
         agreed that the gymnasium would satisfy                    this need.        Vehicular access to the
         ground was discussed,                and the gymnasium    gave the perfect and only
         acceptable vehicle road for ambulances.                    During our conversation it became
         clear that from the Fire Service point of view that would also be the
         safest building as it                was surrounded by     concrete structures which would not
         burn, and it was away from the pitch area.                       The Police and Fire Service
         representatives then left and we continued to have a meeting with Mr.
         Smith, the Senior Physiotherapist.                 He once again confirmed that they were
         quite satisfied with the arrangements with the St. John Ambulance Brigade
         and also confirmed that if the Club needed a professional ambulance they
         relied totally on the 999 system.

            Mr, Wilkinson then asked if two officers could be placed inside the ground
            in the interests of crowd safety*             Mr. Wilkinson drew attention to the fact
            that these officers would have direct contact with Ambulance Control via
            radios, and therefore allow them a speedier Ambulance Service response to
            any incident.         Mr.           then asked if a South Yorkshire Ambulance Service
            vehicle with a qualified crew could attend the ground if players were
            injured*        Mr* Wilkinson pointed out that if a vehicle wa 3 designated to

t           stand by during a match for players there would be a charge*
           was not pursued as Mr.
                                                                                          The matter
                                                    did not think the Club would be prepared to
            pay for that facility, and if necessary the 999 system would be used*                     Mr.
           Wilkinson suggested that the club should provide two tickets for our
           Ambulance Liaison Officers in order for them to be positioned within the
            ground where they could see the crowd and call for assistance if needed*
           He was asked by Mr.                   to write specifically to the Club and that he
           would make the necessary arrangments,              Mr,           offered two seats at the
           back of the trainer’s box at pitch level, and after a visit to the ground
            it was suggested that these seats were not satisfactory and two seats were
            then allocated within the south side stand.                  The reason that the initial
            tickets were refused was that whilst there was a superb view of the game
            there was a very poor view of the stadium and the crowd, and as the

I          Ambulance Officers were primarily in attendance for crowd safety it was
            considered more advisable that they be placed in a higher position with a
           better view.          There was also the added advantage that radio communications
           were better from the elevated position than at ground level.                  The south
            side position was certainly favoured by Mr, Smith as it allowed a
            professional ambulance service to be quickly available should a player be
            injured, because of its proximity to the physiotherapy room.                  Following
            that meeting, two season tickets were presented to the Ambulance Service,
           These tickets were in row ’T ’, seats 152 and 153.




                                                                                          .*.4

         Howevet, season tickets do not provide cover for Cup Matches and therefore
         when the first Cup Match was due Mr*                        contacted the Club who
         provided complimentary tickets*              At       Final games the seats allocated to
         South Yorkshire Ambulance Service are not available to us because we have
         been informed that the Football Association control seats for those games
         and allocations for the Ambulance Service are not within Sheffield
         Wednesday Football Club control, and therefore could not be allocated.                           In
         1987 M r .                 |was promoted and moved from the Sheffield area, since
I        that date I have taken over responsibility, with Mr. P* Eason, as the
         Football Liaison Officers,              It has been necessary for me to make contact
         with the Club prior to each Football Association Cup semi-final to request
         two tickets.           That request has always met with a blank refusal.            For the
         season 1986/87 we were presented with two season tickets for the south side
         and two passes which allowed free access to any part of the ground.                        Mr.
         Chester was then Club Secretary and early in 1987 Mr. Chester left.                        Later
         that season a Football Association Cup semi-final between Leeds and
         Coventry was Organised and I tried on several occasions to contact the new
         Club Secretary, Mr. Mackrell in order to gain the necessary tickets in line
        with the previous arrangements,               I recall that on at least four occasions I
         telephoned the ground his secretary answered the calls and told me very

t        clearly that no tickets were available for the Ambulance Service, and that
         instruction had been relayed to her from Mr. Mackrell.                     Because of that the
         Ambulance Service were not in a position to gain entrance to the ground
         area for the Football Association Cup semi-final of 1987.                     In line with the
         Chief Ambulance Officer’s policy additional vehicles and manpower were
         provided, but these had to stand by outside of the ground area*

         Prior to the commencement of the 1987/88 season no tickets had been
         received by the Ambulance Service and as far as I was concerned the
         attitude of the Club, and particularly Mr. Mackrell, the previous season
         the Ambulance Service had been frozen out, and as we have no statutory
         powers whatsoever alternative arrangements had been put in hand by myself
         in conjunction with Mr. Wilkinson.               However, Mr.             the Senior
         Physiotherapist, telephoned and asked if we still wished to be involved.                        1
         informed him that we believed Mr. Mackrell did not want Ambulance Service
         involvement and had shown no interest whatsoever in professional Ambulance
I        Service attendance*               The season tickets and the passes had been taken from
         us.     Within a few days we received through the post two season tickets but
         no passes.         I recall a particular football player called                         , who
         was a player with the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, received a serious
         multiple fracture of his right leg and because we had no passes at the time
         it took twenty-five minutes approximately for us to gain entrance to the
         ground to cater for the needs of the player*               I also recall the publicity
         which surrounded that case, inasmuch as the Club were extremely pleased to
         report to many national newspapers that one of their players had been
         treated immediately by South Yorkshire Ambulance Service due to
         arrangements which existed between the Club and the professionals.
         However, no passes were issued that season or the following season to the


t        Ambulance Service, although complimentary seats have been retained by the
         Service in Row ’T f, seats 152 and 153 in the south side.                   For the season
         1988/89 once again a semi-final was organised at Sheffield Wednesday
         Football Ground, and once again I tried to make contact with Mr, Mackrell
         to see if tickets would be available.               This time I could only get through
         as far as the telephonist in the enquiry office, and she told me very
         clearly that there were no complimentary tickets whatsoever available for
         that semi-final.

         By now Mr* Wilkinson had left South Yorkshire Ambulance Service and
         transferred to Hampshire on a promotion basis, and Mr. D. Jones, the
         operational Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer, had taken over the co­
         ordinating role.                  Because of our concern, despite all of the previous
         difficult situations we have had to overcome with the Club, we decided that
         ambulance involvement was still totally necessary, and therefore, in
         conjunction with the South Yorkshire Police, we arranged to be part of
         their contingent and gained entrance to the Sheffield Wednesday Football
         Ground*           This was done with the full knowledge of the Club, along with a
         clear understanding that no bill would be sent and that any action taken to
         gain entrance by the Ambulance Service was off our own bat.                          Because we had
         a plan which had been structured with the full knowledge of the South
         Yorkshire Police and Fire Services our ambulance attendance was to be
         within the gymnasium area and the rear of the Spion Kop.                          This was in order
         to ensure that in the event of ambulance resources being needed we could
         immediately, with little delay, take over the gynuu iuxa as the designated
         casualty clearing area and for a vehicle positioned at the top                           of u -•• •r:
         that provides the only vehicular                    access to and egress from the pitch.        As
         far a3 South Yorkshire Ambulance Service is concerned we retain operational
         plans for any serious incident within any Football Ground within South
         Yorkshire in our Control Room.                    We have designated Liaison Officers, all of
         whom act On a voluntary basis in attending matches in line with information
         available to them in terms of crowd size or possible problems.                          The
         Ambulance Service in South Yorkshire have never charged any Club for its
         attendance because our priority has always been to ensure that wherever
         possible the Ambulance Service is in a position to respond to disasters as
         they arise.           We do not have statutory powers similar to the Police and Fire
         Services.

Matter:          Trent RHA - Hillsborough

Ref:             AJC/SO'C


 I telephoned John Evans and I told him that we expected to finish
^the evidence tomorrow and that we would then be drafting the
 recommendations for Part 1.   I told him that Lord Justice Taylor
"had asked that recommendations for Part 1 be put in by the end of
>next week.    I said that we would then want the draft to be
 discussed by Don Page and Richard Alderslade.     He will arrange
 for that to be done late on Tuesday the 4th July, because he
 knows that is the only time he can get the two of them together.
 I said that they ought to discuss it with each other rather than
 separately in case there were any points on which they did not
 agree.   I said I would get the draft to him by then.

He said he was a little surprised that Lord Justice Taylor was
asking for recommendations at this stage as he thought that Phase
1 was only fact-finding.  I told him that Taylor LJ had indicated
that in his interim report he will be making recommendations but
the final report would contain more detailed and more considered
recommendations.

I t o l d h i m t h a t we wer e c o n s i d e r i n g s u b m i t t i n g the
recommendations to the Association of Chief Ambulance Officers
 oth because they had submitted their own recommendations without
reference to us (although these had been drafted before we were
 ranted representation they ought at least to have consulted
SYMAS).   I also said that any recommendations which we make may
well have an impact outside the area of Trent and SYMAS. He said
that he would prefer not to involve them at this stage but that
it might be appropriate to do so at the second stage.

POL PS 9 6 Q MURRAY.



After     briefing at Donca ste r Police Station,                    I, together with the          rest

of my Serial,            were    tr an spo rte d to H i l l s bo ro ug h   for briefing    by the

Seni or Officers              in charge of the operation.



Once    this was         complete my Serial was further briefed                 by Inspector

A T H O R N and POL P S 9 6 Q MURR AY on our specific                task that our Serial          would

be engaged         in.



At   1115 hours,          on the same date,          we ar ri ve d at Ta nke rsl ey Ro und abo ut

where we started stopping and searching                        co ac h e s and mini     buses

containing Liverpool                  supporters    leaving the Ml mo to rwa y bound for            the

g round.



At ap pr ox i m a t e l y      1440 hours,     on the same date,           when there were      no more

coaches      or mini          buses    passing our     location bound        for the ground,     we

made    our way to Cla yw he el s Ln for mealy



At ap p r o x i m a t e l y    1500 hours we ar riv ed at Claywhe els Ln where almost

immediat ely we were              told to atte nd at        the ground as there was a riot

in progress.



To get her with the             rest of the Serial         we went     to the Leppings Ln end of

the ground by transit                 van.    At the Lepping s Ln end of the ground the

Serial was deployed               in making a cordon at the side of Leppings Ln

outside the gates               of the ground.        At this     time     there were    several

other Officers at this                  location    plus mo un te d Officers.         There w ou ld be

ap p r o x i m a t e l y twenty Liverpool          supporters also at this         location,       all

of who m had obvio usl y been drinking alcohol and were demanding                               to be
                                                                                          PA G E    3
                                                                                          S332&

allowed    into the ground.



After a short    period of time my serial                was directed      by a Senior

Of f i cer to make our way       into the ground.              I then made my way through

Le pp in gs Ln entrance.       The gate was           open and    from this    position    I

could see the tunnel         thro ugh the West Stand.              I saw men,    wo me n and

children    coming out of this gate some                crying and      in a very d is tr es se d

state.     These were    closely followed by injured                people and several

people who were      bei ng carried out towards me who were obvi ou sly d e a d .



I then ass is te d   in ad mi ni s t e r in g   first aid where         possible at this

location.     This   consisted of giving              reassurance    to the not so badly

injured and    placing a young         girl     of a p p r o x i m a t e l y eighteen years of

age who was unconscious          in the       recovery     pos ition.



Ev en t u a l l y when the am bul an ce s started to arrive at the location,                   I

assisted    in moving    the dead and           injured to al low the ambula nce s

egress.     Due to nature of things             happening all around,          I am unable to

descr ibe any of the       i njured or dead           I a s si st ed with ad min ist er ing

first aid to or moving.



E l e v e n dead were then    laid out along           the side of the bou nda ry fence at

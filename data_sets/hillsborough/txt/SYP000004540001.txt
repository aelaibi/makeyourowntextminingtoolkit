                I live at the above address with my Mother and Father, my Step Father



                On Saturday 15 April,                 1989 (15048ff) I weH ^ to Hillsborough f o o t b a l l

                We got there as arranged at about 11.30 am (1130 hrs) with the

                intention of acting as Stewards at the semi-final                          game between

                Liverpool and Nottingham Forest that afternoon.



                We went to the seating area of the West Stand to collect our stuff -

                a Stewards cloak.                We also have to sign a slip of paper to say you

                turned up.           I signed my slip of paper that morning.

                                                          NAGU

                A few minutes later a Police Chief                          came and said a few words to us
                                                                                                      PAGE

     about organisation and how important the match w a s .

T    P'tve minutes l a t e > ^ e went down to our post.                      Mine was at           .bottom
                                                          ^ A T 6 0          C jo ry ^
     ofx t h e   right hand set of steps leading up to the seating area of the

     Westland.           There wetN^^about 5 other^Stewards with me on that

     post.       My job was to check people's tickets                 coming         into the stand to

     make sure they had a ticket for the seating area and to tear a

     little bit off the ticket to stop the ticket being passed over to

     someone else and used again.



A    I was also there to stop people coming back down the steps once they

^ywere       in t h e ^ ^ a n d .   I had been standing^Jthere for a bout 20 minutes
s/                                    C£fr -f                 i'1 S ~ t ~s       S
     when the turnsti les opened from the Leppiftgs Ln end which was

     a b out 12 m i d d a ^ g O O     h r s ).   About t«n past twe l v e ^ V l 0 hrs ) I went

     for somfeychips about 30 yards down the road from                                   Lappings Ln E n d ,



     At that time there were quite a few people walking around - mainly

     young people and families - people with yotww children.



     I wentN^anCk into the ground a few minutes                  later to^&y .post.



     A few people came in though the turnstiles and up the steps for the

     seats but the re wasn't a g reat lot coming                   in.

     At aBttut 1.30 pm (1330 h r s K. it started \ o               get busy and             a young

     Liverpool      supporter tried\to           run past me u ^ the s t e p s .            I ran after

     him and caught him and handevj him to the police w h o were                             behind me.

     I d o n ’t know what they did with him.               I\)| ) on fev&ns
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S454

   it was busy without being hectic u n t i 1 about then.          Around that time

/X) I could hear >sl lot of singing outside and I realised that there were
                                                       OrJ-AU-
    a lot of people outside.    I H h e n saw 2 or 3 young Liverpool

   supporters climb over the top oT the turnstiles onto the roof but the

   police got them as they dropped down.     1 also saw a few come over the
                                                                   G/*T<S q
   t urnstile qates'Ni nstead of through them.  I then saw the metal gate

  to the left o f \ h e      witrnstiles being opened.      I would guess sometime
                                             <of\ 6 A T c C
   between half past w o          (143Q hrs) and quarter to three    <1445 h r s ).     I

  saw what      I thought was the Stewards arm o w n i n g     the gate.   There was

  twenty to thi rty Poli cemen also vnere by the turnstiles
                                                  ^ --------- and as the
  gate opened,      I would guess about two thousand Liverpool         supporters

  jogging and running in t h rough the gate which was open and a good

    ive minutes.
                                                 f3
                                                  *
                                               too ]      'la-A1    ,
                      I thought the Liverpool1 fans were behaving very

  badly.      I cTvuld smell the ^ as though they had all been in the ale

  house .     TheV locked drunk .            were swear ing at Po 1 i cmen and

  swearing at us^St e w ar d s .



  Loads of them w e r e N-------
                          ^ y i n g to get up the\gteps without ti ckets past

  us.      I was elbowed in the face twice as they tried to get past us.

  We tried to shut the gate to stop them getting the steps but we

  couldn't because there was so many of them.



  They x^ r e    really frightening me so I went up the steps to t n ^ s e a t s

  to m y 4Jncle           ^ md   I had a chat with him.     Just before that I went

  to the small sna^k^Xar under the steps to get out ofvthe way and then

   I went toNspeak to my Uncle               as I said.     This was
                                                                   is about three o'

   clock    (1500 h r ^   time.     I thought that theNgate to the outside had

  been o pened a second time as I went to go up the steps as there were

  even more Liverpool supporters           coming through the gates.
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S454

After   I had talked to my U/i c 1 e       \n   the stamj., the Police told me
                                cffi"'
to watch the gate w hich is situated at the b o t t o m \ i g h t   hand corner

of the West Stand and leads back down the side of the stand to the

terracing.     A lot of the Liverpool fans       in the seating area wanted to

get past me out of the seating area but the Police said 'No*.



I kept the gate shut but a lot of fans jumped down anyway onto the

t erracing .   I stayed there for fifteen or twenty minutes.           I saw a

lot of people cl imdj-jrvg up and over the fences from the two middle

pens b ut I didn *t realise at that time what was goi ng o n .



I don't remember hearing anything over the tannoy system.              I heard

them say "There has been a d i sa s t e r , please keep ca l m " , that was all

I remember.



After   I hadi&^opped on tJgat gate for fifteen to twenty minutes 1 went
                              s\                    N.
back \ o the snack b a r. Then I started to find out\what had been

going on S^d I helped carry water onto the pitch.           JuVt before that I

had stopped dX. another gate which is on the ter racing aX the right

hand corner of tKg West S t a n d .    I only stopped there for about ten

minutes to keep an eye on the g a t e .    Then I helped with the water

carrying.



I have marked on a m a p of the gound the position I was on when I was

first posted to the bottom of the right hand steps before the g a m e .

I have placed a cross on the map and it is marked          '1st'.     I have also

marked on the map the second post I was          instructed to stand on which

was at the bottom right hand corner of the seating area and this

position is marked * 2 n d '.   I have also marked an the map the third

position I was instructed to stand at wh ich was the gate on the

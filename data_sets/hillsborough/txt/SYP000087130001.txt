         d ropping        tans off    to use    the    pub and make         their      own w a y to the           ground

         fans    off and numerous          cars were       pulling      into     the    pub   car    park.



         T here was also a constant               flow of fans        on foot walking             towards         the

         A    large    proportion     of the younger         portion       of these        fans were        stopping

               the    early     part    of the      game.



               At    this    point we were          oblivious        to any      problems      in L e p pings Ln or any

               build up of fans.              To    the     b,^st of my k n o wledge we were                by now

               We were       still     unaware      of any       pro ol era at   this    point,          dul-   1 no t.i ceo a

               I have       no idea what        the    time was,       but    I recall       us s u d d e n l y       picking      up

               radio m e s sages again.               I heard      “e v e r y b o d y onto   the     perimeter          track."

               We    then made       towards       the front       of the ground after               crossing          over      onto

               the groundward, side             of tmsi road.          I saw more Police                 vehicles

(^/\ -p        t ravelling       to warily the        grounds*       I then heard        on a radio a female                     voic:

               am not sure        if this was          on personal         radio    or VHF         Channel       1.     I presurfi

               At this we went            straxght
                                                 to the g r o u n d , parked up outside and went

               There were about            30-40 P C ’s g a t h e r e d      there.      Although          nobody

               s p e c i f i c a l l y told us what        was    h a p pening   it was      generally           presumed         tha

               there    was     trouble w i t h i n        the ground,       ie, a pitch           invasion or          large

               scale    fig hting.

Stand, to see what was               happening.           I saw a    large    number    of Officers

gathered         in the    centre     of    the L e p p i n g s Ln end terracing and             people

were      climbing       over    the fencing.         The m atch       had been stopped and             it

looked         like a pitch       invasion,,        This was       o b v i o u s l y the early stages          of

the      incident.



After      a few more minutes              we were    ordered       to go    into the     ground.         We

were      still    unaware      of what was         happening       so my Serial       formed     into

pairs and we made               our way onto        the    pitch via the w a l k w a y betw e e n         the

N o r t h S tand and S p i o n Kop,          obviously       I was    e x p ecting   fighting       to be

taking         place    or a large        pitch    invasion.        I saw a huge       crowd of Police

and fans at the L e p p i n g s Ln end,               which     still    looked      like a pitch

front      of the Sap ion Hop,            p resumably to stop a n y attempts             to get       onto

the      pitch,    as    by this     time    there were       numerous L i v erpool        fans all          ove

the      pitch.

the Kop, at the front,                   close to gate 2,            I saw an Officer enter via

gate 2 and        I went       to back      him up.          We entered the Kop,                 the    scuffle            had

broken up,        but the other Officer,                     not known to me,             went    to a y o u t h ana.

There were        no    complaints         of any       nature made        to us and we a g a i n              left

the stand.           It was        not   clear     if those who        had been fighting were

opposing       fans.         I returned         to the area of gate 3.



About 5 minutes              later,      fans    began to      run down to the Kop and star t e d
                                                                                   Ao\/£<?7

injured being           carried from the ground on these and                              it was       obvious          they

were    needed,        so    I assisted         in the di s m a n t l i n g   of    them and fans              took

them away.



After    a p p r o x i m a t e l y anot h e r 5 minutes            stood facing           the Kop,       during

which    time     there was          constant       jeering and abuse              at Liverpool           from some

sections       of the Notts Forest                fans,      who

going    for    the Notts Forest                fans.



I turned       (calling POL PC S E R H A T L I C as                I did so)        and    ran towards them.

I got    to    the     centre       of   the    pitch     in front    of      and about 30 yards out

from the       goal.         There were 6 youths running                   d i r e c t l y at me.         My

impre s s i o n was         that   they were after me,              not       the    opposing          fans. In th

                    unchecked             by any officials.                          They were            s h o uting      at me,         "This    is your

At this        point Brian C L O U G H ami K enny D A L G L I S H emerged onto                      the    pitch

w i t h a senior Police               Officer.       There was a surge              of fans      towards      them

and they had to be                led back off        the    pitch.         The    players     tunnel      area

was     cl eared of fans and              I was    stood a gain          in front of the S o u t h Stami

in front           of the Police         cordon.      There were a           couple       of PC's with a

bucket       of water          giving    drinks    to fans., a lot           of whom were         obviously

going      into shock or at              least    very distressed.



S u d d e n l y somebody         threw a mug       down onto        the     pitch from up          in the South

Stand.         This     caused a number           of Liverpool           fans     to surge     towards       the

stand,       obv i o u s l y    intent    o n Hrt d i n g w h o ’d th r o w n      it.     W ith other

Officers           I joined a cordon across              this      sect i o n     of the S outh S t a n d and

the matter           diffused        itself.      We were     stood        in this       cordon for       some 20

minu t e s     a gaTu when        I saw,    by chance,        2 people          on the far side           of the

pitch below the North S t a n d                  run together         and hug one another,

obviously           they had been s e p a r a t e d      in the       incident and were             emotional

at    re-locating           one another.          However,      this       caused    people      in their

i mmediate          vicinity to         look at them,        out    of     interest,       people     near    to

those      onlookers w a l k e d towards             them to see what was                 happening       and so

on until           I heard 3 youths          close    to me     say,       "There's       a fight    over

t h e r e ” and they           ran off    in that     direction.           This     is clear      evidence         of

the state          of mind of some          of the     fans,       intent       on finding a fight            or an

excuse       for     one.



Over     the       next half      hour    or so    people were           just milling around,              all     the

injured were           off     the   pitch and there was              no    real    di r e c t i o n as   to what

we    sh o u l d    be doing      or what was        going    to happen.

                                                                                                       S3139



At   one      point
             there was a minor s f f i e on the pitch close to gate 2 of

the West Stand whe n a press photograph©-? was a t t a c k e d fay several fans,,

This a gain         caused two youths            near me      to call    out     “fight" and they

star t e d     to   run towards         the    scene.    I chased and          caught one,          a nother

After about           20 minu t e s more an a n n o u n c e m e n t     was made       that     the game was

being a faa n d o n e d and the L i v er po o 1 f a n s s ho u 1d faeg i n t o 1e a v a .              I

located my Serial              S e r geant     (CHAPMAN)      a g a i n and we    located       the   rest     of

our Serial          and went      out    of the ground         to    resume mobile         patrol

re any disorder              a r o u n d the ground,,        However,    our     van was      gone,    being

used as an arnfau 1anee           „

                              FLIP UP SAFETY BARRIER AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS

                Further to our telecon of 23?8.89 when you agreed to lead on this
                case in view of the recognisable 'policy' considerations involved,
                I have had my people examine the technical aspects.

                Please find attached a copy of a note from             , H/TD3B on
                an initial assessment of the barriers as a mechanical safety
                device.    I have discussed these with              and can agree
                with the relevance of his remarks.     Should HSE become further
                involved in this matter, it would be appropriate for our technical
                people to meet with the designer/distributor of the device before
                any thought of 'HSE approval' was even considered.

                However, my own view is that HSE should not get involved in
                'approving' safety devices of this or any other kind.         The
                responsibility for ensuring safety rests, in this case, with the
                football   clubs,   and how    they   choose to    discharge that
                responsibility is their business.

                Please let me know if you need anything further.

                    W O O D ’S S T A R T I N G STALLS OF B R U SS EL S ( M r E d w i n H. Woo d)


In general this seems a r e a s o n a b l e idea, but a num be r of t e c hn ic al and
oth er d ra wb ac ks might have to be overcom e.


QUE RI ES / COM ME NT S/ D R A W B A C K S (in no p a r t i c u l a r o r d e r )

 1. When it o p e ra te s the re will o b v i o u s l y be a h azard to a n y o n e who is
    stand in g w i t hi n 3m of the front of the barrier. This c o u l d be the
    police, o ff ic ia ls , p l a y e r s etc.      It may not be p h y s i c a l l y p o s s i b l e
    to c om pl e t e l y s t e r i l i s e a 3m zone in front of the b a r r i e r wit ho ut
    sub stantial a l t e r a t i o n s to the g r o un d layout.

2. It is not e n t i r e l y c l e a r what the b a r ri er is c o m p o s e d of- the re seems
   to be various lay ers of mesh. Fir st ly , it may be d i f fi cu lt to see
   any football at all, and s ec on dl y, it may be e a s il y c l i m b e d by football
   fans. If it is p a r t i c u l a r l y dense, then there may be a q u e s t i o n of
   wind loading.

3. There are q ui t e e x t e n s i v e and very important f ou nd at io ns .    It is very
   important that the b e l o w g r o u n d level ope ra ti ng bar does not distort
   which could lead to a fai lu re in the ope ni ng m ec ha ni sm . The detail of the
   f ou ndations w o u l d have to be giv en special c o n s i d e r a t i o n at e ach site.

4. There may be p r o b l e m s of m a i n t e n a n c e with the e x p o s e d lever o pe r a t i n g
   system. There is a d a n g e r that the u n d e r g r o u n d shaft might get rusted
   up and bec om e stiff to o pe ra te , and the same w ou l d app ly to the engagem ent
   of the cams on the shaft .

5. I do not have any e x p e r i e n c e of the use of large steel spr in gs which will be
   under con stant stress. W o u l d they be s u s c e p t a b l e to str es s c or ro s i o n ? Would
   it not be b e t t e r if t h e i r m o u n t i n g a r r a n ge me nt s w e r e p r o t e c t e d from the
   wea th er ? F o u r spr in gs w o u l d be fitted, but I w o n d e r if the b a r ri er would
   ope ra te with only three. How e s s en ti al is it that they all o p e r a t e with the
   same force ? Is there any p o s s i b i l i t y of the d i s t o r t i o n of the framed
   b arrier? i.e. it j a m m i n g in its frame.

6. I am not at all sure about the act ual m e c ha ni sm by w hi c h it is said the
   b arriers w o u l d rai se if there was s uf fi ci en t p r e s s u r e from the crowd. As
   much as I can u n d e r s t a n d it, it r elies on a notch in a bar. This seems
   somewhat u n s o p h i s t i c a t e d , and p r e s u m a b l y cannot be c a l i b ra te d. What
   h ap pens, I w o n de r, if the b a r r i e r is sub je ct ed to u n e q u a l p r e s s u r e ? What
   is the key a re a of the b a r r i e r for p r e s s u r e that is g o i n g to t r i gg er this
   r e l ea se a c t io n ?

7. The posts b e t w e e n the l ength of b a r r i e r are r ather w ide a nd prese nt a
   haz ar d when the b a r r i e r s have been raised. ( P r e s u m a b l y no one can reach
   the o p e r a t i n g lever from insid e the s u p p o r t e r s ’ area). It mig ht be p os si bl e
   to r e d uc e the w idths of the se pos ts by means of b e t t e r des ig n, or make them
   r o u nd ed in c r o s s - s e c t i o n on the inside.
8. C o n s i de ra ti on w ou l d h ave to be g i v en to the c h o ic e of the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s of
   the hydraulic cylin der.             To hrfve the b a r r i e r open too slowl y might result
   in the pile-up of p e r s o n s as the fans at the back surge f or wa rd ,b ut no c l e ar
   space having yet been c r e a t e d at the front. If the b a r r i e r flies up too
   quick ly then a nyone who was h o l d i n g on to the ins id e s u r fa ce might go up
   wit h i t .

9. T he r e may be a dange r if one s e c t i o n of bar ri er opens a u t o m a t i c a l l y as
   a result of cro wd p r e s s u r e and this is fol lo we d by a gen er al surge of
   the crowd towards that one ope ni ng , i.e. a "fu nn el li ng effect" might
   result.

1 0. Some c on s i d e r a t i o n w o u l d a lso have to be given to the p o s i t i o n i n g of
     the ter racing bar ri er s in r e l a t i o n to these new o p e ni ng p e r i m e t e r
    barriers.

              I am involved (cownercidl l y ) with a proposal
        to market here a new type of Flip-up Sa£ety
        Barrier at football grounds following the Hills-
        borough disaster. I enclose brief details f*«m
        i^he inventor in Belgium, MrEdwin Wood.

              Obviously, the blessing of the Government
        will be helpful and X have already written to
        dolin Moynihan. It is also desirable that tne
        approval of the Health & Safety E**eutive b<§
        obtained. With this in mind M r . W o o d has already


        now left* I refer to two letters of Mr*Wood dated
        34 th, and 25th« July 1/iet.

               Could you please give this a ‘shove’ now that
        tihe football season is upon us?

                           DESCRIPTION FLIP-UP SAFETY BARRIER.
                               I

                    The Flip-Up Safety Barrier Is designed to give an automatic and Immediate escape
    route when a crowd of people are pressed against any section along the barrier frame, whether
    it be In the centre or either end the force required to open the barrier or barriers is linear.
                    The adjustment of the force required to open any one Fflp-Up barrier Is simple
% requiring only simple tools. The barriers can be tested by using a special yoke attached to specified
* sections of the barrier frame and coupled to a heavy duty spring weighing unit which is attached
| to a tractor. Tho tension on the safety release should be at the minimum adjustment and gradually
t increase the tension until you can hold the barrier between 400        and 500 Kg. The tractorshould
   make a steady pull, avoid jerking.
                   The safety barrier consists of a rectangular 'porta!* section constructed of square
   and rectangular steel tubing forming a frame to carry the Flip-Up barrier which Is suspended from
   the top of the 'portal' frumd.
                   As it Is Important that the fllp -u p section has maximum rigidity with a minimum
   of weight at the bottom end.lt is constructed with a section at the top of the frame where weight
   Is not Important. This beam section Is built at 90 deg. to the flip-up frame and allows for vertical
  stays to stabilize the lower region without adding too much weight to the bottom end of the flip -u p
  frame.
                  The construction of the beam section also provides suitable am»s for attaching
  the laminated leaf springs which create the force to swing the fllp-up barrier up. A six metre
  barrier requires four springs mounted at Intervals along the top of the portai frame. The bottom
  of the fllp -up frame Is locked at Intervals along Its length by cams or arms attached to a transverse
  shaft controlled by a lever attached to one end of the shaft.
                  A control box mounted on one of the vertical portal pillars Is fitted with a mechanical
  safety release to which Is locked the control lever. The safety release can also be operated by
  an electro/magnetic actuator which is operated by. a remote Tele/Command by an In-Field official.
                    Attached to the barrier frame and the pillar mount, are two small hydraulic cylinders,
  which control the upward swing of the barrier, when released. They also check that the barriers
  w ill not return to the ground, until the valve Is turned. Two men are required to close a barrier
  and lock It Into place.      I
                   The basic locking of a barrier consists of a chassis fitted below ground level,
  which has ashaft running the length of the barrier, and mounted on suitable bearings. Attached
  to this shaft are cams, or arms, at two metre intervals along the barrier, and at one end a strong
  lever, 70cm long, controls the locking when held by a spring loaded notched arm, and is released
  only by excessive pressure on the barrier {by a crowd), which w ill automatically release It,
  or by a controlled signal from an electric activated release or Tele/Command signal.
                   The Control Box and lever are protected from the public by the panels mounted
  on the outside, between the two portal pillars of each barrier. The control box houses the locking
  and safety release adjustment, end has provision to mount an electro/magnetic actuator, a 12
  volt battery, a Tele/Command receiver and associated components, and Ant.
                   Ihc mechanical locking chassis is a completely assembled module, and Is designed
  to fit beiow ground level, to each mounting pillar.
                   The safety release is a spring loaded notched arm, which holds the cam locking
 lever. The notched arm can be loaded according to the prescribed release force. The adjustment
 c a n bo aslow   as 300kg Of as h ig h as 7.000kg,
                  All Filp-Up Safety Barriers are s ta lle d In units of s ix or nine metres, ro sun
 an installation plan. A three metre long static barrier Is available which can be fitted between
 two adjacent barriers, where they change direction and make a short angle, which may cause
 Ukht) to touch.

                   Tho necessity for emergency services and official cars to enter or leave the grounds
without gate delays or obstructions Is Important.
                   The 'Flijs-Up Gate* can be ojwned and closed by a hand held coded Co»r»nand,
or a key s w it c h by fhe sgatc. It can bo opened and closed In less than ten seconds with
hydraulic power from a hydraulic accumulator, which maintains stored energy even If the electric
power has been cut. A small electric/hydraulic pump, keeps the accumulator fully charged.
                When a command Is made to open the gate, the lower section (or panel) Is swung
upwards, followed by tf»o main gate frame. The action of swinging the bottom section of the
gate, up; reduces the 4rch of the main gate frame. This allow s vehicles to stop within 2 metres
of the gate, without Interference.

         Dear Sir,




                        Previous correspondence was addressed to Mr.                 3ut I understand he has
         now left your department.

                        My association with your office has been on the subject of Starting Stalls for
         Race Horses and standards of safety in design to protect Jockeys, handlers and horses, and
         procedure of operation.

                         I w ill advise you when I am next visiting the U.K., with a view to showing you
         videos of various types of Starting Stalls, highlighting good ami bad features.

                         In the meantime i am enclosing a letter, specifications and plans of my design
         for safety barriers for crowd controi at sports stadiums, which ! think you w ill find of interest.




                                            Yours sincerely,




                                            Edwin H. Wood.

Dear Sir,


         Since the Hillsborough disaster last April, I have been
approached by many of my associates here and in England, asking me
(due to my long experience in safety barriers in horse racing), to
design a practical safety barrier for crowd control at football
stadiums.
         Having witnessed how quickly events can happen at any section
of a barrier line, the only solution I could see, was to have a
barrier that moved OUTWARDS and UPWARDS away from the crowd, when
released by an official. Or in an emergency, the safety release
trigger would allow the barrier to open when sufficient force was
created by a crowd.
         Hence the heading FLIP-UP SAFETY BARRIER, which is exactly
what I have designed, to cope safely with crowd control at football
grounds- The enclosed description and illustrative drawings should
help to understand the system which will be manufactured in Belgium
ready for delivery in England. The quoted price delivered to the
grounds concerned, is well below the cost of producing the same
equipment in the U.K.
         Delivery time Ex Works Bruxelles for 6 to 8 barriers ready
for installation, would be six weeks from date of official order.
         I hope your technical people find the design of the equipment
of interest, and I would be pleased to give any further information
if requested.




                                  Yours sincerely.




                                  Edwin H. Wood.

                          DESCRIPTION FLIP-UP SAFETY BARRIER.
                                               %




The safety barrier consists of a rectangular 'Portal' section constructed of square and rectangular
steel tubing forming the pillars and the overhead member, pre-cut and prepared, ready for assembly
on site. The Flip-Up Safety Barrier is made with a beam section at the top, where weight is
not important. This section provides rigidity so as to Increase the strength at the lower part
of the barrier, without adding extra weight to that area.
                 The force required to swing the barrier up, Is developed from a number of open
leaf springs mounted on the overhead transverse member.        A s ix metre barrier requires four sets
of springs to activate it.
                 Attached to the barrier frame and the pillar mount, are two small hydraulic cylinders,
which control the upward swing of the barrier, when released. They also check that the barriers
w ill not return to the ground, until the valve Is turned. Two men are required to close a barrier
and lock It Into place.
                 The basic locking of a barrier consists of a chassis fitted below ground level,
which has a shaft running the length of the barrier, and mounted on suitable bearings. Attached
to this shaft are cams, or arms, at two metre intervals along the barrier, and at one end a strong
lever, 70cm long, controls the locking when held by a spring loaded notched arm, and is released
only by excessive pressure on the barrier (by a crowd), which w ill automatically release It;
or by a controlled signal from an electric activated release or Tele/Command signal.
                 The Control Box and lever are protected from the public by the panels mounted
on the outside, between the two portal pillars of each barrier. The control box houses the locking
and safety release adjustment, and has provision to mount an electro/magnetic actuator, a 12
volt battery, a Tele/Command receiver and associated components, and Ant.
                 The mechanical locking chassis Is a completely assembled module, and Is designed
to fit below ground level, to each mounting pillar.
                 The safety release is a spring loaded notched arm, which holds the cam locking
lever. The notched arm can be loaded according to the prescribed release force. The adjustment
can be as low as 300kg or as high as 1.000kg.
                 A il Flip-Up Safety Barriers are supplied in units of six or nine metres, to suit
an installation plan. A three metre long static barrier is available which can be fitted between
two adjacent barriers, where they change direction and make a short angle, which may cause
them to touch.



 FLIP-UP GATE.

                A hydraulic 'Fi ip-Up Gate' is available for entrance or e x it on Sports grounds
 for Emergency Services, O fficial cars, (or the public in an emergency).
                The necessity for emergency services and official cars to enter or leave the grounds
 without gate delays or obstructions is important.
                The 'Fi ip-Up Gate' can be opened and closed by a hand held coded Command,
 or a key switch by the gate. It can be opened and closed in less than ten seconds with
 hydraulic power from a hydraulic accumulator, which maintains stored energy even if the electric
 power has been cut. A small eiectric/hydraullc pump, keeps the accumulator fully charged.
                 When a command is made to open the gate, the lower section (or panel) is swung
 upwards, followed by the main gate frame. The action of swinging the bottom section of the
 gate, up; reduces the arch of the main gate frame. This allows vehicles to stop within 2 metres
 of the gate, without interference.     ------------- 1 1

HILLSBOROUGH

Although it is a considerable time ago, my recollection of the Hillsborough
investigation was that HSE decided that no action was to be taken under the HSWA.
However I was primarily concerned purely with technical issues. The legal aspects
would have been considered by the Sheffield Local Office who, at that time, were led
by Stuart Nattrass who has since retired.

We have retained very little from this investigation other than our original reports, the
Home Office reports and the Inquiry transcripts.

Sorry I can offer no further information.

I attach a copy of a letter from |                          Researcher at Leeds Metropolitan
University, and also a copy of my reply.

She is essentially asking what consideration was given by HSE to breaches of statutory
duties, principally under the HSWA, in consequence of the disaster. In view of the more
specific statutes (i.e. Safety of Sport Grounds Act 1975) I imagine that no consideration
was given to action under the HSWA, and there is nothing in my own brief file on
Hillsborough to suggest anything different. Do you have access to any relevant material?

I am also copying this to Dr Nicholson, in view of his earlier contact with

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM FOOTBALL DISASTER 1989

Thank you for your letter of 19 October.

Dr C Nicholson was one of the members of the Technical Working Party to the
Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor, and I suspect that he may know more about the
disaster than other people currently in HSE.

The general duties in sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act
1974 are wide, and sometimes overlap duties in more specific legislation. In such
cases HSE often comes to an arrangement with the other authority concerned to
avoid duplication of enforcement. There is a reference to this in paragraph 157 of
Hillsborough Report, and I quote some of it:

       “157 ... the Health and Safety Executive, being primarily concerned with the
       safety of employees pursuant to the 1974 Act, has not extended its
       surveillance to include spectators at football grounds. The Home Office
       evidence on this point is as follows:

           “The Health and Safety at Work Act could also be used to enforce
           general spectator safety at sports grounds. Section 3 of the Act is wide
           ranging in that it places a duty on an employer to conduct his undertaking
           in such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that
           persons not in his employment who may be affected thereby are not
           exposed to risks to their health or safety. A sports or other entertainment
           “undertaking” would fall within this category. However, it is the stated
           policy of the Health and Safety Commission that, as a general principle,
           they and the Executive wish to avoid duplication of enforcement with
           other authorities. The HSE would not therefore generally attempt to
           enforce the requirements of Section 3 of the 1974 Act when they overlap
           with duties imposed by other more specific legislation where other
           authorities have responsibility for policy and enforcement. The Safety of
           Sports Grounds Act 1975 represents more specific legislation and the
           Health and Safety Executive does not enforce Section 3 of the 1974 Act

                         to secure the safety of spectators at sports grounds. This arrangement is
                         agreed between the Health and Safety Executive and the Home Office.”

For this reason I doubt that we shall be able to answer your questions quite in the
terms you have asked them. I will, however, see whether colleagues elsewhere in
HSE have more material, and will let you know what we are able to find out.

                Dear Sir/M adam

                 I am w riting to request your assistance in directing me to the appropriate person
                 in your legal branch w ho m ay be able to grant me a short interview on the
                 statutory isstle^ei^closed in relation to the Hillsborough Stadium Football
                 D isaster d*fl989.1 |iav e already interviewed the Chief Executive of the Football
                 Licensing A uthority and Dr Chris Nicholson at the HSE research laboratories in
                 Sheffield and he recom m ended that I get in touch w ith your branch since you
                 are the only people w ho are able to answer my questions. I am a senior lecturer
                in law and sport m anagem ent at Leeds M etropolitan U niversity,w here I have
                w orked for 17 years. My doctoral research is comparing the legal processes
                w hich deal w ith disasters w ith a particular focus on the H illsborough and
                M archioness disasters of 1989,since I am lecturing to undergraduates and
                postgraduates in law ,sport, leisure and management.
                        The m issing piece of legal chronology in m y research in relation to the
                H illsborough disaster is the investigation and outcome of the statutory duties
                relevant to the Sheffield W ednesday Football club and the responsibilities of the
                local authorities. I understand th a t,although Dr Nicholson provided a very
               thorough technical report to both the Taylor Inquiry and the inquest, the
               investigation of the statutory duties was not carried out by the local branch of
               the HSE, but by the Legal branch at HSE headquarters in London. Usually w hen
               the local branch carries out the investigation there is an announcem ent of any
               outcome. I have found no such records of any outcome of investigations into
               statutory duties at H illsbrough football ground. Part of m y research is to locate
               the HSE statutory findings w ithin the unusual legal disaster processes.
                        I enclose a copy of the issues which I w ould like to discuss w ith som eone
               from the legal branch w ho is familiar w ith the statutory investigation at that tim e

               of any interview to you for checking. I teach full-time but have m anaged to get

                Them es/Issues for Interview HSE Legal Branch, London

                1. Did the legal branch of the HSE in London base their investigation into
                possible breaches of statutory duties in connection w ith the H illsborough
                Football Stadium disaster of 1989 purely on the evidence presented to the Taylor
                Inquiry of 1989, or did they conduct a separate investigation ?

                2. W hich statutes w ould be relevant to such an investigation ? (Safety of Sports
                G rounds A ct 1975; Fire Safety and Places of Sport Act 1987; H ealth and Safety at
                W ork Act 1974 ?)

                3. W hat w ere the results of the HSE investigation into possible breaches of
                statutory duties relating to the Hillsborough Stadium Football disaster of 1989 ?

                4. In using the relevant statutes is the HSE able to cross reference from the
                statutory duties to the (Green) Guide to Safety of Sports G rounds -HMSO ?
                In other w ords,w hat is the status of the Green Guide-does it have any legal force
                in relation to statutory duties ?

                5. W ere any changes to the relevant statutes recom m ended by the HSE or any
                other party following the legal investigations after the H illsborough disaster ?
                ( This has happened after other disasters eg the Piper Alpha Disaster 1988 and
                the Zeebrugge disaster 1987)

                6. Since 1993 the Football Licensing Authority has the pow er to review the local
                authorities in the discharge of their statutory duties in relation to football stadia.
                In this role is it possible for the FLA to be investigated or charged in relation to
                breaches of statutory duties ?

                7. In its investigations into the Hillsborough disaster did the legal branch
                consider evidence of reckless m anslaughter by any individual or organisation
                and m ake recom m endations to the CPS/DPP or w as this task com pleted solely
                by the W est M idlands Police,who collected evidence for the Taylor Inquiry,the
                inquest and the DPP in relation to any charges of reckless m anslaughter ?

                8. In relation to the M erchant Shipping Act 1979 and 1984,there are pow ers to
                discipline or suspend individuals w ho fail in their statutory duties and cause
                death (e.g. the C aptain and the First Officer of the Herald of Free Enterprise

                  sinking in 1987). Are there any such powers in relation to failures by individuals
                  in the area of health and safety in the statutes governing football stadia ?
                  Do you think there should be ? W ould such a system be workable across private
                  and public organisations and individuals -for example- police,football
                  clubs,safety consultants,local authorities ?

                  9. The Interim Report of the Taylor Inquiry 1989:59 under the sub-heading of
                  police planning, recom m ended that:

                  * 26. "The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one
                  designated stadium or m ore should nom inate a chief officer to liaise w ith the
                  m anagem ent of each football club and local authority concerned in respect of the
                  safety and control of crowds"

                 *27. "The O perational O rder for each match at the designated stadium and the
                 pre-m atch briefing of all officers on duty there should alert such officers to the
                 im portance of preventing any overcrowding,and ,if any is detected,of taking
                 appropriate steps to rem edy it"

                 *30. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed
                 circuit television m onitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of
                 any electronic or mechanical counting of num bers adm itted to any area of the
                 ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the interpretation and
                 use of these data."

                In your opinion, do the above recommendations clearly locate health and safety
                m atters as shared by both the police and the football club (rather than seeing the
                police as only responsible for law and order at football matches ?). If the HSE
                w ere investigating a football stadium today,w ould / should they access the
                police operational orders and investigate police conduct as p art of the HSE
                investigation into possible breaches of statutory duties ?

                10. A re you aw are of any references or press releases relating to the HSE
                investigation into possible breaches of statutory duties connected w ith the
                H illsborough Stadium Football disaster of 1989 ?

  Subject:     HILLSBOROUGH STATEMENT - DR JACOB


  We have been contacted by the office of Mike Hall MP, who is attempting to obtain a copy of the
  statement made by D r Jacob following Hillsborough. We believe that the request is being made on
  behalf of M r Spearritt. Can you let me know whether the statement can be released?

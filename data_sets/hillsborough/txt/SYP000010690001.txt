                                   Briefing Notes


On Friday the 14th April after the main briefing to Inspectors and above held at

Hillsborough I then briefed Inspectors and above whe were to be under my command at

the semi-final match.


I told them that in particular from experience I could forsee two problems arising.

One was the question of supporters from the Leppings Lane terrace being hauled up by

fellow supporters into the West Stand at half time thus creating over capacity in

the West Stand.   The second problem I related was based on experience of the semi­

final match between the same teams last year in that it was quite forseeable that

there would be a large element of Liverpool supporters who by whatsoever means would

be purchasing tickets for the Spion Kop.   This problem had been evident last year

and that cordoning Police Officers had come under threat to personal safety.      It was

agreed with the Inspectors concerned that we would go to the Spion Kop after my

briefing and examine the area and how it could best be protected, and reserved for

Liverpool supporters.


I specifically spoke in clear terms about behaviour of Liverpool supporters based on

my previous experience.   I told Officers that in my view generally speaking if

things were going well for Liverpool supporters crowd management should be

reasonably well achieved, however should things in any way not go well them then

they had proved extremely difficult to contain and moods would easily change.      I

related an incident to them which I had witnessed occurring at a Sheffield Wednesday

- Liverpool match during the period of the Coal Industry dispute.     It was at that

time as I recall that the then kop was over capacity with Sheffield Wednesday

supporters and out of necessity some were transferred to a pen on the Leppings Lane

terracing (thp’yTTt\(erpool supporters occupying the West End of the ground including

for some Officers to draw truncheons to contain the   Liverpool supporters.


I reminded Officers of the need for extreme care in   searching supporters andto bear

in mind the dangers of weapons such as Stanley knives, knives   or sharp bladed

articles which may be retained in a persons pocket.    Officers were also toldof the

dangers of weakening a police line by taking away supporters either under arrest or

for the purpose of ejecting them thus reducing the police cover and thereby

potentially putting their colleagues at greater risk to their personal safety.


Above all I told the Officers that in my view a successful operation hinged directly

on the alertness of Constables and that if they were to be seen as not being awake

to potential problems then supporters would readily take advantage of the situation.

On conclusion of the briefing I then went to the Spion Kop with Inspectors to

discuss specific plans in relation to the segregation of Liverpool supporters (of

whom it may be expected that there would be more than last year) from Nottingham

Forest supporters on what was an area with a capacity for containing 21,000 people.


I also reminded Officers that some Liverpool supporters had climbed over the

Leppings Lane perimeter fence at the end of last years semi final game and that

manpower1 had been arranged to prevent a repetition (I also discussed separately with

Inspector Darling the normal plan to funnel players and officials into the player's

tunnel at the end of the game).


After the main briefing on Saturday morning I personally briefed the Serials having

duties on the Spion Kop in terms of the plans for the segregation of the Liverpool

supporters and also outlined to then those points that I had discussed on the Friday

as to behaviour of Liverpool supporters, searching, alertness and the undesirability

for arrest/ejection which would weaken a police cordon and thus put their colleagues

at risk.

Chief Inspector Beal, Chief Inspector Creaser and Inspector Calvert, all of whom

have had extensive experience of policing the Hillsborough stadium, were not present

at my briefing on Friday but on Saturday I discussed with then the particular

problens, as outlined previously, I had foreseen as would affect their areas of

responsibility.


At the conclusion of my briefings I confirmed that everyone was familiar with their

allocated duties.

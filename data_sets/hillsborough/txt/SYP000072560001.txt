Once     the       bus    dropped             us    off      I could            see    the      ground.              I walked along

        his    stage          I saw mass                crowds        of          is t r y i n g         to    get       into    th e      ground.

These        crowds       were       back          as    far a s / t h e         road.          I sayfo              steward          or     police

I was        in th i s        crowd       for a pp ro x            20mins          trying           to    get       to    the    turnstiles,

when     I actually                got    to       the     turnstile             I was         slightly             to    one    side        of    the

entrance,           the       crowds          crushing           me,       c rushe d me             round and             I actually

"popped        into"          the    turnstile               entrance.                There         was       no w a y     outside           the

at     the    turnstile             I handed              in the       portion            of m y         ticket          which     is

required and              retained             my       portion.

Once     through          the       turnstile              I no^ced              that         the    gate       to ray right,                a

walking        through             in a       orderly         fashion.

I saw        stewards          standingy^t                 the     entrance            to      the       upstairs          seating

As     I walked          along       the       tunnel         I had^/free                     passage          but as       I go t         to     the

I went        to    the       left       at    the       V a n n e 1 a n d as          the      crowds          were       comi ng         in

behind        me    a steady             pressure           was       building            up.        I was          being       edged along

as     the    crowd       pressure             continued              to    build         up.       I was       being       shoved

60yrs        with     g r ey - g i nge r h a i r             short      and      thinning,             I think          he was         clean

shaven,        and       was      very        red-faced,            I believe              he w a s        wearing       a    l i gh t

coloured           shirt        possibly            blue      w h i c h was          open and          out     of    his      trousers,

this     m an was          obviously               distressed,            he     had an          inhaler          in his          hand,      and

the     crowds        around         him were           trying           to m o v e        away       from     him      to    give       him

breathing           sp ac e .

While        I wa s      being       edged          forward         I couldn't                 see    very much,             I noticed

th e    players          were       on    the       pitc h,        there        was       a man       standing          in f r o n t        of m e       ,

with     his       hand across                my    f ace,        I told        him       I couldn't           see a t h i n g           and

asked        him    to m o v e       his       hand,         he    s a i d he        c o u l d n ’t due        to    the      crush.

I noticed           fans        behin d me           being         pulled        up       into       the    standing          area       above.

I also        noticed           f ans     c l y i f h i ng    from       th e    standing area                 over      t he      barrier

fence        onto     the        pitpfu            I believe            the     police          didn't        k n o w at      this       stage

what     was       happening             as    they were            trying           to    stop       these       people          from

leaving        the       pens.

At     one    stage        a    fan was            pulling         at    the     mesh          fence^arid w a s          stopped            by

the     polic^f          and      then        I saw     the        police        themselves                trying       to    pull       the

Onye     people          realised what                was         happening,              people       were       piling          onto      the

pitch        and    th e       crush      eased       somewhat.

I noticed           the        emergency            services            coming        onto       the       pitch     to a s s i s s t

injured.

I saw        people           on the      pitch       I believe           were            deceased          du e to      their         heads

I stayed           where        I was         until     I decided               to    leave          the    g r o u n d as        I passed

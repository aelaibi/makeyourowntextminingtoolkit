directions,           but    1 knew from          previous        experience where                I was      going.

It was a good natured                    crowd and        I did not witness any disorder,

•fighting or drunkeness.

I a r r i v e d at      the L e p p m g s      Lane     entrance        to the North Stand at 2 . 2 5 p m .

There was a fairly large crowd/at this time.

went     through this            gate.         Ithen handed my ticket                  in      having got          into

the    ground area           but    I cannot          remember where.               Last year         I was       on

crutches and            in plaster and            I d i d n ’t get        crushed at all.                  All    or most

people        for    the North S tand went                through the gate.

This year           1 made my way to the same                   gate,         but   it was      locked.           I then

had to get           out of      the     crowd to find out where                     I had to go.

Ha v i n g   got out        of   the mass        of     people     to which          there was        no

o r g a n i s a t i o n or queuing,         I looked at my ticket and                         I could not          see

assumed        I had to enter            the    stand from the                opposite        end,,    I therefore

made my way down to the other                          end.     It took me about                10 minutes             to get

to the        other     end because         the       police    had blocked off the                   side       streets

for    segregation,.             Having     got       to the'other            end    I was     directed back             to

When        I joined the mass               of    people        trying       to get       to the    turnstiles was

about        15 yards        from them,,              Gradual ly as           I got    closer      it became more

confined,,            when    I was a few yards                     from the turnstile             I was     not   in

control         of my m o v e m e n t s .         I just went with the mass.

I could not move at all„                          I was       stuck with my            right arm at about

chest        height.         At about S . 5 5 pm I was a few yards                          from the       turnstile

and    I was         just    getting/more

As    I got        closer     to the        turnstile           I     saw apolicewoman             pinned up       against

a wall        outside        the turnstile,                 she was       unable to move herself.

I    said     ’Where are all your m a t e s ? ’                       She    said,     "They've         b u g gered off.*

She a p p e a r e d     concerned about                     her own    and everyone elses               safety, but      in

no way        could she           control        the        crowd.     Ithen        told her       to gothrough the

turnstiles and get                  out     of the          way.       This      she done,      entering     the

turnstile            in front       of m e .

I did not see any stewards                            outside       the     turnstiles.           I was    in the       crush

for    10 minutes            to    15 minutes.               During       this     time    I was    frigh t e n e d     for

mine        and other        peoples        safety.            I had not w i t n e s s e d a crush            like      this

since        the     early    1 9 7 0 ’s.

Once        inside     the turnstile              everything           was     calm,      and    I easily made my

way to the            seat,       w hich was          now clearly           sign    posted.

Other        than the turnstiles                  1 did not see any other                       gates    open.     1 did

not witness any u n a u t h o r i s e d                 entry to the             ground.

I did not see anyone                  drinking alcohol                    inside      the ground.          E v e ryone was

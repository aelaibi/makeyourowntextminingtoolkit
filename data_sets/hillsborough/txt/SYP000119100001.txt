For e s t     fans    but    I saw no trouble              as a result           of this.        It    is true to

three       (1435),      1 heard some             conversation        on my       radio when officers

were     requesting          the     start      of the m a t c h     to be delayed.              It seemed this

request was,m a d e              as there was a •large              build up of fans             at Lappings

Lane,       many     of w h o m w o u l d      not get     into     the    ground     in time         for   the

ma t c h start.   I heard concern e x p r e s s e d over this, and some mention
                      1
of    ''pushing and shoving' . Just before 1500 hrs I heard excited

voices        of police          o f f icers    on my    radio      requesting        gates      to be opened

at    the L e p p i n g s    Lane       end.      I heard    one     voice       say words       to the effect

if the        gates were          not    opened,     the    police would           lose    it and a serious

incident        was     probable.           The    radio was        distorted,        with t r a n smissions

d row n e d    by b a c k g r o u n d    noises and screams,               but    I did hear a request

happened           but    I assumed          there    had been a "pitch              invasion".         It was        not

until      an e K c i t e d      police        officer      ran towards me shouting                words       to the

effect       "there's           lots     dead over       there"        (indicating       the area at

Leppings           Lane)       that     I .realised a really serious                   incident       had taken

place      in the West               S t a n d at L e p p i n g s Lane,    and,      it was more        than a

public       order        incident.

With     some       other       officers        I made my way           over    to the West S tand and saw

horrific           scenes       of    injured     persons        lying    on the       pitch and       persons

inside       the       stand being           crushed against            the wire       perimeter       fencing.

Many     officers          were        doing what they           could     to get       people    out by

v ir t u a l l y    dragg i n g        them over      the    fencing onto        the    pitch.        There      were

also many           officers          milling a r o u n d      in a complete           state    of shock and

bewilderment,              particularly           some y o u n g e r     officers       that    I saw.         Many

fans were           running a r o u n d         in a near        state    of hysteria.           Some        of tnsm

wre    screaming           out       that    the Police        ewre at     fault       or that we were           not

doing      enough         or    just     generally w a n t i n g        t o •"have a go" at           us for

whatever           reason.           I myself     found the whole              scene    difficult       to take        in

The    crowd        itself       se e m e d angry.        The Liverpool           supporters          in the North

Stand      in part i c u l a r          were jeering        at    the    police,       especially       those

the      best way to handle               hysterical            Liv e r p o o l    supporters           who were          not

with      injured        relatives/friends               etc was           to    encourage         them to use            their

energies        in the         rescue     o p e r a t i o n , not      on the          po1ic e ,      G e n e r a l 1y

stretchers,           carrying         the     injured and such                  like.     M a n y of      these

supporters          had    been drinking               but     those       I e n c o u n t e r e d were more

However,        there was          the odd fan or two                  that was          hell    bent      on pushing,

prodding and being abusive                        to    police        officers — and they had to be

I did assist             w ith    injured and u n c o n s c i o u s              (apparently          dead)      persons

wit h    others       or getting          persons        into a m b u l a n c e s and           the     like.       I have

no details          of    persons        I was      involved          in in this way,                 During all           this

I was      frequ e n t l y a p p r o a c h e d      by officers             want i n g    to know what             to do,

During my time             inside        the ground            I heard          very    little     o n my personal

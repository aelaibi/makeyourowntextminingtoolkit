                        cases.               A number of statements were obtained to show that relative

                       calm and organisation (given the difficult circumstances) prevailed.

                       On 11 July 1990 I met with Peter Metcalf and Detective Inspector

                       Cleverley who has exercised day-to-day control of the enquiries.                                                             The
                       following points arose from that meeting.

                                                                                                                            Action
                       1.            Peter Metcalf is not sure how to progress

                      the body plan, it does not reveal the picture

                      he expected.                             The inclusion of references to

    ^                where persons were last seen alive dilutes

                     the emphasis on the failed barrier.                                                          Yet, if

                     these were omitted, it might be interpreted

                     by the other parties as ’fiddling*.                                                          He asks

                     that the plan be photographed and the

                     photographs sent to him so that he might                                                               Plans Dept.
                    discuss further with Counsel.

                                     The evidence that emerged at the Inquiry

                    suggested that there was a history of good

                    relations between the Club and the police.



                                                                                                          •16

 Peter Metcalf is particulary sceptical about

 the relationship that existed around 1981, at

 the time of a crush at the Semi-final that

 year.   He would be interested to know the

 views of the then ACC (Operations) Mr Goslin

 who (he hopes) might have some damning things

to say about discussions with the Club's

officers following that crushing incident,

i.e. what was their reaction?    Were they

annoyed that the police had, on their own

initiative, relieved the crush by letting

people on to the pitch?    Did they express a

view about the effect the incident might have

on the selection of Hillsborough for future

Semi-Finals?    Is Mr Goslin prepared to

provide a statement in relation to these

matters? - self prepared?, to Peter Metcalf?,

3.   Peter Metcalf is re-reading the Inquiry

transcripts in relation to evidence provided

by police officers.    In order to challenge

any of that evidence at the subsequent

Contributions Hearings it is necessary to

notify the Court of that fact by 31 July 1990.

Peter Metcalf anticipates a short list of

officers who are to be asked to 'clarify*a

part of their evidence.    For example, one or

two officers talk of having a responsibility

to monitor the pens.    What do they mean by

monitoring?    Surely nothing more than keeping
        a weather— eye out.    If this evidence goes

        unchallenged (unclarified) then another party       DI Cleverley to

        might adduce that the police accepted a             await
                                                            ....*•.

                                                                    .*r

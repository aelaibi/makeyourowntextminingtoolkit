[                      to    the       Sheffield          Wednesday        Football          Ground.

                       A    briefing          was       given     by C h i e f    Supt.      Duckenfield                in the        North         Stand

                       and    I was       part          of a     serial    together          with         9 other          officers        under         the

                       command          of P S 3 2 3        Proctor.           Our    duties        were        to    be    in L e p p i n g s       L a n e.

                       Prior       to    commencing              our    duties,       after       the       initial         briefing           was

                       completed,             a further           briefing        was    given        by     Inspector            Sykes        to     our

                       Serial,          outlining           our       overall     duties.

                       We    then       took       up    ou r    position        on L e p p i n g s       L a n e,    on    the      footpath which

                       runs       in    front       of    the     turnstiles.

                       The    volume          of    spectators           increased          as    the      day went            on.      People         were

                       attending          at       this     location,          requesting           the      location           of    public

                       Many       supporters             were     sat    and     stood      around          on L e p p i n g s       L a ne,    who      had

Officers           it w a s        impossible              to    do a n y t h i n g     about        it.       X was

spectators              who    were       just        intent        on    standing           around,

A    couple        of    coaches          a r r i v e d at         the    Leppings           Lane       end    of    the     ground/

w h i c h was          unplanned          and     these          were     emptied and              the       fans    dealt     with

accordingly.                  Some       alchohol           wa s    brought        on o n e        of    these       coaches        and

the     driver          was    immediately                 verbally        cautioned.

Assistance              in    clearing          the        road and        paths        was       g i v en by n(ounted

officers           from       time       to    time.

By about           2    pm the       amount           of    people        in t h e      area       had       grown     and    by    n ow

many       people        were       stood       around           drinking         and    generally             obstructing             the

highway.

At     2.35      pm a        large       fight        broke        out    on L e p p i n g s       Lane       and    together          with

PC     2120 Thorpe             we    arrested a youth                     each,        who    were       fighting          with     each

other.

An attempt              was    made       to    t ak e      the     prisoners           to    the       Police       Room     via      ’A 5

Gate,        however          this       was    impractical               due     to    the       large       crowds       outside

the     turnstiles.                 We    then went              down Vere         Road       to     the      Police       Ro om.

Whilst        we       were    going          down Vere            Road,     fans       were       jumping          over     the

barriers           and asking             to    buy        the     tickets        of    those        arrested.

This       had     been       the    general           order        of    the     day.        Many       fans       were     wandering

around        wanting          to    buy       tickets,            obviously           many       people       had a t t e n d e d     at

t he    ground          without          tickets.

At     one    point          one    fan       approached            with an        obvious           forged         ticket,

photocopied,                 which       he    ha d    paid £20           for.                f

The     prisoner             was    booked        in a n d         I then attended                 at    the    Gym     to    do

paperwork.

                 terraces.               Officers         were       at    this       location       tending        victims,           I went          on

                 to     the    terraces          and     assisted              in the       pulling        back    of    th e    fencing          in

                 I saw many              bodies      laid       one       u p o n a n o t h e r on    the       terraces.         Th e

    You will probably be aware that Geoffrey Dear was appointed to carry
    out the criminal and discipline enquiries in the aftermath of the
    Hillsborough Disaster.   As I understand it, these enquiries are almost
    complete, under the operational direction of Assistant Chief Constable
    Mervyn Jones and other officers of the West Midlands Police.

    On 1 April Geoffrey Dear takes up his appointment with the Inspectorate
    and, because I and other senior officers of the South Yorkshire Police
    have been the subject of complaint, it is essential that those enquiries
    continue under the direction of a Chief Constable.

     Consequently I am writing to ask if you will take over as the
     investigating officer and to utilise the West Midlands Police team and
     the material already gathered in furthering and concluding the enquiries.

     Mr Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints Authority is overseeing         the
     enquiry, and I have forwarded a copy of this letter to him.

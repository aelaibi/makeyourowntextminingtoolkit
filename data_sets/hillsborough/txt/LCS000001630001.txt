The Hillsborough Family Support Group
                 A Profile
The group’s foundations lie in the immediate aftermath of that appalling day at
Hillsborough that cost 95 irreplaceable lives. Broken families were brought together
by events such as the Memorial Service at Liverpool Cathedral or by more casual                 ^        •     . . . *
meetings at Anfield and elsewhere.
Our grief frustration, anger, disbelief, melancholy - even despair, all became a little
easier to understand when shared or just “aired” with someone else - thrown into the
sameemotional whirlpool by events of April 15th. Strangers, of all ages, from differing
backgrounds, circumstances and geographical locations - found some comfort in
sharing their emotions with someone who really could understand.
Hence our first objective as a group became evident;-
“To support and assist each other”.                                                                       S D 'P I ’O ^
The sad “statistics” of Hillsborough; 95 dead, hundreds physically injured, some very
seriously and permanently, hundreds more psychologically affected, are tragic enough,but when one remembers that those involved
were predominantly young (for example 77 or 81% of the 95
deceased were less than 30 years old, with 38 of them or 40% Dear Friends,
below 20 years) then the natural justice demands
a thorough investigation of the circumstances leading to and The Social Committee has arranged the following events and

It was this view that led to the groups second objective;-

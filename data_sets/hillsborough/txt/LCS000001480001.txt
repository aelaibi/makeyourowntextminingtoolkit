WHAT IS THE HILLSBOROUGH CENTRE?


The Hillsborough Centre was set up to offer help, advice and
support to anyone affected by the Hillsborough tragedy.
Thousands of people have suffered from the events at

relatives, or were injured themselves. But many others
suffered stress and shock, which may not have been apparent
until long after the tragedy itself.

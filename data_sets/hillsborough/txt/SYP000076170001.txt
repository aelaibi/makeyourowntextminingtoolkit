stretchers.               The      old man,       who   I have described,                        must      have    been taken

old or a bit older.                      He was     just       lying there not moving.                             He d i d n ’t

have a top on just                   blue jeans.              There was a man kneeling                            down by him

thumping          the young          lads    chest.           He was           in his      late 4 0 " s or e arly 5 0 " s

I don't         think he had a top on either.                                  By this stage               there were

On our way out,          we went      through the gate ma rk ed                19-22 on your map.                 I

saw three      people     lying    on the floor.             They were         not moving.             There

was a number of stewards               there.        I turned the other way because                      I had

seen enough.            As a c onsequence          I can't     really describe            them.



I want      to add that w h e n       I was     standing     by the       control      hose     I saw a

y ou ng   girl,   who    had been      in the West Stand,             come around.             She was       in

a very d i st r e s s e d state.         Some on e     gave Her a cup of tea.                    I remember

that a policeman          came and a s ke d her questions about what                          had happened.

I don't      think   that     this was     the     right   time to ask her such questions.


                                                                    CAT    ,
I s hould     like to     point    out    that     the^y i d e o    cameras      on the       police

control      box were w at ch in g       the    crowd a ro u n d the ground and                not    really
                                                                                   ■      ■
wjiat was     happening       in the We-s^t Stand.             Also    theN p o l i c e   just       seemed t o

be w al ki ng ar ou nd at       first     doings nothing.             It seems         that    there were

poor      c o mmunications     b etwe e rr<t h e police      inside       the ground and o u t s i d e .

It s eemed that         there w a s ^ a mass\ break         down     in cornmuncations and              no one

se e me d to take       charge w h s n tIrg. niatch was            stopped.



I m e n t i o n e d earlier    that    I didn't      see any        police      officers       outside    the

g ro u n d before    the game apart            f r o rn ^^ fe w m o un te d officers.            I w ou ld

like to add that          there were       police o ff icers          there      but    not many.

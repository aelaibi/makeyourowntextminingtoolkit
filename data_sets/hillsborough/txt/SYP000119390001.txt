the        entrance         to    the       ground        outside       the     main       gate.         As        I   j oined         this

cordon        I    was      dir ected         by     a    Senior     Officer          (I    do    not     know         his    name          or

rank)        to go         on    the   alley betwee n the River Don and the rear of the West

Stand.            It       was    obvious           that    something          was        happening           or       had    in       fact

happened           inside         the       ground.          As     I     entered          this        alley       I    saw       people

ent er i n g the alley from b e h i n d the turnstiles.                                    Some of these people were

obviously           injured,           one    middle        aged     man      was     laid        in    the     alley         and          was

being a t t e nded to by Police Officers.                                    The man's       face was blue arid I got

the impression that he was already dead.                                       With ot her officers I gave what

assistance             I    could      to    these        people.         These      people       were        talking         about          a

pitch        invasion           and    a    barrier        collapsing,          but       I was        still unaware                  as    to

what       had    actually            taken    place.         People         fetched out           into this            alley were

holding their chests,                       and ribs,       some had leg and ankle injuries.

I was       then directe d to make my way along the                                   full length of the alley to

ensure       it was kept               clear for emergency vehicles.                             I found that the alley

went       from     the     Leppings          Lane       entrance       along       the    full length of the South

Stand.           In parts         it w i d e n e d out to form a small                      car p a r k at the rear of

the    South Stand.                Here I found several Special Constabl es                                    and asked them

to ensure that the alley was kept clear.                                       I then made m y w ay b a c k towards

the Leppings Lane entrance.

As     I     reached            the     point        where     I     first          saw     injured           persons             I        saw

that       numbers              here had swollen           dramatically,              there        were        in      fact        now

10    or     12     corpses            laid     alongside           the      chain        link     fence       border ing                  the

Riv er       Don.                The bodies          had     been       covered        over       with        Police          anoraks

and        tunics.                By this           time     several          ambulances           had        arrived             and        a

man    dre ssed            in    denim      was     going      amongst         the     injured.               The      man        worked

tirelessly sorting out people                              who r equi r e d immediate att ention or m o v i n g

between the River Don and the                   rear        of the West Stand.              It was    obvious

that something was           happening         or had in fact happe n e d              inside the

ground.      As   I e n t e r e d this alley           I saw people enter i n g             the, a l l e y from

b ehind the turnstiles.             Some of these                people were o b v i o u s l y    injured,

one middle a ged m a n was          laid in the alley and was                      being a t t e n d e d to

by Police       officers.       The m a n ’s face was               blue and       I got the     i mpression

that    he was a l r e a d y dead.        With other             officers       I gave what a s istance

I could to these          people.        These        people were          talking about a pitch

invasion and a barrier             collapsing              but   I was     still    unaware 4s td what

had a c t u a l l y taken    place.       People           fetc h e d out     into this a l l e y were

holding     cheir    c h e s t s , and   ribs,        some had          leg and ankle       injuries.

I was    then d i r e c t e d to make my way along                      the full    length of the a l l e y

to ensure       it was kept        clear for          em e r g e n c y vehicles.        I f o u n d that tb*

alley    went     from the L e p pings Lane                entrance along          the full     length of,.,

the S outh Stand.           In parts       it w i d e n e d out to form a small, car                  park at.

th e   rear of the S o u t h Stand.                 Here    I f ound several S p e c i a l       Constables

a n d a sked them to ensure              that the al ley was               kept    clear.      I then made

my way back        towards     the L e p p i n g s Lane            entrance.

As     I reached the       point where          I first          saw    injured persons        X saw that

numbers     here    had swol l e n dramatically,                    there were      in fact     now   10 or

 '12 corpses      laid a l o n g s i d e the        chain link fence            bordering      the River

Don.      The bodies had been covered over wit h Police anoraks a nd

 tunics.    By this       time several a m b u l a n c e s             had a r r i v e d an d a roan dressed

 in denim was going amongst                   the    injured.           This m a n w o r k e d t i relessly

 sorting    out    people who       required          immediate a t t e n t i o n or mo v i n g . t o

 hospital.        I was    later    told that           he was a doctor.             I also saw a man

 in his twenties who was              dressed         in     *T*    shirt and j e a n s , he was

oijviously drunk.           This man was stood by the                corpses a n d was        shouting

to nearby Pol i c e         officers,    "WHY D O N ’T YOU DO S O M E T H I N G FOR THEM".                   He

grabbed at two o f f icers who were                 helping a man wit h a leg              injury.           1

approached      this man and he then m o v e d off                towards     the S o u t h Stand.               I

was    told to form a cordon wit h officers                     in front     of the b o d i e s ;       We

were    stood   in this       position for some time,               several     officers      in this

cordon were      in p o ssession of keys              for Police       vans and o f f e r e d to make

them available        for     use as    impromptu ambulances.                They were       told to

stay put but       it was      quite    obvious       that   the sheer       volume     of injured

persons     in that     alley was       too muc h for         the ambu l a n c e s at     the scene.

Eventually      several       officers were told to f etch vans.

W h e n the more s e r i o u s l y   injured had been removed by aubwlance;

alley was being         cleared of the           lesser      injuries     several M f T i ' e r s                        ,

placed    in front      of the bodies and canvas                 sheeting      draped ove r       th©            ;

barriers.       We wer e      then released to stand outside the gates.                           By tfrlfc

time supp o r t e r s were      leaving        the gr o u n d via the L e p pings t4n# e

large numbers,        a l t h o u g h they     were    being asked to stay w here             they                   ;

over    the PA system.          I was    still        unaware    of the     cause of w hat was           by

this time a major            incident.

The numbers       leaving the ground were making                    it difficult        for e m e rgency ^

services     to gain access           to the alley.                                           ;

A small     number    of the        supporters        leaving the ground s e e m e d *deeply

hostile     to Po l i c e    officers,       some s h o u t ing "YOU M U R D E R I N G B A S T A R D S 4'.

I got the       impre s s i o n that any small           incident      could turn the          crowd

against     the Police.         A large       crowd had g a t hered on L e p p i n g s Lane             on

th e other side        of the River Don,              they were     shouting abuse at officers

stood near the g a t e s .                                                                                           '*

Wh e n Leppings Lane          had    cleared      I tried to find the            rest of my serial,

I had had only fleet i n g            contact w ith them since a r r iving a t the

  V..               Leppings Lane          1 was       struck   by the    large q u a ntity of d i s c a r d e d beer

                    In recent years           I have w o r k e d at      this ground on a number           of o c c a s i o n s

                    both     inside and outside             the ground.        I have wo r k e d at 3 FA Cup Se m i -

                    steward.           I had no       idea of what had h a p p e n e d    inside the ground until

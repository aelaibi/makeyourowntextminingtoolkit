               I am a single man and                live at home at th^/above address with my mother

               I am a         supporter         of Liverpool        Football      Clu b and have been for

               I bought a ticket                for the Liverpool           N o t t i n g h a m Forest m a t c h from a

               friend and            paid him the face           value     of £ 6.00 for entrance           to the

               Leppings        Ln terraces.             I went     to the game w h i c h took        place at the

         w tn 1st    the    coach was      searched for                          That       delay    lasted for

         about 5 mi nutes           o r so.      The    coach was evetenua 11 y parkeci with othe r

         coach on a small              road area       to a brewery       I think       it was a Stones

         b rew e r y . O n the motorway,          t h a t ’s the M&2,         there were          roadworks    near    to

         the !vli, where a bridge              repair was           being made,       but the only         lanes     that

         was    in use was        the    inside       lane.     A l t h o u g h we were forced to slow down

         we w e r e n ’t held up very much.

         After      parking      the bus we walked to the ground and                         I saw some       lad

         d rinking       cans of beer as          they went.           There was       no Police       escort       from

         our bus        to the ground and             I. asked,     and was     given directions            by a

         policeman to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                                    I only had to walk

         for about 5 minutes.                 It was     generally a happy a t mosphere and there

         was    no trouble at all.               1 got    to the       turnstile       vicinity and there were

         some    people waiting           to get       into the       ground through          the turnstiles          and

         ever y t h i n g was quite        orderly.           There were a number             of people       just

         hanging around on the streets                    on Leppi n g s Lane          I was       expecting       to meet

         up with soine people             1 knew at the             turnstiles*       but    c o u l d n ’t find    them,

                    nt for a walk ar o u n d            to pass       the time.        I went       back   to the

          urpfstile at about 2 . 1 5             pm    <1415)       and got    into    the ground fairly

               eklfy.      The   crowd still          was okay and orderly.                 I knew w hich was rny

         turnstile         because      it was well m a r k ed above my entrance.

         iouth               cemejpr who were          controlling       the    crowds.           inside   th^r ground

seeing      t h p ^ f o o t b a l 1 hit    the Liverpool        goal      bar.     Then the next thing

w ith   pen 2 having          difficulty,            I thought       he was      having a heart attack.

He was a man about "70 years                      of age,    wearing a brown overcoat,                  wit h may

be a shirt and tie.                 He had balding grey hair.                    People were          pulling

themselves          up in the fence            dividing      the    pens,    from our side and trying

to   pull     people     out of      pen 3 and to our              pen.     E v e n t u a l l y we got a bit

of space around the               old m a n and       pulLeH him over            the fence.           He must

on the fence and began pulling                       people     into      pen 2.     There was also

people      climbing over           from     pen 3 into       pen 2.        When    the    crowd      in pen 3

There was          people    pulling        them apart and          passing them to us,               because

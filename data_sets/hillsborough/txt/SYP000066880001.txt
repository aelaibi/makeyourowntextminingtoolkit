               On S a t u r d a y   15 April      1989    (150489)         I a t t e n d e d the FA Cup semi-final           at

               L iverpool      and N o t t i n g h a m Forest         football        club.

               I t ra v el l ed to the game            by car with my son

               I had     purchased       tickets       for     the game for £ 1 4 . 0 0        each at Anfi el d

              F oo tb al l    Club,     for    seats     in the N orth Stand.

              volume      of traffic          for about        twenty minutes.

              On the way to the               game    even     prior     to    reaching S he f fi e ld    I saw a large

              volume 'of beer           cans and       bottles        on the     road sides w hich a p p ea r ed        to

               have    been thrown from              passing       traffic.

              Once     we had a r ri v e d      in S h e f f i el d    itself     I saw a large number of fans

          who were walking             towards    the gro^nrttf along Woo d Roa d drinking                    beer      from

           cans and bottles.             T he y w er a^ d is c ar d in g    these along      the way without

           thought.          I saw one man      Jlt\ his early twenties in particular who was
          wa l ki n g a h e ad of my son and           I drinking          from a     bottle    of beer.            When
e-vr       he had finished d ri mk in g           from it he simply tossed the bottle                         into the

        air with o ut looking.      He            then turned to w at ch were                it went.         The

           bottle     then h/t the           roof of a parked bus without                smashing and then

           fell    to the      floor.

           I cannot     say what        p ro po rt io n of the fans were             drinking      but    it was a

           lot.      On the     road    I w al ke d along      they were all          Liy^pool        fans.         I

           w o u l d not describe        the    fans   I saw as dru'His-JferdX they were              certainly

           very boisterous and               shouting and      I was       shocked by their          behaviour

           because     I am a regular           supporter at A n fi e l d an d there            is never any

                                                                      *    "     1   j*f'
           th re at e ne d    by these       peoples   behaviour.

           We had a r ri ve d     in S h e f f i e l d at about 2.15          pm    (1415)    near to a hospital

           in the Woo d Rd area              I a sked a Police Offier              in the street where              to

           park.      He told me        to    park near     to where we were and wa lk ed down to the

           gr ou nd from there.              This we did on the m ai n             road which      I believe            is

           Wo od Rd.         As we w al k ed to the ground w ith the other                    fans    I have

           d e s c r ib e d above,     I saw a number         of other Police O ff icers              standing           in

           the    street.       I did not       see any fighting,            disorder      or outright

           d ru nk en es s    on the way to the ground and a r ri v e d outside                      in Leppings              Ln

           at about 2 .30        pm    (1430).

           As soon as we turned               into Leppings          Ljpr'^andgot to the bridge          over           the

5©.£.      river Don         I could    see    that a lar^afB        crowd of       people had d e ve lo pe d

           was    such that      they had spilled out on to L ep pi ng s Ln itself and formed

            to the far            side of L ep pings Ln itself.

            O u ts id e     of the    crowd of       people who were a c t u a l y       pushing     to get     in

            there were a lot of               people milling about.

            T here was a           continual    steady flow of          people a rr iv in g      outside      the

            ground all            the time,    the m aj or i ty a rr iv i ng along L ep pings Ln along                 the

            P en i st o ne Rd side.

            I could see            that    people were       getting    crushed       in the   crowd because          so

            man y    people were           trying   to   push their way          in all at once.         I therefore

             decided         to wait,       because      I had my son w ith me,          until    the   crush had

            died down and the m a j o r i t y of people                 had entered.

            I then went with my son past the back of the mass of                                 people and along

            L ep pings       Lane    to the    junct io n with Vere Rd where              there were

              some     barricades and Police               officers.        I a s k ed one of the

            p olicemen         if there was an y other way               into    the N orth Stand,       he

            replied         ’No,    just    there'.

            The      crowd was       still    pushing and more
                                                       pepple still a rr iv in g                         so    I
                                                        y
            d e c i d e d to wait with my son near toyChese Police officers.

            W he n    I first a rr i ve d      outside       th^Leppings         Ln entrance      I saw a number

             of Police            officers    both on      fj/o t and m o u nt e d on horse back
f o u o d
            a mo n g s t    the    pushing    crowd trying         to   control       the fans and stop the
 firr       crushing w hich a p p e a r e d               be happening at the front.                 There was

            also a          Police RangVflaver           parked    in the    centre      of Leppings Ln

            amon gs t       the    crowd.

            The P o l i c e m e n were all          trying    to control        the    crowd but unable        to do so

            because more and more               people were a rr iv i ng          part ic ul ar ly

            from P e n n is to ne Roa d all           the time.

            At    this      I went as       stated to the         junction w ith Vere Rd and spoke                  to the

            Policeman          there.

            S h o r t l y after      this at a bout 2 .45 pm - 2 .50              pm,    (1445 -1450)         the

            police         started to make a n n o un c em e nt s       from a loud speaker on the
                                                                                                                   PAGE           4
                                                                                                                   S 1 114

         R an ge r ov e r      telling    fans     to stop pushing from the back                    because    people

         at the front were               being     crushed.

         H ow e ve r     the    crowd took       no notice and          continued to         push with more

         people        joining all        the time          despite    the efforts        by Police and the

         announcements             they made.

         Th e y    continued to ask            people        to stop pushing          because of the         crushing

         at    the front and as ki ng              people      to move    back.        The y also a nn o un c ed       that

         there was          plenty of       room      inside a nd that everyone w ould get                   in.

         By this         time    I realised that             there was    no way I was going to be able

         to enter         the ground before             kick off and thought              that they might           delay

         the      start     of the game as had been done                  on previous occasions.

         The      crowd did not take any notice of the                         requests at^all and            I then

         heard an a n no u nc e me n t         from the R an ge ro ve r         te 11 i 13^ the Police        horses         to

         do som et hi ng w hi ch          I could not quite make

         The Police            officers     on horse         back then artl formed a line across                    the
•fouce
  vr     entrance         to the ground and stopped                   oeople    from getting any          closer

         to the        t urnstiles

         The      crowd on the          outside       of t>fe Police      horses       continued to       push

         a ga in st      the horses and          I s^fw people         ducking       u nd er ne at h their    legs and

         heads      to get       into    the efltrance to the ground.

         The      crowd on the          insj/^e of the Police            horses       then   cleared very

         quickly.           I do     not know         if this was      because any           of the gates were

         opened        because       I could not see            into   the area        i mmediately in        front of

         the      t urnstiles        from where         I was waiting with my                son.

         Once      the    inner      crowd had thinned out the Police                        officers on h orseback

         a l l o w e d a small       gap to open            in their    line on the River Don

         side an d        began to filter             the    rest of the fans          into the turnstiles.

         After a while             it a p p ea r ed    to be thinning          out    inside    the    entrance       so     I

         then wal ke d down and              through the gap in the Police                     horse    line wit h my

         son wit h no difficulty.

We    then w al k ed to the        t urnstiles         for the N or th Stand within the outer

blue    gates     there was      still a crowd and               it was uncom fo rt ab le                      in the

crowd but       by now the exce ssive             crushing had stopped.                            There a pp ea r ed

to be only two           t urnstiles working            in these             for       the N or th S t a n d and             I

ente re d with my son thro ug h these and handed my ticket                                             in to the

t urnstile       operator.

Once    through the Police              line    there w      e       r       P     o l i c              e     o fficers on

foot    by the blue        gates.       One     of t    h   e    s       e       c    o   l   o    u    r     my ticket

was and then a l l o w e d me to the N orth £                                                 bs       I showed our

tickets.         I cannot     recall        seeing any stewards                       outside       the turnstiles,

but    they w ould have          been hard to see because                            of the       crowd.

I had no d if fi c ul t y        in finding       our    particular                   turnstile          because      I had

been d ir ected      firstly by the             Police      officer              near to Vere Rd a nd

s ec on d ly    by the Police        officer asking             the colour                of the tickets.

I saw none        of the     gates      open next       tothe turnstiles.

I did not see any u n au t ho r is e d entry                     to the ground though                        I had    seen a

y o u t h on one of the outer walls who was                          shouting at the Police,                          but

was    pulled back        into    the    crowd early on by a m o un te d Police                                o fficer

before     they had formed the               line of Police              horses.

Once    inside     the    t ur ns ti le s    there were more Police Officers                                  on foot        1
asked    one     the way and he d ir ected me towards                                 the N or th stand and once

inside the stand there were                    clear    d irections                  to our       seats from signs.

W he n we entered the ground                 itself     I heard a                    loud speaker a n n o u n c em e nt

saying     'Will    the Liverpool            s upporters        leave            the Pitch'.                My first

reaction was        to think       that      there had           been apitch                  invasion.

We    than wa lk ed towards          the N orth Stai)d and to buy a programme.                                        As we

did so     I heard a further             loud speaker a n n o u n c em e nt                   saying         'All Police

to the    playing        surface'       I then satf all          the P o l i c em e n              running and           I

thought        something     serious must K a v e happened. I then went                                     into   the

N o r th S t an d with my son an4              t / our seats just as

            the      last    players     left the       pitch and w al k ed down the          players tunnel.

            Whe n we got to our              seats    there was s om eb o dy else standing              in one of

             our     seats.        I a sk ed him to move which he did.

            E v e r y o n e wi th in the N or th S ta nd was         standing       in their     seats      looking

            towards         the L ep pings Ln terrace.

            Our      seat was       in Row 36 near        to the middle       of     the N orth S ta nd and           I

             c o u l d n ’t see what was ha pp en in g          in>^ens     three and four very              clearly.

             I could see Poli ce o ff icers               cj^Htfbing onto     the fences and           pulling       fans

             out of the        pens.                           ATT   PG-GJl
            By the time we had got                to our seats       it was    obvious       that the       crushing

             had occured.            The a t m o s p h e r e within the N or th S tand was          very tense

            wi t h    lots of       people    shouting and balling,           a bout    the d i s o r g a n i s a ti o n of

             the     ground and that L iv er pool             should have had the S pion Kop

             t er ra ce s    because     of the      larger    number   of supporters.

             The N o t t i n g h a m Forest      fans    then began taunting           the Liverpool         fans     from

orr         the       S pion Kop and a few of the Liverpool                   fans     K>am from the L ep pi n g s Ln

v \$ o & b d L end to the S p i o n , G o p and started shouting j r f the N o tt i n g h a m F orest

             fans

            By this         time    the first a m bu la nc e     Hartf come onto       the   pitch.

            The      jeering and taunting was ma in ly betw ee n                   the Spion Kop end and

            L ep pi n gs     Ln end.        A few of the fans w i t h i n the N or th S ta nd then also

             shouting at the Forest               fans.

            S h o r t l y after      this    the Po lice m a rc he d onto     the    pitch     four    a b re as t    and

            formed a cordon a long               in front     of the    N o rt h Stand.

            At this         the L iv erpool      fans wi th in the      N o r th S tand became         very a ng ry

            and a g i t a t e d and     star te d shouting        ’We   d o n ’t need you now'         at   the

            Police.

             I then became           very uneasy an d f ri gh te ne d because            of the s i tu at io n that

            was      deve l op in g w i t h in   the N or th Stand.     I thought        that    there m ight         be

d ec i d e d to       leave the stand       itself       for the        time being and go down            into

the are a        beneath the stand.

We    had a drink at the               refreshment       bar and        then went    up a ga in a couple

of times         into the stand to see              if   a ny th i ng    had changed      but   it h a d n ’t.

We w a i t e d until about 3 . 3 0 pm             (1530)    an d then       people started to           come

out     of the N or t h stand an d           leave the ground.              We then left an d made

our way back            to the    car of our own accord.

I did not witness an y of the deaths                       nor w ^ e                 Dr I i njured.The

mai n    factor        in the deaths and          injuria* to the           people was because

of the         large    number    of    people                and       causing    the crush outside

the     ground who w ou l d         n o t y t a k e ^ f n y notice at all        of the Police

o f f icers      outside       t he grpuryr trying        to control        the    crowd.

In hindsight            there were       perhaps     not en o ug h Police          officer      outside    the

ground,         but    those    that where       there did their           best.     There w ou ld have

been a d e q u a te      numbers       of Police     if the     crowd of fans had paid any

attention         to the Police          instruction but they              completely       ignored them

and     just all        pushed    in at once.

The Police            c o n tinued to    repeatedly ask         the      fans to stop       pushing     but

they     just     took     notice.

E ve n whe n the fans            had got     into any queues             they did not try to form                in

o rd e r l y    lines and shuffle          forward but        c on t i n u a ly tried to        push

themselves            to the front.

1' d i d n ’t witn e s s a n y t hi n g    that     I consider          to be a criminal         offence.

I have         no views     or o b se rv at io ns    on the way the             incident was      handled

a fter    the game         had been      stopped other        than that          it was   chaos and

ce r t a i n l y w here     I was      in the N or th stand nobody a p p r ec i at e d the extent
                                                                                          «%
of what         had taken       place.

I would         like to say that as           far as the gr ou nd           itself    is c on cerned        the

e nt rance       in L e pp in gs Ln are       completely        i nadequate        for the number         of

supporters            e xp ec te d to enter      the ground at           this    point.     T here are      too

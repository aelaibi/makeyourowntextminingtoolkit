              I got my ticket            for    the semi-final                from Liverpool            F.C   using     the

              voucher      from my season ticket,                      it was a six           pound ticket       for     the

I travelled w ith seven other                 people,     I have t ra velled to awa y matches

w ith this same group of              people    for some     time.     I was    i ntroduce d      into

this     group of supporters            by a friend of our family

The    details     I know about         the other    people who        I travelled wit h are as

5)     The   athe r three         blokes who were       on the van with us we re f r i ends

       of the other         people    in the van     1 do not know their             details.

                            ana                 organise     the     trips    to away g a m e s , and

travel with them,            but    I d o n ’t know them apart         from this,

We    left Liverpool         at about 9.30 am        (0930)     on the morning         of S at urday

15th April       1989 we t ravelled direct              to Sheffield,         I c a n ’t recall     us

being    s u bjected to any travel             delays,     as far as    I can recall we got

into S h e ff i el d at about         11.00    am (1100).      We parked the van on              a main

road outside a shop,               I c a n ’t say w hich    road     it was    but   it was      only

about    five minutes walk a wa y from the                 football     ground.

A fter   parking      the    van we went       to a cafe     close    by for something            to eat

after    this we split            up myself                  canot

a r o u n d we went    to an off        licence we      purchased two         cans of Lager        each

we went an d sat           in a park to drink        them.

At about 2 .0 0       pm    (1400),    the three     of us met        up with the      rest of our

group by the       players entrance            to the ground,                        was   collecting

tickets      from this       location.

All    of the    people      I tra ve ll ed wit h had tickets           for the stands           (seatin

area)     it was   only myself and                          who had tickets          for   the

Leppings Lane         terraces.

At about 2.15         pm    (1415)    myself and                      left our traavelling

    companions       by the    players       entrance and we walked ar ou nd the outside of

_ \ <J'«the ground to the L ep oings Lane ^entrance to the ground.                               We walked

    down    penistone Road          gj     all    the N o tt i n g h a m Forest         supporters,       there

    were a lot q^fJ^eiTice about              in that area and all               the N o t ti n gh a m

    supporters were          o rg anised      into single         file queues           up to the

    turnstiles.!          c a n ’t say I saw any Police            giving       specific        d irections         to

    supporters as we walked ar ou nd the ground.

    I saw other       supporters walking a r ou n d the ground drinking                           cans    of

    beer,     1 never      saw anyone      that    I thought was drunk              I nevar       saw any

    signs     of disorder      or fighting.

    We a r r i v e d at    the L ep pings Lane        ejjAfince to the ground at a b o ut £.40

    pm,    there were       no queues              a mass    of    people       stretching        back    from

    the turnstiles          to the area       just outside         the outer        perimeter       gates,

    there seemed to be no o r ga ni sa ti on               like    I had seen at the N o t ti n gh a m

    F orest      end of the ground,          the scene at L ep pings Lane was                    chaotic.

    I think there were about               two or three P          o   h   o    r   s   e   s     in amongst

    this mass       of people,       as far as      I can    recall        they didn't appear             to be

    making muc h      control       over the fans,         they were just trying                 to split       the

    mass    of    people    into separate         groups    by moving          their     horses amongst             the

    fans    but this was       causing       people    to become a n no ye d with the Police.

    H aving      joined onto    the mass         of fans    heading        towards       the    turnstiles

    there was a sudden surge               forwards and myself and                                 were    surged

    forwards       towards    the    turnstile      block as you           look from L ep ping s Lane.

    I d o n ’t know what       caused the surge            but wi th in about five minu te s                   of

    joining       the mass both myself and                             had got          into the ground

    through a tutyfstile.                I had handed my ticket             into the turnstile

    operator.

    I had s e 65n a couple          of    po licemen on foot standing               fay the entrance            to

    the    turnstiles we entered through,                  there was such a crusja^oing                    on

    outside       the turnstiles         that these      policemen         couldjpCihave          done
                                                                                                     PAGE         '
                                                                                                     S3543

an ything     they were       crushed        in the    crowd      like everyone       else.        I can't

remember      seeing any stewards              outside     the ground by the entrance                    to the

turnstiles.

Myself and                         got through the terrace                turnstile at about 2.45

pm, when we got through the t urnstiles                        1 said to                  ’Shall    we go to

the    left hand s i d e ’ , I had stood              in that      position for the          1988 semi

final.              w an t ed to go on the            terraces      behind the goal,          he thought

the atmo sp he re w ou ld be pr&11er              in that      position.

We headed straight
                                   /
                              dg*gn the tunnel          w hi ch    runs under       the    centre    of the

West S t a n d .     I di     not see any         policemen or s t ew a r d s standing              in the

area   by the entrance             to the tunnel.

We had free         passage along        the tunnel        until we got           to a point about          six

feet away from the exit                point out onto the terraces,                  at    this    location

there was a large amount p f people                     trying      to get onto the          terraces.

We followed everyone               else[ then as they          pushed there way forwards                 onto

the terraces,        we went        to the     left of the         central       dividing    fence at the

end of the      tunnel       into what       I now kpttw to be pen number                  four

Whe n we got onto           pen number       f o u r y m y s e 1f and                 stood       in a

position towards            the back of tjfie pen.             I have mar ke d this          position

with a figure         one    (1)    on t ha fs eperate       grid       plan.     I can only estimate

we got to this         position atffabout 2.5 5              pm    (1435)       because    short ly after

getting      to this    position the           players     came     out onto the          pitch.

On first getting            onto    the terraces        it was      very packed and there was a

lot of movement         amongst        the    crowd as     people were           pushing and shoving

their way onto the terraces.

We were      only    in this       pos/tion for about             one or two minutes when the

m ov ement    of the    crowd s/tar ted to move              us forwards          down the terraces.

We were      being moved f/rwards              down the terracing               by what    I can only

describe as a series/of                surges.        1 can only presume            these surges were

caused by more         people       entering     onto     the terraces           from the tunnel and
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          S3343

in doing       so    pushing       forwards       down the terraces.                 These    surges      forward

were    occurring       frequ en tl y every one                or two minutes and as each surge

occurred the s ev er it y of the                  crushing       increased.

1 was    event u al ly       pushed forwards            to a position            I have m ar k ed as        CiA)

on the seperate             grid    plan.

In between          position       (1) and       position       (1A)       I believe       from the    reaction

of the    crowd that the game had kicked off,                              a lt ho ug h    1 could not

a ct ua l ly see a ny thing          of what was          happening          on th^-'pitch.

By the time          I got       to position       (1A)    I was       be i n y crushed s e v e r l y and was

having    diff ic ul ty breathing                I was aware          of    people ar ou nd me        panicking

and shouting          out    to the       police    down the front             by the       perimeter     fence

to open up the gates and                   let    people       out.

By the time          I had got       to    position       <1A>    I had been split             up from ______

          I can remember m an aging                 to look       behind me and seeing

the    crowd about          sin    or eight      feet     behinr1

S ho r tl y after      getting       to position          (1A)

passed over          the heads       of t h e ^ f o w d just a couple                of feet to my right

hand s i d e .       I wou 1 d^esJ>ilTva^te that whe n            I saw this the time w ould have

been about 3,0 2            pm    (1502)    or 3.0 3      pm    (1503)      about     two or three minutes

after    I believe          the game had kicked off.

This young          bloke    so far as       I can recall was                being    passed over head,

from the back          of the terraces             down pen number             four       towards   the

perimeter       fence.           I think he was         facing        upwards     towards      the sky and

was    being     passed down the terraces                  head first.            As best      I can recall

the young        bloke a pp ea r ed to be           lifeless he had no colour                   in his face,

he was    very white and his body was                      limp.

I w ould describe            this young          blokeas a white male aged between about                            13

years and 23 years,                 I cannot say          if he was a short or tall                   bloke,    i

think he was          fairly stocky          in build.           I cannot        remember what         colour

hair    he had,        I think his hair was m ed iu m                      in length,        I c a n ’t remember
                                                                                                         PAGE          6

what     sort of      clothing        he was wearing,             I cannot       describe   this    bloke         in

any more       detail     but    later       the same day          I saw this bloke         being     passed

over     the    p e o p l e ’s heads    on a newsc li p but              I c a n ’t remember which

t ele v i s i o n   chanel    X saw     it on.

W hen    I was      in position        (1A>    I was aware             of people a ro u nd me

shouting       out that       they were        trapped up against a                crush barrier.         I

found myself          crushed up against              this       barrier myself and         I had to

struggle my way u nd er ne at h               it and up again.

After     getting      under     this    barrer       the       forward surges       continued and            I

event u a l l y ended up         in a position          I have ma rk ed with a figure                two

(2)     on the separate          grid plan.

By the time          I got to this           position       I believe       that the game had

been stopped from what                 I could hear             people ar ou nd me saying a lt ho u gh

I could not a c t u a l l y see the             pitch.

In position number              two    (2)    I was    being       crushed to such an extent

that     I was      having    diffi cu lt y breathing              I was having       to gasp for

breath.        At this       position        I could not move my body                I was stuck         in

this     position and e ve nt ua ll y           I drif te d across            towards my      left hand

side towards a narrow                 pen w hich      I np^know           to be pen number         five.

Whe n    I got to the         dividing        fej><fe between           pen number    four and      pen

number      five a policeman i^fo was                 standing          in pen number five         put

his knee       through t he /d ivid ing          fence and             I climbed onto his knee

and     climbed o veryuie         dividing       fence          into    pen number five,

I then gotvjirfxo the            pitch through the gate at the bottom of pen

five.

I think        it was about 3.13             pm (1515)          when    I got out    o h to t foe & i t ch

I wa l k e d about      on the        pitch trying          t

lot of people          on the     pitch at this             time.        I did not assist any of

these     people      other     than ap pr oa ch in g a few              people who were       sitting

down trying          to get their        breath and asking                them    if they were      okay.

I did not think at that               time that many           people had died,             I saw

people      being    given first aid but              I c a n ’t remember       seeing anyone

who    I w ould say        1 thought was dead,           or any person          I w ould be able             to

describe.

I had been standing               on the N orth S tand side of the                pitch by the

centre      line whe n at about 3 .25            pm    (1525)                     came up to me. We

saw                      in the N orth Stand and made              our way up to him.

Dur i ng the       crush    I was    in in pen number           f o u.j>*f'"""re c e i v e d injuries

cons i st i ng of bruises            to my    c h e s t ,jxtfas suffer i ng f rom aches               and

pa i ns    in my    chest and        right a w     for at       1 east a week after the

incident.          I did not sgglTany medical              treatment          for my    injuries.

We    left the ground^at about 3. 4 5 p m               ( 1545)   after       1 o cat i ng all     of our

t ravelling        companions        and   returned back to the mini~-bus»

During my time            in the     ground    I did not witness any kind of disorder                         or

fighting,         I did not see any          c onsumption of alchol             inside

the    ground,      I did not witness a ny thing               during that day w hi ch             I would

have      said to be a criminal            offence.

The    only thing         I could say about           the way the      incident was          handled

is that      I did see one young             boy about     eight      or nine years          old

trying      to    climb over       the front     perimeter        fence at the front             of    pen

number      four    the    lad was    trying     to    put his     leg up over the fence and                      1

saw a policemen            push his    leg    back down at first,              people    in the        pen

were      shouting at       the    policemen to help him but               it was then that             the

policemen         reacted and helped the                  over     the fence.

I think the            police were very^sflow at first to help people out,

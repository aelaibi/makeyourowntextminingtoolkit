               I did support Liv er po ol                  i-ootball C lub and held a season ticket                      for

               I have not            renewed my season ticket and have a tt en de d only one match

               since the Hi 1 1sbo rough mat ch at Liver pool                             but have a t t en d ed mat ches

       On the morning           of the m atch    I boarded a "Sunsoan"            coach at the

       W o o d ? i d e Hotel    in B e rk e n h e a d with my t\iend

                   had boarded another           coach at the same          point and had      left

       before us


                                                                      CAT~   T         i  ^     o     v     y
                  ch went       straight    to S he f fi e ld without stopping,        we w e r W d e l a y e d

       on the             »way but    not seriously.          I think we a rr iv ed    in S he f fi e ld at

       a bout    one o ’ clock       (1300)   and the    coach was        parked with other       coaches

       near     to a R ugby Club.          No one boar de d our        coach and    checked any

       tickets.



                                 and myself     on reaching S h e f f i el d tried to find

                   my other       friend but we     could not find him and            I did not         see

       him again until           the S un d ay after    the match,



                  and    I w al k ed to the football          ground   from the     coach,    there was a

       large     number     of people making       their way towards          the ground but        I

       cannot     remember any        problems    or m i sb eh av io ur   at all.     I cannot

       remember        seeing any P o l i c em a n along      the   route to the     ground.



       We    reacrt^d the Le p p i n g ^ Lane     turnstiles at \jne ground about a quarter
5-0.
        o two     (1345)       and there was a large          crowd milllHg aro un d outside             the

       turnstiles.         We deci de d to get something            to eat and went       to a nearby

       chip shop.         After    this we went     back      to the L ep pings Lane      turnstiles

       where     the re we re s t i l l 'people mill in g aro un d but we did not have to

       queue     up,    we wa lk ed straight      to the turnstile and gave            up our     tickets

       and    into the ground without any trouble.                     I cannot    remember    for sure

       if there were any Police               outside   but    1 did see stewards both outside

            not searched          but              was by a Policewoman,



            1 have    never       been to the ground before and did not know where                         to go,

            but    I saw a sect io n          indicted      by a     *C ’ and because my ticket           had a    *C

            we made    for       this are a and         into \    tunnel    w hich     lead to the terrace

            We walked through the                tunnel    withou'kjany trouble           there was     very few

            people using          the    tunnel    at    this time,       I remember reading the m at c h „
                                                                                s.o.ds. - W v v & d « w 3
            programme as          I w al k ed    through.        It was    now about ten    two (1350) and
                                                                                                  ---------
            at this    stage we          could stand where we wa nt ed               to the terrace was not

            crowded.



            I have ma r ke d two          positions       on a seperate         grid plan w hi ch      I produce

            <Ex No         <      )     Nos        < ) these       positions are m a r k ed as         numbers    <1>

            and number          <2).



            We    remained       in position       1 for about        half an hour        this being almost        in

            the    centre      of pen three and halfway down the                     terrace.    During    this

            half an hour the             crowd    in the    pen built up and we were             put under more

            and more       crowd pressure,            I remember the teams             coming out     into the

            pitch at about             quarter    to three       <1445)    and at this time          I became

            concerned about             the   crowd     pressure,      I don't       think   I was    concerned

            about my safety at this                stage    only that my view of the             pitch was

            getting worse             because    I was    being    pushed further down the             terrace

            towards    the       pitch.       My friend                   was   still wit h me at       this    point,



            The    crowd       crush built       up to such an extent            that    I could not move and

            found myself agai ns t a barrier,                    atfii I had    lost            in the    crowd.        I

            was    now getting w o rr i ed                was    in paiNn because        the barriers was

            being    crushed a ga in sT XL he           barrier but       this had no effect.           1 was    not

aware     that    the game       had started       I was to       concerned at being                  crushed

and    injured.      I was       square    onto the barrier and I think                        1 was    in this

position for        five    or si;-: minutes        before      the      pressure       eased very

slightly.         I can remember          one    person near me at              the barrier           he was

a ge d about 2 0-25 yrs,           male,    short,       stocky build,            I think       he was

wearing a green jacket              I cannot       remember anymore about                  him,       but    1 did

see him later walking              on the       pitch.



I was     still against          the barrier       but because           the    pressure        eased

s l i ghtly    I m an a ge d to get my right             foot   irHo the concrete                near       to the

fence     between    pens    three and two.              I m a na ge d          get my     left       leg    into

the barrier and grab the fence wi t h \ ^ h a n d s .                          I m a na g ed    to    pull

m yself    out of the       crush b sH^my         left    trainer        came off       in the        crush.        I

got    over the fence and s o m e o n e S h e 1ped me down at the                       terrace        in pen

two.      I realised       I had    lost my trainer and on looking                       back        into    pen

three     I saw    it w r a pp e d ar ou nd a metal          support       to the       fence.         I reached

through       the fence and gra b be d my trainer.                    Over      in pen two           I did not

feel    concerned there was           plenty of          room to move around.



After     this    I saw              climbing       out of      pen three          very near          to the

perimeter        fence ar ou nd the        pitch and       I went        down and helped him climb

over.         I did not     see any       injured or dead          people         in pen three at             this

stage.                    and myself wa lk ed up the             terrace away from the                      pitch

and    just stood there.



I looked towards           the    pitch there were           no players on the                 pitch    I had

not seen any        players       since    they W i e      out to warm up.               I did not see

a ny of the       play.
                  I saw people climcsLng over the fence w hich I had
                   C^nT   fAWS                         s-f
climbed over and also over the peri me te Vy fa nc e into the pitch. I now

r ealised that       there was a serious             si tu at io n and I saw             people        on the
                                                                                                               P AGE        ;
                                                                                                               S360E

         pitch getting            treatment    by St Johns       personnel and other                people.         I

         remember          in particular a young         boy who a p p ea r ed to be a ge d eight                   or

         nine    on a proper s tretcher              on the    pitch he was being given a t te nt io n

         by a St Johns            person.      I remember      the boy had dark brown hair,                    no

         top on I c a n ’t remember anything                  else about       him and my a tt e nt i on

         was    then taken by something               else.     I saw people          lying on the        pitch and

         also    being         carried across     the   pitch on stretchers and h oardings                      by

         P olice and fans.             I was   notN^ware at this             stage    vioaj people       had died.

         I remember an a m bu la nc e           coming Ifc^ito the      pitch,       and bill       boards     being

         ripped off by fans             to be used as s V a t c h e r s .                      i— '



                         and    I stayed on the terrace all             the time and did not go                 into

         the    pitch at all,          and   I was    to far    from the       pitch to       identify any-

         injured or dead.              I did not see any         person on the             pit\h    I knew.



         I had a aching            pain a r ou n d rnv hips and on looking                 I saw              iy hips
o /v T
         were    bleeding         par ti cu la rl y my rlhght hip,       I did not          think     I was
"v/CT
         ser i o u s l y    injured.     These    injuries      had occurred when             1 was     crushed

         against         the barrier     in pen three.



         We stayed          in pen two until about            ha\f    past    four to five o'           clock

         <1630)      -     < 1700) , during    this time       I reibember a nn ou n ce m en t s        being
                                                       n /g i s o           I" m x w o V

         from the Police Control               Box,     I saw him enter this box near to us in

         the    terrace.



         We    left the ground at about quarter                  to five       <1645 5 by walking around

         the end of the West S t an d and not going                     back       through the        tunnel.           I

         did not         see any    injured or dead people at                the    rear    of the stand,           it

         was    very quiet         in c omparis on to what           had happened on the              pitch.

        We headed back           towards     our    coach and saw     people walking across           the

        rugby field towards               the Clu b House,     we thought      there w ou ld be a

        telephone        there and we wan ted to ring home.                 We wa i te d   in a queue       for

        a few minutes and both               rang home without any           problem.



        We    returned      to the       coach,    me being   the   last    person to arrive,        there

        was    no one missing            from our    coach and we made        our way home arriv in g

        in Liverpool          at about      quarter    to eight     <1943).     F rom there       I got a

        train to near my home where                  I a rr i ve d at about    quarter     past   eight

        The    build up to the game was               first   normal,      like any other     big game,

        but    in my opinion the            pens three and four were very o v er cr ow de d where

        pen two      I went      into was very        reasonable and not o v er cr ow de d at all.

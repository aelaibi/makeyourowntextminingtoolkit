going        on at        that     stage.            I know       from         experience            t hat a         lot    of       people

was     sunny        day a n d          people were sitting                     a b o u t outside.

At    this       time      there        were       hardly any            stewards            on d u t y \ p n        the    outer

I walked            freely        through          the    turnstiles                         the    r ig ht into the             terraces,

there        were     no       directions            g^fc^en to         the     f an s       inside      nor w e r e        there any

I ’ve      been      to    the     ground          before        and     I knew          there       were        other      terraces             at

either        side        of    the     stcl'Rds but           I c h o se       to      go    into      the      tunnel         and    into

I was able            to w a l k        rNgely         down      the     t u n ne l      into      the       terraces           and    i   went

into       the      ri ght      which       I tm^ik         is    pen 3.

I d i d n ’t see a n y              other        gates      around           the        ground        o p e n as I       went        in.

There        w as    no— one        climbing           o ver     the w a l l s          getting         into       the     ground          for

When       I went         down      th e    t u n ne l    there we re              no    police         on    duty       or a n y

I handed my                 ticket        in at        the    turnstile           and    k ep t     the       stub,      its    numbered               .

I could         not         see a n y o n e         drinking         beer     or a l c o h o l      i ns id e    the      ground,            nor

any    disturbances.

I went       into           pen 3 a b o u t          halfway         down       in the m i d d l e        of    the       pen.

I w as     pushed            forward with               the       crowd and          I p u s h e d back         and moved             to the

r ig ht    to      let       others         f ill      into     the     ground        from       behin d.

Eventually              I moved           o ve r     to the       righ t      hand      s id e     to    the    fencing

separating              perrs3 f r o m          pen 2.

The    crushing              w as \gid but             nothing         too    unusual         at    first       but      at    the        t ime

t h e^ t e a m s       came      out      o n to     the     pitch      it w as       extreme and              I realised             I

couldn't           breathe             properly and             it w a s n ' t       getting        any       better      and       it was

going      to      get       bad       in there.

It w a s    at         thi s     t im e     I decided           it w as       time      to    get       over    the      fence        and

into      pen 2         if     I could.

I c o u l d s ee            t h e re    were        plenty        of   f an s     going      ov er the        fence      already             but

there      were         a    c o u p le    of       blokes        stood       to m y     right.

I told       them           I wanted           to    get     ove r     the    fenc e.         T h e y w en t     over         and     I

followed           them.

T he   pressure              was       still        increasing and               I had       one a t t e m p t      to    get       over,

not    really               knowing        what       was     going      on a n d s t i ll         trying      to       w a t c h the

                    notice        at     all       and      then      Just        stood          there .

                    I suppose            o n ce     the      police          realised what                     was     going        on a n d      seeing           the

                    Everything              w as    very        confusing and                    even       I d i d n ’t k n o w w h a t              w as    really

                    and    stop        the       g am e     but      I thought              t hat       it m a y       h a ve     been      s t a r t e d a g ai n.

                    I stopped            on the           terraces           and       later          I knew         there        were      at    least           ten

                    When     things           startesd to             go w r o n g          there        was        a t otal        confusion            on the

                    part     of       the     p o li c e     and      the     stewards                and      it     seemed        to    be     left        to    the

                    fans     to       s ort      out      the      trouble.

                    If s o m e o n e        could         h av e     told     the          people what                was     going       on o ve r          the

                    t an no y,        the     police         in the          c en t re          of    the      pitch        could        h ave    helped           out

instead         of    standing            in the m i d d l e         doing      n o t h in g .

People       should         have         been      told what         was    going      on q u i c k e r        than      t h e y were.

There      w as      no    communication               to    the     police       inside         the    ground          to    those

out s i d e .

This      was     the      second         t i me    I ’ve    been     to H i l l s b o r o u g h       and     I ’ve     n ev er

liked      the w a y        the       g r o u n d w as      designed.           I t ’s j u st      designed             like       a

pri so n.

Also      the     ticket         allocation            should have             been    such       t hat L i v e r p o o l          had

the    Hop      e n d of        the      ground a^d a            lot m o r e     tickets.              This     to me j u s t

seems      commonsense

t ^ ...    ...... _______________                                        p o lice     inside       and       out    should             h av e

been      better.           It was          obvious         at   about     2.20       pm    (1420)        that      the       c e nt re

terraces          were      filling          up     too m u c h a n d       they      could       h ave      been       directed            to

send      the     fans      to     the      two     pens at        the     outside         instead        of    the      centre.

I think         also       that       the    f an s    w ho w a i t      outside       to    close        on    time         before

the m a t c h        starts        should          be m a d e    somehow        to    get    inside          instead          of

milling         around          outside,           t h e n y o u w o u l d n ’t h av e       th at      sort       of    congestion.

When Liverpool                  f an s   t r a ve l    to    other       big    c i ty m a t c h e s ,       I think          there

should       have         been     s ome     consultation             from      their       police        force         with

Merseyside            Police          because         t h e y a re    used      to    dealing          with     such         cr owds.

There      are       n e v er    any      problems          with matches             played       on L i v e r p o o l        g r ou n d s .

DISASTERS AND THE LAW:     INQUIRIES INTO MAJOR ACCIDENTS

                                                                                9 4 / 63 39 .
The Home Secretary wrote to the Lord President on 26 July about
the Home Office led interdepartmental working group on disasters
and inquests and subsequent reports.
You will wish, in due course to ensure that all members of EDH
are content, or have commented.     When you have done so, you
should inform the EDH Secretariat, who will then prepare advice
for the Lord President.     As you know, the approval of the
Committee cannot be assumed until the Lord President has written
to convey it.

Those to whom this letter is copied will wish to note that if
their Ministers wish to respond they should do so within two
weeks of the date of the original letter or notify the
originating department that they intend to.

I am sending a copy of this letter to the Private Secretaries of
the Prime Minister, members of EDH, and to Melanie Leech (Sir
Robin Butler*s Office).

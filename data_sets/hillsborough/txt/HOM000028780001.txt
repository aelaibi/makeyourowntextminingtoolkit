DRAFT LETTER FOR TREAT OFFICIAL CORRESPONDENCE


Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough
in which you called for a reopening of the public enquiry.

The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough
and found it deeply moving and harrowing. In the House of Commons
he gave an undertaking to consider carefully the points which
were raised in the programme and the representations which have
been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has
emphasised that he would not take the decision to reopen the
inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be
in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance
of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider
whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome
of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
different.

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide
the Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points
raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he
will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon
as he has been able to consider all the issues.

He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his
thoughts will remain with all the bereaved families.

6th December 1996


Dear Mr Howard,

I write with reference to the recent documentary on the Hillsborough disaster and to express my
concern at what appears to be the withholding of evidence, and collusion by senior officers serving
with South Yorkshire Police at the time.

I have attended football matches for some thirty years berth home and away and have been to
Hillsborough several times to see my team, Newcastle United, play Sheffield Wednesday.
On one particular occasion, many years prior to the disaster, we were subjected to exactly the same
scenario as the Liverpool fans were on that fateful day, but were fortunate in that we managed to force
open the side gates at the top of each pen and spill over into empty terracing reserved on either side
for segregation purposes. Our screams for help were met with abuse from the police. Our fingers were
hit with truncheons whilst trying to scale the fences to escape the crush. We were pushed back into the
overcrowded pen just as we were about to escape it. In short, our lives were put at serious risk because
o f the, “They’re all animals”, attitude of South Yorkshire police.

Several people of all ages and backgrounds were injured and complained bitterly, but were silenced by
the threat of arrest for some invented, “Breach of the Public Order Act”.

I am sure that, upon the realization that their detractors could be silenced, South Yorkshire Police
became complacent and their standards continued to slip. Measures that were previously taken, such
as putting up barriers and checking tickets on the way to the stadium, were slowly discontinued.
These falling standards due to lack of accountability were, I believe, the major factors that led to so
many wrong decisions being taken on that fateful day, and the fact that ,as yet, there has still been no-
one held accountable, leaves open the possibility of a repeat disaster despite the recent improvements
to stadia.

How can any organization that pledges to take responsibility for the safety of the public, be allowed
to shirk that responsibility when the going gets tough?

Other incidents since Hillsborough, which I will gladly discuss, reinforce my view that there is still a
lack of training given to police officers on the issue of crowd control. Training which I am sure would
be forthcoming if every Chief Superintendent knew that they were going to be held accountable
should they fail in their duties.

I consider it imperative that the inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster be reopened, not as witch hunt
of individuals, but to make accountable every organization which claims responsibility for public
safety, be it the police, fire brigade, channel tunnel or whatever.
I will gladly discuss these and many other points which time prevents me from adding at this time and
implore you to consider the new evidence highlighted in the Hillsborough documentary.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and please do not hesitate to contact me at the above
address.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Howard


On the 15th o f April 1989 I celebrated my daughters 18th birthday. Next April she
will be celebrating her 26th birthday and has the rest o f her life before her, not an
option for the victims o f Hillsborough. Victims being the operative word, victims o f a
series o f fatal mistakes and errors o f judgement, but, most o f all, victims o f injustice.

“Let them rest” has been the response o f some o f the media to the Granada
documentary, to further quote, “Yorkshire Police with convenient early retirements
and compensation payments for trauma” may be able to rest, but for the bereaved
families until justice has been seen to be done there can be no rest.

As a parent and member o f the public, who is losing faith in the justice system o f this
country, I implore you to restore the faith o f the electorate in the justice system and
reopen the enquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.


Yours sincerely

                                                                          - 7 JAN 1997

I am writing to express my utter disgust and disbelief at the        re a ti& e n t,^ ^ c E
both the victims and their relatives of the Hillsborough tragv
portrayed in the ITV programme on Thursday evening.

While I am aware that this drama was of course highly emotive and may
therefore also portray only one side of the argument this does nothing
to detract from several facts which have previously been reported in
other media, and which it is interesting to note have not been disclaimed
by any involved party.

Firstly the sheer incompetency of the organisation of entry into the ground
for the Liverpool fans was nothing short of stupidity. It does not need any
great knowledge to have worked out that this in itself if not life threatening
was certainly likely to promote tensions among fans, and possible crowd
disturbances. Then to continue with this procedure while being able to
see the sheer weight of fans was grossly negligent. It is obvious now that
Mr. Duckenfield ( for h&does not deserve any title he may ever have held)
COULD see the scenes via CCTV even though this was alleged to have
not been so at the inquest.

The further bungled handling of the situation once the tragedy could no
longer be averted surely cost further lives. Why were fire and ambulance
crews not allowed inside the ground immediately? The whole country was
witnessing the horrific scenes live on National television yet police
communication was so appalling that they were turning away desperately
needed emergency crew who could surely have saved at least one life. And
perhaps one of the most disturbing alleged occurrences was the policemen
being told not to write anything down in their notebooks. One can only
 assume that this is true since there have been no public denials of any of
these accusations since the broadcast.

The appalling treatment of victim's relatives immediately after the tragedy
left me in total and utter disbelief that anyone could have so little regard
for the pain and suffering of another human being. To have to identify the
body of a loved one from a gallery of polaroids is a horror I can barely
comprehend. How can this be in a supposedly civilised society? Then to
have the audacity to interview these grief-stricken relatives with the sole
purpose of attempting to apportion the blame onto the innocent victims
of a national tragedy is beyond comprehension.

As if this was not appalling enough to hear that Mr. Duckenfield had the
nerve and complete disrespect to spread rumours through the gutter
press that the situation had not only been caused by the fans themselves
but that they had behaved like animals afterwards is no less than criminal.
Why was he never brought to task over this behaviour? Indeed why, when
The Taylor Report apportioned serious blame to his mismanagement of
the entire situation was he never brought to any kind of justice over it?
What was the point of the Taylor Report if only part of it was acted upon?
This must surely have only added insult to injury to the families of all
those involved that someone was being held up as responsible yet they
were not to be made to pay.

The inquest itself was nothing short of a travesty, with one rule for the
Police side and another for the victims. Not to mention the altering of
statements to suit the Police and the dismissal of any evidence after 3:15.
There appears to be significant medical evidence to suggest that indeed
people may have been alive after this point yet this suggestion
was discounted on the word of the chosen coroner.

It is imperative that this tragedy is not allowed to remain blame free - we
are all aware of who is to blame. While I would not suggest that Mr.
Duckenfield murdered these innocent people through his negligence
96 IN N O C EN T PEO PLE lost their lives at Hillsborough that day and
the lives of countless others destroyed as a result. Someone must pay.
Why was he allowed to retire in the middle of disciplinary action? Why
does he receive full police pension? Why is he allowed to continue
his life in the same way as before when through his incompetence,
neglect and downright lies he has ruined the lives of so many others?

 The matter is in your hands Mr. Major, you have the power to sanction
 a further inquiry into this event, an inquiry which is fair to both sides.
 An inquiry which gives these people a right to that which is imperative
 to British people - a right to justice and a right to dignity.


                              Yours sincerely

DEAR MR HOWARD

I recently recorded the Hillsbqcpjiigh documentary and watched it last night. The
programme upset me so much I feel I had to write to you to urge you to reopen this
case. I am only 18 years old but watching this programme really made me wonder what
life is all about if people in supposed positions of respect i.e. high ranking police officers
can treat other people like was shown in the programme. How anyone could ever say
justice had been done since this tragedy occurred I do not know.

The pain the families had to go through with their loved ones dying in such an horrific
way is terrible.      However having to cope with what happened afterwards is
unimaginable. Having their relatives accused of causing their own deaths, for vital
evidence to disappear and a complete cover up to take place must be soul destroying
and heartbreaking. After seeing this programme I do not feel I can ever have faith in our
so called justice system again. I can only greatly admire the families for how they have
dealt wiili the w«.-.y they imvc been ici: dowii by ike ji'Siict system and you the
government. I leave you with this thought, we can only wonder what would have
happened if a disaster like this had occurred in a VIP enclosure at Ascot and not to a
bunch of ordinary people.


Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr Howard       DISTRIBUTION UNIT


HILLSBOROUGH

I feel compelled to write to you, having watched with some
difficulty the ITV programme "Hillsborough" which was broadcast
on Wednesday, 4th December 1996.

Like many people who were present on that fateful day, I have
tried at times to put to the back of my mind the dreadful and
traumatic events that I witnessed.      I no longer am able to
suppress those feelings of anger and despair as to what happened.

I recall with great clarity incidents of human tragedy and,
regrettably, even cruelty. Once incident that I witnessed with
some revulsion was when I was trying to find out what had
happened to my brother (who I later found out had luckily pulled
out of the Lepping Lanes end) I noticed a police officer shouting
loudly and without any compassion to a boy, no older than 8, "Get
the fuck out of the way" from an entrance.      This was a child
whose trousers had been torn and his legs cut,             crying
uncontrollably.     The boy was screaming out for his brother.
This officer, together with a number of others who branded the
Liverpool supporters as drunks and vermin, acted wholly without
compassion or thought for human life. That seemed to go by the
wayside as far as many officers were concerned.     The fact that
we went to watch the match at all, made us worthless and unfit
to merit their respect.

Although I remember also with great clarity, several officers
offering much required assistance and support, it is not those
brave and thoughtful officers that concern me.   Apart from the
uniformed officers to whom I have already referred, it is my
view, having considered the evidence at a number of forums in
recent years, that there is undisputable evidence that senior
officers made a number of serious errors and those errors may
indeed have amounted to gross misconduct and negligence.
The policing at Hillsborough was not only shambolic but also
proved to be fatally flawed.

The fact that not one police officer has had to face disciplinary
or criminal proceedings is, frankly, beyond my comprehension and
an insult to those who so needlessly died as well as to their
families.

I am sure I am not alone when I call on you to commence an
immediate investigation as to exactly what happened on 15th April
1989.

Dear Mr Howard,

After watching the dramatised version of Hillsbrough presented by Granada TV last night (Thursday 5th
December), I would like to press for a further investigation to be held into the cause AND blame for this
incident.

I would also like to point out that the Police have learned very little from this incident. I travel the country
year after year following Sunderland A.F.C., and some o f the treatment that we receive from Police
Officers is literally beyond belief. There are countless examples o f this, but I will list only a few.

The first occurred last season at West Bromwich Albion, where I witnessed a fan being arrested because he
‘stank o f drink’. I concede that entering a sports stadia under the influence o f alcohol is an offence, but to
drag this man away from a young child who is screaming ‘DAD, DAD’ and has no one else to look after
him, is absolutely disgraceful. I myself complained to a Police Officer immediately, and was given the
reply, “You’ll shut your fucking mouth if you don’t want to join him”. I have seen people arrested for just
that, voicing an opinion.

Another incident again occurred last year at Birmingham, where a Police Officer walked past me singing
‘There’s only one Kevin Keegan’, this is obvious provocative behaviour, and I’m sure that I, or any other
fan, would have been arrested if we had started to sing Aston Villa songs.

The final incident occurred at Leeds this season where a young fan was ejected because he was ‘Getting
too excited’, at which point his friends objected, only to be given a reply similar to the one mentioned
earlier.

I could go on forever with examples such as these, but until this problem is addressed the Police will
receive no respect from football fans. I would confidentley say that 75% o f all trouble that I have
witnessed at football crowds have either been provoked or made worse by the Police and their ‘We’ll
tarnish you all with the same brush’ attitude.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

 D ear Mr Howard,

 Following on from the TV program last night about "HILLSBOROUGH" I wish to
 lend my support to those people feel a full public enquiry into the conduct of
 the police should take place.

 I am astonished that no disciplinary action was taken against any police
 officer which begs the question WHY?

:/T wb«ld welcome your comments on this issue.

         Dear

         Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough
         in which you called for a reopening of the public enquiry.

         The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough
         and found it deeply moving and harrowing. In the House of Commons
         he gave an undertaking to consider carefully the points which
         were raised in the programme and the representations which have
         been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has
         emphasised that he would not take the decision to reopen the
         inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be
         in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance
         of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
         what happened on that terrible day.

         In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider
         whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
         that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
         put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome
         of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
         different.

         The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide
         the Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points
         raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he
         will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon
         as he has been able to consider all the issues.

         He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his
         thoughts will remain with all the bereaved families.

         Yours sincerely

         Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough
         in which you called for a reopening of the public enquiry.

         The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough
         and found it deeply moving and harrowing. In the House of Commons
         he gave an undertaking to consider carefully the points which
         were raised in the programme and the representations which have
         been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has
         emphasised that he would not take the decision to reopen the
         inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be
         in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance
         of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
         what happened on that terrible day.

         In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider
         whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
         that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
         put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome
         of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
         different.

         The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide
         the Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points
         raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he
         will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon
         as he has been able to consider all the issues.

         He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his
         thoughts will remain with all the bereaved families.

         Yours sincerely

         Dear

         Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough
         in which you called for a reopening of the public enquiry.

         The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough
         and found it deeply moving and harrowing. In the House of Commons
         he gave an undertaking to consider carefully the points which
         were raised in the programme and the representations which have
         been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has
         emphasised that he would not take the decision to reopen the
         inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be
         in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance
         of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
         what happened on that terrible day.

         In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider
         whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
         that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
         put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome
         of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
         different.

         The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide
         the Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points
         raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he
         will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon
         as he has been able to consider all the issues.

         He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his
         thoughts will remain with all the bereaved families.

         Dear

         Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough
         in which you called for a reopening of the public enquiry.

         The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough
         and found it deeply moving and harrowing. In the House of Commons
         he gave an undertaking to consider carefully the points which
         were raised in the programme and the representations which have
         been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has
         emphasised that he would not take the decision to reopen the
         inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be
         in_tha_puhlic -interest to do so and that it would stand a chance
         of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
         what happened on that terrible day.

         In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider
         whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
         that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
         put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome

         Dear

         Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough
         in which you called for a reopening of the public enquiry.

         The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough
         and found it deeply moving and harrowing. In the House of Commons
         he gave an undertaking to consider carefully the points which
         were raised in the programme and the representations which have
         been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has
         emphasised that he would not take the decision to reopen the
         inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be
         in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance
         of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
         what happened on that terrible day.

         In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider
         whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
         that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
         put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome
         of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
         different.

         The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide
         the Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points
         raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he
         will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon
         as he has been able to consider all the issues.

         He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his
         thoughts will remain with all the bereaved families.

         Yours sincerely

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to Michael Howard, about the tragic events at Hillsborough.

As you w ill be aware, the Home Secretary undertook in December to consider carefully the
points which were made in the programme “Hillsborough”, and the representations made to him
by the bereaved families and by others. He has said that the decision to reopen the inquiry is one
that cannot be taken lightly, and he w ill need to be convinced that it is in the public interest to
do so and that it w ill stand a chance o f providing a better understanding than there is at present
o f what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to his decision, the Home Secretary w ill consider whether there is any new evidence.
He w ill also consider whether that evidence appears to be o f such significance that had it been
put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome o f the Taylor inquiry or the
verdict o f the jury would have been different.

The Home Secretary has now received a detailed report o f all the points raised by the
programme from the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire, and he is also considering copies o f
the video surveillance tapes used at the ground that day which have been supplied by South
Yorkshire Police. He w ill reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as possible.

I hope that this explains the position.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr Howard,
              I am writing on behalf of myself and many other
Liverpool Football Club supporters on the subject of the 1989
Hillsborough Stadium disaster. Whilst I felt that I k n e w a lot of the
real facts about what happened, and not just what the Newspapers
reported, 1 was not alone in being shocked by what was revealed in the
television programme recently shown on BBC1. Although previous
campaigns to re-open the inquiry seem to have had little effect, i
once again urge you to consider a new inquiry which would account for
events that took place after 3.05 pm on Saturday 15 April 1989. With
the evidence available for what occurred after this point pointing
more to unlawful death, rather than accidental, surely it is immoral

•
and unjust not to admit that the original inquiry was seriously
flawed. I admit that I do not know everything that really happened at
Hillsborough, but those who were there know the truth, and I feel that
the public should know the truth as well. A new inquiry would show
that people have stopped blaming the Liverpool supporters for the
tragedy, and help people to understand that somebody else, not us, was
at fault.

                        yours Sincerely,




                                           -r

Dear Sir

            I am writing to you tb’>eilfist your help and support in an attempt to obtain justice for
for those people tragically killed at the Hillsborough disaster and their bereaved families.
            It has been shown that the original inquest did not consider all the available evidence
and its verdict must therefore be fundamentally flawed. For example it was the contention o f the
police that the CCTV cameras monitoring that part o f the ground where the tragedy occurred
were not working yet we now know from the video technician Mr. Roger Houldsworth that they
were working. Why was Mr. Houldsworth not called as a witness and more sinisterly who took
the video tapes which showed what was seen from these cameras from a locked cupboard in a
alarmed room in the centre o f a disaster area sealed o f by the police? (a subsquent investigation
by the police failed to resolve the mystery).
              Secondly the Coroner was insistent that no evidence could be heard that relate to
events after 3.15pm. This is very convenient for the people charged with responsibilities for
dealing with the emergency procedures that day. To say it was mis-handled would be a gross
understatement. We will never know how many lives were lost through the incompetence o f the
authorities in charge. The reason why the coroner chose the time o f 3.15 was that he thought the
deaths were caused by 'traumatic asphyxia' which causes death quite quickly but it is now thought
that death was caused by 'crush asphyxia' where death takes considerably longer. Dr. Walker only
yesterday went on BBC radio to say that many o f the victims were still alive after 3 .15 a fact
confirmed by witnesses.
             From the moment the police officer in charge Mr. Duckenfield lied to the FA that the
gates were broken down by the Liverpool supporters thus causing the tragedy there has been an
attempt to put the blame on the fans and not on those people who were responsible for their
safety.
           What is needed is a fresh inquiry to look at all the facts and hopefully vindicate what
many people believe that there has been a 'cover up' so that the bereaved families can at last
mourn in peace .                                                          v

            Dear Home Secretary,
                                 I am writing to ask you tc
            power to get the Hillsborough inquiry reopened. I know this letter
            will go straight in the bin, but could you at least read the first
            paragragh. I'll say what I want to say most first; How would you feel




            and the horrific scenes of that day. For the police to say because a
            camera was not working they could not see the terrace becoming
            too crowded is incorrect. From the police control tower at

            persons on it as well.




            moment in time is the one responsible for the deaths.




                                                                           —
            else because we know the real truth and the real culprits are still
            out there!
            It seems the people who are supossed to protect us are actually the
            ones who harm us. i personally know I'll never trust a police officer
            to do anyting after Hillsborough, i am also interested to know why


            of the correct actions being taken.
If you have taken the tim e to read th is le tte r then I am very greatful
tha t you have listened to w h at I have to say.

As members o f the Hillsborough Family Support Group, we wish to request that the events o f
Hillsborough be re-examined in the light o f the totally contradictory evidence that came to our
attention during Granada’s research for the recent Jimmy McGovern “Hillsborough” programme.

We lost our son, aged 18, in the tragedy, and owe it to his memory, and all the other people who
lost their lives that day, to seek to bring out the truth.

Yours faithfully

Dear

Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough in which you called for a
reopening o f the public enquiry. I am sorry for the delay in responding.

The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough and found it deeply
moving and harrowing. In the House o f Commons he gave an undertaking to consider carefully

HILLSBOROUGH 1989                            OiSTRtSUTION U N ff


After much soul searching and deliberation, I finally decided to
put pen to paper and approach an individual which should have the
power and competence to re-open the enquiry into the above
devastating and totally unacceptab1e tragedy of 'Hillsborough'.

I was not personally touched by the above, in the sense of losing
a loving member of the family, or         nd but feel that as a
member of the public who sat and viewed with horror on that day
in 1989, and then provided with a much deeper awareness in 1996
by the Hillsborough Documentary and relevant media coverage last
week that the ordinary man and woman should have shown less
lethargy sooner and stood up and asked for truthful explanations
as to what exactly had happened and really who was responsible?

Like many, I have my doubts on a number of issues regarding how
it was all handled taking into account the families of the
victims, whose incompetences were to blame, what cover-ups were
made on behalf of members of the services, and finally is human
life so cheap that it is more important to protect the 1 good
names of those who are considered more worthy and of es        ed
rank, above those who were commonly known as footbal1 supporters,
- mums, dads,       en - the public.

In the present climate, I 'm not alone in saying, that I have no
confidence in the Government with regard to their policies -
especially since Mr Major was elected Prime Minister - it took
little time to realise that this man was a weak leader and all
hopes and inspirations disappeared. With this in mind, is it not
time for the present Government       to try and instill some
confidence into the PUBLIC - if we could see action speaking
louder than words, and justice being done - public morale and
confidences would soar.

I certainly feel that those who were responsible for the
HILLSBOROUGH tragedy need to be brought to trial, apologies
offered, and the blame lifted completely from those who were
totally innocent, only then can this be laid to rest in its
rightful place. Please reopen the Hillsborough Enquiry?

I look forward to your response.

Yours sincerely.

Dear

Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough in which you called for a
reopening o f the public enquiry.

The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough and found it deeply
moving and harrowing. In the House o f Commons he gave an undertaking to consider carefully
the points which were raised in the programme and the representations which have been made
to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has emphasised that he would not take the
decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be in the
public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance o f providing a better understanding than
there is at present o f what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether there is any new evidence;
he will also consider whether that evidence appears to be o f such significance that had it been
put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome o f the Taylor inquiry or the
verdict o f the jury would have been different.

The Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the Home Secretary with a
detailed report o f all the points raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that
he will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as he has been able to consider
all the issues.

He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his thoughts will remain with all
the bereaved families.

Dear Sir,
          I am writing to you about an issue w m c n seven years on,
still plays a major part in many peoples lives, an issue which cannot
be as easily forgotten by it's victims as it was by the establishment.

•
I am writing about a government cover— up which is amazing and
repulsive even by your party's standards.
   Mr. Howard I am writing to you about Hillsborough. Please do not put
this letter down but take the time to read it. It's been Severn years
and still no justice has been achieved.      I do not want to dwell too
much on why this happened or too much on who was to blame as I'm sure
many of my fellow Liverpool supporters would haye already done so. I
just want to share with you my memories of that daty.
   I was only ten years old at that time and living in the South, we
did not get to see Liverpool that often, but I remember the joy that I
felt when Dad said he could get some tickets. I couldn't believe it, a
chance to see Liverpool playing in the F.A Cup!, it was even a semi­
final'-. Luckily we could only get tickets for the Kop which was the
Nottingham Forest en d .
   I remember going to the ground with my best mate and his father and
my dad. It was a sunny summers dayand there            was an electric
atmosphere full of singing and laughter.   In theground it was my first
experience of standing at a match, it   was also quite full at our end
 ,in fact it did seem too full and this was before the match had kicked
off. This was my first feeling of anxiety, but this subsided as the
match kicked off.
   Liverpool were attacking our end in the first half and I was just
following the flow of the match. I remember Peter Beardsley doing a
bicycle kick which hit the crossbar and then after that things began
to happen. The players all went off the pitch and an ambulance sped
off to the Leppings lane end.
   My next memory is seeing the far goalmouth disappearing amongst a
mass of people, I could only just see the top of the ambulance in the
distance, it was completely surrounded.    I was confused, I couldn't
understand what was happening. Immediately the police farmed a barrier
bisecting the pitch along the half way     line, people around us were
saying it was a pitch invasion by the Liverpool supporters. I don't
have much recollection of the actual time that this happened.
   Next I remember fans from both teams, stewards, and policemen
 tearing off the advertising boards and running down to the Leppings
 lane end and then running back to our end carrying the boards as
makeshift stretchers with people lying on them, bodies,. These were
placed on the pitch right in front of us and people knelt down over
the bodies giving mouth to mouth resuscitation in a vain attempt to
save their lives but as I later found out, for many it was already
too late. I also remember seeing some bodies on the ground with nobody
attending to them and it was at that moment that I felt helpless.
  By that time the pitch was becoming very crowded with people
running here and there and it was at this time that we decided to
leave.
  At home my mum was with my younger Brother and she was oblivious to
what was happening. A neighbour came round to our house and told my
mother that there    had beensome trouble at     the football match and
would she like her to look after my brother. Mum immediately went and
turned on the television and saw what was happening on Grandstand, she
saw the emergency hotline number come up and she could not remember
what end we were in and so she rang the hotline over and over again
but could get no answer as it was repeatedly engaged.
  The next bit I      remember is getting   back to Sheffield station,
finally we managed to reach a phone and give mum a ring. I remember my
dad saying a few years later that the first time he realised the true
extent of what had happened was at the station, where he saw two big
grown men hugging each other and crying as they      realised that each
other hadn't been among the dead.
  I don't remember the journey home but I remember getting through our
front door and mum embracing us, then the tears started to flow.
  Mine is a story with a happy ending but for many people they were
not blessed with such good fortune, how many mums and families waited
for loved ones to    come homeonly to be still waiting to this day. It
was just meant tobe a good day out,an innocent day out, yet it
turned out to be a catastrophe.
  I still remember that day fairly vividly and the whole affair has
only started to sink in during the last few years, but I am lucky,
there is nothing around me        to plague my thoughts, constantly
reminding me of that fateful day. Yet for many people this is not the
case, Hillsborough is a disaster with implications that will last
forever . 96 people died, some young, some old, families were broken
apart on that day, never to be the same again and I keep asking myself
why? how could this happen?.
  With the aid of various books and articles I know why it happened,-
a lack of communication involving stewards, police offices, the ground
it's self and the F.A along with an out of touch government. This
government; in it's view,, considered football fans as left wing
socialist hooligans who were always totally pissed and likely to riot
at any given moment, which was why it used the same police force which
earlier had been used to brutally crush a trade union uprising.
  It was an unmitigated tragedy that 96 football fans should loose
their lives in such a fashion     , but what was even worSe was the
failure of the press and establishment to tell the truth, the failure
to treat the victims families with the dignity and respect that they
deserved and the manner in which the establishment managed to
transform the families from victims into culprits through the courts
treatment.
  This is the so called covei— up and shows that mistakes were made, it
is time for the truth to be told. During the original inquiry a lot of
information was with-held, certain witnesses' weren't called up,
policemen who were there and tried to help were told by their
superiors not to write reports or submit their notepads on what had
happened. These reports would have shown the true extent of what was
happening, that people were being crushed to death due to overcrowding
in the two central pens and that a lot of deaths could have been
averted if the gates(leading onto the pitch) had been opened a lot
ear 1ier.
  These reports along with certain key witnesses and key evidence
would also have undermined the lies that were told. This would have
proved certain prosecuting evidence false such as the coroners report
which stated that all the people that died at the ground did so
before 3:10 whereas many victims did in fact die after this time
showing that more could have been done by the authorities e.t.c. to
prevent more victims from dying, further showing the incompetence of
those in charge during their attempts to deal with the situation.
  It's also interesting that certain video evidence which was viewed
in the police box showing the overcrowding and crushing that was
occurring in the central pens, conveniently went missing during the
time of the trial. It is a well known fact that if all of this was not
with—held or covered up then the outcome of the trial would have been
far different from the original charge of accidental death by mis­
adventure.
  It is about time that a        new enquiry is launched into the
Hillsborough disaster to show what really happened. To many people
Hillsborough was about drunk Liverpool hooligans rioting at a football
match resulting in a loss of life. This was mainly due to large
sections of the media negating their so called journalistic training
or ,■skills,, and producing a report based on personal prejudices and
word of mouth rather than facts.      It's time the record was set
straight, it's time that justice is done and more importantly it's
time the families of those 96 were compensated. It is not a question
of greed, as no amount of money could ever make up for the loss of
loved ones and the resulting heartache that plagues these families day
after day. However it does show that this was not just a question of
“death by mis-adventure” but that there is someone,( or should I say
there are some people as it was not just down to one man that this
happened, i.e Duckenfield should not take all the blame, speaking of
Duckenfield, why was he put in charge of such a high profile match
considering his total     lack of experience in overlooking similar
operations?) to blame for this tragedy.
  The Taylor report has already ensured that the supporters did not
die in vain but the families still do suffer from that day's
consequences and compensation would be a major step in easing the pain
that is still felt and then the fight for justice will end.
  I understand that some of the South Yorkshire police have been
compensated for there part in what happened, now I don't have anything
against this as many of the policeman in the end did try to help and
did witness horrific sights but I can't for the life of me understand
why the families and survivors of Leppings lane, who still to this day
struggle to get their lives back together, don't receive a penny. This
is just one typical example of the many inadequacies of an aging
justice system. I urge you to re-open the inquiry, now is the time for
justice, now is the time for the truth to be told. It's in your hands.
Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

Dear

Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough in which you called for a
reopening o f the public enquiry.

The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough and found it deeply
moving and harrowing. In the House o f Commons he gave an undertaking to consider carefully
the points which were raised in the programme and the representations which have been made
to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has emphasised that he would not take the
decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be in the
public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance o f providing a better understanding than
there is at present o f what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether there is any new evidence;
he w ill also consider whether that evidence appears to be o f such significance that had it been
put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome o f the Taylor inquiry or the
verdict o f the jury would have been different.

The Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the Home Secretary with a
detailed report o f all the points raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that
he will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as he has been able to consider
all the issues.

He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his thoughts w ill remain with all
the bereaved families.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

Dear Mr Bickerstaffe

Thank you for your letter about the tragic events at Hillsborough in which you called for a
reopening o f the public enquiry.

The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough and found it deeply
moving and harrowing. In the House o f Commons he gave an undertaking to consider carefully
the points which were raised in the programme and the representations which have been made
to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has emphasised that he would not take the
decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be in the
public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance o f providing a better understanding than
there is at present o f what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether there is any new evidence;
he will also consider whether that evidence appears to be o f such significance that had it been
put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome o f the Taylor inquiry or the
verdict o f the jury would have been different.

The Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the Home Secretary with a
detailed report o f all the points raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that
he will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon as he has been able to consider
all the issues.

He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his thoughts will remain with all
the bereaved families.

Yours sincerely




Mrs P Mehta

             HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY 1989

             UNISO N ’S National Executive Council recently considered the
             Hillsborough tragedy in the wake of the TV documentary and
             subsequent reporting of the matter.

             Many UNISON members have been involved in the events surrounding
             this tragedy and the National Executive Council felt that the events
             raised issues which would best be dealt with by a full public enquiry into
             the tragedy and the events leading up to, during, and since.

             Will you give consideration to this matter, and let me know whether the
             Government is willing to establish such an enquiry.


             Yours fattnjjally

Dear Mr Howard                                                             r-— -x .
I am writing to demand a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster. My(^rother)s a
survivor of the disaster, having,been resuscitated on the pitch. W e were lucftyTne
came home, badly traumatised, but he came home. The joy of having him come
home was short lived, we also grieved with the unknown people who were not so
lucky as us. My brother grieved for the ones who were killed that day - and felt
enormous guilt that he had survived. There are many more survivors just like my
brother and 96 families still grieving for the loss of their loved ones. How can
anyone move forward until the truth of that day is acknowledged officially?

The drama/documentary written by Jimmy McGovern did not open old wounds, it
ripped us apart again. But Jimmy McGovern must be applauded for writing
Hillsborough, because it showed the tm th we in Liverpool had known all along - it
was not our supporters fault, ^ b r o t h i h d i d not speak much about what happened
that day, but he did tell us he screaTrretfat the police to open the gate as they were
being crushed and how they were taunted in return - by the very people who were
there to protect them. It is only now after seeing Hiisborough has he began to talk
more about what happened on that day. It is only now that many of us feel we can
take up the battle again and fight for justice.

You can not allow such injustice to continue. You must look into the issues that
were raised in the programme as a matter of urgency. The people of Merseyside
demand a new inquiry, we demand justice as our right.
Yours Sincerely

DEAR MR HOWARD

I recently recorded the Hillsborough documentary and watched it last night. The
programme upset me so much I feel I had to write to you to urge you to reopen this
case. I am only 18 years old but watching this programme really made me wonder what
life is all about if people in supposed positions o f respect i.e. high ranking police officers
can treat other people like was shown in the programme. H ow anyone could ever say
justice had been done since this tragedy occurred I do not know.

The pain the families had to go through with their loved ones dying in such an horrific
way is terrible.      However having to cope with what happened afterwards is
unimaginable. Having their relatives accused o f causing their own deaths, for vital
evidence to disappear and a complete cover up to take place must be soul destroying
and heartbreaking. After seeing this programme I do not feel I can ever have faith in our
so called justice system again. I can only greatly admire the families for how they have
dealt with the way they have been let down by the justice system and you the
government. I leave you with this thought, we can only wonder what would have
happened if a disaster like this had occurred in a VIP enclosure at Ascot and riot to a
bunch o f ordinary people.


Yours sincerely

          Following the viewing of the                                      to register my
regret at the revelations that the film brought to my attention,
         I am not a football follower, nor have I ever been to a football match, and
therefore appreciate that I cannot understand how tense the situation can become.
However the film brought to light an overall feeling of ‘shabbiness’ in the way the
victims and their families have been treated by the establishment. Disturbingly the
film through victims testimony suggests that the inquest failed to get at the truth.
        I write to you because I feel that these victims have been wronged and that I
need to register my recognition of their grievance.

                 Thank you for reading and noting this letter.

                 Yours faithfully

Dear Mr. Howard,

Re: GRANADA t e l e v is io n p r o d u c t io n - h illsb o r o u c h - Thursday 5 th December

l am aware from newspaper articles that you have seen and are considering the legal
implications relating to the above programme.

You will be aware that the programme incorporated implications with regard to the
medical evidence.

in view of this, I felt it of importance to forward a copy of my formal letter of complaint
to various authorities involved with such complaints.

The programme also precipitated a personal review in the British Medical Journal (copy
enclosed). Again, I enclose a copy of my formal response to the British Medical Journal.

I felt that this documentation should be in your possession when giving consideration to
the contents of the programme.

YouFSvSincerel

Dear Sirs,

Re: GRANADA: HILLSBOROUGH Thursday, 5 th December 1996

l am writing to complain that, in my opinion, I was both treated and represented unfairly
in the above programme. This was in such a way that has been professionally damaging.
The damaging nature of the programme is illustrated by a British Medical Journal article
(Vol. 313, 7 December 1996. Page 1491 - A day Sheffield will never forget, Dr. E. walker). I
have been informed that similar comments were made in national newspapers although
l have not personally had the opportunity to see them.

I enclose a copy of the BMJ article and my letter response for your information.

My points of criticism are :

1.     I am shown as a verbally named pathologist in conversation with a verbally
       unnamd off-duty police witness. This conversation is not on court transcripts and
       not on formal statements. McGovern, also took no advice from myself with regard
       to the authenticy of the telephone conversation. The conversation is depicted in
       such a way to have clandestine connotations and a suggestion of myself
       pressurising or coercing a police witness, to alter the course of justice. These
       serious implications (although interpreted by the writer as relating to the timing
       of resuscitation and not presumptive signs of life) have been substantiated by the
       BMJ article (see above). The implications partly originate from a suggestion of the
       telephone call being made at night (the lights were on), the type of over-recorded
       music and the responses of the police witness.

       The words spoken by myself on the programme 'I need to clarify a few details'
       were fictitious. The conversation, actually held during the day, was merely to
        arrange a meeting date and time during the inquest at the request of HM coroner.

        The police witness's reply ‘your the pathologist. OK, I'll change my statement,
        clarify a few points' did not occur in reality and specifically not during any
        telephone conversation.

        It is important to state that contrary to comments made by the police witness on
        the programme, his original statement made no specific mention of the time 3.30
        pm for getting to a casualty. The presumptive timing of this was derived purely
        at a later date when told of independent video evidence.

        Significantly, the programme ignored the police witness's second statement. This
        was that his clarification was stated to partly incorporate experience from
        extended first aid training after the Hillsborough disaster.

2.      Carefully contrived editing by McGovern gave the mistaken impression on one
        occasion that I said the deaths at Hillsborough were ‘instantaneous, no discomfort
        and no pain', in fact, the word 'instantaneous' related to a solitary general case of
        crush asphyxia and not to specific Hillsborough deaths. The editing, of course,
        omitted the vital information that the words ‘no discomfort and no pain' related
        to when the casualties were unconscious. I am appreciative that these points were
        presented more accurately at an earlier stage of the programme. However, the
        second occasion with ‘faded editing' created the stated false impression. The false
        impression portrayed was further emphasised by a continuity linked emotive
        comment by a relative ‘that it did not hurt a bit'.

3.     Although only a minor point, my main inquest evidence was given at the Sheffield
       Medico-Legal centre and not the Sheffield Town Hall. Again, this is contrary to the
       credit that the drama was based entirely on fact. The place of giving evidence was
       important as unfortunately, as shown, many of the events at the Town Hall were
       of a disturbing emotive nature.

The initial credits stated t h a t :

a)     ‘Certain events were dramatised to add clarity'. In fact, with reference to the
        above, the dramatisation appeared to be specifically to create false impressions.

b)     ‘That the drama was based entirely on fact using court transcripts and eye witness
        reports'. Again, with reference to myself, this is not accurate.
        Furthermore, and of grave concern, is that eye witness reports involving two
        people were presented on a unilateral basis with no clarification or agreement
        from both parties involved.

I look forward to receiving a ruling relating to my complaint in due course.

Yours faithfully,

 Dear Sir,

Re: McGovern's Hillsborough

As a pathologist involved with a number of deaths at Hillsborough, I must confess

sympathy with some points that have been put forward, since the inquest, by relatives

of the deceased. I believe, however, that the accuracy and portrayal of certain events on

McGovern’s drama documentary did a grave disservice to their case.             Dr. E. walker,

reviewing the programme, states that a pathologist (verbally identified on television as

me) is shown persuading a police witness to change his evidence about the time at which

he was resuscitating one of the victims.1The accuracy of this perception must be totally

rebutted. It cannot be overstated that I was, at no time, involved in this specific evidential

issue, indeed, the original witness statement, contrary to a comment on the programme,

contained no designated time for the event.

The function of a pathologist at an inquest is to present the medical facts and findings,

consider other evidence put to him and offer unbiased opinions that will assist the

Coroner and the jury in their duties and decisions. The word ‘persuade’, as used by walker,

admittedly has several possible meanings. To me, however, it is totally incongruous and

incomprehensible that any pathologist should attem pt to pressure or coherce a witness
 to change their evidence with the resulting potential fo ra miscarriage of justice.

 My principal conversation with the off-duty police witness, a Liverpool supporter, was

 during a person-to-person meeting at the Medico-Legal Centre, Sheffield. This was at the

 suggestion of and in the full knowledge of HM Coroner. At no time did I instigate and

 participate in a telephone conversation with clandestine motives, as suggested on the

 programme and interpreted as such by walker. The programme received widespread

 public acclaim for its content, purporting to be close to the documented truth. No

 conversation involving myself, however, formed part of the documented evidence and

 I was, unfortunately, not consulted with regard to the programme. Also, although a

minor point, my evidence depicted was given at the Medico-Legal Centre and not the

Town Hall, Sheffield.

Contrary to walker's article, the comments, made by the police witness on television,

related to the timing of presumptive signs of life and not resuscitation. It is also to be

regretted that, carefully contrived editing of my evidence by McGovern could give the

false impression that the mode of dying at Hillsborough was 'instantaneous, pain free and

with no discomfort’.

There is, no doubt, that at the inquest an important aspect of the medical evidence was

the formulation of opinions on clinical awareness, the rapidity of unconsciousness, and

the time-scale to somatic or brain-stem death. Based on factual evidence, the views of

pathologists involved and expert neurological opinion, HM coroner decided that all those

who received fatal injuries were somatic or brain-stem dead at 3.15 pm.

The original witness statement, to which walker referred, contained comments on

possible signs of life in a casualty. The time, derived from other evidence and not the

police witness statem ent, was believed to be at or after 3.32 pm. The formation of expert

medical opinion on the rapidity and timing of death can be extremely difficult.

Accordingly, it is both desirable and reasonable, whenever possible, that other evidence



                                            2
 is taken into consideration, it is well known that the declaration of somatic or brain-stem

 death can be fraught with substantial difficulties. This can hold true for qualified and

 experienced medical practitioners, even when working in ideal conditions and with the

 assistance of sophisticated equipment,          it was vital, therefore,   that the medical

 authenticity of witness impressions relating to the presence of life or death was explored

 diligently. This was crucial for all parties involved and particularly so when there appeared

 to be a discrepancy between expert medical opinion and a witness statement, in the final

 instance, however, each witness must be relied upon to present what they believe to be

the truth, whole truth and nothing but the truth'. Until, McGovern’s programme, I had

no reason to believe that any witness involved felt that their evidence had been given

other than openly and voluntarily, indeed, the second statement by the police witness

made a point that his clarifications incorporated the added benefit of further first-aid

training in the period after Hillsborough.        I certainly played no active part in the

formulation or wording of the second statement.

With reference to myself, I regard it as unfortunate that walker’s article was allowed to

publically re-highlight and even misconstrue the inaccuracies shown and implied on

McGovern's programme. Both can be interpreted as professionally damaging, and I am

seeking a ruling from the Broadcasting complaints Commission. I thank those colleagues,

who, despite McGovern's programme and walker's article, have not doubted my

professional integrity in the matter.

Yours faithfully,

COMMENT

I am aware that the word count of this article is greater than that normally permitted in

the Letter section of the BMJ. However, you will now be appreciative that Dr. E. walker

has committed a serious inaccuracy, which could potentially significantly amplify

McGovern's professionally damaging remarks. I feel it desirable that Dr. walker should

make a specific response to the contents of my letter.

 The broadcast has highlighted several questions that have not been
sufficiently addressed. Failure to answer these questions w ill severely place
British justice under the suspicion that it is not as highly regarded as we
would like to believe it is.
 The points at issue I believe are as follows;
 Why, if 42 ambulances Were at the scene were only two allowed onto the
pitch ?
 Why with this amount of trained medical personnel available were members of
the public left to minister to the injured and dying ?
 Why were the Fire Brigade with specialist bolt cutting equipment and oxygen
not allowed into the ground ?
 If BBC commentator John Motson could see on his monitors at 2.45 pm that
problems existed In the Leppings Lane pens, why could the Police not see the
same on their monitors ?
 Was there indeed a police video tape showing this and if there was how has it
come to 'disappear' ?
If a sworn affidavit by the civilian installer of the surveillance cameras exists
stating that problems could clearly be seen, then why was this man not called
to give evidence at the inquest ?
  Why when it was plainly obvious that people died well after 3.15 pm, did the ...


coroner refuse to hear evidence referring to deaths after this time ?
  Why was an officer with so little experience of policing such events put in
charge■?
  Why did the police not put filtering cordons in position to alleviate crowd
surges as had indeed been done on previous occasions ?
  Were police officers told not to enter anything in their notebooks after the
tragedy and if they were why was this ?
  Why did Chief Superintendent Duckenfield mislead other people by telling
them fans had forced open a gate when the officer knew that he personally had
given the order to open the gate ?
 Indeed at the inquest Chief Superintendent Duckenfield when asked certain
questions gave replies of 'I'm not sure', 'I cant remember', and 'I dont recollect,
its a long time ago'. Surely if any of his subordinates had given such replies in
a court their competence would be in serious doubt. Why did a man in his
position not know ? This further rises the quetion was even he told not to write
up any notes ?
 The broadcast also showed policemen being told to alter evidence statements
regarding the time they were administering mouth to mouth resuscitation. Was
this true and if it was who told them to do it and why ?
 If emergency services personnel who are paid and trained to work in such
situations have been awarded large sums of compensation for trauma
suffered, why have the families of the bereaved who suffered due to alleged
mismanagement by the same police force been offered such derisory sums in
compensation ?
 The now Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has been on television and
admitted that his force on that day did not act in accordance with their remit.
 Surely with all ,this doubt in existence you must order a new inquiry into this
tragic disaster. There are too many unanswered questions. Until they have
been thoroughly and openly investigated doubt will always exist in Hie minds
of the public. Doubts as to the efficiency and integrity of certain emergency
agencies.
 I would urge and Implore you in the interest of truth, honesty and justice as
well as for the sake of the bereaved families to order a new open and
independent inquiry at the soonest opportunity.
 I would appreciate your own comments on this unfortunate matter.
Dear Mr Howard,                                                     rTl            c>-
                   I am writing to you withreferencetJMbgrecent teflga&onprogramme concerning
the Hillsbourgh Football Disaster. This was shown on the O ^ T ^ ^ lfejro g ra n im e contain®!
several points that I was previously unaware of, which I think need urg^'cte^fication.        >-

1. I am of the opinion that the programme was very well researched with eye^ft«esa_aecounts,
Police, Ambulance and Fire service reports. This was combined with the results of the Taylor Report
and the evidence provided by the longest Public Inquiry in British Legal History. Yet according to
this Inquiry an “Accidental” verdict was returned. This puzzled me. So I consulted my Chambers
English dictionary that described “accidental” as follows:

“An unexpected event, often unwanted or causing injury...happening by chance”.

I would suggest that due to the nature and course of events that the disaster could not have been
“accidental”, for the following reasons:-

a) Football matches occur every weekend without incident. Some have attendance’s far in excess of
that at Hillsborough on the day in question. I.e. Old Trafford, Anfield and Villa park. Why haven’t
these grounds had similar incidents? There must be a reason why Hillsborough was different.

b) With the amount of ground supervision, state of the art close circuit surveillance and a
Government Issued Safety Certificate, someone must be responsible for the death’s of so many
innocent and in many cases young people. Someone has to take responsibility for the events that
happened.

c) The Taylor Report as you know contained, many recommendations for Football Ground
Alterations. I accept that the report had concluded before the enquiry reached a verdict, however, why
did these alterations have to take place if indeed the disaster was “accidental”? Which by its very
definition is unpreventable and unexpected.

d) Again the Taylor report concluded the disaster could have been avoided by funnelling people into
empty areas of the ground. This must highlight to you how the disaster was preventable and could not
possibly be “accidental”. This leads me to the conclusion that the incident was something other than
an accident.

2. Am I right in assuming that it was responsibility of the South Yorkshire Police to ensure the safety
of everybody who attended the match? If my assumption is correct, I would suggest that the Police
failed in their duty to protect the public interest. Therefore, should they not be held responsible and
disciplined? It is not acceptable to me that the officers in command, ultimately responsible for the
safety of the people in the ground have not been held responsible for their incompetence in assessing
and dealing with the situation. Were they expecting an F.A Cup semi-final not to be busy?

If it was my responsibly for so many people, I would make sure that I knew, in detail, the layout of the
ground. I would have a comprehensive plan of action in the event of an incident. It is obvious that
the Police were unprepared for the situation and their inadequate preparation showed.

3. It is my understanding that at the enquiry, it was revealed that a camera positioned in the Leping’s
Lane position was faulty. If this was so, why was a check not done before the match?
Why was the video tape from this camera lost?
Does this loss of legally binding evidence happen a lot within the Police Force?
Why was the technician who installed the system not called at the enquiry?
Too many Questions remained unanswered. Questions that are very important if the Police are to be
c le a r e d o f r e s p o n s ib ility .




4. The Inquiry was very complicated, with several legal arguments beyond the ordinary member of
the public. Yet they were the people who decided the final verdict. I would suggest there should have
been some other way of conducting an Inquiry using more legally qualified personnel.


I am sure there are many more questions that remain unanswered. While they remain in this
inconclusive state, I think the people who died, their families and the Country as a whole are being
done a great injustice.

I must urge you in the strongest possible way to conduct a further, more in-depth Inquiry to settle the
doubt that many people have in the original Inquiry. This matter cannot be left like this.


                                            Thanking you for your kind attention

           I write concerning the recent screening of ‘Hillsborough’. If the information in the film
          concerning suppressed video footage and ‘losf tapes is true (amongst a number of
          disturbing issues raised) then I believe that you should lend support to the families of the
          victims of the tragedy in their call for reopening the inquiry and bringing to trial those who
          appear to be at fault. Only in this way will all the facts be placed before the courts and
          justice can finally be seen to be done.


          Yours Sincerely




                                                                                         2 3 DEC 1996

Rt. Hon. John Major MP,

Dear Mr. Major,

Having just watched the recent harrowing drama-documentary, Hillsborough, I am moved to
write to you to urge your government to reopen the inquest into the 95 deaths that occurred in
April 1989 at the Hillsborough football stadium.

I am struck again, as I was at the time, by the shabby and thoughtless treatment that the relatives
o f Hillsborough victims were subjected to after the horrific and grotesque death o f their loved
ones. It seems clear now, as it seemed at the time (and as concluded in the Taylor report), that
the South Yorkshire police force are, in large part, responsible for the carnage that occurred
there. The exit doors should never have been opened. Video camera surveillance o f the
ground should have been used by the police in order to spread the fans around the ground and
avoid the fatal crush. Ambulances should have been allowed onto the pitch immediately. The
senior police officers responsible should have been held properly accountable for their failure
to avert this tragedy. The scope o f the inquest should have been widened and families of
victims should have been properly compensated for their incalculable loss. The evil lies
peddled by the Sun newspaper should not have been supported by the evidence, in court, of
police officers who were present at the ground and who, it would appear, manufactured these
stories to divert attention from their failures.

Unfortunately it seems that, as with so many miscarriages o f justice that come to light long after
the original verdict, political forces carry more weight than human ones. It is your
responsibility, as the highest placed representatives o f the British people, to ensure that this
case is reopened and that a full and fair enquiry follows that takes into account ALL the
evidence, not just the evidence that the police choose to submit. I sincerely hope yo^i will
recognise this responsibility, even if it means political embarrassment I look fonyard to
hearing from you.

RE. The Hillsborough I:           &3 D E C W %
Dear Mr Major,                    cu            uwt

A s a person w ho watche                     Events of the H illsborough tragedy on the
television on the day it happened I am contacting you to give support to the request of
the relatives to reopen the inquiry into the H illsborough tragedy.

I admit to watching the recent television drama, how ever, I realise that producers of
these programmes som etim es w ish to sensationalise in order to b oost ratings.
H ow ever, for me the programme did highlight a number of areas of concern that really
do need further examination and for w hich as a member of the public w ould require an
answer.
The w hole issue surrounding the investigation into the tragedy raises too many
unanswered questions. It seem s to me if they had been thoroughly answered the first
time around this w ould not have led to the relatives asking the makers of television
drama to highlight the w hole incident.

Therefore, because of these unanswered questions, I feel that the people of this nation
need to know that justice is being carried out on behalf of those victim s w ho died. If
the fam ilies of the victim s are still feeling that justice has been denied to them or that a
cover up has taken place then this nation and its governm ent should respond to their
request.

I hope Prime Minister, that as a member of a government w ho states it is hard on crime
and cover up’s you w ill respond to the relatives request.

Dear Michael Howard M.P.           \
        I am writing to you as Honrn
                               HomelSecretary. I( would like to express the concern that I
feel over the handling of the Hillsborough disaster.

        I hope very much that you have new been able to watch a recording of the
recent docu-drama about the disaster and that it has given you fresh insight into the
disaster, especially some of the evidence that has come to light since the inquiry.

         I am interested in your opinions of the docu-drama, and I would be particularly
grateful if you could clarify one thing for me. The film showed that only one ambulance
was allowed on the pitch although it appears that more were necessary - is it correct
that o ily one ambulance got onto the pitch, and furthermore were more ambulances
requested onto the pitch.

       There are obviously very many more questions that 1would like to ask but 1dare
say that that would prolong the process. I would therefore like to urge you most
strongly to hold an independent inquiry into the disaster. 1believe that this would be
easier now that many people who were directly involved in the disaster are not now in
the same pressured job that they were in during the disaster.

       Finally, 1think that a new inquiry would help the cause of justice and enhance
the general belief in the justice system in this country, for there are many millions of
ordinary people who were and stiil are deeply affected by this man-made disaster.

yours expectantly,
                                                                                                                       i r U . __________

Home Secretary
House of Commons
London


Tuesday 17th Decem ber


Dear Mr Howard

With reference to the television documentary ‘Hillsborough* aired on ITV on
Thursday 5 th December, I would like to add my voice to the important campaign to
correct what appears to have been a terrible injustice.

As the Home Secretary you are bestowed with powers by us, the general public,
which you have a responsibility to use in the protection o f all of our interests. This
means to the best of your knowledge and abilities, ensuring where possible that our
legal and police systems work properly and fairly.

I was outraged and deeply distressed to learn how the families of the Hillsborough
victims were treated in the direct aftermath o f the disaster and in the following
years.
I highlight in particular the following points

        There were key witnesses never called to give evidence at the inquests into
        the deaths o f the victims.
        Some members of the police force called to present evidence at the inquests
        appear to have perjured themselves.

It is your responsibility to find out the truth.

I’m sure the relatives would want more than anything to be able to put the events of
the 15th April 1989 behind them (as some critics o f last week’s documentaiy have
suggested they do). But in order to try to get on with their lives they must first
come to terms with their losses and find some sort of peace. However, this must be
impossible. It would be for me. Would you be able to feel at peace if your son or
daughter had been cleared of all blame in the disaster (in the Taylor Report) yet
those implicated and directly blamed (also in The Taylor Report) had been allowed
to lie in court and manipulate the media to perpetuate the myths that still shadow
the disaster? I wouldn’t be able to.
For example, many members of the public still perceive that

1.    Liverpool fans charged through a locked gate
2.    The police did all they could to help those trapped
3.    People who w ere crushed all died in an instance and without pain

However it is clear that the above are myths. Today there are people walking
around in our country who have known for seven years that they are responsible for
the events that occurred at Hillsborough. In fact more than being accountable for
the terrible accident and refusing to accept any blame for it, they also hold full
responsibility for treating victims and victims’ families with contempt and little
respect.

It is your responsibility to ensure to explore these issues and respond to the public’s
calls for fresh inquests.

If you do not have time to watch the documentary (as you did not at the time it was
aired) I draw your attention to the front page of The Independent on Sunday
(8.12.96). Facts presented there totally discredit the first Hillsborough inquests.




Yours sincerely

Dear Michael Howard

Once again it seems to take a television documentary to reveal the truth.

I was appalled to watch Jimmy McGovern’s portrayal of the events leading up to the
deaths of 96 people at Hillsborough football ground. Events previously relayed to me by
a friend who had been present at the match, in the pens, who had waited an hour and a
half surrounded by the dead and dying before any help reached him. Events which
understandably still traumatise him to this day.

Why is this government so reluctant to accept culpability in any form? Why were the
police recently granted compensation for events witnessed that day on the grounds that
they suffered unnecessary hardship in the line of duty due to negligence of their
superiors? Why haven’t the families of those who lost sons and daughters, fathers and
mothers been offered similar compensation, let alone an apology from this government?
And why was Sergeant Duckenfield allowed to escape investigation by early retirement?
In fact why has the whole thing been effectively swept under the carpet?

I have never written to a Member of Parliament before. I am not a football fan. I am
merely a member of the public who has felt driven to add my voice to all the families
who lost loved ones so unnecessarily. I believe there should be another enquiry into what
happened that day. Please do not let us down.

I look forward to hearing from you on this matter.

Yours sincerely

Let this letter add to your pile of pic a m m        ______
Hillsborough story. I was one of the                        to tears
by Jimmy McGovern’s extraordinary story of huw Qlb! finAilies
report the events of that day. There were simply too many
questions raised to leave the case closed, even if your courts find
that some of those were based on hearsay or hysterical evidence.
I recognise that it must be a difficult time for you; your record as
we come to election time, has hardly been exemplary, and a re­
opening of the case could be misconstrued as electioneering. But
dig deep in you heart to decide whether or not more personal
criticism matters to you now. The country will thank you for
your compassion.

Dear Sir

I am writing to you regarding the broadcast of Hillsborough on 5 December 1996; and the details in
this programme that have not been addressed by the courts.

It is now proven that there has been suppression of evidence regarding the police camera’s, this
evidence should be heard in the courts. Also, I am appalled that the inquest refused to accept evidence
regarding the disaster after 3.15pm. So much happened after that time that still needs addressing and
those responsible brought to task.

           People were still alive after that time. This is not hearsay.

           The Fire Brigade were turned back when their help was vital to the rescue operation.

           Ambulances waiting outside the ground with qualified paramedics, whilst inexperienced
           police and public tried to resuscitate those dying; thus denying the injured the very best of
           help.

The Taylor Report was ignored at the inquest, which absolved the fans and according to a statement
from the present Chief of Police in Sheffield, is still being ignored.

The police showed total insensitivity dealing with the bereaved. Relatives shown photographs of all
the dead, even though, for example, they were looking for a young girl. Has anyone been reprimanded
for that and an apology made to the families?

The interviewing techniques used by the police afterwards were a total disgrace. Whose orders were
they obeying, when every officer was the same, or is it usual for bereaved families to be treated like
scum Or is that technique used only for football supporters’ families.

I am ashamed of our supposed protectors.

I realise there must have been panic but one bad judgement led to another and another.......
Police are only human and make mistakes but no mistakes have been admitted to, and this I feel makes
matters worse.

Sir, I plead with you on behalf of all decent people to open up the enquiry so all evidence can be heard.

If you don’t, no-one will have faith in the justice of this country and I for one, will not be able to
support a government that disregards justice.

Yours faithfully

The Right Honourable John Major,
Prime Minister,
10 Downing Street,
London.

6th December, 1996.

Dear Mr. Major,

This government owes a debt to the victims and survivors o f the Hillsborough
Disaster. Just because it was not you in 1989 does not mean you do not shoulder that
responsibility now.

Shame on our system that allows people to be treated in this way. Shame on those
whose job it is to protect us, but who care for nothing but protecting themselves.
Shame on those of you at very the top who can change things, but chose to do
nothing. Shame on you.

These people deserved better then, and they certainly deserve better now. It is within
your power to begin to repay them for the wrongs they have suffered and the losses
they have incurred. Do something.

Yours sincerely,
M   y

  Dear Mr Howard,

    feel it is time you reconkWered your position on fhe matter of the Hillsborough
  ‘disaster’. I use the term quite loosely as I consider a disaster to be an unavoidable
  event.

  Since so many people that could be culpable and were in a position to effect the
  outcome of the coroner’s decision and are no longer in that position, eg ex Chief
  Superintendent David Duckinfield; then maybe a fair and just inquest can now be
  carried out.

  Being a member of a political party that is approaching a general election with
  diminishing support from the general public; surely such a populist action could not
  only do your party a favour but also aid the worthy cause of justice and truth.

  Mistakes happen but attempting to cover them up is inexcusable. Please reopen
  the Hillsborough inquest.

  Yours sincerely, an undecided voter,

Dear Sir,

               RE-OPEN HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY

After watching the drama-documentary on the HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY, on 5/12/96,
on ITV. I can’t help but come to the conclusion that a terrible injustice has been done to the
families o f the victims.

      Jregtfnent was a disgrace. There is evidence o f a massive cover-up and the police must not
be allowed to get away with it. The frustrations that these families feel are the sort that ends up
forcing ordinary law abiding people into taking the law into their own hands with disastrous
consequences. Please don’t let that happen. Let’s have justice! Re-open the HILLSBOROUGH
ENQUIRY! That is what the people o f Liverpool and I believe the majority o f the people o f this
country want.

Thanking you in advance.

I remain.

Dear Sir

I am writing with reference to last night's screening of the
Hillsborough drama.

This programme highlighted the major cover up by South Yorkshire
Police, who placed the blame on the disaster on drunk football
supporters. The victims and their families suffered a terrible
injustice by the British legal system and their treatment by the
authorities was horrendous.

I urge you to reconsider the request by the families to re-open
the inquest. It is plain to see who should take the blame for
this terrible tragedy.

Yours faithfully

Dear Home Secretary,

Re: Hillsborough

I was aware o f the Hillsborough disaster from information I read in the newspapers at the time
o f the disaster. I was further informed about the disaster and how the families o f the victims
suffered through insensitivity, lies and distortions and general mismanagement o f the whole
terrible carnage and aftermath, through studies I had to take on planning for emergencies.

I did not fully understand that the case was now closed -and that only new evidence would allow
for a re-opening o f an inquiry.

Nevertheless, I feel strongly enough about this to ask you to open an inquiry into Hillsborough
in order to see common justice done. In my view justice was not effected properly by the State
either for the victims or for the victims families.

I do not think Hillsborough w ill ever be laid to rest until another inquiry is deemed to have
examined all the issues -many o f which may have been mentioned, but in my view were never
dealt with satisfactorily.

I am particularly interested in the question o f the camera in the monitoring box, the missing film,
the pathologists report on asphyxia and time it took victims to die, and the assumptions made at
the hearing concerning pain experienced by the dying. I am concerned also about the the lack
o f opportunity for families to challenge findings at the time o f the inquest because they were in
shock or were not diligent because o f ignorance. Guidance for them seemed to be inadequate.

I also think that the misinformation which was reported in some newspapers, in particular the
Sun newspaper, which has a readership o f 10 million people, created an atmosphere o f hostility
not only towards the dead who could not defend themselves, but towards the families. This
misinformation was allowed to fester in the public imagination and creed an atmosphere at the
time which did not allow for justice to be seen to be done.

I think common decency and humanity demands that you as Home Secretary agree to open an
inquiry. I think it would be a very popular and very right decision.

I am, not a football fan.


Yours sincerely

I feel compelled to write to you having last night watched “Hillsborough” on
TV. Words canot express my disgust at the treatment received by the families
of those who died in this tragic incident.

You will note, I hope, my failure to use the word accident despite the ruling of
the inquest. This is because no feeling human being having watched the
incompetence of South Yorkshire Police and the way in which the coroner
appeared to be biased towards them at the inquest.

As a law student, I am well aware of the failings of our legal system but I have
always believed that in all matters, our system maintained a neutrality when
hearing cases and delving into matters put before it. To watch, therefore, the
coroner allow a police witness make reference to incidents that happened
weeks after the events at Hillsborough and yet not let one of the victims make
reference to events of the day merely because the medical evidence
suggested that all the dead were dead by then, filled me with disgust and
loathing. Surely in an inquest into events of that nature, all the events of the
day are relevant to the manner of death of the victims.

I am writing therefore, to beg you to concede to the request of the families of
those who died and allow them the opportunity to discover exactly who is
responsible for the deaths of their loved ones in a new inquest. Perhaps this
could happen away from Sheffield in order to remove any possible bias
among the jury but nevertheless nothing but a new, scrupulously fair, inquest
into the evnts of that fateful day will satisfy the public at large.

Your government stands accused of failing an enormous amount of people
over the last 17 years. Please address the balance now.

Dear Mr Howard

I am a Liverpool Football fan, and after watching Jimmy McGovern’s Hillsborough Documentary last night feel
that I have to write to request that the inquest into the 96 victims deaths be reopened. It is obvious and has been
for the last seven and a half years that a great misjustice has occurred, and now is the time to right a terrible
wrong.

South Yorkshire Police obviously covered up a lot of facts during the previous inquest resulting in a great
miscarriage of justice. Lord Justice Taylor in his report gave us the answer everybody knew, that the Police were at
fault, yet why has no one come to trial over it?

Please for all the families and friends of the victims, and for football fans nationwide, reopen the inquest and let
the public know the TRUTH, let not the 96 lives be lost in vain.

Yours sincerely,
                                                                                                          _-__

6th    December             1996




Dear Home Secretary



In view o f the recent remarks made by the Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police that
Granada Television’s programme “Hillsborough” failed to shed any new light on the subject,
and o f remarks made by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that ‘There w ill be no
whitewash”, I urge you to call a second enquiry for three reasons;


        1        It is now clear that several key witness committed peijury.

        2        It is now clear that vital video tape evidence was withheld.

        3        It is now clear that a number of victims were alive after 3 .15pm.



The findings o f the original Coroner’s hearing and subsequent inquiry can surely no longer be
a matter o f reliable public record.

It is your duty as a public servant and as oik of the nation’s foremost judicial figureheads to let
justice be seen to be done.

I await your reply



Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Howard:

         I lived on Leppings Lan^m^Hffday of the Hillsborough disaster. What has followed has
been the worst and most insidious misuse of police and judicial power in recent memory. I have a
six year old boy: I hope with all my heart that I never have to rely on British Justice in a similar
fashion to those families bereaved at Hillsborough.

  If this rase is not reopened and the truth pursued until found I will finally give up on a nation that
that has many fine qualities but is, it would appear, morally bankrupt.

 I ask you to please re-open the Hillsborough victims inquest.

Dear Mr Howard,

I am writing to you concerning my views on the Hillsborough tragedy,

which has been brought back to the attention of the media and public

by the broadcast of ITV's docu-drarsa "Hillsborough".

I don't know if it was right to dramatise the events that occurred so

soon after the diaster because nobody close to me was involved in it,

but I know that if I were one of those relatives I would want to know

the truth about how my son or daughter or father or mother had left

that morning to watch a football match like thousands of other people

all over the country do every week and ended up never coming back.

I would also want to know why an F.A.Cup semi-final involving a club

like Liverpool,who have a hugh following of fans who will travel for

miles to watch them,was being held in a ground with insufficent safety

precautions and no apparent organisation concerning the emergency

services present there.

Having attended many football matches I know that the chances of a

catastrophe like the one in Sheffield is remote,but tfye obvious lack

of thought, and preparation from the Pdlice officer in charge is almost

as unbelievable as the cover-up afterwards.

I have no personal problem with the Police Force,in fact I applied to

join the Metropolitan Police during their last recruiting campaign,but

nobody is outside of the law no matter how many times they have put on
a uniform or what their rank is.

How can ex-Chief Superintendant Duckenfield refuse to apologise to

the families of the victims for a decision he m a d e ,whether he genu­

inely though it was correct at the time or not?

He has shown no respect for the bereaved relatives and by trying to

twist the blame on to everyone else the senior officers of bhe South

Yorkshire Police Force have either confirmed exactly what sort of

corrupt,two-faced organisation it is or destroyed any trust people

have in~ the decent men and women who do a particulary difficult job

generally well all over the country.

Being a London based Liverpool supporter,I know people drink before

games and I have repeatedly seen alchol removed from idiots who are on

their way into grounds,but even the suggestion that nearly every fan

in the crowd had averaged on 20 pints is astounding.

Firstly,I know people can hold varied amounts of alchol before any real

effect takes place but even a hardened drinker would have problems

sustaining that sort of amount without the effects being very visible,

and how did these same drunken yobs l.as they were clearly viewed) manage

to be sober enough to perform C.P.R.on other spectators?

Also why did Police officers at the turnstiles who are supposed to be

conducting basic alchol and weapon searches on fans passing through not

detect the extrene signs of alchol consumpion on people?

Surely that in itself should be classed as a shurk of responsibility and

the suggestion of missing video evidence and witness statements being

changed puts a very uncomfortable,and in fact frightening,image of the

senior Police officers across.

You start asking yourself if they can try to cover up a mistake so

publicly witnessed what could they be doing behind closed doors.

I don't know every detail of what went on at Hillsborough that afternoon

and nobody probably ever will,but I do know 96 people died that da;y who
didn't need to and their families have to cope with that fact for the

rest of their lives.

Surely it isn't too much to ask for a new inquiry into the deaths of

those fans so their families at least know why they died and can really

start to carry on living their lives again.

It may be hard to understand at first why the words "We're sorry" are

so desperately needed to toe heard by these people,but when you think

that the loved ones they lost were practically blamed for their own deaths

it becomes a lot clearer.



Please seriously consider a new inquiry into the 96 deaths,because the

truth cannot possibly cause the reputation of the South. Yorkshire Police

Force any more ftarm than seven years of uncertainty already has done.




                       Your sincerely,

Dear Mr Howard



I felt I had to write in response to the Hillsborough feature shown on ITV on Thursday 6th of December. I
realize emotions must be running veiy high after the screening of this show, but when all is said and done
96 women, men and children went to that football match and did not return home. I cannot see how the
ffcaths of these people can be called an accident. Accidents happen in a normal environment, that is why
they are so unexpected. The over crowding in those pens was by no means a normal occurrence, so I do
not see how the deaths of these people can be called an accident, when they were forced into a very
unnatural setting.



I am requesting that you please put your backing to a new inquiry into this tragedy. We all owe it to the
families of the victims to find the truth about that day. I can remember clearly the day it happened. I
remember being shocked and upset, but unfortunately I did not follow the aftermath. I would now like to
make up for that by supporting the families search for the truth and urging others to do so too.



I thank you in advance for your time.



Yours sincerely

The Rt Hon Michael Howard

Dear Mr Howard

Having watched the Hillsborough docume?fcfc3'f‘y-drama on ITV last
Thursday/ I believe that there has been a cover-up and many
inaccuracies reported at both the original inquiry and at the
inquests.  I strongly urge that you agree to reopen the inquiry
so that the truth regarding the deaths of ninety-six people
can be correctly ascertained.

I hasten to add that I have no direct connection with either
Liverpool or any of the bereaved. Nevertheless, I hope that
you will agree to my request.
                                                                                                                                  '\ Q l

Rt. Hoa Michael Howard MP,
H»e Home Office,
50, Queen Anne's Gate,

London, SW1.

Dear Mr. Howard,

Having just watched the recent harrowii w           documentary, Hillsborough, I am moved to
write to you to urge you to reopen the inquest into the 95 deaths that occurred in April 1989 at
the Hillsborough football stadium.

I am struck again, as I was at the time, by the shabby and thoughtless treatment that the relatives
o f Hillsborough victims were subjected to after the horrific and grotesque death o f their loved
ones. It seems clear now, as it seemed at the time (and as concluded in the Taylor report), that
the South Yorkshire police force are, in large part, responsible for the carnage that occurred
there. The exit doors should never have been opened. Video camera surveillance o f the
ground should have been used by the police in order to spread the fans around the ground and
avoid the fatal crush. Ambulances should have been allowed onto the pitch immediately. The
senior police officers responsible should have been held properly accountable for their failure
to avert this tragedy. Hie scope o f the inquest should have been widened and families o f
victims should have been properly compensated for their incalculable loss. Hie evil lies
peddled by the Sun newspaper should not have been supported by the evidence, in court, o f
police officers who were present at the ground and who, it would appear, manufactured these
stories to divert attention from their failures.

Unfortunately it seems that, as with so many miscarriages o f justice that come to light long after
the original verdict, political forces carry more weight than human ones, ft is your
responsibility, as one o f the highest placed representatives o f the British people, to reopen this
case and allow a full and fair enquiry that takes into account ALL the evidence, not just the
evidence that the police choose to submit. I sincerely hope you w ill recognise this
responsibility, even if it means political embarrassment. I look forward to hearing from you.

The Home Secretary

Rht Hon Micheal Howard MP
                                                                          *'r'
RE. The Hillsborough Inquiry.

Dear Mr Howard,

As a person w ho watched with dismay the events of the Hillsborough tragedy on the
television on the day it happened I am contacting you to give support to the request of
the relatives to reopen the inquiry into the Hillsborough tragedy.

I admit to watching the recent television drama, however, I realise that producers of
these programmes sometimes w ish to sensationalise in order to boost ratings.
However, for me the programme did highlight a number of areas of concern that really
do need further examination and for which as a member of the public would require an
answer. These are as follow s.
(1) W hy were the emergency services called late and subsequently prevented from
attending the injured on the pitch.
(2) W hy were the dead and injured in the gymnasium not seen straight away when the
emergency services did arrive.
(3) W hy were there not proper crowed control at least several miles from the football
ground.
(4) W hy w as the gate to the tunnel not closed and fans not directed to the empty areas.
(5) W hy were there no stewards on duty to direct fans.
(6) W hy did another police force carry out an investigation. H ow can justice been seen
to be done when another force investigates the actions of other police, officers, other
professionals have independent bodies to investigate claims of malpractice w hy should
the police be a special case.
(7) W hy were people not called to give evidence at the inquest w ho should have been
called such as the person who instaled the television monitors.
(8) W hy did the DPP consider their w as no blame to be levied when the report by
Lord Justice Taylor did outline that the police were to blame.
(9) If the Television drama portrays events as they occurred w hy were the relatives
treated in such an insensitive way, for example, questioned by police officers when
they were in shock and trauma.
(10) W hy were the relatives not able to challenge the testimony of the medical experts
at the inquest.
 The w hole issue of the investigation into the tragedy raises too many unanswered
questions. It seems to me if they had been thoroughly answered the first time around
would not have led to the relatives asking the makers of television drama to highlight
the whole incident.

Therefore, because of these unanswered questions, I feel that the people of this nation
need to know that justice is being carried out on behalf of those victims w ho died. If
the families of the victims are still feeling that justice has been denied to them or that a
cover up has taken place then this nation and its government should respond to their
request.

I hope Home Secretary that as a member of a government w ho states it is hard on crime
and cover up's you w ill respond to the relatives request.


Yours sincerely,

                Following         the m a t c h    briefing          in the N o r t h S tand at H i l l sborough,                     .1

               along with other memb e r s                  of Serial           17 a t t e n d e d      the   e n closure      behind

                * C ’ Gate at         the L e p p i n g s Lane          turnstiles..              We a r r i v e d    there at around

                1 1 . 15am to take         up our        position outside                the      *A'    t urnstiles      in order

                to search L i v e r p o o l        fans     entering          the ground and to keep Public

               Order.       At     the    time     of arrival           the     turn s t i l e s were         closed and there

                were    very few Liv e r p o o l          fans wait i n g           outside        the ground.           At around

                11.30am we were            deployed         to the        outside        of Turns t i l e s          'A' and    took up

                our    positions,         one     officer        to each turnstile                 entry,      I myself        taking

                up position at            the     second t u rnstile              along         from    'A' Gate.        At around

                11.45am myself            and     two    other      officers          were       requested       to    leave    our

                positions         and assist        another         serial        with the off            loading       of buses

                outside     the     turnstiles           on L e p p i n g s     Lane.           This    serial       consisted of

                "F2'   area o f f icers           controlled          by Inspector               Sykes.       Only a few        coaches

               a r r i v e d at    this    point and          it a p p e a r e d      that most          of the       fans arriving

               were    either       wa 1 k i n g to t h e g r o u n d f r o m t h e d i r e c.t i o n of P e n i s t o n e

               Roa d or from C a t c h b a r            Lane.

               As     I patrolled         the area        outside         the     turnstiles            I noticed a number             of
                                                                                                              PAGE         2
                                                                                                              R 11

youths     stood a r o u n d        the    small     shop       close     by the       'A' Gate and also a

number walk i n g           past    the     ground,       the m a j o r i t y    of whom doned         some    form

of   '"Liverpool M e m o r a b i l i a " ,         who were        drinking       from   cans    of    lager     or

other a l c o h o l i c         beverage.        On a couple           of occasions        I spoke with

these     supp o r t e r s and wa r n e d them             regarding           their   entry to the       ground

wit h alcohol          or       being worse        for    drink.        I also     saw a number         of other

officers       do the same and               some    d i r e c t e d youths       to get    rid of      cans     they

were    carrying           or    drinking       from,     escorting        them to nearby          'waste      bins'

and throwing a way the                  cans.       By    12 noon the           gates at L e p p i n g s Lane were

opened,       but the m a j o r i t y        of the       fans     refused to enter           the ground,         being

content       to gather           on both sides           of L e p p i n g s    Lane and outside         the

turnstiles.

Over    the next 20 m i n u t e s            the    crowd outside              the turnstile       increased          in

number as        did the          number     of supp o r t e r s       on both sides        of L e p pings

Lane.      During          this    period the         'mounted         o f f i c e r s ’ p a trolled   the area

outside       the t u r n s t i l e s     requesting         the      s upporters      to move    towards        the

t u rnstiles         and    into    the ground.            A number        of buses a r r i v e d      outside

the ground and occ u p a n t s were                  diverted          towards     the t u r n s t i l e s and

s e a r c h e d on    leaving       the    buses.         I could still           see a number         of fans

drinking       from        cans and       empties        were    lined up on the wall             on the       far

side    o f L e ppi ng s Lane.

As the numbers              outside       the   turn s t i l e s      increased myself          and    the other

two officers           r e t u r n e d to assist         Serial        17 in there       duties.        I must

say that at this                stage     the m a j o r i t y    of   fans      I saw were      good humoured

and a small           number       had o b v i o u s l y been drinking             but a p p e a r e d fully     in

control       of their          faculties.          I returned          to the     turnstile      I had

originally           star t e d at and there              spoke wit h Sergeant Whitlam.                   I think

it was at        this       stage    that Police           C o n s t a b l e P u l f r e y from our    serial

left    the    turn s t i l e s     to take a prisoner                he had found         in p o sse ssion of

Cannabis       to the Po l i c e          room.      I was w o r k i n g with Police Con s t a b l e
                                                                                                               PAGE

E l s a m on the t u r n s t i l e s        and we       carried out          searches       on fans who

e n t e r e d the    gr o u n d at     this       point.        Their     searches      were       selec tive and

not everyone           was s e a r c h e d as this w o u l d            have been       impractical           to

carry out.           The m a j o r i t y     of fans who          ente r e d were either             children or

the   older     fans      who w a n t e d to get           their     seats      early.        O r d e r l y queues
                                        K
had formed          outside     each turnstile              but     these were         only of a short

length,     and      it a p p e a r e d     that    the m a j o r i t y    of fans were wait i n g

outside     the      gro u n d to enter at a later                   stage.

As 2 pm a p p r o a c h e d     the queues           l e n g t h e n e d and the       crowds       increased

outside      the turnstiles.                 At one       stage a couple             of the    fans    j umped the

turn s t i l e s and      entered without                tickets     and some youths               tried to enter

the ground          via the wall            next    to Gate       "A*.

On s e arching         one y o u t h      I found a tin of              lager       hidden    in a pocket,              he

was   reminded of           law and         the    lager was        d i s posed of.          Some    of the other

youths who          queued were           o b v i o u s l y under    the effects          of alcohol,

slur r e d s peach etc,           but       by S.20prri the         queues      had d i s a p p e a r e d    being

replaced      by a large mass                of    people,       making       searching and the              dealing

of the     unruly       impossible.               Over    the    next     10 minutes         the    crowd

increased and           people w a i t i n g at the              t u r nstile       opening were       being

crushed and          pushed,      people were             trying     to    push their way to                the front

and gain entry.              I shou t e d         back    towards       the    crowd    in an atte m p t           to

get   them to move           back      or    people were          getting       crushed,       taut all       I could

see were      people       smiling          back at me and the                crowd    pushing       towards me.

It, was    now getting          very        difficult       to move at all and                people were

obviously       in a d i s t r e s s e d      state.        C h i l d r e n and some         of the w omen and

O A P *s were       strug g l i n g    to get t h r o u g h the           turnstile and were                o b viously

scared and          frightened         by the       c i r c u m s t a n c e s w hich were      arising.

At this      point      it was        deci d e d that Po l i c e Con s t a b l e Elsarn w o u l d fight

his way thro u g h his            t u rnstile and see               if officers         inside       the ground

could help.            This was at ar o u n d 2 . 4 0 p m and                 the    crowd was       now beyond

control.         I. was     pressed up a g a i n s t           the wall       of the      t u r n s t i l e s and

was    unable       to move,        having     to fend off            the    crowd who were           pressing

up against me.              I could see and hear                    the    crowd who were         g a t hered

bey o n d the       sc r e e n outside       'B G a t e ?           They* were      chanting and shouting

a n d some      had m a n a g e d    to    climb on to the                screen and were         s c ra mbling

over    the     turnstiles          into    the ground.              O f f icers   s i t uated there were

trying    to send          some     back    but    it a p p e a r e d the       impossible        task.          I was

unable    to     contact S e r g e a n t W h i t l a m as            I had no radio and had                 lost

sight    of him.           Memb e r s     of the    crowd were             shouting at me         telling me

to get s o mething            done about          it,     " d i s g u s t i n g " and   "someones       going       to

get    killed out          here" were words               used.       I decided that            I was      not

helping       the    situation          by being        pushed to the turnstile wall,                       I was

also    f r i g h t e n e d for my own safety,                 so    I forced by the            people moving

into    the t u r nstile          and went        t h r o u g h the turnstile             into the ground.

I went     to     Inspector         W o o d w a r d and    e x p l a i n e d the    c i r c umstances       to

him.     There        a p p e a r e d to be a lot of             noise      over    his    radio at        this

time and so           I moved       back     to give me         a chance        to get my breath             back.

Pe o p l e were moving            thro u g h the t u r n s t i l e s        and were       shout i n g at us as

they went        past,      "get out        there and get             something         done,    s o m e o n e ’s

going    to get       killed",          " y o u ’re no good          in here       get out      there".

Ev e ryone was        c o m p l aining as they             passed us.           S u p p o r t e r s were

jumping       the metal        railing and          getting          into    the enclosure          by Gate

*C*    giving       them access           to the L e p p i n g s Lane Central               Terrace.         There

was    nothing        we    could do as there were                   s upporters        grabbing      hold of

us avid complaining.                  The    gateman on         Gate       *A* was having         to hold

the    bolts      in the      top of the doors as                   the    supporters       outside were

trying    to break          their wa y       in.

At a r o u n d 2 . 5 3 p m we       formed a cordon             from Gate          VA ’ to direct          fans

around    the       back    of the N orth Stand.                    The    gate was       opened and the

fans    poured       in,    shouting        a n g r i l y at    us.        "You should have           opened

   * ‘       the gates         e a r lier"      was     quoted at me           several      times and m a n y       of the

             su pporters were               obviously disgusted                by the a r r a n g s m e n t s    outside.

             The    gates were         only opened for a short                        time and then were           closed by

             Inspector Sykes,                he then d i r e c t e d        us outside.          I w o u l d estimate

             'that there was           only Z Q Q fans               outside as we got there.                   Police

             Se r g e a n t W h i t l a m    im m e d i a t e l y    r e c eived a message        to the        effect   that

             the    crowd were          invading          the       pitch so we        ran through the           turnstiles

             and made our w a y a r o u n d               the       back   of the      stand    into    the N o r t h West

             Enclosure        and on to the               pitch.

             I w ould      like     to m e n t i o n that            during    the     three    hours    leading     up to

             the start         of the game            I noticed a large                number    of fans and spoke to

             a number who           had      no tickets,             they a d d e d    to the mess       outside     the

             t u r n s t i l e s and. o b v i o u s l y a number            got   into the ground w h e n           the gate

             were     opened.

                  occasional                drink     together.

                  On Saturday                the     15th A p r i l     1989     < 15 0 4 8 9 ) ,    I worked            from 3 , 3 0 am

                  (0330)       unt i l         11,30 am       ( 11 30).        I ha d a r r a n g e d        to m e e t        Garry         Taylor             at

                  th e     Concord           Municipal        golf      ce n tr e .     I think         we    had ag r e e d               to m e e t         for

                  about      1 pm.             I got       there   at    about        12.30     pm    <1230)           to    12 .4 5        pm    ( 1 245).

                  Garry      was        not        there    when   I arived           but    turned       up a         few m i n u t e s          later.

                  I recall            him      saying       thatynj> w as       a     bit    early     and. that             he    had        called

           . then      I would              have      joined         him.       We    played a          round        of    golf    finishing              at

             about       4.30          pm    (1630).            I wa s       aware     of    the       f a ct    that      the F A C u p        semi

             final       was       being         p l a y e d at        Hillsborough              and    knew      th a t    there      wa s    a

             strong          likelihood               of   traffic           delays       and     congestion.                I drove        the      ba c k

             route       back          to m y      house        to     avoid     delay       and Garry            TAYLOR        followed            me    in

             his      car.         It was          only      when       I listened           to    the      car      r a di o   that       I became

             aware       of       the       disaster         at      the H i l l s b o r o u g h       Football           Ground.

             It w a s        a    couple         of    d a ys     l a ter     that     Garry       mentioned              to me a b o u t      what        h

             had     heard         being         discussed             in the S i c e y          pub.       He    said      that      he    had

             overheard             a    conversation                 between         some    Liverpool            f a ns    saying         t ha t    they

             d i d n ’t h a v e         any      tickets,            that     they were           meeting         up w i t h      other       fans        an

             they      knew        how       to get        into        the    ground        without         a t ic k e t .

             At    the       time       Garry         t o l d me       this     it was       at    the      t i me    that      the    p r e ss      were

             blaming             the    police         for      what      had    gone       on.

             Over      the        next      couple         of w e e k s       I could        tell       th a t    this      was    playing           on

             G a r y ’s m i n d .           He     wanted         to    tell     his      story        to   the      judicial         inquiry            but

             I could             understand            his      reluctance           to     do    so    bearing           in m i n d ___________

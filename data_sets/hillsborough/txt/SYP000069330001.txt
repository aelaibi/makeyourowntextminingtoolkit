As    I looked       into the same            crowd     I could see            people wedged betw ee n

others who          looked a p p a r e n t l y       dead.

After a few minutes                of work in g        to          people      out     I recall       the    first,

looked dead.            First A id O ff ic er s             then took     over.         I returned to Gate

w i t h bodies.         All    apparently            dead.     People     were walk in g ar ou nd

crying,        screaming,        panicking,           hysterical.

I remember          noticing       that      this y outh had been sick.                   I laid him down

an d a s s is t ed another           officer with m o ut h to m o u t h and heart massage.

We m an ag e     to pump more           vomit        out of his       stomach.           We were a s s i s t e d a

o ther    supporters          came     to our aTd and            it was       d e ci d ed that     this y ou th

could     possibly         be s a v e d .     We     then    placed him on one            of the       bill b o a r d s ,

ripped a way from the                side     of the ground           by the s upporters              and others,

to be used as a stretcher.                         The y ou th was       laid on the board a nd we

The y o u t h was t h e j ^           left     in the care            of the        doctors and a mb u la n ce

staff.        I can d e s j ^ j r f f o e    this y o u t h as about             18-20 years,           ^wr'Ce male

5 * 6 , slim,      f<        ha i r , light t r ouse r s , V's h i r t .                   I then      r eturne^rto          the

West Stay^T and a g a in a s s i s t e d                  co^agues           to evacuate           sup*jrtTrters.

By the time          I r et urned            I could say about               a quarter         of the        pitch was

^occupied by dead bodies                      or    persons        s er i ou s ly injured.

I have      no    ideas of any times                     during      £>rfs event          but when      I returned           I

n ot ic ed Police O ff ic e rs                at tl           sack of the        supp or te rs        that    remained

inside     the standi ng a r p «               af the West S t a n d .               Gaps     began to ap pe ar and

some    supporters ^rre able                       to    1eave as they entered,                  back    t h ro ug h the

tunnel     from L ep pi n gs Ln.

I recall         shouting        to the        supporters,            go back,        look behind you,            you        can

get    out.       But a lot took               no notice at all.                    They simply         panicked and

kept    pushing         forward.             One    supporter         was w ed g ed        between the         floor

inside     the s ta nding are a and the track.                              His      legs were         trap pe d under

the    volume      of bodies           and his torso was                 half       out    of t p e    gateway.

E v e n t u a l l y we got       him out                All   efforts were           hamjj'ered due          to the     fact

that    the gates were               ty o     small
                                                all       m     both sil ze A fid numbe r               1 saw some

of of     this     fence       in order            to get a female            fan out.           The    fence wire

e v e n t u a l l y became       d e t ac h e d from           its m o u n ti n g    frame and numerous                fans

c lamrne r ed to get out.

I never       saw the        little          lad m en t io n ed at         the      early     part of this s u mm ar y

again.     I don *t kno w whethe r he got out or                              nojK^        I was a p p r o a c h e d    by

I recall         seeing a cordon gf "police o ff icers                              later spread acr os s              the

             W he n the area at          the West S tand had e v e nt u al l y been              cleared      I noticed

             all     kinds     of   personal         property      lying a ro un d on the floor,          shoes,

             coats,       scarves,      jumpers         etc.     I remember      being a p pr o a c h e d by two

             supp or te r s while        sat     on a wall        near    the West Stand.         They    p ersonally

             bore    no blame         on the     police.

             I recall         other    incidents         involving       hysterical     supporters       scr ea mi ng at

             the other         offic er s on the          pitch.        I did not witness        any a ss au l ts        on

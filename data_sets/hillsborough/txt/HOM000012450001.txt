         TAYLOR REPORT:       HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT



    The Home Secretary was very grateful for the comments of
the Prime Minister as set out in your letter this morning and
those of the Chief Secretary, recorded in Carys Evans' letter.

   I attach a redraft which the Home Secretary has now
prepared in consultation with the Minister for Sport and
which, as you will see, picks up nearly all of your comments.
The peroration is somewhat longer than before since the Home
Secretary took the view, on reconsideration, that the original
draft ended too abruptly.

    Copies of this go to those who received copies of my
letter of 25 January.




                                                                      C J WALTERS

                      HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT ON
                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S FINAL REPORT
                         OF HIS INQUIRY INTO THE
                      HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                              29 JANUARY 1990


With    permission,       Mr Speaker,     I      should     like    to   make a
statement about the f i n a l r e p o r t of Lord J u s t i c e T a y lo r's
Inquiry in t o the tragedy a t the Hillsborough stadium on
15 April 1989, which i s published today.                  Some months have
passed since t h a t t e r r i b l e event but not long enough I know
to dull the pain suffe red by the bereaved, and I wish to
place on record my sympathy f o r them and f o r those who
sustain ed in j u ry .




I am most g ra te fu l to Lord J u s t i c e Taylor f o r the Report,
which   sets    out      clearly   why we have had so many major
tr a g e d i e s a t fo otball grounds over the years and why we have
had d i s o r d e r and hooliganism.          As the House f a m i l i a r i s e s
i t s e l f with the Report,       i t will     become c l e a r t h a t i t    is
addressed as much to the fo o tb all industry as i t i s to the
Government.      Lord J u s t i c e Taylor explains how in his interim
r e p o r t he concentrated on overcrowding because t h a t was the
cause of the Hillsborough d i s a s t e r , but now he goes on to
t a l k of a game, the image of which has been much
t a r n i s h e d , and of a b l i g h t over the game due to old grounds,
poor f a c i l i t i e s ,   hooliganism, excessive drinking and poor
lead e rsh ip .


Lord J u s t i c e     Taylor does     not   spare    those    who run     the
in dustry .       He says indeed t h a t the provision they make f o r
t h e i r customers is often not merely basic but s q u a l i d ,          and
he says t h a t sq ualid conditions can have an impact on s a f e t y
and t h a t in his view they also lead to lower standards of
behaviour.


Lord     Justice         Taylor    Taylor    says    that     the    Football
Association and Football League have not seen i t as any p a r t
of t h e i r duty to o f f e r guidance to clubs on s a f e t y m a t t e r s ,
and he questions whether the d i r e c t o r s of many clubs are
genuinely i n t e r e s t e d in the welfare of t h e i r own supporters
or t h e i r good behaviour.         Players too are c r i t i c i s e d , with
Lord J u s t i c e Taylor pointing out t h a t incitement from the
pi tch or bad behaviour by p la y e r s , which is not confined to
soccer, has a major influence on the crowd.                   I acknowledge
t h a t some clubs have made an e f f o r t to an e f f o r t to improve
stan dards, but Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r's c l e a r conclusion was
t h a t the m ajority had not and t h a t the game only has a
f u t u r e i f the d i r e c t o r s and the players can change t h e i r own
p r i o r i t i e s and give a leadership which i s p l a i n l y lacking a t
p re se nt.


He agrees with the Government t h a t t h e r e must be a move
towards a l l - s e a t e r s t a d i a and points out t h a t sec tio n 11 of
the     Football        Spectators         Act     specifically          provides        the
machinery f o r t h i s .       The change will improve s a f e t y and will
improve behaviour, and we intend to bring i t about.                                   Lord
J u s t i c e Taylor makes c l e a r t h a t the bulk of the finances f o r
ground improvements will                  have to be r a is e d by the clubs
themselves.         He says th e r e are ways of r a i s i n g the money i f
the clubs ' management i s e n t e r p r i s i n g and resourceful and he
po ints to the o p p o r t u n i t i e s presented by sponsorship.                        He
also     points      to the       revenue t h a t        flows      to   the     fo o tb all
a u t h o r i t i e s f o r t e l e v i s i o n r i g h t s and says t h a t the fo o tb a ll
authorities         should      ensure      that     this     valuable         source of
revenue i s d i r e c t e d towards improving s t a d i a .               He canvasses
the p o s s i b i l i t y of a levy on t r a n s f e r fees which he says
have reached a level which many regard as grotesque.


There are a whole s e r i e s of d e t a i l e d recommendations s e t out
in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 on matters r e l a t i n g to
s p e c t a t o r s a f e t y such as gates and gangways.        Indeed, of the
76 recommendations, 43 in substance appeared in the Interim
Report.       The Government accepts these proposals,                     some of
which     can    be    implemented       immediately.        Some will        need
f u r t h e r work.     For convenience I have placed in the Vote
Office a schedule s e t t i n g out the Government's response to
each.


Hon Members will           recall     t h a t sec tio n 13 of the Football
Spectators Act provides f o r the Football Licensing Authority
to      supervise       the     safety     responsibilities          of      local
a u t h o r i t i e s in r e sp e c t of designated fo o tb all grounds.         We
intend to implement t h a t provision.            Lord J u s t i c e Taylor
welcomes        the   establishment        of   the     Football      Licensing
Authority but would l i k e us to go f u r t h e r and extend i t s
remit to cover o th er than fo otball                 grounds.      This would
re q u ir e primary l e g i s l a t i o n and we will       have to consider
whether i t i s j u s t i f i e d .


P art I I I the Report contains a number o f proposals r e l a t i n g
to   crowd control          and hooliganism.           It   acknowledges        the
c r u c ia l r o l e of the p olice in crowd c o n t r o l .      Lord J u s t i c e
Taylor r i g h t l y reminds us t h a t , without the work of the
p o l i c e , many sp orting events would be chaotic and could not
be permitted to take place.                                Something l i k e 5000 police
o f f i c e r s are engaged on football d u tie s each Saturday during
the season,            la r g e l y a t     the expense of the taxpayer and
ra te p a y e r .     He pays t r i b u t e t o them f o r t h e i r s e r v i c e .   I
want to add my thanks to the p olice f o r the way they carry
out the d i f f i c u l t , thankless and often unthanked tasks which
are t h r u s t upon them.


The Report recognises the advances made in the l a s t couple
of yea rs in the e f f e c t i v e n e s s of the po licin g of f o o t b a l l ,
particularly             in s id e grounds,                and to the major impact of
closed c i r c u i t t e l e v i s i o n on the hooligan problem.               I t also
mentions o th e r measures taken by the Government such as the
r e s t r i c t i o n on the s a l e of alcohol and the power given to
the courts to make orders excluding convicted hooligans from
grounds.


Lord J u s t i c e        Taylor also recognises the g r e a t p o t e n t i a l
value of the             police National Football I n t e l l i g e n c e Unit in
dealing        with       f o o t b a l 1- r e l a t e d    crime and   with hooligans
t r a v e l l i n g to matches abroad.
As I have s a i d .              Lord J u s t i c e Taylor takes the view t h a t
b e t t e r f a c i l i t i e s and b e t t e r trea tment of fans will bring
b e t t e r behaviour.             Beyond t h a t , the Report recommends the
cr e a ti o n of t h r e e new s p e c i f i c th r e e new s p e c i f i c offences
to apply a t designated s ports grounds:                    throwing a m i s s i l e ;
chanting obscene or r a c i a l i s t abuse;                and going onto the
p itch without reasonable excuse:                      and i t      also asks      for
c onsideratio n to be given to extending the c o u r t s ' powers to
impose         attendance          centre    orders   and     for    the    use     of
e l e c t r o n i c tagging in the case of offenders convicted of
f o o t b a l 1- r e l a t e d   offences.      The   specific       new offences
suggested do to some extent seem to d u p li c a t e offences which
are already a v a i l a b l e in the Public Order Act.                 But I s h all
look c a r e f u l l y and quickly a t a l l these suggestions.


I now come to the proposed Football Membership Scheme.                            Lord
Justice         Taylor examined the            Invitation     to Tender f o r a
scheme which was issued by the co n su ltan ts employed by the
f o o tb all     authorities.           He came to the conclusion t h a t he
could not support a scheme of t h a t kind because he did not
believ e the technology would work well enough to avoid the
danger of congestion and d i s o rd e r .              He was also concerned
about the c a ll on p o lic e resources.              Instead he proposes the
measures to which I have r e f e r r e d .
In the l i g h t of t h i s advice, the Government have decided not
to proceed with the establishment of a Football Membership
Authority, but P art I of the Act will remain on the S t a t u t e
Book.        Work will              continue         to    see   how the         shortcomings
i d e n t i f i e d by Lord J u s t i c e Taylor could be overcome in case
we have to r e tu r n to the matter again, should the problem of
hooliganism not be defeated by the a l t e r n a t i v e s t r a t e g y
a l t e r n a t i v e s t r a t e g y proposed in the r e p o r t .


Let no-one imagine t h a t t h i s means t h e r e will be any l e t up
in     the      fight          ag a in s t    hooliganism.            Those      who,   unlike
Government,              have         for       so        long   shrugged         off    their
r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s will         now have to face up to them.                  The
Government intends to proceed as quickly as p o s sib le to the
establishment of a Football Licensing Authority and, s u b je c t
to c o n s u l t a t i o n .      Section 11 of the Football Spectators Act
will be used to d i r e c t the to d i r e c t the Licensing Authority
to r e q u ir e a ll s e a t e r s t a d i a - with standing being reduced
by stages           and e n t i r e l y        eliminated        in    First      and   Second
Division         grounds           by August          1994 and        in   all    designated
Football League grounds by 1999.                             The necessary s tep s will
be taken to ensure improved arrangements fo r crowd control
and b e t t e r t r a i n i n g f o r police and stewards.                    There will be
                                           8.


urgent co n sid e r a tio n of the case f o r new offences and f o r
new powers to deal with those excluded from grounds by the
Courts.             The Clubs will be compelled will be compelled to
get r i d of the t e r r a c e s .      But Lord J u s t i c e Taylor i n d i c a t e s
how much more they can do to c r e a t e a b e t t e r atmosphere by
improving the now often squalid conditions to which they
s u b je c t    their      supporters    - sq ualid conditions which can
encourage squalid behaviour.                    Those clubs which have not
faced          up     to   their   responsibility          now    have     a    fi n a l
opportunity to do so: and i f they d o n 't now a c t , the public
wi l l not fo rgive them.

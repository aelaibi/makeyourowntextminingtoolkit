 HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER



 Thank you for your letter of 9 December about untransmitted tapes of the
 Hillsborough disaster.

I understand your reasons for not making this material publicly available. The
question may arise, however, of whether relatives of those who died may see this
material. I understand that the BBC has previously agreed to the tapes being made
available to the representatives of Mr and Mrs Church, subject to certain conditions.
There is a precedent, therefore, for the material being made available for the private
viewing of relatives.

The Home Secretary has now received Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report, which
does refer briefly to the BBC material. The question of the availability of this material
may not arise. But, if it does, the Home Secretary will wish to explain the position.
He could explain that the material has been made available to all official inquiries
and for the purposes of relative legal proceedings; that it cannot be made publicly
available because of the very distressing and horrific nature of what it contains; but
that the BBC would be prepared to allow the legal representatives of victims’
families to view the material.

I would be grateful if you could let me know urgently if you consider that this
misrepresents the BBC’s position.

         I am writing in reply to your recent letter to Roger Law in the BBC ’s Legal
         Department. You asked about the BBC ’s likely attitude to putting the untransmitted
         tapes o f the Hillsborough disaster into the public domain.

         Our attitude throughout the last eight years has been that, while w e are, o f course,
         very ready to make the untransmitted material available to any official Inquiries and
         for legal proceedings, the nature o f the material is such that w e do not wish to make it
         publicly available.

         The tapes deal with the moment o f death o f very many people and with the horrific
         nature o f that death. For this reason, the BBC has chosen not to transmit the material
         and for the same reason we would not agree to making it publicly available.

     HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM DISASTERS989


     You wrote on August 21 to Mr Bone, Secretary to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
     scrutiny of evidence relating to the Hillsborough disaster, with copies of the
     BBC s videotapes of events on the day.       I am writing to enquire about the
     BBC’s position, should the Home Secretary wish in due course to put the
     tapes into the public domain as part of the evidence considered by the Judge
     in his scrutiny.

    When the Home Secretary announced Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny to
    the House of Commons on 30 June, he said that he would publish the
    Judge s report to him. He also said that he would do his best to publish all
    the evidence which the Judge had considered, but that ‘there m ay be good
    reasons - for example, in respect of criminal or (police) disciplinary
    proceedings - why such evidence cannot be published at the same time’.

     I understand that there are significant extracts from them on the ‘compilation
    tape’ combining videos from the police and club sources which the West
    Midlands police put together for Lord Taylor’s Inquiry in 1989 to illustrate the
    sequence of events.       As the BBC tapes were available at the time of the
    previous inquiries, it does not seem likely they could amount to fresh
    evidence. It may be, however, that the Judge will to some extent refer to
    them in his report to the Home Secretary, and that the Home Secretary will as
    a result wish to publish them (which would be by way of placing copies in the
    Libraries of the Commons and Lords).

{   The Judge has said that he intends to let the Home Secretary have his report
    by the end of the year and I should be grateful for an early indication of


    f:\oppu\hou\misc\pp0433pddoc
9   whether the BBC would be content for the material on the tapes to be
    published in this way if the Home Secretary considered that that was
    appropriate when he published the Judge’s report. If there are any objections
    to that it would be helpful if you could let me know what they are so that we
    can advise the Home Secretary accordingly.

^ p e a r Chief Constable,

  In response to the tragic events of April 15th at the Hillsborough Stadium, Liverpool
  City Council set up a 'Hillsborough Working Party', involving close co-operation with
  the Football Supporters' Association, to ensure the submission of proper evidence to
  Lord Chief Justice Taylor's Inquiry on behalf of the people of Liverpool.

  To enable the City Council to respond to any issues arising from the tragedy the
  Working Party has approached all official bodies involved in the planning and
  organisation for the Hillsborough F.A. Cup semi-final tie- with the exception of the
  South Yorkshire Police - requesting information on matters of responsibility.

  As it is not the intention of this Working Party to frustrate the Inquiry or to do
  anything that might unwittingly constitute contempt we have accordingly delayed our
  approaches to yourself until South Yorkshire Officers, called to give evidence, have
  completed their submissions.

   Recognising that your officers' evidence does not conclude your force' involvement
    in the Inquiry and the ongoing nature of the Inquiry could you please furnish to me,
^ r h e r e appropriate, your assistance to the following points:-

      Information relating to total police numbers for each of the semi-final fixtures
      held since 1980 at Hillsborough up to and including April 15th, 1989;

  -   A breakdown of their deployment, location and duties comparatively for both the
      April 1988 and April 1989 semi-final fixtures;

  -   Information covering the response of South Yorkshire Police to the overcrowding,
      crushing and injuries sustained by Tottenham Hotspur supporters at Hillsborough
      at the semi-final tie in April 1981 and report thereof;

  -   Information regarding the number of police deployed to all Sheffield Wednesday
      league and cup fixtures (including dates and opponents)for seasons 1987-88,
      1988-89 inclusive

- -   Information on numbers arrested within the ground and its immediate vicinity for
      first-class fixtures at Hillsborough for seasons 1987-88, 1988-89 to include the
      April 15th fixture and a breakdown of charges;
-    Information relating to the decision to allocate the North and West Stand
    areas to Liverpool fans and to close the North Stand turnstiles to the
    Penistone Road on April 15th;

-   Information in the regularity of contact between the South Yorkshire Police
    and the Sheffield Wednesday club and Sheffield City Council on matters of
    crowd safety, crowd management and evacuation procedures. When was the
    last evacuation exercise practiced?

Yours faithfully,




Cllr. H. Chase,
Chair - Hillsborough Working Party.

Facts from Hammond and Suddard, 6 June, timed 3 - 5 5



Discussed contents of letter (ref. L89/2117) with Peter Metcalfe,
particularly in respect of their requests for statements from
licensees which might indicate evidence of organisation amongst non­
ticket holding Liverpool fans to gain entrance to the ground.   Pointed
out to Mr. Metcalfe that this evidence was not simply confined to
licensees, that it was my belief that the West Midlands enquiry team
had evidence from other sources which may help aduce this point, and
suggested that we might make a _further request to Treasury Solicitors
requesting that other information.   Mr. Metcalfe advised that he
preferred to leave things as they were until such times as our
request had been responded by by Treasury Solicitors, at which time
we would discuss further.

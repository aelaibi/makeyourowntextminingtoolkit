     Our ref: VH/SEW                                       6th June,          1990
     Your ref: MJF/VSC

     Dear Sir,

     Hillsborough - Superintendent R . Marsha 1.1

     I am writing this separate, explanatory letter, to clarify
     Superintendent Marshall's intentions*   I have no objection to the
     complainants * solicitors having copies of both letters - if my
     proposals are not rejected out of hand-

     It is somewhat unusual for an officer who is the subject of
     disciplinary proceedings to suggest that the proceedings are
     unnecessary and a waste of time and money, and should therefore be
     withdrawn, but I hope you will accept that these are unusual
     circumstances.

     Despite the final report, which places the blame on almost
     everyone concerned, except the dead fans, Superintendent Marshall
     and a few colleagues are the only ones faced with possible
     manslaughter charges or severe disciplinary punishment.

     He has no option but to use every piece of evidence he can
     muster to show that he did his best in very difficult
     circumstances.  There is also his own self-respect.   Even one
     death is too much for him to accept responsibility for without the
     most determined fight.  There can be no question of him
     accepting the blame for 95 deaths by default.

      It will be clear from my main letter that I am not seeking to say
      that the complainants' children were responsible in any way nor
      that all the fans outside the ground were wicked or malicious, but
      it flies in the face of known facts and experience to ignore the
      'crowd' syndrome which makes two or more people acting together a
      very different proposition from the sum of the individuals.   Here
      we had some 5,000 latecomers, many of whom had filled in the hours
      before the match by drinking alcohol and were 'merry' at
      Anyone who thinks that they could have been controlled m the
      simple terms of the Enquiry (see Para 19 of my main letter) is not
      facing reality.   All the evidence before and since Hillsborough,
      shows that time after time, despite the most intense preparation
      and planning, crowds become uncontrollable and injuries and damage
      ensue.  We can show that this crowd was not the exception to
      the rule as some wish us to believe.

      We can't do it on the same evidence that was shown to the
      Enquiry, however, and will have to bring in all those who were
      upset because their evidence was not used and who will be only too
      willing to come forward and have their say.

       Nothing that I shall put forward will suggest that Liverpool fans
       are any worse or any better than any other fans - the crowd
       syndrome knows no city, county or country boundaries.
                  w
T unnld aenuinelv prefer to let bygones be bygones.
I              Marshall obviously has some searing experience
that      h   put at the disposal of any Force making plan, for
              e    c   o   u   l   d


another       "ootball match, but he will not be asked whilst this
investigation continues.  Your own services, and those of your
men, could also, with respect, be better employed.

              Dear Sir,
              Hillsborough Disaster - S u p e r i n ^ d e r 0 ^ p g e t l _ M a j ^ h ^ l 1

              1.     Superintendent Marshall and 1 have now carefully <" ^ n e f a n d
                      the complaints made by Mr Trevor Hicks, Mr Leslie Jones and
                      Mrs Joan McBrien.
              ■?     As vou are aware, the issues have already been dealt with at
                      a Judicial inquiry which lasted 31 days, taking the oral
                      evidence of 1^4 witnesses.  So far - the p o U c e in gen. al
                      are concerned, a conclusion was reached that their         '
                      to control the crowd was the major cause of the disaster.

              3      The senior officers were castigated for being defensive and
                      evasive in their evidence to the Enquiry.

               A      Consequently, any enquiry into senior police officers
                       in£o!v“ment in thiB matter begin, with an assumption of
                       guilt, which they have to displace.

               5>     I "“^ n te n ^ n r S a r S ^ i^ n ’ n o fb fe o n te n f^ e ly to answer
                        fH?ther questions tending to highlight the
                        and mechanical failures of communication w ^ich m y
                        contributed in some degree to the overall disast r.

               fi     if the bias is to be shifted, it will be necessary to   bring
                       In positive evidence to show that all the alternative
                       theories put forward by various critics could n<* have
                        put into effect on that day and that
                        L „ 0w.ii    faced with an impossible situation,
                        substantially different from> 8   for
                        the almost insuperable                    |£c^ sary to show

                        a.;                                          -       r * H l i r r ; Boat o£

7            The report Indicate, that 3,776 statements were t a k e n . I t
             must be doubted whether the judge read all
             The considerable pressure on him to produce an interim
             report as quickly as possible, makes it likely that he only
                 what was put before him.  My information is that a
             considerable body of evidence which would have shown the
             difference between the 1988 crowd and the 1989*crow*a was
             BUDoressed.  That difference is vital to any hindsight
             view of what the police ought to have done to             the
             1989 crowd and as to how effective any use of force or
             coercion would have been.

8            It seems likely that if all available evidence had been
             placed before the judge, he would have takeJ a
             view, even if only in the emphasis he gave to the
             factors • H ^ i ^ t ^ j ^ e r ^ i f f e r e nh view in t h e f i n a ^

             and that a belief that the Liverpool fans had been cneatea
             in the ticket allocation coupled with an intention i t o
             aScep t the position but to travel to the ground and attempt
             to aain entrance in one way or another ib a form of
             hooliganism which could have the same consequences as a mor
              easily recognized display.



              when r t f e v l d l n « beini distorted before their very eyes
              - no doubt in the laudable aim of not causing further
              distress to the relatives of the dead.

    in        &a it- was not onlv was external evidence s uppressed but the
              officers themselves, Superintendent Marshall in particular,
              were prevented from answering questions as soon as it

              evasion? at l e a s t so far as S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall is
              concerned.

           Your ref: PGK.3341.89


           Dear Sir,

          Hillsborough - Superintendent R» Marshall

           Thank you for your letter of 8th June which does indeed serve to
           explain the position and clarify matters.

          No doubt the fault was mine. Although I was obviously aware
          that criminal proceedings were under consideration, I had
          mistakenly thought that we were initially dealing with the
          Police Complaints Authority and an internal disciplinary hearing
          - not with the Crown Prosecution Service and criminal
          proceedings.

          1 hope you will appreciate and accept that I had no intention of
          writing to you on the lines of the letters to which you are
          replying. They were directed to and couched in a form which I
          hope is appropriate to the lay-complainants in the disciplinary
          proceedings. I am sure you are already taking into account most
          of the factors I mentioned and that my observations to you in due
          course may therefore be much shorter.

          Could I please correct any suggestion that I asked for the names
          and addresses of the complainants' solicitors, A careful
          perusal of my letters will show that I did not so presume, I
          asked for my observations to be passed to them, which is of course
          the only proper course and one which I am gratified to see that
          you have adopted.

          I would like to persevere in my attempt to persuade the
          lay-complainants to look at this matter from a factual rather
          than an emotional point of view, I will then continue to deal
          direct with Chief Superintendent Foster as regards the criminal
          investigation which I believe would benefit from being considered
          separately from the complaints procedure.

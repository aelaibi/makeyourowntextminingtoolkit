 Dear Sir,                                                ;

 Safety of Sports Grounds - Certificate Conditions

 Thank you for your letter of 5th April, in reply to mine of 30th March; I also
 refer to Chief Superintendent Dentons’ subsequent telephone conversation with my
 Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes.

 I gather that you would find it helpful for a condition to be included in the
 Certificate which provided for the attendance of police officers at football
 matches.  I have no objection to such a condition being inserted and I would
 like to submit the following draft for your consideration:-

       "Before the stadium is used on any occasion for a specified activity, the
       Holder shall make arrangements with the Chief Constable of the South
       Yorkshire Police for the attendance of a sufficient number of police officers
       for the purpose of maintaining lawful and orderly behaviour amongst
       spectators. The extent of the provision of police services is reserved for
       the determination of the Chief Constable .

  I would appreciate your comments on the Certificate conditions a n d the remainder
  of the Certificate Conditions which were enclosed with my letter of 30th March.

  I wish to proceed with the issue of the Sheffield United Certificates within the
  fairly near future, and I would therefore like to hear your comments, if
   possible, by 15th May.

   Yours faithfully,




   Acting-Head of Department

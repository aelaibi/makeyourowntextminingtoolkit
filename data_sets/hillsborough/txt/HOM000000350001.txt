               On Saturday             15 April               1989,   I was emplo y e d as the Sergeant on Serial

on my Serial           reg u l a r l y work    the West Stand at Hillsborough and I have

good knowledge           of w or k i n g     that detail.



W ith the consent of             Inspector Bulias,          I deployed officers on my

Serial    as to their          individual           and specific duties.         On normal matches

it is the a c c e p t e d prac tice            to keep the whole length of the very iron

 the West     Stand had been sold,           therefore,     it was not possible             to keep

 the front         row of seats sterile.



Ai tnougn we hcid been           informed at brief i n g      that      the gates would be

 openea at 12 noon there was a steady flow of Liverpool                           spectators

 into Pen 3 of the Leppings              Lane terraces and a few family groups                      into

 the West     stand from 11.30 a.m.           onwards.



Those few fans at that time were                    in the m a i n well behaved and

 cheerful.         A l t ho ug h my s u p e r visory duties caused me to patrol               the

 co n c ou rse/bar     area -at the rear of the West Stand and the t w o                    entrance;

 gate areas giving access             to the West Stand          in the m ain I remained

most of this time at the front of the Central area of the West Stand

 w here I had a good view of those                  in the West Stand and' was           looking

 d i r ec tl y down onto      the fans      in the Leppings      Lane Terraces.           These

 terraces and West S tand continued                  to fill without any problems.



'Abotit 12.45 p .m . a number          of youths       entered    the   West;   Stand a n d - w h e n r^r:

 looking out of the back of the West Stand onto the pitch they took up

 a   p o s ition    leaning   over   the small wall       at the front right hand corner

 of this stand,          looking down onto the terraces below.                   One of the

 edge of the wall           thereby obscuring a particular advertisement

 boarding.          I s ho u t e d across       Police Constable 1 4 9 4 Naylor             to tell

• the youth to remove -it to prevent                 the advertisement board from being

 obscured.          This was done with o u t any p r o b l e m or        ill feeling towards

 the youths.          However,    a middle apd w om a n      (50 ish) who was sat              in the

 West Stand near to w here            I was stood at the time and who was

 o b viously alone        complained,       to me that     it was not fair to ask the

 y o u t h wit h the flag       to remove     it.     She went on to explain that a
                                                                                                   PAGE

similar      flag was being displayed                in the centre of       the Spion Kop by

 the N o t ti ng ha m Forest         fans,    but   they nad not oeen       instructed        to

remove     theirs.         Wnen    I explained      to her   that the Notti n g h a m Forest

one was not o b s c u r i n g a nything or any advertisements,                      but    that the

Liverpool          flag had been doing so she still               took exception to this and

comp l a i n e d    that our actions were pr o v o c a t i v e and unfair against

Liverpool          fans.     She   then went on to complain that              it was       ludicrous

 that the Liverpool             fans were      in the West     Stand and Leppings            Lane end

whe n they should have had the Spion Kop end of the ground.



 I received,/hundreds of simi iar compl a i n t s               throughout-.that day bot,h ••

before,      during and after              the tragic events      that   later ensued.             It

was q u i t e      obvious    to me that       there was a great deal of Liverpool

 ’hurt pride'         beca u s e of    this even before        the tragedy occurred.



The area that filled               the quickest was Pen 3 of the Leppings                    Lane

t e r r a c e s and I saw that by 2.00 p.m.              the fans were cramped              in this

 secti on of Che'terraces.                 Around 2.00 p.m.       I saw a youth who           I would

d e s cr ibe as a p p r o x i ma te ly 20 years with very light :blond; shioulder

was   intent on c l i m b i n g: u p and gaining access              into the West Stand.                 I

 appro a c h e d him from the          front of the West Stand,            leaned over and

 could not         reach hi m      if he    lowered himself and knowing             that    I could

 not get to him- because              of the full      c a p a c i t y of this section of the

 terraces       (Pen 3) he         looked up at me and said,             tuck off      , two or

 three times,         at the same time ma k i n g a two fingered                   ’V ’ sign towards
                                                                                          PAGE   •'
                                                                                          R124

        I again told hi m to get down wne n he again told me to "Fuck off"

and g e s t i c ul at ed with    ' V ’ signs as previously.           I could smell drink

on   this m a n ’s breath.



I was so incensed by this attitude               and conduct that          I left the West

Stand and went down         through the tunnel         into the Leppings Lane

terraces     (Pen 3).      I could not g a m       access    into this Pen because of

the crowding      there.        From the rear    I was able only to get a vie w of

the wall where       the youth had been stood.              He had disapp e a r e d from the

wall by this time.          I returned to the front of               the West Stand and.

e v e n t u a l l y saw>that' this youth had m o v e d t owards the front of Pen 3.                   \

I can be specific        about being pretty close            timewise because       records

will    show that after         the .incident wit h this youth i c h a n g e d my: radio

Upon returning       to the West Stand after           the radio change,        .the fans

                      in the crowd.              He had both his hands raised                    in the air and was

                      saw this youth n e a r ly get                   into a fight with a youth d i r ectly              in front

      (Calendar)            I saw a shot of this same youth                   in the Leppings Lane

      terraces and            i m m e d iatel y recognised him as being the same youth who

      had been -d-iving^ about                   on top of     the collapsed barrier.



      I tried        to attract        the att e n t i o n of        these two youths to stop their

      stupidity,            but my attempts were futile - I could neither get                          to them

      nor attract            their attention.



      As kick-off            time d r e w nearer          the numbers       of Liverpool     fans    in drink

      became more and m o r e                    obvious as it was so with their m a r k e d decline

      of    general         beh a v i o u r and      increased a g g r e s siveness..



      Around        2.55 p.m.        to kick-off            time,   numerous youths climbed up from

       out of the Leppings                   Lane Terraces          (Pens 3 and 4)    into the West Stand

       was a mass of heads and shoulders                            only.    I could not see any of the

              To my     lent    I saw Inspector Bulias and Poiice Constable                    2167 Frost who

              were    trying     to inform Poiice Control            of an   incident     m    Pen 3.      Radio

              terraces b elow        into the Vest Stand.            I saw a flood of Police Officers

              come    to this perimeter          fence on the pitch side of the fence,                  fans

              c o ntinued      to flood onto the perimeter            track and spill         over onto the

              actual        playing surface.       I saw a Police Superintendent               run onto        the

   injured and crushed.                The tans      in these pens were c o u n t er-p roductive

   m    a s sisting       the Poiice.         Instead of m o v i n g back        to relieve     the

  pressure and give             the Poiice Officers more                  room in which to work,           I

  saw the fans surge                forward    to fight,         abuse,    insult and spit on the

  officers        trying      to help    the injured.             The fans reaction o b v iously

  m ade    the s i tuation worse,             thereby ma k i n g        the situation      far more

  graver        for   those alread y      injured and crushed.




  In general          terms    tne behaviour of the Liverpool                  fans when events of

  the     tragedy initially became apparent was nothing                          less than appalling

 and      in m y n i n e t e e n and a half years.of Police Service                    the worst      I

 have p e r s o na ll y ever         experienced.             The Police were called         "murdering

 b a s t a r d s ” by thousands of fans.              Fans smelling of intoxicants was

 rife     in the West         stand.     From the Liverpool               fans I continued      to hear

 shouts and chants             of    "we know who will            be blamed for this fucking              lot

 don't we - the Liverpool                fans again.             Liverpool a g a i n ” .




 Further        shouts of      "We should have had the other- fucking end,                      you    (the

Police)         are all    fucking m u rd er in g bastards".                Further shouts of         "The

 F.A.     are    to blame      for   this fucking             lot",     I also heard on numerous

occas ions




I .saw the Police             carry more bodies onto                  the pitch area at m y end of

tne ground and mor e officers arrived on                              the scene at   the Leppings

Lane end.         I saw fans stood about on                    the pitch and perimeter         track

who appeared          to be    in a total daze and oblivious of what                       to do.     I

saw the injured being                treated by Police Officers,                the St.     Johns

A m bu la nc e and Liverpool           fans alike.




I saw the        injured being given m ou t h                 to m outh resuscitation and heart

  prevent          a n y p o s s i b i l i t y of     a clash between                    opposing       fans.

Naylor,       I instructed              those      two      officers           that we w e r e all              three          to

remain       together        as    I genuinely              feared         fo r    our    s afety.           We w e r e

positioned           at   the     right     hand      corner          of     the V e s t       Stand when            looking

  aggre s s i o n of       the Liverpool        fans both     in tne West Stand ana Leppings

  Lane     terrace below,            I d ecided   to p er s o n a l l y take over the

  re s p o n s i b i l i t y of   the e m ergency exit gate        leading from the West Stand

  to the t ear        of    the Leppings        Lane Terraces.       The young steward who was

 responsible          for m an ni ng     this gate was useless — he was mor e              intent on

 w a t c h in g the events on the pitch than m a n n i n g his post.                 I must have

 told him at          least six       times to stay by the gate,           but he continued                   to

 ignore m y requests and kept                  returning     to the front of the stand to

 see what was h a pp en in g on the pitch.




 I was of the opinion that                   if I were     to a i l o w this e m ergency gate             to

 be opened        there w ould be a flood of dep a r t i n g fans              that w o u l d only

 clog up the ease of flow of the eme r g e n c y services.                       My thoughts were

 then confirmed by a Police radio m es s a g e                   that was broadcast       over            the

 ground public address system,                    r e questing    that fans remained

 they were so as not                to impede     the speed and efficiency of the

e me rg e n c y services.




Whilst m an n i n g        this gate I was under a constant barrage of threats,

pleas and requests                 to open   it both from Liverpool        fans    in the West

Stand and those             in. tne Leppings        Lane   terraces. - The fans came up with :-

them.          I remained         in charge of this gate         throughout.



At   some point ,m           t^ae £hev Steward who tiad: b # e *

this Steward          it I were        to see h i m again -




                                                                                                              It

was obvious        to me     that    this Steward had        ’lost his bottle'.

                                                                                             1   ) '} .   P    ^   }

As events on cne pitch became more o r g anised and the bodies and

injured were cleared,              the crowd       in the ground started to dwindle and

i event u a l l y opened         this e m e rgency gate        to allow fans out of the West

Stand.      Man y by this         time had alre a d y        left   the stand via the rear

entrances.       A bo u t   this time one of the Chief Stewards a p proached me

m    the West Stand.             He had   taken off his yellow Stewards                        jacket and

d i s c r e e tl y showed   it    to me   folded up in his            inside       jacket pocket.          He

t o l d me that all his           Stewards        in the West     Stand had taken off their

Stewards     jackets and abandoned                their duties       - this was because of                 the

threats and a b u s e ,t he y had been given by the Liverpool                            fans     in the

West   Stand.      I have seen this Chief Steward on- previous matc h e s and

wo u l d recognise hi m again.                                             —



My Serial     had .obviously got split               following the tragedy.                     After the

West   Stand was cleared,            those of my serial             that were       left with me

mad e a sweep of .the West            stand for any dis c a r d e d property and after

f inding none w e - w e n t       out: of the rear of the             Leppings Lane terraces'.'^

We   (the Police), were           then all        instructed      to return to the North stand

for a de-brief w hi ch we did where                  I was able to account                    for the well

being of all of my Serial.



We then walked        to Claywheels         Lane w here we were stood down and

returned by transport             to H a c k e nthorpe Police Station.                   I went off

d uty that date at 8.00 p.m.                             ■    -     : .-       -     ■



I w ould   like to voice my own feelings:-



1.            This    tragedy was caused by the unruly and idiotic behaviour

              of the Liverpool            fans     themselves.

                                            i a                                          f'
                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                             R124


     2.
                      Drink   (intoxicants)     played a iarqe part       in tft.tr d i s g r a c e f
                      behaviour.




                     As   the tragedy unfolded      the actions of the Liverpool             fans,

                     particularly     those    in pens   3 and 4 of   the Leppings Lane

                     terraces did more        to hamper and obstruct      the Police when

                     they should have been d i r e c t e d at assisting.



     4.
                     I was d is gu s t e d at comments made     late on Saturday night

                     t elevision   (15.4.89)    by the Liverpool      Chairman whe n he

                     stated   that h oo li g a n i s m by the Liverpool   fans was not so

                    and played no part        in the tragedy.     He ought     to have been

                    witn me   in the West stand - he would have had a very

                    di f ferent   viewpoint    then - unless    of course he is an

                    hypocrite.

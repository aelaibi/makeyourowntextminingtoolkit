survival in the hell o f H illsborough. c ) u
  T he two Liverpool fans, o f F ox Hill W ay, Fox
Hill, were trapped in the crush o f supporters at
the Leppings Lane end at the ill-fated semi-final.
                              Today they spoke of
                           their ordeal and Sean,
                           aged 17, to ld how he
                           battled to save 13-year-
                           old Chris from death —
                           and then had to fight for
                           his own life.
                              “You are too young to
                           die,” he told the youngster
                           as he lifted him above the
                           seething crowd towards the
                            perimeter fence.
                              Sean, still deeply shocked
                            by his experience, added:
                            “He was getting squashed
                            and was crying his eyes out.
                            He kept saying ‘Help me.
                            Help me'. And I said ‘I
                            can’t, I can’t’.
                               “ Then someone at the
                            side of us just died and there
                            was suddenly a little space
                            as everyone tried to move
                            away. I quickly lifted my
                            brother above the crowd
                            and other people passed him
                            over their heads.
                               “I could see he was stuck
                            by his trackie bottoms on
                            the rails and then someone
                            on the other side just tipped
                            him down. That was the last
                            I sbw of him but at least 1
                             knew he was all right.”

                             deaf, told how he thought he
                             was going to die in the crush
                             and struggled for several
                             minutes before he passed
                             out.
                                “I’d got someone else’s
                            foot stuck in my ribs and I
                            lost my hearing aid on the
                            floor. I managed to pick it
                            up and then Sean picked me
                            up and I could feel other
                            people lifting me and pass­
                            ing me on. All the people

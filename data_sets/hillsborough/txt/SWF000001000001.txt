1.   Professional Career of A.R.Entwisle.
I am 62 years of age, and am Senior Consultant to Sheffield University Metals

Advisory Centre (SUMAC).     I have worked in the Department of Metallurgy,

University of Sheffield, since    1951, initially as Research Fellow and then as

Lecturer, and Senior Lecturer,    until 1984.   Since that time I have worked in
SUMAC, firstly as Managing Director, and latterly as Senior Consultant.

During most of my academic career I have been involved in the investigation of
practical metallurgical problems related to metal failures, in a wide variety

of circumstances, both in the capacity as advisor in a number of large scale

engineering failures, and as technical consultant preparing evidence for legal

actions.     Since 1984, I have been engaged full time in this type of activity

on behalf of SUMAC ( which is accredited by NAMAS, The National Measurement

Accreditation Service).


2.   Examination of Barrier 124a.

I have examined the various pieces of barrier 124a held by the Health and

Safety Executive ( Research and Laboratory Services Division) Broad Lane,

Sheffield, on 30 March 1990.      These included both the rails and the supports,

together with pieces cut from these,   which had been prepared for

microstructural examination.


The barrier had been considerably deformed.     The rail between supports 2 and 3

(2-3) had fractured at both ends in the region of the supports, and the rail
between supports 3 and 4 (3-4) had fractured at support 4, but had still been

held at support 3.

The rail 2-3 was more or less uniformly curved, with a maximum deflection near
mid-span of approximately 135mm, and the rail 3-4 was in a similar state, but

with a maximum deflection of approximately 200mm near mid-span.   Support 3
had collapsed, and had been forced to the ground.   Support 4 had also

collapsed, but had not been forced to the ground.


The large permanent (plastic) deformation of the two pieces of rail, with

smooth, almost symmetrical curvatures, strongly indicates that it is most

unlikely that any collapse of the supports could have taken place before the

deformation of the rail occurred.                       N

The microstructures of the sections of the two rails, and of the sections of

the supports were satisfactory, and show them to be wrought iron and mild steel

respectively.

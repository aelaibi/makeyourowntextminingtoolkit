              HILLSBOROUGH SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989
Together with my brother, my 11 year old son and a friend! left
Liverpool at 1030 hours to travel to Hillsborough to attend the FA
       Cup Semi-Final match.
I drove to Sheffield by car along the M62 heading as press reports
advised to join up with the Ml motorway.
On approaching the junction of the M62 and M602 motorway,
road traffic signs advised 'Football Traffic' to follow M602.
This was in fact misinformation as these signs are for football
traffic heading towards Old Trafford, Manchester United's
ground. These signs are for use in conjunction with road works
on the Barton Bridge, and could have been covered up for the day.
Much has been said about the effect of the late arrival of many
Liverpool fans at the ground; but anyone following the direction
signs on the M62 would have incurred a lengthy and time consuming
diversion resulting in late arrival in Sheffield.
After a trouble free journey with no traffic congestion we arrived
in Sheffield at approx 1230 hours.
We proceeded towards the ground passing numerous Police Officers
who appeared in a pleasant and receptive manner.
We reached the perimeter of the ground at about 1345 hours and
and having ensured my young son and friends safe arrival in the
North Stand my brother and I entered the Leppings Lane terraces
at turnstile B as shown on my ticket. It was then approximately
1355.
We ware_body searched twice., ores as we approachsd the turnstils
and again as soon as we passed through.
Continuing through the tunnel under the Stand we made our way onto
the terraces. I did not see any Stewards or Police directing people
within the ground nor did there seem to be anybody checking the
build up of spectators in the various pens.
Whilst I had no complaint    regarding the body searches
this activity was given great priority compared to the direction of
spectators within the ground thereafter.
Inside the pen there appeared very little space and we had difficulty
making our way through the crowd tc find a space on the right hand
side of the pen; this in fact proved almost impossible as no space
was available. At about 1430 people around me were complaining
that they were having difficulty in breathing as a result of the
intense pressure and heat generated by the crowd.
A gentlemen of middle age who had his son with him was distressed
that the young lad was upset and tried to leave the pen.
This proved impossible as one was unable to turn around
or move in any direction. We lifted the lad on the the gentleman's
shoulders so as to ease his distress. Many people around were by
this time shouting to the    Police Officers in front of the wire to
take action and relieve some of the pressure by moving youngsters and
others in distress out of the central pens to the emptier touchline
pens. Requests were also made to the Police at that time to stop any
more fans entering the centre pens.
Regrettably, no action was taken.
As the 3.00pm kick ciff time approached the situation had already
    reached and passed the condition of acceptability. Everybody
    was shouting at the Police Officers to relieve the situation. In many
    cases these pleas were vehement, and arguably abusive - however when
    you a»re struggling to survive and unable to move there is little
    alternative.
    A fan with pain etched on his faced climbed onto the fence
    and appealled to the fans at the back to ease off, but this was an
    impossible request as we could not move in any direction.
    The fan was swiftly pushed back into the crowd by a
    Police Officer who apparently was still unaware of what was
    happening to the fans on the other side of the wire, despite the
    continuing appeals from spectators for the pressure to be relieved.
    The gentleman again climbed onto the fence and shouted towards
    us that fans were dying in front of him.
    The match had still not kicked off.
    Fans all around w^re trying to move back but were unable to do so as
    others were apparently still entering the pen.
    The situation at that time was horrific.
    The game by now had kicked off but nobody around was watching
    we were trying to breathe and stay upright as the pressure was
    unbearable and the fans a few feet in front of us were screaming
    in terror. Somehow the game was stopped and all hell was let loose.
    Fans were trying to pick other fans up who had slipped down into
    the crush, but this was proving impossible as once you got your
    hands and arms free you were unable to put them back down again.
    Many fans were eventually lifted out of the front of that pen,
    many fans scrambled and were aided upwards into the stand above.
    Only then did the Police open t;*e ge£es at the front of the terraces.
    On              % U r ci-.r lav.®!- "t'miie-'c.fternoon I sickened anti
    found it hard to believe that so many fans had died. I was unware
    that a gate had been opened and so many fans lost the lives in the
    tunnel entrance and the central area of the terrace.
    I never once felt a sudden surge or any more pressure. The poor people
    infront of us on the right hand side of the pen were systematically
    crushed to their deaths from about 1415 onwards.
    The pressure had been unbearable from that time and there
    were many instances of crushing before the external gate was opened.
    Some of the fans died in that pen not as a result of that decision
    but because of the steadily increasing pressure in the preceeding
    hour.
    Fans were being crushed to death and many more would have died
    irrespective of whether the external gate was opened or not.
    I can only state in the section of the terrace we were in many would
    still have died as a result of the gross incompetence of
„   many people who had the power to act and failed to do so.
    On realising the extent of the tragedy the help then given by
    the Police was exemplary. The people of Sheffield late that
    afternoon surpassed all levels of human kindness and understanding,
    and for that we are extremely grateful.
    The events which lead upto this waste of human life must never
    be allowed to happen again. A little thought for our fellow human
    beings would have saved the lives of so many friends.

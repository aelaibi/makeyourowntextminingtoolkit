state       of       drunkeness.                    We       left          there          at     about             twenty          to    three          (1440)             and

walked          to    the       ground.                 On       the       way       I saw           a    couple             of    Policemen                bu t

received             no    directions                   to       the       ground           from          them          but       we    knew       the          way

anyway.              I saw          no    fighting                or       disorder              while             walking             towards          the

ground.                                                      ^         f        .      i

We    got       to    the       e n t raiyig/^at                 about          ten        to    three,             where          there          was       a    mass

There       were          no    organised                queues             just          masses              of    people.              There          were          two

Policemen             on       horses             and    a       few       on       foot        in       the       crowd          but    a    lot       were

just       standing             in       the       Leppings                L.N a r e a .

There       were          no P o l i c e           or    Stewards                 at      the        entrance                to    the       turnstiles.

As    I entered                through             the       gates          there           was          fence          to    the       right          which          I

was    pushed             against             by    the          crowd          which           was       quite          excessive.                    By       this

time       I had          been       split          up       from          my       friends.                  I got          myself          away       from          the

fence       and       got       into          a    sort          of    a    queue           in       between             the       gangway             fences

leading           into         the       turnstiles.                       Whilst           I was             in    the       queue          I was          edging

along       to       the       turnstiles                when          a Policeman                       to    my       right,          to    duck          under

the    barrier             as    the       gate       was    opened          around          the        corner,                so    I ducked,

under       and     walked          straight            through             the       open    g a t e , with                   a    load       of       other

supporters.                 Around          this       open       gate       were       standing              a       few          Policemen             and

I saw       no    other          gates       opened.              Whilst//!            was    waiting                 in       the       mass       of

people       I saw          about          ten    or    f ifteejp/people                    climbing              over             the    t u r n s t i le

Once     I got         through             the    open       gate        I saw         the    tunnel              and          headed          for       that

as    was    everybody              else.             1 began          to    walk       \sj(xn n    the       tunnel                which          was

quite       comfortable                to    walk       through             although          a     large             amount             of    people

were     w a 1 k i ng       d own      it.

I didn't          see       any     Policemen               or    Stewards             at    the        front             of       the    tunnel          or

inside       it.           From     when         I entered             the       ground       to        when          I    reached             my       match

When     I reached               the       end    of    the       tunnel          I made           my    way          to       the       right          pen.

It    was    very          full,       lots       of    shoving             and       pushing           and       I       initially                stood

and    stood        in      this       position             the     match         kicked           off.           I       could          now       feel       a

lot    of    pressure              coming         from       behind          and       I was        being             pushed             forward

towards          the       fencing.              We    were       crammed             together           with             little          control

over     myself            where       I    could       move        or      stand.           I could              see          that       I was

being       pushed          slowly          towards               the    blue crush            barrier                infront             of       m e to

1 got       back       a    few     feet         of    that       and       got       pushed        forward                again.              I    could

        due     to     the       mass       of       people          and       the          pushing          from          the       crowd.           I saw          that

        the     game        had       now       stopped             and       that          people          were          still       climbing             over          the

        fence.             There          were       about          two       hundred             people             on    the       pitch.           There          had

        been      no       particular                surge          by    the        crowd         it       was       just       a    continuous                crush

        due     to     the       mass.

        My     injuries              consisted                of    heavy          br u i|S i ryf to             my       left       arm       and    both       legi

        especially               to       the       left       side       of       my       inner       leg.

        I was        stood           up    now       and       started             to       push       myself             back       towards          the       rear

        of     the     pen       towards             the       wall       by       the       tunnel.              Some          of    the       crowd          were

        also      trying             to    get       back          and    took          a    couple          of       minutes             to    get       to    the

               the    terracing                   where     I was.            I got          myself             to       the       tunnel       and       started           to

               walk       up       the       tunnel.           There         were       some       people                still       walking          in       aswell

               Policemen                at    the       start      of    the       tunnel          at       the          terracing,             standing

               there,          not       doing          anything         in       particular.                       One       of    them       because          of    the

               state       I was             in    took    hold         of    me       and       led    me          into       the       tunnel       and       stood

               me    up    against                the    wall      to    calm          me    down.              He       left       me    and       went       back       to

               the    terracing                   and    I made         my    way       to       the    rear             of    the       stand.           As    I    g ot

               out    of       the       tunnel          into      the       courtyard             area             I sat          down       with    my       back

               against             the       wall.        Shortly            after          four       Policernen                  came       out    of    t he

' D C v 'TH*   tunnel          car r y i n g        a    gir 1 .        She       was       in    he r t w e n t i es               w h i te    wiIh       dar k

               curly       bushy             hair.        They      put       her       on       the    floor             and       I stood          up.        I saw

               one    Policeman                   give    her      the       kiss       of       life       but          she       had    turned          blue       in

               the    face.              I just          wanted         to    get       away       so       I walked                towards          the       open

               blue       gate          past       the    girl      at       which          about       twenty                or    thirty          Policemen

               walked          through             the    gate      past          me    and       stood             around          the       Policeman             giving

               the    girl          mouth          to    mouth.          An       ambulance             baeked                up    towards          the       gate       and

               people          started             shouting         to       the       group       of       Police             to    get       out    of       the    way

               but    they          just          stood    there.             I just             walked             out       of    the       gate.        I got          out

               of    the       gate          and    there       were         people          and       Policemen                   stood       round,          some       in

               a    daze       a    lot       of    them       distressed,                  this       would             be    about          twenty       five       past

               three.

               I just          car r i ed          on    walking         and       a    woman          in       a    shop          helped       me    in       the    shop

               because             of    the       state       1 was         in a n d        I had          a       cup       of    tea.        I    phoned          my

               girlfriend                to       say    I was      alright             left       the          shop          and    went       back       to       the

               van.        My       friends             turned      up       at    the       van       except

                                        and                                   who       went       home             by    other          means       as    they

               thought             we    would          have    left.             When       they       d i d n ’t            turn       up    we    went       to    the

               Police          Station             to    report         them       missing             and          shortly          after          that       at    about

                                                                                                                                              S496

eight       o'clock             that       evening          we     headed            back    to    Liverpool                and       arrived

home    at    about             quarter          past       ten       (2215).

I saw       nothing             happened          at    all        which         I    consider          to       be    criminal.

I    feel    that       after             the    incident             had       happened          the       Police          outside           the

ground       completely                   misunderstood                what          was    happening             inside.               There

were    a    lot       of       Police          standing           outside            the    ground          doing          nothing           there

seemed       to    be       a       complete          lack       of    communication                 from         the       Police           inside

to    the    Police             outside.              There        was      a    complete          lack          of    ambulances

initially          at       the       start       of    the        incident            but    it     took         some       time           before

the    rest       of    the          ambulances             arrived.                 There    should             have       been        a    lot

more    first          aid          equipment          to     help       the         injured.           I    personally                 didn't

see    any.        There             was    a    complete             lack       of    vital       information                   by     the

loudspeaker             in          the    ground,          x^ou      couldn't             hear    it       at    all       and       it    wasn't

used    enough          to          inform       p e ^ p 1e      of    what          happened.

I feel       we    were             given       Ime    wrong          end       of    the    ground          by       the    F    A.         I went

last    year       to       t.h g JS^rn i -■F i n a 1 at              Hillsborough                and       the       general           queuing

was    organised                a    lot    better.              I think             th4t    this       was           due   to        the h o r s e s

being       put    to       a       better       effect          at    t h e A,u r n s t i 1e s .                 I think        th at the

kick    off       could             have    been       d e l a y e d yand            the    loudspeaker                being          used     to

inform       people.                 The    Police          an d ^Stewards                 could     have         blocked             off     t he

tunnel       and       directed             people          tafother             parts       of    the       terracing.                     I think

more    time       should             be    used       ijiv o b s e r v i n g         the    crowd            by w h e r e t h e y s t a n d

and    better          directions                given        to      them       to    where       to s t a n d .

              Further          to    my    previous            statement          dated    6th       May    1989          (060589),          I wish

              to     add      the    following.

              I have          marked       on    a   plan       of    the    Leppin^fs         Ln    terraces             my    positions

              within          Pen    3 .    (Exh,         No              )(Exh./Ref,

       &      I got        onto      the    terrace            and    ente, e d P e n      3    at    about          2.53       pm    (1453       hrs)
 S P
              to     2.54      pm    (1454- h r s ) ,          as    Miave        described          within          my    previous

              statement.              I tried         to       get    a    good    position          within          the       Pen    and    was

              pushed          generally          towards            the    front    by    the       crowd       of    people          within       the

              Pen.

              I did        not      stand       in a n y       one    position       for       any    length          of       time    because

              the       Pen    was    overcrowded               and       I was    continually             pulled          from       side    to    side

              and       generally          forward.             Just       after    kick-off          I was          pushed          forward       to    a

              position             I have       marked         (1)    on    the    plan,       which       is    just          behind       the    gap
                                                                                                                                                 PAGE            2
                                                                                                                                                 S49&A

between          the    two       forward              sections             of    crush          barriers.                 I saw       the       crush

barrier          slightly             in    front           of    me    and       decided             to    try       and      push     back          to

get    away       from       it       because           I d i d n ’t w a n t               to    get       trapped          against          it.

I    pushed       back       for       only        a    matter          of       ten       to    fifteen             seconds,          when          I saw

the    upright           l eg     of       the     barrier             at    its       junction             with         the     crossbar             start

to    bend       away       from       me        to wa rd s the             perimeter             fence.               I have         marked          this

point       on    the       plan       'A'.            t h i s is       the       left          hand       leg        of t h e    right          hand

barrier          as    you       look       at     the       pitch,          at       the       front       of       the    Pen.

I saw       the       barrier          start           to    bend       forward             and       I started             to    shout,             "Get

back,       it's       gonna          be    another              Heysel          here",          as    the       barrier          bent       away

from       me    though          e v e r y one         near       to    it       started          to       fall       forward          and       I    lost

sight       of    the       barrier              b e n e a t h the          people.

I did       not       see    if       the        barrier snapped                      or    the       crosspiece            separated                from

the    upright           leg.          The       barrier           still          seemed          intact             before       I    lost          sight

of    it.        It    just       seemed           to       bend       away       slowly          wirth t h e            people        against             it.

There       were       approximately                    four       people             in/front             of    me,       between          me       and

the    barrier.              As       they       fell        forward./!                braced          myself            because        I    could

see    what       was       happening;                 howeverI                  was       pushed          by    the       sheer       weight          of

numbers          behind          me    and       yell        ojpr t o p      of       the       people          in    front       of    me       onto

the    floor.                                      \ /
I ended          up    at    a    point          I have           marked          on       the    plan          ’S ' .

I have          described             in    my     previous             statement                what       happened             after       I       fell

to    the       floor.

I did       not       feel       any       surge        of       people          within          Pen/S          and      did     not    see          any

reason          for    the       barrier           to       break.           I felt             a/constant               pressure

throughout.                 I believe              it       to    have       brokgdi a b o u t              3.02         pm -     3.03       pm

A    lot    of    my    friends             who        were       iln tbre        stands          have          talked         about        seeing          a

surge       when       BEARDSLEY                 hit the bar.                 I saw         the       first          c o u p l e of m i n u t e s

of    the       game,       but       did        not see thi s               s o it        must       have       happenedeither                        at

                 the    time       or    after       the       barrier          broke.

                 When       I eventually             got       out    of    the       mass       of    people          who       had    fallen          to    the

                 floor,       the       game    had    finished.                 I have          no    idea       of    what          time       this    was

                 but    there       were       still       a    few       players          standing          on       the    halfway             line.        I

                 then       just    wanted       to    get       out.           I made          my    way    to       the    tunnel          just       as    the

                 first       Police       were       coming          down       it.        It    took       me    a    couple          of    minutes          for

                 me    to    get    from       the    front          of    the       Pen    to       the    tunnel.

                 There       is    only    one       thing       which          I wish          to    change          from       my    previous

                 statement          and    that       is       concerning             the       young       boy       whose       face       I    put    my

                 hand       on.     In m y      previous             stateme                                          I did       not       think       he    had

           ^     died?       however,          looking          back       on    i                                lat       he    must       have       died.

                 He    was    about                                                    with          natural          looking          brown       curly

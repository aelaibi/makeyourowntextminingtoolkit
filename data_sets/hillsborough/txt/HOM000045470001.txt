I attach

                  a note from Julian Knowles about video evidence. This is one of the
                  submissions which Ann Adlington promised me this morning. She told me
                  this afternoon that we can expect two more - one, imminent, on how the
                  Coroner tried to rewrite Taylor and another (which she hadn’t mentioned to
                  me this morning) from a ‘trauma specialist’ bearing apparently on the 3.15
                  cut-off at the Inquest. She said she had been chasing the trauma specialist
                  since the summer, but he had been tied up in the recent murder trial involving
                                    and                        so could not oblige;

                  a letter from Dr Wardrope which indicates that we may have to wait a little
                  while for the medical records we asked for (but I will chase);

                  the top copy of the letter from Doug Fraser, the Steering Committee solicitor
                  - you have already seen this text of course but you might prefer to work from
                  this good copy rather than what we had before.

      Dear Sir

      Hillsborough private prosecution - Ai                                                 -v- Duckenfield

      We note that we have heard nothing father from you since we wrote to you on 1
      November.

      We are aware that Hillsborough Family Support Group wrote to you on 11 November 1999
      setting out the Crown’s ^ j^ s s io n s on our application to you to enter a nolle prosequi in
      relation to counts 4 and 5 on the indictment, as they have sent us a copy of that letter but
      have not sent with it copies of the varioils enclosures referred to in their numbered
      paragraphs 2, 6,12,16 and 22.               ;j||;

      We should be grateful therefore if you woali kindly forward to us a copy of the complete
      letter which you have received-from HFSG^ked 11 November, including full copies of the
      various enclosures, so that we may draft ourfeply.

      Without having a complete copy of HFSG’s letter to you of 11 November with enclosures
      we are clearly placed in some difficulty over providing our reply by 30 November as
      provided for in your timetable. We should be grateful therefore if you would kindly allow
      us 10 days from our receipt of the comptetfeletter and enclosures in which to provide you
      with our reply.           ;

      We look forward to hearing from you as so6$ as possible.

      Yours faithfully

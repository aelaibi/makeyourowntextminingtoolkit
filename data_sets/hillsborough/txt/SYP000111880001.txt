  see them because                of my position.                  What    I could see was           through a

  small     crack       in the         corr u g a t e d s h e eting at         the top of the stairs and

saw several         fans     lying      on the grass and even so,                         the match had. k ic ke d

qualified         Instructor,         1 went        to the two        people who had been brought

o u t , to help them            in M w a y          I could.        B o t h of them were           uncons c i o u s

but    breathing.            T h e y were     ini t i a l l y   placed in the          recovery        position.

I then was j o i n e d          by Police C o n s t a b l e 216 7 Frost              and together with

this     officer,        carried the female,                now se m i - c o n s c i o u s    person,    outside

the ground beside               the gate       in question.             I was still           unaware    that any

person had bee n killed,                 but there were a p p r o x i m a t e l y a dozen bodies

laid out beside              the gate,        but    leaving       room for vehicles,               ambulances

to just        get    through.        These      bodies were          covered over w i t h            coats,

blankets        etc.*     But    initially,          it still       d i d n ’t hit me they were              dead.

I passed a b o u t % in betw e e n about                two dozen other             people who were            laid

out,     but    o b v i o u s l y alive,      placing       one female who was o b v i o u s l y having

great     difficulty          b r e athing and who was              laid down.         I raised her up and

got a c i v ilian to support                  her    in this      position.          It was        obvious     she

had ribs broken,              but    in that        p o s ition her      breathing           became   easier.

The female           I had h e l p e d   to    carry out         I found to be an a s t h m a t i c and

also had rib fractures,                  still       unconscious         but still           breathing.

Seve r a l     more were        unconscious          and    I placed       in the      recovery        position.

One    thing was a p parent,             X saw no one w i t h open wounds,                      mainly    crush

a c c e s s was      not mad e      easy by fans           now s t a rting      to leave        the stand.

Quite a few mor e             injured were           now being        brought out and              it was then

 subsequently did,along with a good number of other officers* I was assigned

 duties as part of Serial no*13 which was led by fiS 2001 BORMAN of E1 Sub-

 Division. We travelled to the ground via police transit reg.no* A602 WHL,

 arriving there at approx. 8.458®. We then went straight to the North Stand

 where we occupied our specified seats in serials as previously directed.

 We remained seated until the briefing took place at 1000am. Immediately after

 briefing, we had a packed lunch, again in the North Stand, to be on our

 points by 1115ara» for the gates opening at 12 noon. My specific duties related

 to the Leppings Lane Stand, being in company with PC 928 PARKIN, also of

 Hackenthorpe PS, and before the match started, to patrol the concourse area

 at the rear of the upstairs stand. This is the area where the toilets sire,

 the tops of both stairways and the buffet bar area* This was to be continued

 until kick off, when we were to be relieved by another serial, for a hot meal.

 Fans from Liverpool started arriving and entering the stand at about 12.15pm,

 but very few had entered up to about 1.30pm. Between 1.30pm and 2.15pm a great

 deal more arrived and the stand begem to fill up, both downstairs and upstairs.

 Quite a lot of these fans had been drinking, and one in particular had consumed

 a lot, but was not a problem. Shortly after this, I was aware that there was a

 large amount of fans waiting outside the ground, in Leppings Lane, not making

 any attempt to enter the ground, but merely standing around or sitting on grass

 banks opposite the entrances in Leppings Lane* At around about this time,

messages began to be broadcast over the Tannoy system to fans outside the ground,

 to the effect that the crowd was pushing towards the turnstiles, and would they

 stop doing so - they would all get through* It would appear this had no effect on

the crowd, as messages continued to be passed over the tannoy system. I could in

 ffcftt- see fans pushing towards the turnstiles and the side gate. As this was

 happening, fans began to climb over the wall between the turnstiles          weremet

 by officers inside. After a short while, an Inspector(I do not knoe his name)

 climbed up on top of a turnstile building and leant over the top of the wall,

 where they were climbing up, and began helping some over. There was obviously

a large amount of people at the front, near to the turnstiles being crushed up

against the walls, although I couldn't see them because of my position. What

I could see was through a small crack in the corrugated sheeting at the top

of the stairst and through windows at the back of the buffet bar,

I began to get some idea of what was happening outside, when, it must have been

towards about 2.50|»i fains began coming in saying ’It8s fucking hell out there,

you’ll have to do something people sire getting crushed.* At this time the gate

in question was still closed. I believe the gate must have been opened shortly

after this and the crowd swelled in through the opening. People began running

through sind pushing eveyone in front of them towards the stsind. They then ran up t

the stairs towards us, a lot of them in a very angry state, shouting and swearing

because they hadn’t been let in earlier. Shortly after this I saw that the gate

had been shut again, and fans were again being let in more gradually and certainly

under controll. I also saw that the gate at the bottom of the stairs on that side

of the stand where the gate is, was being monitored by ground stewsirds and I think

a police officer. It was in fact shut about this time, effectively leaving

only myself and PC PARKIN in the concourse area, though there were other officers

at the front of the upstairs stand. The general feeling of the most of the fans

at this stage was pretty ugly and angry. Staff, mostly young girls, behind the

counter of the buffet bar expressed the feeling that they were very frightened by

what they could see happening below them outside the ground, and were scared

for their safety. I went up to the top of the entrance/gangway about 3*00pm to

see that quite a number of fans had by now in fact got onto the pitch,presumably

over the fencing, and officers were trying to control the matter. I saw several

fans lying on the grass and even so the match had kicked off. Shortly after this

an officer wnet onto the pitch and held his hand up towards the players in sin obvious

effort to stop the match. This was met by loud boos and general rowdy disapproval

by the majority of spectators, certainly in the Leppings Lane stand. At this time I
                                                                            R 1(•*-
                               -3-


saw officers and St John Ambiance people gesturing at the fans in the standing

area below us to move back and relieve pressure on those at the front, Thete

actions were those of being desperate, I was not aware of any dead at this stage*

However, I did see some people being carried off the pitch with obvious leg

injuries, their legs being strapped together with bandages.

About this time, two people were carried back to the concourse area from the front of -

the upstairs, I do not know if they had been handed up from downstairs or not.

The upstairs area was packed solid, people sitting on the steps between seats,

and along the front, in front of the seats. Being one of the Forces First Aid

Team and a qualified Instructor, I went to the two people who had been brought out,

to help them in any way I could. Both of them was unconcious, but breathing. They

 were initially placed in the recovery position. I then was joined by PC FROST (216?)

and together with this officer, carried the female, now semi-concious person,

outside the ground beside the gate in question, I was still unaware that any person ha

been killed, but there were approximately a dozen bodies laid out, beside the gate,

 but leaving room for vehicle,ambulances to just get through,*These bodies were

 covered over with coats, blankets etc. But initially it still didn't hit me they were

 dead. I passed about in between about two dozen other people who were laid out,

 but obviously alive,   placing one female who was obviously   having      great difficul

breathing and who was laid down* I raised her up and got a civilian to support her

 in this position. It was obvious she had ribs broken, but     in thethat position her

breathing became easier. The female I had helped to carry out I found to be an

asmatic and also had rib injuries, still unconcious but still breathing. Several

more were unconcious and I placed in the recovery position. One thing was apparent,

 I saw no6one with open wounds, mainly crush type injuries.Ambulances then started

to arrive, very steadily and access was not made easy by fans now starting to leave

the stand. Quite a few more injured were now being brought out and it was the that I
                                                    «r

went to the bodies that were covered over, expecting to be able to help them, check

their breathing, turn them into the recovery position etc. But I then saw that at

that point we had about a dozen dead bodies there* Other people such as nurses

and in particular a doctor the gradually arrived. The doctor took overall charge of th<

 in which casualties were transported by ambulances, the dead being left till last.

Fans leaving the stand were generally abusive, shouting obscene comments towards

 officers, even those engaged in tending to casualties. Lying the blame at out door.

At this point I was involved with resusitation of three casualties together with

 cardiac massage, f&is was assisted initially by PC 3162 PEARS E1, then by a

 para-medic type ambulance man and a doctor, until he was then taken to hospital
                                                  (


 by ambulance. I was then directed by an inspector to take a group of doctors who

 had just arrived, to the Gymnasium. This I did, and on arrival there saw that it was f*

 full of bodies, some dead some alive. Ambulance personell were busy carrying in more

 casualties, and taking other ones out. Various doctors,nurses were busy treat ing

 those alive. Gradually the exchange of those dead, those alive and treated was

 completed, until I believe 9^ bodies were laid out in the gym, all with a police

 officer. I was then directed, along with PC PEARS, and by Insp TINGLE to identify

 and record all found property being brought in. By this time, the major incident

 equipment was being brought in and wheels were being put in motion. In the property

 brought in, were some identifying the owners, and approx. three were able to be mate tie-

 up and identify bodies. I eventually was released at 9*00pm from the duties at the

 gym and signed off duty at 1000pm at Hackenthorpe PS.

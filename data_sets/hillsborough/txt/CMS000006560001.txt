The Secretary
All Football League Clubs



IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TAYLOR REPORT


In my letter of 1 August 1991 to all club secretaries I indicated
that, before the FLA issued licences for the 1992/93 football
season, it would expect clubs to provide it with full details of
their plans to implement the Taylor Recommendations - in
particular those on converting their grounds to all seater by
1994 or 1999 as appropriate. Accordingly, I enclose a detailed
questionnaire which is to be completed and returned to me please
not later than 15 April 1992.

Clubs will observe that the questionnaire is an expanded version
of that issued by the Football League in Autumn 1991. Much of
the information required should, therefore, be readily available
to clubs. Nevertheless, given the amount of information being
sought, the questionnaire is, in 1992, being sent out before and
separately from the start of the licensing process. Applications
for licences will be dispatched in about a month's time.


The questionnaire will double as the six monthly Football League
questionnaire for Spring 1992.    It will also provide valuable
background information to the Football Trust which should assist
the processing of applications. Clubs are, therefore, requested
to copy the completed form to the Football League (Football
League Clubs only), the Football Trust and the Football Stadia
Advisory   Design   Council.   All   three   bodies   will   treat   the
financial and planning information submitted as "commercial in
confidence".

Any club unsure about how to complete the form, should, in the
first instance, contact its local FLA Inspector for guidance.
I am copying this letter and the attached form for completion to
the Secretaries of all Football League Clubs, plus Berwick
Rangers FC and the Stadium Managers of Wembley and Cardiff Arms
Park. Copies go for information to the Chief Executives of the
Football League and Football Association, the Secretaries of the
Football Association of Wales and the Football Trust, the
Executive Officer of the Football Stadia Advisory Design Council
and to the Secretary of the Rugby Football Union (Twickenham).

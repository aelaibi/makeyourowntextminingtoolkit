        SUBJECT:
                                  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

        I f o r m r d herewith photocopies of personal letters my wife and I
        received following the disaster at Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989.  I
        acknowledged each letter briefly in the aftermath of the disaster and my
        wife has since written to             I.

        In your capacity as Liaison Officer with the West Midlands Police, I
        should be grateful if you would forward these letters to the senior
        Investigating Officer.

        You will know that I have been served with Regulation 7 Notices frcm
        three complainants to date.     It would be appreciated if the letter
        writers could be seen by the investigation team.    It may be that they
        have already been seen but, if they have not, then it is possible that
        they have evidence to offer which might provide seme balance to counter
        the allegations which have been made in the Notices I have received.

        It is regretted that the identity of the writer of the letter marked 'A'
        is not .jknown. However, the letter was handed in personally at West Bar
        Police Station and, as he describes himself as a 25 stone man, it is
        possible tlkat his identity may already be known frcm the enquiries which
        have been rpade by the West Miplands Police at Merseyside.

Dear Superintendent Marshall,

My name is                  I am from Liverpool. What I want to say is that I
      juu  _       o ____
thank you for saving some lives at Hillsborough.  I believe if you had not
opened^that gate I do not believe there would have been 95 people dead, but I
think there would have been 295 or 395 people dead.

I have a nephew in hospital in Intensive Care. His name is
By opening those gates, what the media do not realise, is that you made an
escape route. What has got to come out of this is that we have got to stop
this madness now together. How we do it is we call for an amnesty of all arms
in the world as a tribute to Liverpool Football Club. No human being in the
world should be asked to pay the price as they are asking you to pay. The
price is far too high. By making you redundant or demoted will not bring back
the dead or get the injured better. The lesson that has to be learned is that
we do not believe that the Sheffield Police said or wrote those lies in those
shithouse papers as that is all they are fit for.

The only thing that cannot be replaced by time, money or effort, ishuman
beings.  Obviously, you are in crisis yourself as I have been.  I have got a
lot of help off people I did not even know. I am trying to help you to cope
with this problem.  I want you to put me on your Christmas card list. We have
got to take the opportunity now to stop the violence. One way we do it is when
we report it we say people were fighting at Anfield but the men were shaking
hands with each other, drinking with each other and joking with each other.
As we are both aware, youths think it is manly to fight at football matches.
I like to think that gesture I am making to you will prove what being a man is
all about.

The only 'weapons' I have come up with from Liverpool are some photographs of
myself, family and friends.   Photo No. 1 in the picture is my friend who sadly
died 3 years ago, his son, his daughter in law and his wife.Picture Number      2
- that is me taken in 1975 when I was a hippy and I am still   one today. Photo
No. 3 is my father, who sadly has had a stroke and my mother who has to cope
with him.

Going back to the media, one of the lies was that an unnamed policeman said the
hurtful things that the gutter press reported. My answeris that there is no
such thing as an unnamed policeman. They all have   names; Tom, Dick or whatever
There is only one man I know with no name and he is called Clint Eastwood.

In Liverpool I want the people from Sheffield to know that the people from
Liverpool do not believe it.  I would like you to look at your feelings like a
puncture. On Saturday, whatever date it was, as you can see I am in crisis
myself and cannot remember. You are the puncture. Whatever date it is now I
want you to know that you look on me as a puncture repair kit. This is   only a
start of a friendship starting now as from 10 minutes ago.

Yours, as a mate,


P.S.   The disaster was only an accident. With hindsight, I would know a horse
       was going to win a race at 3.00 p.m. at Aintree. So there is no way you
       knew what would happen. Because your name is not Doris the medium.

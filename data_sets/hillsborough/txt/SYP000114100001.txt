At this          time there w e r e only a small                 number     of fans      in the       immediate*

 vicinity.            E v e n w h e n the turns t i l e s were         o pen there were           o n l y a small

 number      of L i v e r p o o l    fans entering.             The m o o d at this       time was happy

 wi t h m a n y    fans    joking w i t h us, at            this    time    it was      possible        to search

 every      person e n t e r i n g     through^ our         turnstile.          However,     as time went

 on it was very noticeable^ Vo me that a l t h o u g h there were an

 i n creasing         number     of fans arriving,              m a n y were    choosing     to sit outside

 the gr o u n d or s t a n d a w a y from the               gr o u n d at L e p p i n g s Lane,       even at

 this    point        it only a p p e a r e d to be a           'normal'       match.

 It was      noticeable          though      that w h e n a prisoner            needed e s corting         to the

 g y m g n a s i u m area,      it m eant     two me n      leaving      the tur n s t i l e area.         To

 escort      fans      to our       control area,          the g y m n a s i u m exit gate        *B*    had to

 be op e n e d to a l l o w         us through.

 Although,         due to the work            being      carr i e d out,       I was unaware          of time

 throughout,           I beli e v e at about 2 . 1 5            p.m.   I e s c o r t e d a L i v erpool     fan

 ticket stub.                                        ,

We went          thro u g h exit      gate    *0y    to get to the gymnasium,                at      this time the

 crowd outside was              still     growing,         although      people were        still       jovial

and     it was        still     in order/to         s e a r c h v i r t u a l l y every person entering

 the ground.

 It had been a s u r p r i s e          to see       the    number     of L i v erpool      fans who had

 tried to get            into   the L e p p i n g s L ane Wes t S t a n d on N o t t i n g h a m Forest

the    number of          people outside.            A y th^t .time           I thought          it was       quite

astounding          the    numbers       that    hadr a r r i v e d    in such a short              space of time

Understanding             the    reason for'not           being a l l o w e d outside              the ground via

exit    gate       * B * , I the n went         to exit      gate      ’C * where        I m a n a g e d to get

outside.

Once    outside a g a i n          I managed      to get        to the      railings         by t u r n s t i l e s A-G

but felt       quite       h e l pless as there was                   no possible way             of       returning

to a turnstile,             there a p p e a r e d to be               so m any fans        to     so       few

P olic e m e n .      It was                                        of f i c ^ ^ ^ a T t ^ o u g ^ T ^ B i ™ n o t    sure

who,    i n s t r u c t e d me     to go to the w r o u g h t          iron     perimeter          gates      facing

L e p p i n g s Lane      to ens u r e    that    the gate         closest         to the       river was            kept

shut.

I, a long w i t h all            but two of my serial,                 did not        possess an y personal

radi o s .

I noti c e d that          there were        two m e m b e r s     of the Police M o u n t e d S e c t i o n

trying     to s top the           crushing       that was        occurring.           However,         the horses

w ere ma k i n g      little       impact,                            crowd was g e t t i n g          very angry

at the way they were                 jumping about.

The    crowd at        this      point were       getting        very heated as time was getting

on towards          three       o ’clock and m o v e m e n t       t h r o u g h the t u r n s t i l e s a p p e a r e d

to be very slow.                 At this     point       I^dtfn't believe             there were any

P o l i c e m e n a c t u a l l y workinglrfie t urnstiles.                   Indeed,        w i t h the amount

The      p e r imeter       gate     I was at was shu t a f t e r a struggle,                    the     idea being

 that     if all       the     p e r i m e t e r gates were         shut,      the    crush- by the

 tu rnstil.es w o u l d be earned however,                       fans    just outside, these g a t e s M g e r s ’

 by n o ^ f e t t i p g      very     irate,      s h o u t i n g a n d Some hurl ing a b u s e          towards ti*.

Unfortunalely,               it could             seen/that         there were a number o f young

 c h i l d r e n in this          crowd o u t s i d e / t h e    gates an d      I fe a r e d for their safety.

 Immediately           to my       right was^ aj w r o u g h t       iron fence f o l l o w e d by a

 further        two    gates       w h i c h h a d | ^ e e n shut    by the M o u n t e d O f f icers.              The

 crowd was g r a d u a l l y          pushing harder and on numerous                       occ a s i o n s    I was

 ha v i n g d i f f i c u l t y    holding this gate              shut.        I was    by myself        on this

 gate.       It was         n o t i c e a b l e that   large numb e r s         of    people a l t h o u g h

 possessing           tickets,        did NO T know w here              that    part of the        ground was

 a n d man y were           unable      to get out of the               crowd to get to that                 part of

 the ground a f t e r             being     instr u c t e d on w h e r e       they sh o u l d be.

 At one      point      I a l l o w e d my       perimeter        gate    to be ope n e d to a l l o w a

 f a t h e r a n d his y o u n g        son and a pregnant w o m a n to go through,                           the    crowd

 at this        point       held     back and       allowed       them thro u g h before pushing again

 when     the    gate was          shut.

 The     time must          now have       been getting           cljD^^^^JUTre^jo^^o^k                  and

 a surge.          I was       unable      to hold the           gate    shut,       but made     sure that          I

 was     pushed b e h i n d the fencing                to my      right.        At this      point      I was

* fearful       for my o w n s a f e t y but there was a greater                          fear    for

 s u p p o r t e r s ’ sa f e t y as      they    crushed t h r o u g h        the gate.         Somehow       I

managed         to shut        the gate again,            but     i n c r e a s i n g l y more a n d more fans

 w ere    climbing          over     fencing      to my     left w h i c h      runs    parallel        to the

 river,      in order          to get      round the        p e r imeter       gates.      I also w i t n e s s e d

 S o o n after        the    first      surge     there was a great surge,                   I was      thrown

                                     W ' the floor as           the    rush of    people     p u s h e d them

over,     now    I was      extremfrly aware th«t                there were going to be some                     ,

serioufs      injuries         o r d e#th*      if these        peole d i d n ’t get up off          the ground.

O n a couple of o c c a s i o n s            I m o v / d ac r o s s my g a t e w a y area to try and

hold    the     crowd back to gi«e these                   people       chance    to get     up.

H o w ever,     the ones        on the g r o u n d d i d n ’t seem to realise                the vast

numbers       pushing indeed,               I witnessed         one ma n who      had f a l l e n over,

l i ngering      to    pick up his           loose    change w h i c h     had s c a t t e r e d on falling

from his        pocket.         It was at this            point       I realised anot h e r P oliceman,

not from my serial,                  was    present.       We    urged    people      to calm down and to

stop    pushing,         but    it was useless,            the    crowd    c o n tinued to surge

t owards the          t u r n s t i l e area.       I wy&s a m a z e d how q u i c k l y such a large

n umber    of    people        had    cleared f r/om the a r e a outside               the West S tand

turnstiles.            O n l y a few people r e mained,                 looking      for shoes and other

items of p r o p e r t y they              had lost     in the surge.

^As I looked towards                 the ground,        I saw that EX^T^G^T^^C^jTaid^Jfceen

opened.         I felt      some      relief as       1 was      in no doubt that          if this h a d n ’t

o pened m a n y       people w o u l d have j^fied outside.

As    I walked        round w i t h other O f f i c e r s         outside      of turns t i l e s A~G,        the

general       comments w ere           of h^w/qui ckly the a r e a had                cleared.       It was

now    I heard        the first        tannoy m e s s a g e      I had heard all a f t e r n o o n and

that was        for    the fans at the L e p p i n g s            Lane    end to stop        pushing.

Believing        it was a m e s s a g e for those outside,                     I thought      that    it was a

bit    late     for    that,     but       it was    o b v i o u s l y meant   for   those    inside as

a fter a few moments,                 it was h e a r d on personal             radios    pos s e s s e d by

some o f f i c e r s    that all           officers were         required      inside the ground.

I made my w a y          into    the ground,          a r o u n d the    rear of the West S t a n d onto

the S o u t h S t a n d a n d        then on to the pitch.

              Ptjiice O f f i c e r s    in the      v i c i n i t y a n d ga i n e d entry    into    the ground.

              On getting          i n t o ,the s t a d i u m from L e p p i n g s Lane,       the s u p p o r t e r s were

                                  a tunnel,        an obvious r o u t e     for s u p p o r t e r s who are      unaware

              of .t-hf side        entrances        onto the t e rracing.

              The gam£ had o n l y just started,                  but as T u n d e r s t a n d P e t e r B e a r d f l e y

              had just hit the              crossbar w h i c h will       fejbvl'ously have         cause eKci t e m e n t

              amongst       the    crowd.      As w i t h all     late e n t r a n t s   to football        matches,

              w h e n the    crowd are        excited,      people     rush to the nearest a r e a to see

              what     is going       on.     In this      case    I believe      the    crush from outside,            a

              rush     inside      to the     nearest an d o n l y obvious           route       in to see the

              pitch,     caused m a n y       problems.

              However,       I would        like    to   reiterate     that a l t h o u g h    I didn't      see exit

              gate     *C ’ opened,         it o b v i o u s l y had been ope n e d for so m a n y to            clear so

              quick BUT       I am      in no doubt that           if the    gate    h a d n ’t been opened,          many

              deaths w o u l d have          o c c u r r e d outside   the ground.            The   d e c i s i o n to open

              the gate was           in my opinion,         the onl y one        possible.

Q 13.   DID YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM GAINING ACCESS?           IF Y E S , BRIEFLY

         DESCRIBE.



         (See blank page at t h e     rear of questionnaire.)     •

         I parked my car in Wads ley Ln at about        1.40 pm (1340).      From

         my car it is about       10 minutes walk to the ground.       1 made my

         way into Leppi ngs L n and when 1 reached the last set of

         traffic    lights before the entrance to the ground I found the

         road a 1most     completely b 1oj?fc&d by L 1 verpooI supporters,   many

         of whom asked me for a IJlc k e t .    I had to walk down the centre

         of the road to reacm t/e Leppings Ln entrance.           Near the

         turnstile area I noticed a policeman and policewoman each on
                                                                        page:
                                                                        D349

h o r se ba ck .   As I approached the policeman he shouted to the

Liverpool fans massing           in Leppings Ln,    “Come on you lot,   it's

Z o ’clock,        time you were   in the g rou nd .11   None of them moved,

presumably because they d i d n ’t have tickets.             I then entered

the ground.          The mood of the Liverpool      fans in Leppings Ln was

boisterous to the extent that 1 felt somewhat uneasy walking

through them.

At the same match last year,            people were being asked by the

police in the area near the traffic             lights I have described

above    if they had tickets.         I am also    pretty sure there

was some form of barrier across Leppings Ln at the traffic-

lights.       This year there was no check on tickets at this

location or a barrier.             I was only asked for my ticket at a

barrier near the turnstiles to allow me access to the rear of

the South Stand.                                 (sgd) 8 W Longworth

£   (320.    COULD YOU SEE CLEARLY THE STANDING AREA IN FRONT OF THE WEST

             STAND?



             Yes.



    G21.     DID YOU SEE ANY INCIDENT IN THAT STANDING AREA WHICH YOU

             BELIEVE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DISASTER?



             When match started a lot of the play was aJ^-tTte Leppings Ln

             end.     I saw a number of waye-1 ike lavements of the fans on
                                                                               PAGE   6

        the terrace behind      the goal.    The terrace     was packed, but at

        capacity crowd matches such movements are            commonplace and    I

        thought n o t h i n g i t    at the time.    {vJo^             ■



G22.    DO YOU KNOW IF YOU      SAW ANYTHING WHICH YOU       BELIEVE WAS DIRECTLY

        CONCERNED WITH T H E    BREAKING OF A BARRIER IN PEN 3?



        No,    it was   impossible on such a congested terrace to see any of

        the crush barriers.



Q23.    WHAT TIME DID YOU TAKE UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POSITION?



        About 2.30 pm ( 1430).



(324«   DID YOU SEE ANY UNUSUAL CROWD SURGE IN EITHER PEN 3 OR PEN 4 OR

        BOTH?    IF SO, DO YOU KNOW THE CAUSE AND WHAT TIME DID IT OCCUR?



        Nothing more than I have described at item 21 other than there

        seemed more qeneral         crowd movement   in pen 3.



(323.   AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT,         CAN YOU SAY IF YOU WITNESSED THE

        DEATH OF ANY PERSON?




•326.   DID YOU ASSIST ANY OF THE DECEASED?            BRIELFY EXPLAIN.

         No .



G28•     DID YOU WITNESS ANY ACT SY SUPPORTERS WHICH OBSTRUCTED EITHER

         POLICE, STEWARDS OR MEDICAL           PERSONS AT THE TIME OF              THE DISASTER?



         No .



Q29.     HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE

         OFFICERS AT THE TIME OF THE           DISASTER?



         I was surprised that having           a video camera           on the back of the

         Leppings Ln stand that the build-up and crush at the

         turnstiles was not identified quickly and police reinfor cements

         deploy e d t o d e a I wit h it ..   T h e 1a rg e n u m fae r o f s u p po rt e rs

         outside the Leppings Ln entrance was evidence at least an hour

         No «



Q3"I .   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OTHER

         PERSON IN AUTHORITY AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



         The crowd should have been kept informed of what was happening.

         There was obviously a serious            incident but no public

         announcement was made for about an hour.                    If some form of

         info rmat ion had been given about the seriousness of what had
                                                                     PAGE

         happened it would have prevented some of the rival fans

         baiting each other.



<332.    WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY THREATS OR VIOLENCE?



         No „



<333.    DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL ACT

         BY ANY PERSON?



         No.



<334 „   HAVE YOU BEEN PRESENT AT, OR HAD EXPERIENCE OF ANY OTHER

         FOOTBALL TRAGEDY?     (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



         No   .


(335.    IF YOU ATTENDED LAST YEARS SIMILAR MATCH WAS THERE ANYTHING

         SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK    IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR

         TO THIS DISASTER?     (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



         See rear blank: page. ?



<336.    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FANS IN THE

         STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?



         If there was no option but to have opened the gate near the

         turnstiles to relieve the crush outside,   why was the

         entrance to the tunnel    leading to pens 3 & 4 not closed or

         stewarded with fans being directed to the wing terrace
                                                                                                                                   PAGE

         Q37.      DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

                   FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



                   There seemed to have been some delay before ambulances started

                   arriving.          The first ambulance was from the St Johns and came

                   onto the pitch about                    15 minutes after the game was stopped.



         G38.    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL.

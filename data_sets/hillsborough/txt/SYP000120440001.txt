           2.40pm        <1440)    About    2.40pm            on S a t u r d a y      15th     (1 5 0 4 8 9 )    April       1989      I was

                                   to a t t e n d     the L e p p i n g s        Lane      e n d of     the      rear      of    the     North

                                   Once    at    that         location          in    company with              other      C & V

                                   officers         I could          see    that        several       fans       were      climbing          the

                                   walls    in b e t w e e n         the    North        and     West     Stand        sections.

                                   Myself       and      other       officers           received        numerous           complaints

                                   fram    fans       who      were      entering          the    ground         through         the

                                   turnstiles            to    the      effect        that     people       outside          attempting

to    enter       the     ground             were    being          crushed.           1 could         see

through       the        s m a ll       window       in the          concertina-type                 gate       at

this       location,           that          people       outside          the    ground           were    in

some       considerable                 distress.              People       on the           other     side      of

the    gates       began           hammering          frantically                on    them and were

repeatedly             attempting              to    forcibly             open    them.            Fans

entering          the     ground             were    by    this       t i me     complaining

hysterically              at       officers          on    the       inside       of     the       gates,

demanding          for        them       to    be    opened.              Numerous           fans    were       of

the    opinion           that       people          outside          would       be    killed?         unless

the    gate       wa s    opened.              PS Higgins             then asked              match       control

for    permission              to       open       these       North       Stand       gates,        w h i c h was

granted.           When        the       gates       were       opened         by a s t e w a r d         some       3

or    4 hundres           fans          stampeded          into       the      ground         into     the      area

behind       the N o r t h          Stand.           I went          through          the     gates       and

could       see    that        the       situation             outside         had     eased        with     about

Z hundred          waiting              outside.           A    short       t im e     later        all

officers          received              the    message          to a t t e n d        th e    perimeter

track.        I immediatley                    ran    inside          the      ground         and

subsequently              on       the       pitch with             other      C & V         officers.           At

this       time    I could              see    that       numerous          Liverpool              fans    were

already       on       the     perimeter             track          and    pitch,        some       of w h o m

appeared          to     be    injured.              1 could          see      fans      climbing          over

the    fencing           behind          the       goal,       and    also       fans        were    being

pulled       from        the       b ac k     of    the    terraces            and     up     into     the

seated       compound.                  At    this    time          officers          were     being

organised          into        a    cordon          some       20 yards          from        the    Liverpool

end with          a view           to    preventing             a    potentially              serious

public       order        situation,                which       it a p p e a r e d       to    be at       this

Taunts       were       coming       from     the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t        crowd which

were    obviously             intimidating            the    Liverpool           fans       who    were

now    flooding          onto       the    pitch.



After      several        minutes          X received          reports          from     fans      and

other      officers           to    the    effect      that       people        were     being

seriously          hurt       in the       Liverpool         Stand.         I then          left       the

cordon       and went          to    the    area      around        the    goal       mouth       where       I

assisted          fans a n d        other     officers         who       were    ripping          apart

the    the    advertising             boards         for    use     as    stretchers.              I

could      see     a number          of    people      lying        on    the    ground         being

tended       to    by o t h e r      officers,         ambulancemen              and     firemen,,

It w a s     apparant          at    this     time     that       some     of    the     people

being      put     on    to    the    makeshift            stretchers           were     dead.

L i v e r poo 1 fa n s        on    the    pi t ch w e r e     becoming          increasi ngly

agitated          at    the    chants       coming         from     the N o t t i n g h a m       Forest

end and       a    large       number       began      to    run     towards          t ha t    end,

many    of    them       shouting          and    screaming          hysteri c a l l y .           I ran

back    towards          the       Nottingham Forest                end    of    the     pitch,         all

the    time       attempting          to    calm      hysterical           fans,       together

with    numerous          other       officers.




A   large     number          of    officers         lined     up    near       to    the

Nottingham Forest                   end    and    together          began       to    walk      back

towards       the       Liverpool          end,      sweeping        the    angered            fans

towards       the W e s t          Stand.        After      this     I once          again      went

towards       th e      West       Stand    g o al   a r ea,      to a s s i s t      regarding

carriage          of    the    injured.

(*D * C & V?)             left    the       pitch      at    this     time    and       got     into      a

police        transit       on L e p p i n g s      L a ne.     We      then attended                 in the

At    the     time    I left          the    ground         I had     no    idea       of    the

7. Meeting with Trustee of Hillsborough
   Disaster Trust Fund
  The Working Party considered information submitted
  regarding a meeting held on 28th September, 1994 between
  representatives of the Working Party and a Trustee and the
  Trust Fund Manager of the Disaster Appeal fund at which it
  was indicated that following recent commitments made by the
  Trustees there was a balance of only £2,000 remaining in
  the Charitable Fund and a nil balance in the Discretionary
  Fund and that therefore it was unlikely that any
  suggestions for further financial assistance by the City
  Council on behalf of bereaved families and survivors could
  be supported.

       take place to discuss matters arising from the meeting
       with the Trustee, the Chief Executive be requested to

           Further Education bursaries within the area of the

DOC”. P.HQNE IN OS SUNDAY 23rd OCTOBER 1994 - IIT RESPONSE TO CALL MADE
CRITICISING THE COMMENTS OF BRIAN CLOUGH RE;.-HILLSBORQUQH DISASTE 2.

IF YOU CAN REMEMBER HILLSBOROUGH AND THE SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF IT THERE
WERE SCENES OF BEHAVIOUR THAT WERE AT BEST IRRESPONSIBLE. IT WAS WITHIN
STRIKING DISTANCE OF HEYSEL WHICH WAS A DISGRACEFUL EPISODE AND YOU KNOW
THAT OUR DEPARTED PRIME MINISTER MRS. THATCHER WAS MUCH EXORCISED BY IT-
NOT SAYING THATS A RECOMMENDATION IN ITSELF- BUT THE FEELING ABROARD ON
ONE HAND WAS THAT FOOTBALL HOOLIGANS AS A SPECIES WERE A DISGRACE AND
ALMOST THAT FOOTBALL FANS AS A SPECIES WERE A DISGRACE - I THINK THATS
THE CROSSOVER THAT WAS MADE AND THERE WERE DRACONIAN MEASURES
INTRODUCED.
PEOPLE SAID THE TAYLOR REPORT WAS MORE TO DO WITH MAKING PEOPLE BEHAVE
THEMSELVES THAN WITH GUARANTEEING SAFETY. YOU'D ALSO THINK THAT THERE
WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE DRUNK AND BEHAVING RIDICULOUSLY AT HILLSBOROUGH AND
ITS NOT UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT AFTER HEYSEL THEY SHOULD HAVE LEARNED
THAT THERE IS A WAY TO BEHAVE FOR THEIR OWN IMAGE AND ALSO BECAUSE WELL
FOR THE REASON YOU DON'T NEED ME TO POINT OUT - FOR THEIR OWN SAFETY -
AND SOMEHOW THE TWO BECAME MERGED AND THE PEOPLE AND FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS
OF LIVERPOOL BEGAN TO BE PORTRAYED AS PEOPLE WHO WERE THE VICTIMS OF
UNCALLED FOR SUFFERING
THE PEOPLE AT THE FRONT OF THAT STAND MOST DEFINATELY WERE - CERTAINLY
WERE (SUFFERING) - THE PEOPLE AT THE BACK GETTING INTO THE LEPPINGS LANE
STAND, MAYBE BRIAN CLOUGH'S DESCRIPTION OF THESE PEOPLE MAY BE NEARER
THE MARK THAN PEOPLE LIKE TO ADMIT.
CALLER INTERVENES- The Police lost control of situation. I don't think
they helped matters. Its too late to go through recriminations. People
died so is it really right to bring it back up again?
WELL I DON'T THINK WHAT BRIAN CLOUGH SAID IN ANY WAY DETRACTS FROM
SYMPATHY FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIED, THE PEOPLE WHO DIED AS WERE POINTED
OUT WERE THE PEOPLE WHO GOT THESE INGOOD TIME, IN GOOD ORDER AND TOOK
THEIR PLACE ON THE TERRACES AND WERE       WELL BEHAVED,     IT WAS THE LATECOMERS
AND I'LL PUT IT IN A LANGUAGE NO STRONGER THAN THIS - IT WAS THE
LATECOMERS WHO CAUSED THE PROBLEM.
TOMMY DQCHERTY INTERVENES - The distribution of tickets that was
questioned
OH YEAH, YEAH, MANY, MANY FAULTS EMERGED BUT WHAT DISTURBS ME WAS THAT
SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO DID BEHAVE IN A STUPID FASHION AT HILLSBOROUGH
SOMEHOW GOT SOME OF THE SYMPATHY WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN RESERVED FOR FOR
THE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T - WHO WERE THE VICTIMS.
DOCHESTY - The Heysel thing as well. The carry on at Heysel in the
European Cup Final Jim - I mean the Liverpool supporters got the total
blame for that yet the Juventus supporters on that particular day were
worse than anyone.
YES, QUITE, EQUALLY THERE WERE TWO PARTIES TO BLAME THERE.
JOINT STATEMENT FROM COUNCILLOR JACK SPRIGGS, COUNCILLOR PETER
MILLEA AND COUNCILLOR JACKIE MCCARTHY ON BEHALF OF THE
HILLSBOROUGH WORKING PARTY

We unreservedly condemn the reported comments of Mr. Brian Clough
blaming Liverpool supporters for causing the Hillsborough tragedy
as revealing his total and pitiful factual ignorance of the real
causes of the Disaster which were the comprehensive failure of the
Police control operation on the day allied to wider organisational
failures by those responsible for staging the semi-final.
We deplore the cynical attempt by the publishers of the
autobiography of Mr. Clough to exploit the disaster to gain free
publicity in advance of publication;
In the light of the recent statement of the Secretary of State for
National Heritage recognising the extensive nature of the Judicial
Inquiry and concluding that "this vast store of evidence was
carefully sifted, we think it is fair to say that Lord Justice
Taylor's Interim Report gives a very clear picture of events on
the day."
We are concerned that
     (i) five years after the Disaster and the unequivocal
          judgement of Lord Justice Taylor detailing its causes
          there continues to be a movement among journalists such
          as Sir Bernard Ingham, now supported by Mr. Clough, to
          "re-write" the Taylor report by recycling discredited
          theories which blame the Liverpool fans for the
          Disaster; and
     (ii) this determination by some to avoid the true lessons of
          Hillsborough suggests that some of the contempt for
          supporters and the complacency, ignorance and neglect
          which led to the Disaster may still be in place and
          could yet lead to another tragedy;
We refute the specific content of the "opinion" of Mr. Clough as
being fundamentally flawed and inaccurate particularly given the
clearly established transportation problems faced by Liverpool
supporters on the day, and also given that only approximately one
third of the number of turnstiles allocated for Nottingham Forest
fans were made available for the access into the Stadium of a
similar number of Liverpool supporters;
We demand that in the light of the above, the fact that Mr. Clough
was not either a personal participant in or witness to events
outside or inside the Leppings Lane Terrace and in noting his
longstanding commercial allegiance to the "Sun" newspaper Mr.
Clough either state the factual evidence he has gathered to
support his "opinion" and reveal the source of this evidence or he
retract his comments forthwith and apologises to the bereaved
families and survivors of Hillsborough and to all football
supporters for the offence he has caused.

gmc/docs/hills pr
In the event that no retraction, amendment or apology is received
we urge
      (i) w M p bookstores to decline to place the book on sale
           in recognition of the very grave offence which has been
           caused to the people of the region: and
     (ii) all football supporters nationally, but particularly
           followers of Nottingham Forest, not to purchase the book
           in recognition of the fact that given the circumstances
           of the tragedy any supporter could have been its victim
           and that therefore Mr. Clough's "slur" is against all
           football fans and not just those from Merseyside.

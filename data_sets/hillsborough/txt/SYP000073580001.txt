              My name is                     and I live at the above address with my parents

               and have done for 10 years now.          I am employed as a Civil Servant and

               have worked for the Department of                    and Social Security for five

               years and work from               _______

               I am a Liverpool     s i ^ o r t e r ' and have been all my life attending the

               matches since I was 8 years old, mainly attending the home matches

               only.

               On Saturday 15th Apri^/^989 I attended the S h e f f i e ^ / ^ e d n e s d a y

               football g/fcund travelling down by 27 seater coach with an

               independently organised group of friends.             I bought my £6.00 ticket for

               the Leppings Lane terraces through the voucher system at Anfield,

               being a season ticket holder. The coach was hired from Balmoral

               coaches of Prescott Road, Liverpool and we left Liverpool at about ten

o'clock and arrived at Sheffield at twelve o ’clock, having encountered

a five minute delay, when we were stopped by^Police who were checking

for alcohol,   but none were present. We also stopped at a place          called

Chapelt/5wn at a public house the Car ou<*rf,, I think.        Inside I saw both

sets of supporters drinking alcohol        but none appeared drunk.

In Sheffield we parked on Penistone Road North,           about ten minutes walk

from the ground. We weren't escorted from the coach to the ground by

police and nor did we receive any directions.           I ha     ended

H i-llsborough^a.t         for the _s           nal and knew roughly where to go

anyway. On the way down to the ground I d i d n ’t see any drunkeness or

past t w o .

people                                  ned.    I saw no stewards outside the

gates and only one or two mounted police,           but they didn't appear to be

in control and at one stage a lone mounted police officer moved his

horse from the proximity of the turnstiles away and towards the gates.

The   crowd was very light outside the turnstiles and we eventually got

through,   handing my ticket   in. On the other side I waited for my mates

to group together again and saw some police in small groups standing

inside.    I approached them and pointed out rather heatedly the

situation outside. They said they would do something about            it but

before I saw them do anything I saw them pointing towards some people

who had managed      to climb over the turnstile building.       They were then

stood on top of the turnstiles and showing the officers their tickets,

but the officers were insisting they got down,           back over the fence.

tunnel was comparatively free and unobstructed. As we entered into the

pen, I moved to the right h^nd pen and moved into the centre area of

into the same pen with me and went down to the front of the standing

The atmosphere at the time of taking up my match viewyrKj point was as

per a normal football match in the Hop, <£>thout severe crushing and

the time must have been about ten to J f h r e e .   At about five

when the players came o n , tly /'crowd suddenly got very excited and the

crushing
             , S o €=L          CnoCicJ
             came e x c e s s i v e / r o m all sides. My arms were pinned closely

to my sides and I found it impossible to raise them up. At the same

time I was finding it more and more difficult to breathe normally and

I suddenly became concerned for my own safety and the safety of

everyone around me. People were starting to scream and shout around

me, myself   included,   shouting for people to try and move back or push

back and other people shouting for the gate at the front of the pen to

be opened to allow an overspill.       It was obvious that there were

much too many people     in the pen and this was causing the crushing etc.

The general atmosphere     in the pen was of sheer      panic,   people still

screaming and shouting, and it wasn't until after about ten to fifteen

minutes that the pressure                             ly 11v xy f probably

climbing the f e n c f at the front and over to the right hand side of me,

which I had been moved closer to by the movement of the crowd. The

slight reduction in pressure allowed me and                to start moving

backwards towards the wall at the back of the pen. moving through

people as wty did so. When we managed to get there,         I y a s able to turn

stood on the seats to have a look at the incident. On the pitch I

could see hundreds of people milling about and numerous        persons on the

ground being resusitated by other fans or police. The sight was too

much for me to take in and was very distressing.       I subsequently sat

down to avoid watching any more and having later heard             enny

              nnouncement    left the ground ten to fifteen minutes      later

leaving through the back of the West stand with              ind a few

friends    I had met there

I w a s n ’t aware of any injuries at the time and d i d n ’t attend a

hospital    in Sheffield. On Sunday




If I can just correct something       I said earlier, we arrived, in

Sheffield at about twenty past two not twelve o ’clock.

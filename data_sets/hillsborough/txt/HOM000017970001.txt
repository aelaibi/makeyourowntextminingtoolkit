       Dear Sir,
       Re:- Football Stadia - Safety
       We wish to advise and assist the Government regarding the design and safety
       of the Public in the use of stadia. We believe our international worldwide
       experience and knowledge may be invaluable to help to reduce and avoid
       future problems.
       We have a track record of the development and project management of many
       American sport stadia including an involvement with 1984 and 1992 Olympics
       facilities.   Our knowledge and work covers the wider aspects of design
       where layout, access and egress, land usage etc. are all matters that have
       to be carefully considered. It is to be noted that during the past ten to
       fifteen years, mass attendance events such as professional sports, popular
       music concerts and exhibitions have been developed to a point where they
       may be considered a mature industry.
       I shall be pleased to hear from you if you consider it is of value for us
       to impart this knowledge.
        Yours faithfully

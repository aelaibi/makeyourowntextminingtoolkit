  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re

     on drugs.

     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, itis
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:

     care/self-neglect').

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one

     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the resultof an accident/misadventure.

     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide

)   Dear Sirs,

    Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


    If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
    of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
    on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
    due course.

    I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
    evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
    coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
    inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

    Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
    under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
    witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
    this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

    Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
    to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
    aPPropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
    consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

    May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
    attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

    I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
    names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
    to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

    I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
    heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
    submit.                   ^ —

    yours faithfully,

^         Sirs,

                               f


As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
1ms decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours/faathfully,                                      _

Re: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - BODY FILES.


As agreed with Mervyn Jones, I am contacting you in connection
with any detailed amendments which I think perhaps should be
made to the files.

I have already mentioned to Inspector Tobe that the summaries
are fine, my only reservation being because they are in the
third person and do not contain quotes may give rise to perhaps
some extra questions from solicitors. However, as the format
Viaif? already been settled, and I believe that the majority of
cases have already been drafted, I do not think that there is
very much we can do about it at this stage.

 I have now managed to read through several files and would
 like to draw the following points to your attentions-

 Deceased Reference No.2. Inger Shah.                        x

 On the summary sheet at the front of the file, I notice that
 the next of kin are given as                 ^ sister. I think
 strictly speaking, the next of kin are the children. I wonder
 whether we ought to, in this particular case, put the children
 in brackets against next of kin. On the summary sheet paragraph
 4, I -Mrinie it might perhaps be a good idea to add a sentence
 to the effect that Gary Oyitech saw Inger Shah within the Pen
 after a final search and formed the impression that she was
 obviously dead (Page 24).

 With regard to the time of death (referred to in the outlined
 summary sheet and also in the summary itself at Paragraph 8)where
 there is a specific time of 1555 hours given, I cannot find the
 evidence for this as Dr. Ball merely seems to say that he
 certified various people between 1550 and 1650 hours.

  There may be some simple explanation for this but I think
  it may be wiser to give the time bracket, unless there is evidence
  from say a police officer (as there is in one or two of the other
  cases) where a specific time is actually mentioned.
                                                                                        cont'd

There are one or two other points in some of the statements, at
least in one of the statements which I do not find quite right,
bat they are not relevant as far as these Inquests are concerned
so I will not refer to them.




For the next few days I will not be at the Medico-Legal Centre
but you will be able to contact me at my home where I will be
a good bit of the time. ]


Yours sincerely,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

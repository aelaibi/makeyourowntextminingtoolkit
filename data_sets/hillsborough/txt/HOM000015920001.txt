Now that the oral hearing stage of the Public Inquiry has been
completed, on behalf of my own Team I would like to thank you for the
tremendous contribution which    (as was   fully acknowledged by all
concerned at the final day on Friday 14th   July) you and all your Team
made to this Inquiry and for all the assistance and co-operation which
you provided    in the course    of the Inquiry to my own Team.

It is clearly no exaggeration to say that, without the comprehensive
investigation undertaken by the West Midlands Police, we would never
have been able to start the oral hearing stage so soon (one month
after the disaster) nor complete the presentation of the oral evidence
to the Inquiry so quickly (within virtually three months to the day of
the disaster).    The evidence-gathering exercise undertaken by your
Investigation Team was thus obviously crucial to achieving Sir Peter
Taylor's twin objectives of a speedy but thorough Inquiry, and I think
it is a great tribute to your Team that we managed to meet these
objectives.

The scale of the task facing your Team was undoubtedly a daunting one
and, if I may say so, I consider that they discharged it extremely
effectively.  We obviously placed great demands on your Team, and they
invariably   responded swiftly,    and with unfailing courtesy     and
cheerfulness, to all the various requests that we made throughout the
Inquiry.

As far as I am concerned, a very good spirit of co-operation prevailed
throughout, and I am very grateful to you and your Team for this.    It
is always invidious, of course, to mention names, but our special
thanks must go to Chief Inspector Nick Dickerson at the Inquiry,
Detective Chief Superintendent    Mick Foster at Nechells Green    and
Inspector Malcolm Ross and Sergeant Gary Wright at Furnival House, and
last but by no means least to yourself and Geoffrey Dear.

Finally, I think I can speak for all of my colleagues when I say that
we found this experience of working with the Police a most stimulating
    one.   I think we all learned a lot from it.    I would very much
hope that our experience could serve as a model for any such future
"joint ventures"!   Speaking for myself, it was a great pleasure to
work with you personally, and I am grateful to you for all your own
personal assistance and co-operation.

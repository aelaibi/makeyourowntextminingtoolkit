                              CANON LEAGUE DIVISION 1
                          SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY V. CHELSEA
                           SATURDAY, 17TH AUGUST, 1985.

        At the request of The Football Association, I attended the above
f ix tu r e to make a general observation of any possible crowd misconduct.

     I arrived at the ground at 2.00 p.m. There were about 1,000 people
outside the ground and 300 inside the grounds a ll generally well behaved.
      I was welcomed by the Club Secretary, Mr. R.H. Chester, who kindly
gave me a verbal report of the new measures taken by the Club to ensure
the whole ground is covered by c l o s e -c ir c u i t T.V. cameras.  B riefly
there are three cameras        used by the South Yorkshire Police, one on
a flo o d lig h t pylon at the Penistone Road end of the ground which covers
both     the main road and v ic in ity outside the ground and also is able
to turn 360 degrees to cover the inside of the ground and the Spion
Kop.    Another camera is fixed above the main stand which can also turn
360 degrees to cover the whole of the inside of the ground.          A th ird
camera is positioned on the flo o d lig h t pylon at the back of the West
Stand (Leppings Lane end)which is used fo r v is it in g standing spectators.
This camera covers outside the ground and inside the ground as well
as the Leppings Lane standing and seating enclosures.
      The South Yorkshire Police will monitor three screens from a vantage
point     in a corner of the ground.  I understand th a t the pictures will
carry    an automatic date and time stamp and the evidence of the cameras
will be admissable in a court of law should any prosecutions follow
trouble in the ground.
      Inside a control room under the main stand the Club's own in s ta lla tio n
of 14 T.V. screens will cover every entrance to the stadium.                This
system is under the Club's control but Police Officers will s i t in
on match days.         In th i s way, the force will be called in in s ta n tly
at the f i r s t sign of any disturbance.
      In addition to the cameras,                 the Club have in s ta lle d in fra-red
equipment a t all t u r n s t i l e s which will give in s ta n t numbers in every
p art of the ground.      The information will be relayed in s ta n tly to the
control room and the s e c re ta ry 's o f f ic e .
     The ground i s divided into six sections and each section i s covered.
At any time the Club will know exactly the attendance.       When capacity
i s lik e ly to be reached, a warning bell w ill sound and fans can be
directed to le ss crowded areas.
     The system is fu rth er enhanced in th a t the senior match day o f f i c i a l s
will be in contact with each other and with the Club's Headquarters
through w alk ie-talk ie u n its. All problems w ill thus be seen on screen
or relayed by voice.
     On Saturday two of the senior Officers of the Metropolitan Police
attended the match to view the system in s ta lle d .
     I understand from Mr. Chester th a t the to ta l cost of the whole
system was £75,000, of which £25,000 has been funded by The Football
Trust and 75% of the remainder by F.G.I.N.T.
        I had occasion p rio r to the kick-off to v i s i t both the Club control
room and the Police Box. All the systems seemed to be working s a t i s f a c t ­
o r ily .      However, there did appear to be a problem at the v is ito r s end
of the ground by unopened t u r n s t i l e s .  The police were holding groups
of v is it in g spectators in Leppings Lane outside the ground and expressed
concern a t a possible explosive s itu a tio n .

     Whilst I must congratulate the Club on the e f f o r ts th a t they have
achieved to monitor quite so phisticatedly a l l possible crowd control,
a matter of in s u ffic ie n t t u r n s t i l e operators could on occasions prove
disasterous and lead to an explosive s itu a tio n .

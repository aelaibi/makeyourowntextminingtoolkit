                                                                    cc

MEETING WITH THE FOOTBALL LEAGUE


Sir Terry Burns and I met Mr Sandford, Mr Dent and Mr                                  Whalley        of
the Football League at 4.30pm on Friday, 30 March.


2.      Sir       Terry Burns welcomed the representatives of the Football
League.       He said          that,    since     the    Chancellor            had     met    certain
Football          League       officials     at    the     Zenith        Data        Cup Final last
Sunday, and given that he (Sir                    Terry)    would         be     meeting       League
officials          at    the Football League Cup Final in two or three weeks
time, it would be useful to have a short meeting so that we                                         could
explain       the       thinking       behind the Chancellor's Budget proposal to
reduce the rate of pool betting duty and they                             could        mention        any
points that concerned the Football League.                         He emphasised that the
meeting was in no sense a negotiation.                       The     discussions               on     the
detailed          arrangements         for   implementing         the Chancellor's Budget
proposal were being conducted by the DOE.


3.      I then gave a short account of the thinking that                                lay     behind
the Chancellor's Budget proposal.


4.      Mr        Sandford said that the Football League were very grateful
for the Chancellor's proposal.                    The amount        of      tax       relief        would
represent          a    very     significant       contribution           to      football.           The
Football League were currently trying                       to    quantify            the     cost     of
implementing            the     Taylor recommendations in full.                      It was already
clear that the total cost could be nearer £500 million rather than
£130     million, the amount which had been referred to up to now. In
order        to     reach      agreement     on    the     detailed         arrangements              for
implementing     the     Chancellor's proposal, it would be necessary to
change the existing agreement between the pools companies and                                               the
Football   League       about     who       would        benefit        if        the rate of pool
betting duty     were     reduced.            There       would        also       need           to    be     a
modification     of     the existing agreement on payment for the use by
the pools companies of the fixture list copyright.                                     He        did     not,
however,  think that            these changes would represent a difficulty.
He went on to say:


               the Football League and the                      FA     were        thinking             about
               ways      of      raising            additional           funds              for        ground
               improvements           (eg    by        using     some        of     the           Barclays
               sponsorship        money,          by     a levy on transfer fees or by
               using some of the television money);


               the Football Trust and the Football Ground Improvement
               Trust     were     being        merged,          and     would          be called the
               Football       Trust         1990.        The     Football              League            were
               concerned        about       getting the right representatives on
               the new body's key committees;


               when     talking       with        football           clubs        about           how        to
               implement        the    Taylor          recommendations,                 the Football
            League were encouraging them to take a long run                                             view.
               Doing    the absolute minimum - eg bolting plastic seats
            on crumbling terraces - was not necessarily                                          the     best
            approach for the longer term;


            it        would      be         helpful        if     there       were           an        inter­
            departmental group, with representatives from a number
            of     Government          departments,              to consider the problems
            that        implementing                Taylor        would            involve.                 One
            particular           difficulty             that      needed          to        be        tackled
            concerned the problem of securing planning                                      permission
            for ground improvements;


            there       was a need for some flexibility in interpreting
            the Taylor recommendations,                         though       without              changing
            the       target     dates        of       1994-95        and 1999-2000 for the
                   introduction of all-seater stadia. Taylor                                     recommended
                   that        the         standing        capacity       at grounds              should          be
                   reduced on an annual                    basis.     This would not                  encourage
                   clubs             to     look     for    new     green-field             sites           or    to
                   completely rebuild inadequate stands;


                   the Football Trust would need to exercise                                     the        wisdom
                   of       Solomon when deciding which clubs should be helped
                    financially;


                   the Football League were carrying out a survey of                                             the
                    full costs of implementing the Taylor recommendations.
                   By 31 May they were hoping to receive                               information                on
                    (a)        the        minimum     expenditure required for grounds to
                   become all-seater (b) how much                         clubs        would           like       to
                    spend (realistically) to implement Taylor and (c) what
                   clubs were in fact planning to                          spend           (including            any
                   options under consideration).


5.   Sir        Terry          Burns said that             he took note of these points.                           It
wcrnld be wrong for the Treasury to comment on many of them,                                                  since
they     were primarily the concern of other Departments.                                             He went on
to say that it would be very welcome if football itself could                                                    add
to     the    funds         being         made      available       by     the Chancellor to help
implement the Taylor recommendations.                               The     Chancellor                 had       said
that     he     would          review        the     cut    in pool betting duty after five
years.        In considering whether the cut                        should        be        continued,             he
would obviously want to take account of how much football had done
to help itself, as well as the amount of work                                 still              required          to
implement          Taylor in full.                 He would also want to see how well the
money had been spent over the first                           five        years        -     had        it,       for
example,        led       to     major        improvements          in     spectator              comfort and
safety,       or      had       it        simply     inflated       the     profits              of     building
companies?          In reply to specific points raised by Mr Sandford, Sir
Terry confirmed that the Chancellor intended that the whole of the
benefit to the pool promoters of the 2.5% reduction in the rate of
pool betting duty should go to the Football                                 Trust           and        not       just
that     part       of      the reduction that related to English and Scottish
football fixtures.                   It was not a requirement that                         all        the     money
received     by   the   Football Trust in-year should be spent the same
year: any surplus could be carried over       and   used    the    following
year.      The story in that morning's Times was a little misleading:
it was not the Chancellor's view that Football Trust money            should
only    go on new stands and arenas.     The point was simply that this
sort of new build should be eligible for support as         well    as   the
upgrading of existing stands and terraces.

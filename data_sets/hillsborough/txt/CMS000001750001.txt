                                                                         .3 5 'r.l 'f.'. f.2:.2.


               I attach within a note (document      ) summarising the results of
               our enquiries of local authorities following up the Interim Report.
               Annotated questionnaires are in the pouch attached to the file.
               It is perhaps timely to consider what, if any, further action
               should now be taken.

               Only Twerton Park has apparently not been the subject of an
               enforced reduction in capacity. The decision not to apply a 15%
               cut was taken by council members and cannot therefore be altered
               by officials of the council.     Informal contact suggest/that the
               relevant council members are not too concerned about Home Office
               views. If we are to take action at all we shall have to write to
               the Chief Executive.     Bristol Rovers who use Twerton Park are
               currently having a run of success in Division 3 of the football
               league.   Attendances seem to be hovering around the 5,000 mark;
               from what I was told local authority officials regularly attend the
               ground and monitor the arrangements there. On balance I think we
               should write both to the local authority and the club to press for
               what, on the face of it, might well be no more than a paper
               reduction. We might also write to both the Football Association
               and the Football League for them to use their influence. Drafts
               are within for consideration.
               The two other main areas of difficulty seem to be the opening of
               pitch perimeter gates and monitoring of turnstile flow rates.
               I suspect that the Inquiry would have already have noted that not
               all pitch gates are left open in the course of a match.       But a
               commonsense approach is, I think, needed:     not all grounds will
               always be densely packed, not all pitch fences are 8 feet high and
               if the police perceive trouble in the making it is awkward for the
               Home Office to insist on keeping pitch gates open.          As for
               turnstile flow rates, where difficulties have occurred they have
               been primarily at clubs in the lower divisions              (except
               Middlesbrough and Barnsley who are both in Division 2) . The local
               authorities in question are however alert to the problems. I think
               it   might   be   worth   a   telephone   reminder    to   Barnsley
               Middlesbrough/Hartlepool and also to Scarborough to keep up the
               pressure on the local authorities in question.         I would not
               advocate a formal written approach.
               My feeling is that where other difficulties have arisen, such as
               the absence of suitable cutting gear at Manchester United, there
               is little point in pressing for further action.   The impression
               gained is that the local authorities and/or police and emergency
               services are well versed with the problems and have taken or are
               taking such action as is possible to improve the safety
               arrangements.
               Further Action

               Fixtures over Christmas and New Year tend to attract larger than
               normal crowds.   The early stages of the FA Cup are now with us.
               This means that grounds not normally crowded are likely to be
               filled to capacity - probably for one fixture only.     Non-league
               football grounds may be also affected.    I think therefore it is
               opportune to perhaps remind the soccer world and local authorities
               for the need to maintain vigilance, to look out for "attractive"
               matches and ensure that safety limits are not broken. We might


CODE   18-77
also thank local authorities etc for the efforts taken so far and
remind them of the need to ensure compliance with the Inquiry's
recommendations.     I have prepared a draft circular for
consideration together with a draft letter to football clubs. If
we are to proceed in this way we need to issue the circular and
letters fairly soon. If it is agreed to so proceed I will draw up
a submission for Ministers.

?        1. Write to Avon County Council, Bath City and Bristol Rovers
         Football Clubs as within; and write to the Football League and
         Football Association as within;
         2. Follow up the isolated turnstile flow rate difficulties
         mentioned above by telephone;
    *     3.   Issue a reminder circular to local authorities as within;
         4.    Write to football clubs as within.

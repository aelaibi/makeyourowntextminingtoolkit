               I am a single man and            reside          the above address with my                     parent

               away,    mainly home matches.

               I obtained a ticket           for   the semi         final     football       m at ch between

               Liverpool     and Notts Forest           from Anfi el d

               were also        in the van.

               On the morning        of the m a t c h we all met at about                    11 am     (1100)      outside

               the Pheoni        Public House,         Beanf ield Ave,            Cor ly.        We stop pe d once on

               route    to S h e f f i e l d and were    not subject            to any traffic           delays.      We
                                                                                                      PAGE       2

a r r i v e d in S h e f f ie l d at about    12.30      pm <1230)         and    parked the van         in

a side street about           four miles from the ground.                        I had been to the

ground once before at the same game                      in 1988.

I knew that        some    friends were       travelling        to the game          from B ou rn m ou t h

and    I together with some              of the friends went              to the L ep pi ng s Lane

area    to try and find them.               I could not find them a nd then went                       to a

chip shop and        then to a couple            of pubs for a drink               I dayftat k now the

names of the        pubs.

At about 2.30        om    (1430)                                                                        ^nd

myself    left the        public house  together.   We/all had tickets for the
                                              ,/    /   t
Le ppings Lane       terrace    the yothere who h^ia t ravelled to the ground in

the    van had tickets        for sweats in the/Notts Forest                      end.

We got to the L e p p i n g ^ L a n e       area of the ground at a b o u t twenty to

three    (1440)    and say thousands             of    people a ll trying           to get      into the

ground.      There wer/e no queues            just a mass           of    people.        I saw m o u n t e d

Police at the fYisnt of the                crowd near        the turnstiles,             they were

telling     people    to move       back but      it was      not    possible       because       of the

crowd.

We all    joined     the    crowd a nd made           our way towards            the turnstiles.            We

were    pushed a ro u nd and        crushed s li ghtly but all               kept    together.         It ^is

about    twenty minutes        before        I got to the turnstiles,                    I went    thro«

the turnstile a head of nw friends,                     I handed         the stub of my tick

an d kept    the    rest of tine ticket.              Once    inside the others joined me and

made    our way towards/the             tuqnel    w hi ch everyone was making                 for.     I did

not see any signs  j/nforrning me w hich way to go to the terrace.' As l

and people      rushing      througj/.       I did not see who opened the gates                        or

could    I see any P ol i ce m an or Stewards                near these          gates.

We then all        entered the          tunnel and      it a p p e ar e d alright at first             but

b ecause it was getting very crowded.      My friends \y£d gone on

ahead of me and          I thought about            shouting       to them/but        because       of the

noise    I did not.         I made my way to               the side o-T the         tunnel     and made my

way out of the tunnel           towards       the     turnstiles.         As     1 was     going along

the    tunnel    the      crowd were rushing by me t o w a r d /               the ter r a c e .

I made my way out of the t u n n e 1 and turned Vo my right.                                I went

through a gate and stood                 in the e 1 evated /Section of Pen 7 near the

N orth Stand.                                                /

In this section          it was       not    crowded ana you          could stand where you                like.

I stood there          on my own,        the game had been stopped and the                     players had

left the       pitch.

I looked down towards              the      pitch and saw people           lying on the ground and

two    people were       getting       the kiss      of    life.      I saw some       people       coming

through the gates          in the        perimeter        fence    into the      pitch and also

people    climbing       over    the     fence.      I then saw people             being    carried

across    the    pitch on bill           boards and        put    into a mb ul an ce s     on the     pitch

at the Notts Forest             end of the ground.

A man stood near me had a                   radio and      I heard him say he had heard                    on

the    radio    that      people      had died      in the terrace.

I was too far awa y            from the       pitch to      identify any person either                    dead

or    injured,    but    I saw a continual            stream of        people     being     carried

across    the    pitch.        I saw a few Police            but the m aj or it y a p p e ar e d to be

fans who were          doing    the    carrying.

After    I had heard that             people had died            I had had enough and              left    the

ground,    by the L ep pings Lane             end.        I did not see any           injured or dead

people at the          rear of the Leppings Lane S tand just                       crowds    of     people

1eav i ng the ground.            I had not seen my friends                 in the ground a nd              I

thought    that they may have made                  their way to the van.                On the way to

the van    I rang home          from a shop and told my Dad I was O k .

                                                                                                           S3513

            I made my way back to the van and e ve nt u al l y they all                        turned up

            safely.         I think    it was       now about       five   ociock   (1700).     I remember

            sitting        in the    van   listening        to Sports Report.         On   listening   to this

            programme        I realised how bad the                incident was.

            After    some     time we made          our way home arriving           home about S. 30 pm

            (2030).

            Whe n   I a t te n de d the same         game    in 1988 1 w^s stopped in L ep pi ng s Lane

            some    distance        from the ground,             near a garage,     and my ticket was

            checked.         This year       there was none          of this you were all a l lo w ed to

            walk    up to the        ground without          being    checked.

            Because        of the    large    support,       thart follows Liverpool          I think that    they

            should have        been a ll o ca t ed the/Kop e n d , it a p p ea r ed to be very             crowded

            in Pens 3 and 4 last year.

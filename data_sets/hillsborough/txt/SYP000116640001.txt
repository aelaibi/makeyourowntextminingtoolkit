positioned             on       th e     road         there      was         a       constant            stream        of    spectators

passing          us,       the     majority              of          which            went d o w n L e p p i n g s Lane,                 however?

several          f an s     from Liverpool                           came            up    to us            and asked          for      directions

to    the B e e h i v e           Public           House,        I do            not        know where             this      pu b       is

h o w e v e r , and         could           not       tell     them.

Numerous          fans          c a me      by     us    drinking,                   these         being        L i v e r p o o l fans,

identified             by       scarves,              shirts         and         accents,              from      cans       of    beer        and

carrying          full          cans,         as      well     as        a    lot         that        had    obviously            been        drinking

and       it w a s     obvious              to me        that        a       large         amount           were    drunk         but        it w a s

pointless             as    far        as     I could                see         to       t r y to          stop    thesepeople               going        to

the       g r o u n d as        there         were       just        too         many            of         them.        Th e f a n s    as     a whole

were       very       boisterous                 and     a    lot        were         shouting,              but     1 would            not    say

they       were       at    this         point          aggressive                   or     threatening,               more       highly

emotional.                 1 lost           count        of    the           number             of L i v e r p o o l      fans      that        came       by

asking         if a n y o n e          had       spare        tickets,                and        I did       see    on e     man        sell     two

t ickets         to    fans        for           25     each.

As    the      time        go t    towards              2.55pm           the          stream           of    fans      died       d o w n a n d it

was       around       t h is      time          I realised                  from what                was    be i ng     said       over       the

radio        that      there           wa s      a serious               problem             at       the L e p p i n g s        Lane        entrance.

At    about       2 . 5 5 pm m y s e l f              and     the        rest         of     the       serial       began walking                    to

the       Leppings          Lane         entrance             along          Leppings                 Lan e ,    whilst          walking         1

could        hear      messages               on      the     rad i o ,          a        lot     of w h i c h      I can't remember,

however          so m e     have         stuck          in m y m i n d ,                  these       were about            the o p e n i n g         of

a gate        and      I heard              someone           sa y       that         if     the       gate was          not      open        then

people        would         be     killed             outside            the         ground,           also      1 remember              somebody

asking        for      Gate       A      to      be     o p e n e d as p e o p l e w e r e                   getting         crushed           outside

and       also    c a l ls        that        the       fans      w e r e t r y i n g to                tear       the    gates         down        at

the       turnstiles.

As    a    result          of     the       radio        message             m y s e l f .and s e r i a l              3(3 w e n t       straight

fans     outside             th e    ground.             Together           with       other       serials          we    cleared

people        from       the        area     at     the    entrance              and    waited,          it w a s        then       that       1

heard a         call         that     an ambulance                was       needed          urgently          at    the    Leppings

Lane     entrance.

1 remained              outside           the      ground       u n t i 1 the          arrival          of    the    ambulance

which went              to    outside           Gate      B.      As    I watched             the       ambulance          two

casualties              were        carried         out    of G a t e        B to       the       rear       of    the    ambulance,

it w a s      at     this         point      when        X started           to    realise          th e      gravity          of    the

si t u a t i o n .

On   seeing          these          casualties            I entered              the    ground with                the    remainder                of

my   serial          through          Gate         B , on g e t t i n g          through          the    gate       there       were

bodies        s t r e w n al l        around          which       were       being          attended          to    by P o l i c e

Officers           and       f ans,       all      of w h i c h      were        trying       to a d m i n i s t e r       first          aid.

On   looking            at    th e    bodies          from      their        colour          and    appearance             it was

obvious         some         were     d e a d a n d as          there        were       enough          people       seeing          to

these      bodies            I went        through         the       tunnel        and       into       the a r e a       behind          the

g oal.        J. h a d       at     this     p oint       no    idea        of    the       whereabouts             of    the       o t h er

members         of m y        serial.

On   entering            the        goal     enclosure            1 passed             through a             lot    of    fans       and

went     to     the      f ro n t ,       n e ar    to    the     perimeter             fence       referring             to    the       map

point      3,      I was          there      faced with what                     I can       only       describe          as    a    pile

of   bodies          against-         th e      fence      with        several          Police          Officers          and       fans

trying        to     pull         people        from      the     pile,          I went       and       joined       these          in

pulling         people            from     this       pile      and     passing             the    bodies          through          to    other

officers           on    the        pitch       behind         the     goal       this       being       done       through a

hole     in the          perimeter              fence      near        to    the       separating             fence       between

areas      3 and         4 on        the     map.         As    the     pile       grew       smaller             there    was       not

enough        room       for        all    the      officers           to    get       to    the    bodies          and    1 went

were     passed          through           and      placed        them       on    the       pitch.          As     soon       as    I

'   placed        each      body      dow n ,     someone            be    it a P o l i c e            Officer        or m e m b e r       of

    public,        was      attempting            to a d m i n i s t e r         first           aid and        I went        back     for

    another        body.

    As    all     bodies        had       been     removed           from       behind           the    goal     enclosure           I began

    helping        carry        bodies          both     on     stretchers                and advertising                boards        to       the

    gyrnnas i urn a r e a .

    Throughout            all     this      there        wa s    a    lot       of       hostility           from     the     members           of

    the    crowd,         both       directed          at m y s e l f       and          the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

    supporters.                Whilst       several           members           of       the     crowd       did assist         me     in the

    things        I was        attempting           to    do,        I lost          count        of    the     times       I was      called

    a murdering             bastard         and     other        such       insults.                I cannot          remember         a    lot

    of    what     wa s     said      as    I was        more        interested                in t r y i n g    to    help     the        dead

    and    injured.

    When     most      of      the    bodies        had       been        carried           to    the    gymnasium            I joined

    other       members         of    the       Force     in f o r m i n g           a    cordon across               the     middle        of

    the    pitch       to      ensure       the     segregation                 of       the     two    sets     of    fans,        1 do        not

    know who          gave      the       order     for       this        but    as       I was        stood     there        1 was        sure

    there       was    going         to    be    trouble         due       to    the        abuse       and     attitude        of     the

    fans     at    the      pi t c h ,     this     situation was                    diffused           slightly         by a n

    I wa s      still       in the         line     when        the       accouncement                 came     that     the    match

    had    been a b a n d o n ed           a n d at      this,        together              with       the    other      members           of

    my    serial,         who     I had         rejoiced         in the          l i ne        went     back     out     on    to    the

    roundabout            at    Penistone           Road        to    ensure             fans     left       quietly,,         We    stayed

    on    the     roundabout              until     most        fans       had       passed        us    and. t h e n w e n t        to

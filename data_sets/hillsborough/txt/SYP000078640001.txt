At    about        te n    to    thr eexU"ie         pressure          of     the       crowd   seemed       to    build          up a n d

It w a s      increasing              all    the\ime.              I felt         like     1 h ad a s t eel         band a r o u n d

my    chest.            There     was       no    crowdN^urge              in f a c t     there     was     nowhere       for       the

crowd        to    surge.

At    the     time        of    the    crush       I di d       see    bodies           being    carried away            on

advertising               boards.           My    s on    was    also       in the        crowd.         I was     worried

about        him.         I saw       bodies       laid      out      on    the     pitch.        After      the    crush          had

finished           I walked           up a n d U o w n       the      terrace           looking     for m y       son.        I

x ^ a u l d n ’t f in d him.            I then           1 eN?t the      g r o un d .     I c a n ’t        remember what

the    g r o un d .        It w a s     a    good        half    an    hour       back     to   the      car.

When     I was          on the       terraces            I did     not     see a n y t h i n g      at      all    that I

considered              to be a        criminal           offence.

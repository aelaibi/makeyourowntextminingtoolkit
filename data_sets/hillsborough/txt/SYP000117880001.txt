              I am a De t e c t i v e       Inspector          in the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e Police and am                in

              charge       of the Force Seri o u s Crime Squad.

             On    I believe        the 8 April             1989    1' received a telephone                call      at my home

             asking        if I was a v a i l a b l e        to    perform duty at the S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

             Football        Ground       on the occas i o n           of the FA Cup Semi               Final     the

              Inspector B r e n n a n           of    'C ' D i v i s i o n had    been depu t e d       but    he for some

              reason was unavailable.

              of   coaches on H a l i f a x Road.                  I made rny way to Hali f a x R o a d                near     to

              Chau c e r School          an d    deployed         one serial       to a c t u a l l y   receive        the

              coaches and a n o t h e r              spread out along            that   road back         towa r d s    the

              ground to ensure where                     possible      that      the L i verpool        supporters

              remained        in the      coaches         until     they were        parked.

              We were       not    p a r t i c u l a r l y busy until         a bout 2pm w hen man y             coaches        began

We g r a d u a l l y as       coaches a r r i v e d wor k e d            our way down H a l i f a x Road

closer      to the        g r o u n d and there were                no d i f f i c u l t i e s     experienced,             the

suppo r t e r s a p p e a r e d       to be      in good spirits and few of the                            coach

passengers a p p e a r e d           to have          been drinking.                 Other    s u p p o r t e r s who       had

arrived      by private             car and         vans also wa l k e d             past    us and a number                of

these a p pe a r e d        to have           been drinking           but    except         for    the    odd word of

advice,      no other a c t i o n was                 necessary.

As the      time m ov e d         towards        kick      off,     I could hear             radio m e s sages

reflecting           d i f f i cu l t i e s    in the       control      of the        crowd at          the Leppings

Lane    turns t i l e s       and     I could u n d e r s t a n d        such dif f i c u l t i e s        as    I have

p r e v i o u s l y been      on duty at that                location years ago and on big

occasions a r r an g i n g            orderly queues               of supporters who are                   inclined to

arrive      near       to kick        off time          is a problem.                I g a t h e r e d the      units

together and w a l k e d              the short            distance      to the        j u n ction of the main

road with C l a y w h e e l s Lane.                   My    radio     had    not      been work i n g

pa r t i c u l a r l y well       and     I listened           in to my S e rgeants                radio.       We were

s u p p o s e d to     return       to the Traf f i c Garage                 for meal         but a m essage was

received that all                 ava i l a b l e     officers        were     to go to the              ground.        I

w a l k e d w i t h my units            together wit h a number                      of others along Leppings

Lane and on            reaching         the t u r n s t i l e s     1 saw a number                of    policemen       lined

up but few supporters.                         1' did not        u n d e r s t a n d what was           happening       and

the    radio was a s u c c e s s i o n              of u n i n t e l l i g i b l e    messages.           I told both

my S e r g e a n t s    to gather             their    serials        together and            I    went    to try and

find out what             was     happening.               I walked      towards         the service            road and

to the      right       of the        turnstiles           and     saw an ambulance.                   There    were

officers       rendering            first aid to two                people       lying       on the ground and                   I

could hear           supporters          shouting           that    it was my fault and similar

comments were             d i r e c t e d at other           offic e r s ar o u n d me.                I ran through a

gate and down the tunnel                        that       leads    to the area             behind the Leppings

Lane   goal.         I wanted        to know what was            h a p pening and        I saw       people

m i l l i n g a bout     in      front   of me. I d o n ’t         know      how but     I went       forward

onto    the    running           track and saw               people     lying on the ground and a

parked a m b u l a n c e w ith          two    persons    inside.           I was    stood at a door              to

the t e r racing         and     I then started          shouting at          officers        round me to

lift    fans who were             being       carried    towards me from the                 terracing       to

help me       lift     them out of the              crowd.       I helped      both     injured and

un i n j u r e d fans      off    the    terracing       and     told officers          to    lift them away

from the track             to a l l o w others         through.         I d o n ’t know how          long this

went    on but       I b egan to         realise       that    to my       left was    a heap of

injured.          I was        s h o uting at offic e r s        near      to me to     carry the       injured

awa y and      render          first aid.           I then heard        someone      saying     'This ones

a l i v e ’ and    it was        then    I thought       there ma y be fata l i t i e s          but    I couldn'

accept     that      the       people    I    was    s truggling      to     lift    out were        dead.

There were         supporters           on the t e rracing         throwing a r t i c l e s      towards          us

an d they were           shouting        threats at rne.           I couldn't         u n d e r s t a n d why and

kept    thinking what             are they blaming me              for,      I just     c o u l d n ’t grasp

\what was      happening.            I lifted what            seemed a lot of           people       out and

some    stage      I saw         a body of a young man being                 passed to me.            He was

purple and as we                 lifted him he hit         his     head      on top of the wall.                  I

shouted       "mind his          head"       or s o m ething     and then thought,             he's    dead you

idiot,     get him         out of       the way.        1 was     still      telling     offic ers      to

assist     the     injured as           I moved a way         from what       had now become           the exit

fro m the t e r r a c i n g and          I encouraged          fans and Police           o f f ic ers to       rip

the wire       netting          away from the area             of the exit          to a l l o w more    room.

How    long    I carried the             bodies       I do not     know but e v e n t u a l l y       the area

in front       of me       cleared and          I had    chance     to      look    round at the        playing

area    im m e d i a t e l y    behind me.          Thinking      about      it now     I presume       that all

except     for     two     that     I lifted out were             dead.       Those     two    showed signs

of    life but       the       others    did not.        Some     of the      people we        had    laid on

                                                                                                                R 149

the   grass        had    their     faces       covered and were              obv i o u s l y dead    but       I

couldn't          accept    that and wanted              to help them.

I eventually accepted                    that    I was     s u r r o u n d e d with dead      people and that

there was          nothing       I could do.            I completely           lost track        of time and

cannot      even guess           how long        I was     i n v olved       in what     I have      described.

I w ould estimate               I entered the t e r r a c i n g             between 3 . 10pm and 3.15pm.

I then w a n t e d        the    injured and           bodies     removing and tried                to ask          on the

radio     for a m b u l a n c e s     but    the      radio was        just a s u c c e s s i o n    of messages.

In retrospect             I don't        know    if    I actually           tried to get      thro u g h or           if

the    radio was          so ja m m e d     that      it was    impossible,

I was     finding         it d i fficult         to accept        that       these     people    had       to   lay

there and was a n g r y             that     no a m b u l a n c e s    had been sent        to us.          The one

amb u l a n c e    that was       there m oved a w a y          from the area behind the                    goal          and

I could then see m a n y more                    dead and       injured on the other                 side of the

g o a 1 a re a .

The    next       thing    I recollect           is s u p p o r t e r s     running     up to me and            telling

me a gain         that    it was my fault and                some wanting            to fight me.           One       in

particular was             d r a g g e d away from me           by his        friends.       I was        a ngry and

frust r a t e d     that     I c o u l d n ’t do a n y t h i n g       to help people and             found          it

d i fficult        to keep my temper.                  I tried        to    calm down some Police

C o n s t a b l e s who were also            feeling       the same way and then,                   for    some

reason the L i v e r p o o l          supporters         began        to    charge     towards       the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest       supp o r t e r s     on the S p i o n Kop.            I started       to form a

line across          the     centre       of    the     pitch and as           I was     doing      so a

Superintendent             came     to    me and said s o mething like                  "Get a line of

officers,          keep them apart".                  I said    I was        doing     that and      c o n tinued to

do so.        I was       jo i n e d at aro u n d this          time       or just     before       by Detective

S e r g e a n t M o r t o n who was working              in u n i f o r m and he stayed w i t h me.

Myself and others                eventually           formed the           line and     I must admit, that

the    prospect          of a riot        in front        of   the Spion Kop f r i g h t e n e d me.                  I

s hou t e d at     o f f icers        to keep       the    line     intact and then met Chief

Superintendent            Nesbit           who    told me to get a line of P o l i c e                    dogs    in

front     of the S p i o n Kop.                  Detective       S e r g a n t Mo r t o n used his         radio         to

ask     for    the P o l i c e    dogs and they were                  very quickly          in position.               This

made me feel m u c h             better as          I felt       that we were         now to some           degree at

any     rate    c o n t r o l l i n g what was           happening.         There were           several

i ncidents        of d i s o r d e r ar o u n d      the P o l i c e     line and         I remember

supplementing           one      end near          to the      players       tunnel w i t h        officers       that

were     stood beh i n d         the       line.

People        young    and      old were          corning up to me           enquiring        as    to missing

friends        and as k i n g     if people were               really      dead.      I lied to them.                I

said     I didn't       know and            that a l t h o u g h    I knew        there were        injured,         I was

not     sure    if an y o n e was           dead.        I was     still     finding       the a c c e p t a n c e       of

the     deaths alm o s t         impossible          on a personal               basis and       that     is why         I

lied to them.             A young           boy,    probably        eleven years           of age        came up to

us and asked           if an y young              people     had    been hurt.            I said     I didn't            know

and     he said that            his    friend was m i s s i n g          and that         it was     his fault

b ecause       he had     i n s isted he           came    to the match.             I almost        broke       down at

this     stage     but m a n a g e d        to    reassure       him as      best    I could,        helped by

Detective         Sergeant        M o r t o n and he w a l k e d         back      towards       the Leppings

Lane     terracing.

This     period of        time        is    impossible         to estimate          but    I kept        enquiring            if

the m atch        had been        cancelled.              I felt      very strongly that                 it should

have     been and       i put         this       point    of view to a number               of     senior      officers

who a p p r o a c h e d me.           Eventually          this     d e c i s i o n was made        and    I took       half

the     line of o f f i c e r s        from the          centre     of the        pitch to the Penistone

Roa d    juncion wit h H e r r i e s Road                 to s u p e r v i s e   the N o t t i n g h a m supporters

as    they     left.      D e t e c t i v e S e r geant M o r t o n        remained w i t h me           for

c o m m u n i c a t i o n and    there was a u n i f o r m Chief                 Inspector         there    but      I can'

remember        who    it was.

■* *    I was    engaged        in this         duty for some           time and when the N o t t i n g h a m
                                                                    - - - r ''


         supporters        had     cleared        the     g round ^aSrtT'went to the N orth                   stand where

         o f f i c e r s were     gathered.

         I searched        for my        two    serials w ith w h o m              I had    lost       contact      since

         entering       the gro u n d and with the                 help of Po l i c e S e r geant               Cloke who

         was    in charge         of serial         40    I located all             but    three Police            Cons t a b l e s

         and    the S e r g e a n t   who was        in charge          of serial 3.

         I talked       to two Pol i c e          constables who were                    part    of serial         39 who       had

         o b v i o u s l y been    present        at the     incident and a sked them to write                             down

^       briefly        what     they had seen.              They went awa y to do that an d                         some short

         time    later,       after      a debrief         from a senior                officer    in the       stand      I sent

         all    my officers           present       plus    the    two who          had by then          completed

         state m e n t s   to C l a y w h e e l s    Lane    for    transport             back    to Rotherham.             1

         I then a t t e n d e d a short             briefing       of     Inspectors and above                  in front         of

         the Police        Control        Roo m     by Chief Supe r i nt e n d e n t ^ M o 1 e and Nesbit and

         returned       to Police         Headquarters.

         I should add that               I am    confused as         to my exact                position      in    front       of

         the     terracing.           I at      the time of        the           incident       believe    that I was

^       lifting      people       from the        terracing        thro u g h a gate             but    it may have been

         a hole      in the wire          netting,         which wit h my encou r a g e m e n t               was     further

         torn away from            its    frame at some            stage to enlarge                the hole.

         I also      pulled two          police      officers       from          the    terracing      and     one     of these

         I have     since       i d e n t i f i e d as Police       S e r geant 758 Morgan,                VF*      Division

         who     confirms this.            That          officer    left          the terracing         whe n      1 believe

         all     the   dead and       injured        had been       removed.

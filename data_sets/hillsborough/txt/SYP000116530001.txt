             no t    carrying          drink          and    had    tickets         for    the      game.       In g e n e r a l          the     fans

             we     encountered             were       good    natured          and    enthusiastic.                 A    quantity           of

             cans      were      removed          from       several         Ford     Transit        vans.

             PC R o g a n      caused           one    van    to    stop and          I spoke        to   the    driver             and    his;

             three       pas.engers.              Only       one    of w h o m      had a      tick et.         I brought             t his       to

             the a t t e n t i o n         of    the    sergeant          who     spoke       to    the   lads       a nd was         assured

             by     them     th at     they       were       collecting           their       tickets       from         a f r i e n d at

             Hillsborough.                  I    then       informed         them     t hat    if    they did            n®$    infact, have

tickets        they would              definitely              not     be    seeing            any    football             and       one    of

the    lads       replied         ' W e ’re L i v e r p o o l          fan s,        we    can       get    in anywhere!'',

I saw a nother             van      pull       up    in t he          1ay by a n d a            lad got          out       and       sold     a

ticket       to a       lad     in a      car w h i c h          had       pulled         up    behind          it.

We    noticed        that       from about               1 - 1 . 3 0 p m the         traffic          was       so    congested

along      th e    road       that       the    cars        we re at          a standstill.                     However          by a b o u t

2pm    the     road was           virtually              empty.

At a b o u t      2 . 30p m we         stopped           two     coaches           which were               travelling together

and    the     fans       were      complaining                  t hat       the d r ivers           were       g o i n g to         make

them     late      for     the      game.

At a p p r o x . 2 . 4 5 p m        we    left       Tankersley               Intersection                 en    route          to

Claywheels           Lane       for      our    meal.

As we      passed         by H i l l s b o r o u g h        I saw          that      there          were    a    lot       of    Liverpool

fans     s t ill     milling           about        at    about        3 pm a n d         I commented                that       if the

fans     didn't         hurry       they would              miss       the      start          of    the    game.

At    about       3.05 a        call      came       to     us       t hat    we     were       required             at    Leppings

Lane.        We a s s u m e d       fighting             had     broke        out.

On arrival           at    Hillsborough                  our     Inspector            and Sergeant                   told       us    to m a k e

sure     t hat w e        stayed         together           as       a serial.             Once       we    got       to    the       gate        at

the L e p p i n g s       Larie     I saw several                    hundred Liverpool                     f ans      standing

opposite          the     gates        which        lead         into        the g r o u n d .

At    first       we w e r e      told     to       form         a    cordon and               I thought             this must        be

because        the      fans      were     going          to     storm        th e    turnstiles.                    At    t his      t ime

rumours        began       to     circulate              th at       the     game     had       been       stopped and                some

Liverpool          fans       had      spilled           onto        the     pitch.

A Liverpool             fan     came      up    to m e a n d           asked why               he w a s     not       being          allowed

in a n d     s h o w e d me       his     ticket          and        I explained               the    situation             to       him.

As    we w e r e     speaking            an ambulance                 arrived         and       the    lad a s k e d            why    th e

ambulance          had arrived.                 1 said           t hat       some     one m u s t          have       been       injured

in the       crush        and     he     replied          'Oh g o o d         if     they       get    s ome         out    t h e r e ’ ll        be

                                                                                                                                  R 14

more      r oom    for       us*.

Just      as    the     ambulance           was      making            its w a y      into    the      ground a            call     came

ov e r    a tanoy        system          requesting              that        the    fans make          no a t t e m p t      to     gain

entry      to     the    ground          but       assist        Police         in b r i n g i n g     out      the       injured.

Our      serial        was    then       told       to    enter         the     ground.           Once     we    passed         through

the      outer     gates          I lost       contact           with        our S e r g e a n t     and     Inspector            and

d i d n ’t se e        them again             until       after         the     Liverpool          fans      had      left      the

stadium.

The      first     person          I s a w as        we       passed         through        the    gates        was       a man     in

his      mid. E O ’s w h o         was    sat       with         his    head       b e t w e e n his     knees        cry i n g .        1

then      saw a man           in his          mid    3 0 ’s laid             on the      ground with             a    teenager

kneeling          at    his       side.        The m an was              having        difficulties                 breathing           and

appeared          to    have       an    injury          to      his    ribs.

I knelt          beside       him       and    helped            him    into a more                c o m f o r t a b l e p o s i t i o n to

aid      his     breathing.

I then walked                over       to a n a m b u l a n c e          w h ic h was       parked         n ex t    to G a t e

*C ’        I could          see    two m e n         lying        on     the      floor     who were           obviously           dead.

Ambul ancemen were                  giving          another            man     oxygen.

I then          helped       another          PC    to m o v e         these       corpse          to one       s i d e in o r d e r to

make      a space           for    ambulances               to    get     up a n d      d o w n the a l l e y .

At     t h is    stage       fans       began       coming         through Gate              'C ’ in g r e a t e r          numbers

and more          bodies          and    casualties               were       brought        from     the     p i t c h a r ea.

Many      of     the    fans       who     came       out w e r e         very      hostile         towards          the P o l i c e ,

passing          comments          s u c h as       ’ It's all            your      bastards         fault*          and    ’D o n ’t

j us t    fucking           stand       there       you       bastards’.

I saw       one    fan       say    to     several            P o l i c e me n who       had      formed        a    cordon around

the      bodies        of    the    dead,          ’Y o u     bastards          are     going       to    pay       for    this,

some       of y o u     will       die     for      whats         happened           here    today'.            Many       of     the

f an s    were     quite          drunk       and     some        who     were       genuinely           trying       to    help        the

As    the      injured        were      brought         out       we   placed         them        to    one; side*            along        a

wall    and      I went         along        this wall            giving      advice          to       the    friends           of     s o me

administering               minor       first         aid    etc.

Many      of    the       sergeants           seemed        to    be   in a s t a t e         of       shoc k ?      as   we     all

were    and      I saw a Chief                  Inspector          take      hold      of     one        sergeant         who was

standing         next        to m e     and      say    to       him    ’C o m e     on,     i t ’s up         to y o u       sergeants

to    take      control          of     this!”         The       sergeant          simply         looked away              as     if     he * d

not    heard         th e    Chief       Inspector..

A Doctor            then     c am e     over     to m e      and       explained           he w o u l d        .tike to help.

(I    found         out     later       this     was    Mr.       Ashton).            1 directed               him     to a m a n w h o

was    lying         face       down     on     the    ground          surrounded            by    his       friends.             When

the    Doctor          knelt       down       next     to    the m a n        on e    of     his       friends         said       ’W h a t

do y o u w a n t          you    bastard          fuck      off'.

I    told h i m        the      man     was     aDoctor          and      h a d come         to    offer         assistance                and.

he     replied         'Well       he    should        get       my mate       to     fucking            h o s p i t a l ' ’.     I told

him     to     ca lm      down and           do w h a t e v e r     the D o c t o r        told        him       to.

told      his       friend       to m a k e       him more          comfortable.                  I then walked                  o ver      to

where        fans      were      leaving          by G a t e      *8'.       Many       of    the        f ans     were         openly

position            because        it m u s t        have    been 30 minutes                  or       so    since        I had        first

available            ambulance.

At    this      ti me      I saw an           ambulance            coming         through         the m a i n          gate       and

heading         towards           us.        I went        over        and     spoke       with       the a m b u l a n c e           driver

and      was    then       joined           by a    sergeant            who     was       busy organ i si ng                the

transportation                   of    the    injured.             I    informed           h i m of        the    si tuation and

then      returned           to       the    injured m a n .

At    this      stage        a young          man     c ame       o ver      to m e       and    told me          he w a s        a

medical         student.               I told       him      to    go a l o n g       the w a l l          at    the       far    side        of

the      alleyway          and        examine       the      injured,

A    few more         minutes           passed        before           I was      able      to get          the       injured man

who      was    lying        on       the    floor      into       an a m b u l a n c e .

While      all       this        was    happening            I kept          coming        in     contact         with       s ome       of

the      officers          who        were    in m y       serial.             P a r t i c u l a r l y PC £ 9 7 B a r n e s              and

PC    1629 Rogan.                 However           I h a d lost        touch with              the        rest       of m y s e r i a l .

At    this      stage        a    sergeant           came a l o n g       and      told      us    to      go    to    the        main

gate      and    X remained                 there     as     the       West     S t a n d was         emptied          of L i v e r p o o l

fans.

The a tmo sp he r e              at    this     time       was     very        tense       and    the m a j o r i t y            of     the

fans      were       very        hostile       and      I personally almost                        ’e x p e c t e d '       to    foe

assaulted.

One      young       man     came       up a n d      asked        me     if     1 knew where               a    particular              pub

was      and    I said           I did       not.       He    replied            ‘Y o u    bastards             you    d o n ’t k n o w

fuck      all*.

n ex t    to me       and        said       ’Do y o u      think        the     game will             be    played          today".

I replied            ’I very muc h             doubt         it”.

He    replied         ’W h y      n o t , they        di d at      Heyse1’.

During         the    time        that       I was      on d u t y at          these       gates X my s e lf               and

We    ignored         th e       comments          that      were       made      because,            first,          it    seemed

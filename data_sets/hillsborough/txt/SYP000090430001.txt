                [ live at the above address as a Nursing Bister p C                    the Northern

                General Hospital           I am the Sister     in charge of the Accident and

                Emergency Dsf

                On Saturday 15th of April           1989 (151089)        I finished work at about

                1.00 pm (1300 hrs) as I had time off.                  As a result of what           1 was told

                when I was in the centre of Sheffield regarding what had occurred at

                the Hillsborough Football Stadium I returned to the Accident Dept

                at the Northern General Hospital.

                In charge at that time, about                  pm (1515 hrs) was Charge Nurse
           11   H 1 Z J S S

                any admissions.          I did also treat a number of minor              injuries but there
                                                                                                    PAGE      2
                                                                                                    S3469

             were so many casualties        I*m not able to         any d e t ai Is .

             I do recall that                             'came to the Department             in a

                                        T recall,I tojra her to go and assist              in the

             resuscitation department whicl\j£he did.

             I spent most of my time organising other members ofy*»taff,                     but T
t o iBfe.
"TO Vt£vv/   reca^     on one occasion I was     in the r esus c i tat i o / f Dept when a casualty

f t CctJ5)Q £(L I would describe as     IS yrs, male, med height j w d      build I think;

             with dark hair and I remember he was w e a r i ^         je a n s .       I started to

             assist in his treatment but then left hym with a trained nurse when

             one became available.         I saw that thisr youth did die but I'm not able

             ^ q gj_ve an y further des c r i pt i on \>f i/is identity. I can't say which
(a rn ^ X                                              X j
             members of staff were dealing with this patient or what time of day it

             was.

             There was a youth I helped take from an ambulance,                    I saw he h<ya dark

             hai r and a leather jacket and jeans.          I remember he was noV' weil, as I

             looked into a cubicle as he was          dealt with by                            who
At50&        stayed with h i m .   I'm sure he survived and was e            i
                                                                             v     e   11 y admitted    to

             a ward.

             Again I can't, help with this casualties identity.

             As I've said previously I was fully occupied that day in organising

             other staff and ensuring that all the patients were dealt with as

             quickly as p o ss ihi e.

             The two casualties       I have mentioned are the only two I remember                   in any

             detail, as I am unable to give any other descriptions.

             I continued work until about 8.30 pm (2030 hrs) when I was relieved by

             the night staff.      However as far as I remember the last casualty

             arrived at the hospital        between   5.30 pm (1730 h r s ) -6.00          pm (1800

             hrs).     The last part of my duty       was spent   in cleaning and replacing

             equipment.

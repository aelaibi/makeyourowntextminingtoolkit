                 Thank you very much for arranging the meeting last Tuesday and for taking the time to
                 see Alun Jones and myself. We appreciated the opportunity to put the Group’s case
                 directly to Lord Justice Stuart - Smith.

                 Thank you also for the invitation to the meeting in Liverpool on Monday. Having
                 discusscd the matter with Ann Adlington, however, I have decided that it would be belter
                 if just the families were present at the meeting and so 1 will not, after all. be attending.

                 I will shortly begin drafting the anwers to the points raised by his Lordship, and I hope
                 that these will be with you before the end of next week.

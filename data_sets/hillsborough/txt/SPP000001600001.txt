FILE NOTE DATED    llsMo.   CONFERENCE WITH COUNSEL, PAPER

BUILDINGS, LONDON.     ------------- ------ --------------

indexing - Michael Powers Counsel - Legal Opinion_-_


We saw Michael Powers together with the articled clerk of
Mr. Ian Rothera.     Discussed instructions to Counsel dealing
with the Part A i.e., the interpretation of Section 16.
Counsel said that having re-studied the Section and
considered it, he had come to the conclusion that it was
perfectly possible for the D.P.P. to request an adjournment
under Section 16 (1) (bj in respect of persons who might be
connected to somebody who had been charged with an offence
under Section 16(1) (a).      The reason for this being that he
felt that reference to the deceased in Section (1) (b) was
a reference to the deceased person in respect of whom the
D.P.P. was making his request and not the same as a
deceased person who had been charged under the provisions
of Section 16 (1) (a).      In other words, he accepted the
construction of this Section which the D.P.P. and Mr.

 Sturt had put upon it.
 Basically he felt that there were three possibilities.
 1.   That there was a charge of Homicide in respect of
      somebody.    That was covered by Section 6 (1) (a).
 2.   That the D.P.P. informed the Coroner that somebody had
      been charged with an offence relating to the death of

      the deceased under Section 16 (1) (b).

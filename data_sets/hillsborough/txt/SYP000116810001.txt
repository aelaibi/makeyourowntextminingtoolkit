EE!ven at     this         early        s ta g e ,     a number             of L i v e r p o o l        supporters               approached

the    g round        drinking           beer         and    soft        drinks          from      cans      which          in the m a i n

were    discarded            on       th e    floor         or    as     they         approached            the       turnstiles                to

Certainly,            anything           containing               alcohol             was    either         disposed             of,    drunk

Lane    area      had       increased             significantly.                       Many       people        were        stood about

number      of    them       were        continuing               asking          others          if t h e y      had any             football

tickets       for      sale        to    enable         them        to       see       the   match.          C l e a r l y , there

were    literally            several            hundreds            of p e o p l e       who      had a r r i v e d         in

A    steady      stream          of     fans      were       walking             towards          the    ground            both       from       the

Middlewood            Road       a n d W a d s ley B r i d g e              directions             and      the       area       at    the

Leppings         Lane      e n d wa s         becoming            fairly          congested.                Looking             towards          the

turnstiles,            I. c o u l d      only         see    the       top       of    one     Police        helmet             and    the       top

of    a flat      Police           cap,       but      faces        were         obscured          by    the      h e i g h t of        the

c rowd.       On a high wall                    adjacent            to a n d          partitioning              various
turnstiles,              youths       had       climbed          to    th e    top and were               making       their       way

perilously              towards       a    further          w a ll     above       the a c t u a l        turnstiles          where

uniformed           Inspector             Bennett          'FI*,       was     assisting         them and             no    dou bt

alleviating              a dangerous             situation             that      they were           putting          themselves             i

By     about       H.40    p.m.       th e      crowd       s i t uation was             hectic       to    say       the    least.

There      were         hundreds,          thousands             of    supporters             walking       along          Leppings

Lane      towards         the    entrances             where          there      seemed        nowhere          for    them       to

go.       Around         eight       mounted         Police           Officers          were    attempting             to    form a

barrier         with      their       horses          through          the     solid         herds    of    peopl e c r a m m i n g

towards         the      turnstiles             and Police             Constable             Buxton       from Hammerton

Roa d ,    who      drove       up    outside          the       Leppings          Lane       entrances          in a P o l i c e

La n d Rover,            was    appealing             through          the     vehicle's         l o ud     hailer          system

for     the     crowd      to    stop          surging          forwards         as     people       were       being       crushed

•at 'the t u r n s t i l e s .            In s p i t e      of    innumerable                requests,          the. c r o w d

continued           to m o v e       unrelentingly                in the         direction           of    the     entrances.

Such      was      the    volume          of    people          that    any      pick— pocket             observations                were

n ow    useless          arid at      Detective             Sergeant           Smith's         instruction,                together

with      Detective            Constable             Lindsay          and     others         engaged       on    the       same

duties,         1 m a d e m y w a y to the j u n c t i o n of V e r e R o a d a n d L e p p i n g s

Lane.         We    continued             to w a l k       down Vere           Road      towards          Penistone          Road and

several         residents            were       clearly          annoyed         and     remonstrating                with youths

who     had     obviously            been       urinating             in a     passageway.                In fact,          without

exception,              every    passageway                on    the    ground          side    of V e r e       Road       had been

used a        number       of    times          by u n k n o w n       persons          relieving          themselves.

Staining           of    urine       was       all    over       the w a l l s         and    floors       of    the       passageway

With      Detective            Sergeant          Smith and Detective                         Constable          Lindsay,          I

continued           to    the    ground          at a t i m e          when      several        dog       handlers          with       dogs

began      to      assemble          at    the       top    of    the       access       path    to       the    pitch       between

the     Spion Kop and                the       North Stand.                 Th e y ,    shortly after,                moved

towards         the      pitch.
About    3.00      p.m.    or    thereabouts,          within         f iv e    minutes      of   entering     the

gymnasium         sited    inside      the    ground,        I was       instructed with             other    Police

Officers         present    to    clear      an area       to m a k e     way     for    the      reception    of a

number      of    fatalities       from      the    Leppings          Lane      end.     An a re a was       cleared

and   almost       immediately         bodies       started       to a r r i v e       and   throughout       that

evening      into    the    early      hours       of S u n d a y ,    16 t h A p r i l ,    1989,    with    other

Police      Officers,       I was      engaged        in h e l p i n g     to    process       the   property    of

and   the    victims       of    the   tragedy.

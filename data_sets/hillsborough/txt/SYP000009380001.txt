w as n't    until about         half   t w o ,/Cwenty to three            that    things      s t ar t ed to

bui 1 d up at the t urnaft i 1

U p to this time the s u p po rt er s             had been well           b eh a ve d and      in good

humour,      only a couple         had comp l ai n ed that            they had a l re a d y been

searched.           I could tell       that    the s u pp or te rs were          b ui l di n g up outside

the    t urn st il es and the          large metal       gate      nearby,     I could hear         people

be hind      the    large gate     s houting and s c r e w i n g .

Supporters         then st ar te d to      climb oiltirthe top of the                   large met^l          gate

a nd onto t>fe wall above                 the turnstiles.

At first       I thought        they    were     trying       to get in because they d i d n ’t               have

a ticket,          but soon r ealised from what they were                      saying,       that   they had

clim bed up to get out of the w ay of the                          crushing.        T h e y were    s h ou ti ng

that       people were g etting          crushed and that             they n e ed e d help.         T he y

then got onto           the   small      roof on top of/the t u rn st il es and we h e lp ed

them to jump down.               One    of t h e Inspe/tors           c li mbed onto         the small       roof

and h elped them to get o ver.                   S ome ^o f      the s up po r te r s m a n a g e d to get

a cr os s    the top of the metal             gate a nd then onto             the wall       at the other

s i de .

S h o r t l y after     this one officer          told me that           the other       large metal
                                                                               C_
gate was open.             I then saw the other Jlfetal gate                   open for a short              time

I c a n ’t remember how m a ny supp o rt e rs                 came    through.

Our serial          remained on t h e / X u r n s t i 1e s , I then         remember hear in g over

the S e r g e a n t s   radio    that all      a v a il ab l e    o ff i ce r s were    r e qu ir ed at the

perimeter          of theypitch.

The    large m e tal/gate         o pened a g ai n and a lot o f /o f f i c e r s             from outside

the    ground       raWthrough         and towards       the      centre/ tunnel.

M ys el f    and a few of the other              offic er s were         told to stay by the

t u r ns ti le s as we were        still      n ee d ed at this         location.

It o nly seemed          like a few mintues             later that         people      co-

d i r e c t i o n of the      centre    tunnel    were     shouti ng       for hel

a ss istance.        Myself and P C 3 1 0 7 P ^ a ^ f o n           ran towards              the     centre

tunnel,       injured people were                 sta gg e ri n g   up the           tunnel,       one man ran to

me a nd told me to get                 into the terrac es as                   people were           dying.

B o t h m ys el f and PC P e a r s o n          ran t hr o ug h the            tunnel Jfo the back of

the    terrace.        At this         point      I could o n l ^ T e ^ ^ h ^ d s            of    people,         the     crowd

was    so ti gh tl y       p a c k e d .'   At first       I tried to          push t hr o ug h but there

was    h ardly any         ro\gf‘.      I think       then people          saw my u ni f or m a nd more or

less    pushed me          through.           Cries     for help were           coming         from d i ff er en t

directions.          People were             s hout in g at me that              other       people were              dying.

I t hen got to a point where                      I saw what s ee me d               like a pile of bodies,

one m a n was       slapping a w o ma n across                 the face.             O th er      s u p p or t er s

s t ar t e d to    pick these          people        up and    I s h ou t e d at s up po r te r s             to      let us

through.          I think some s u p po rt er s             didn't        realise       how seri ou s the

s i t u a t i o n was and were more               c oncerne d a bout            k ee pi ng     their       spot       in case

the m a t c h s tarted again.

As    I was    trying to get the                 injured out         I was       geti ng a lot of verbal

abuse    from s u p po rt er s a nd            could s m e 11 alco ho l              in the air.

Once    the fans       had got t hr o u g h the             crowds w i t h the            injured          I ran up

the tunnel         w it h them,        a sup po rt er       came up to me and told me                         he was a

n u r s e , he went and h elped                the    injured.           By this time             there was a            lot

of    injured      people      lying on the g ro un d at the                     end of the tunnel.

A m b u l a n c e men and P ol ic e Off i cers were givi ng m o u t h to m o u t h .

I made     sure all        the      injured had someone                  g iv in g    them a t t e n t i o n before

1 ran back down the tunnel                       to see     if there was a n yo ne                  else who          n eeded

help.      By this time m ost of the                     injured were            on the        pitch and the

a m b u l a n c e s were    there.          S u p p o r t e r s a bove    us    in the seats             s ta r te d     to

take    the a d v e r t i s i n g    boards       down and they were                  passed to the             front and

then onto the          pitch         w h er e they were           used as        stretchers.

Some    s u p po rt er s were        still       stag g er i ng     up the tunnel and were

suffering         from shock         rather       than any        physical           injury.          I w a l k e d w it h

              them and tried to            comfort     them.

              A   lot of       relatives     by this      time were     g et ti ng   frantic as they           c o u l d n ’t

              find their         friends    and    relatives.        M ys el f and other         officers      t ri ed to

              comfort         them as m u ch as     possible,       but we wer e         still    g e t t i n g abuse     from

              some      of the       supporters.     One man      came up to m e , he            pointed his finger

              in my face and            called me a       'fucking m u r d e r e r ’ .     For    the   rest   of the

              afternoon         I lost    count    of how m any times         that was        said to me and

              other officers.

              W h e n all      the    injured were     out of the terraces,               m y se l f and other

              o f ficers were          told to stand       in a line at the entr an ee              to the tunnel

              to s top s u pp or te rs       relatives      going back        into the      terraces.

              I did this         for a while,       but    could see that        people       n eeded    comforting.

              I remember         standing w i t h a       lady who     couldn't      find her h u sb a nd and a

              y oung man who was w ee p i n g          an my shoulder.

              A ft er    this    I cannot     recall      ex a ct l y what    I did,      I w a l k e d a r o u n d and

              r e a ss ur ed friends and          relatives.

              I then met         up w ith S e r g ea nt Burns and         some    of the      other officers

              from my serial.             By this    time all       the fans were          leaving the stand,

              both Liv er po ol         and N otts Forest.          We stay ed by the t u rn st il es at the

              West S t a n d until        the m a j o r i t y had left the ground.

              We then went            to the N o r t h S t an d for a de-briefing.

S oo n after 3pm       (1500)      I heard a frantic appeal                  for all O f f i c er s

available        to go onto     the      track.

I ran w ith several O f f i c e r s to the front of the g r ou n d w here I saw
         1U ”5>
Supt. C H A P M A N , who a p p e a r e d to have h eard the m e ss ag e but not the

location where Off ic er s were              needed.       I told him the d elay was minimal,

a bo ut    15/20 seconds.

We   ran to the N S t an d Gate            ’0 ’ where 2 S t ew a r d s a lone were m a nn i n g                  the

gate and straight           onto     the track.       I saw a large            number     of O f f i c er s      on

the fence at the goal              end    (W Stand).       Several        civilians were on the

track.      The m ain area      of    concern seemed to be to the                     right    of the

goal      - very q uickly      indeed very m any O ff i ce r s a p p e a r e d at this end on

the track.         I saw several         people    inside the fence with faces a nd bodies

ja m m e d up a gainst      the fence,       some w i t h vomit           on their       clothing,        some

we re blue       in the face and we re e xt r e m e l y distressed,                    some a p p e a r e d

beyond any help.           T here was      nothing      I could do to get              into the         pen to

give      immediate    relief.       I was speakin g        to one male who was                 pleading         for

help and a p p e a r e d    to die as       I spoke      to him.         I climbed onto          the fence

a nd saw m any       people    in a sea of         c o nf us io n    i mm ed i at e ly b eh in d the W

S t a n d goal     in the s tanding        enclosure.

Chief      Supt.   N E S B I T was s tanding       close to me on the h oa rd i ng s                b e hi n d

the g o a l .

I d i r e ct ed several O ff ic e r s       into the e n c l o su r e a d j a c en t        to the       "pen’,

they were trying           to enc ou ra ge    people to go b a ck wa rd s to the entrance

or   climb the fence          to the wing w h i ch was              sparse w i t h s u p p o r t e r s . M a n y

of the fans were           in a state of          panic and w er en 't           responding        to

a dv ic e a nd directions          g iven by P ol icemen.            I saw several          fans     being

pu lled up from the           'pen'      into the upper        section.         The a r e a was swar mi ng

with      people and m any O f f i ce rs a r r i v e d at the top end.                   I ascertained

O f fi c e r s were at the      rear fo the W S t an d a nd were trying                       to get      people

back      into the open a re a        near the turnstiles.                I went out a r o u n d

the    back to a s c e r t a i n this was        correct.       It was then I saw several

bodies       on the gra ss ba nk and many O f f i c er s            present        in this area.             I went

back onto the field a nd saw m any                  people     being brou gh t out onto the

grass     by Police Officers.            Several      people were          being     t r a n s p o rt e d    by

h oa rd in g    boards      carried by civilians.            I saw several           S t e w a rd s and

Sheffield Wednesday apprentices                    in blue t ra ck s ui t s         on the field,              they

were    tending       to the    injured and trying            to clear        the    pitch.      M an y

p ho to gr ap he rs were on the f ield as were L i ve rp oo l                      fans.    I saw very

many,     the vast m a j o r i t y were under the             i nfluence       of    into xi ca nt s

d is pl a y i n g   the usual     symptoms - eyes         glased,         b reath smel li ng         of beer,

sl ur re d speech,          some were    very a gg re s s i v e     in their manner.

It was obvious           the task      of helping      people       out of the s tand was well                        in

hand.     M a ny Off ic er s were at the scene of the                     crushing a nd         it was a

case    of     'too m any     cooks'.    I then saw m a n y O f f i c er s          forming       up on the

halfway        line to prevent Liverpool              fans    e n c ro a ch i ng    into the oppo si te

half.     Due to the         lack of    infor ma ti o n by t a n n o y / v i d e o    board the fans

a p p e a r e d to be b ecoming        impatient.

I was a p p r o a c h e d    by a s te w a r d who told me several                 people were being

t h r e a t e n e d by d i s tr au gh t L iverpo ol    fans    in the a re a of the               players

tunneI.

I went       there and saw Sgt C H A P M A N trying            to    contain the situation,                       I

there saw Bert M c G E E and F A R e p G r ah a m K ELLY                    being     lobb ie d by m an y

irate     fans      blaming    them for the disaster              by poor      planning a nd bad

ticket       distribution.

We saw several           fans had gone up the tunnel                 and were        t r es pa ss in g

looking for trouble after                several m in ut es         we    cleared them away,

however,        very m any were at the entra nc e              to the tunnel            repeating            their

s t a te me nt s    blaming    the F A for the disaster.

The t en si on was          very a p p a re nt and several          O ff i ce r s were      called to

support        us   in the    c on tainment    of this area.             It a p p e a r e d to me the

             Liv er po ol     fans were b uilding         up near the h al wa y         line    I f ea re d an

             a tt ac k at the Kop end where              the Forest      fans were        located,     and      I

             s ug g e s t e d to G ra ha m K EL LY    both m ana ge r be a p p r o a c h e d to give a T a n n o y

             appeal     for    calm.     I was a s k e d by K E LL Y to do this and both m an a ge r s

             a g r e e d to do so -- and were          taken by me to the P o li c e            room. Shortly

             afterwards        the   referee was       taken to the same           loca ti on to see

             C hief Supt DUCKENFIELD.

             I was a p p r o a c h e d   by the D e p u t y Chief C o n s t a b l e    of M e r s e y s i d e who a s ke d       :

             a nd was taken to the P olice               room a nd was      i nt ro d uc e d to Mr JACKSON.

             I did not handle any bodies.

             W h en   the scale of the disaster              became a p p a r en t     I f eared a riot by the

             L i verpool      fans who were        in the m ain drunk and a g gr e s s i v e a nd w it hout

             courage and disc ip li ne           to keep order and save               life where      possible,

             they were hin de re d by these m indles s                people,     m an y too drunk         to

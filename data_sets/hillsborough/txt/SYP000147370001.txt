  T o d a y we are         removing       the    remaining    bay of the broken              crush barrier             No

  124A from the L a p p i n g s Lane Terrace.                     We are also        removing        barrier         125

  from FJen 3 and barrier                   129 from     pen 6     and these will            be s u b j e c t e d to

  f urther      e x a m i n a t i o n and testing        in our    laboratory.          This     is in

  a c c o r d a n c e with your          letter    to Mr M A C K R E L L of 6 July          1989.



  To date our exa m i n a t i o n s             have   concent rated on Pens 3 and 4                 , but      in

  attempting          to   locate a barrier             similar    to   124A    in dernensions,

  s t ructure and          condition,           we examined      barriers      in other Pens at the

  Leppings        Lane     end and also at the S pion end.                     We    were a t t e m p t i n g
to   locate      barriers       w hich showed evidence                of      corrosion under           the    straps

at   t he supports a n d , i f po ss i b 1e , t o i denti f y an                       i s o 1at ed case where

corrosion had              created actual         holes     in the horizontal              tube.        In a brief

e x a m i n a t i o n we    identified holes            in various         barriers within Pens                1/2,       3,

4 and 6 at the L e p pings               Lane     end and also          holes      in 32 of the           older

style     barriers at          the S pion Kop end.               Some      of these S pion Kop              barriers

showed severe              corrosion,      with     large     holes     of up to bOmm being                found.

It must       be stressed         that      our    ex a m i n a t i o n was     in no way exhau s t i v e and

in our      opinion a t h o rough ex a m i n a t i o n by an                  independent        structural

engineer        is requi r e d .



11 shou 1 d be noted that                  in     is e v idence      to the Court          of    Inquiry,           Dr.

EASTWOOD         was       shown a p h otograph of a hole                  in barrier        123 and d e c lared

that     such severe          corrosion would            result      in the       barrier       being

"condemned".               In view of this,           I recommend          that    r e - e x a m i n a t i o n be

car r i ed out f o r thwith.



Wi t h the      removal       of the 3 barriers              prev i o u s l y    referred       to,   this

completes        the HSE ’s study at the ground, and,                           as far as we are

concerned,         the embargo         placed on L e p p i n g s Ln end                can be    lifted.

However,       for the        reasons       stated above,          this       in no way      implies       HSE's

acceptance         of the state            of the ground,          this must           be dealt w ith         by the

a p p ro p r iate a u th o r i t i e s .

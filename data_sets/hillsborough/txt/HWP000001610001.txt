         Dear Mrs Hudson                              r

         Thank you for your 1 etiMrai&Siuj£.j.t±ie--traeri.c-.evejits at Hillsborough
         in which you called for a reopening of “the public enquiry.

         The Home Secretary has seen the television programme Hillsborough
         and found it deeply moving and harrowing. In the House of Commons
         he gave an undertaking to consider carefully the points which
         were raised in the programme and the representations which have
         been made to him by the bereaved families and by others. He has
         emphasised that he would not take the decision to reopen the
         inquiry lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be
         in the public interest to do so and that it would stand a chance
         of providing a better understanding than there is at present of
         what happened on that terrible day.

         In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider
         whether there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether
         that evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been
         put before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome
         of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been
         different.

         The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide
         the Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points
         raised by the programme. The Home Secretary has promised that he
         will reach a decision on any further action to be taken as soon
         as he has been able to consider all the issues.

         He has emphasised that, whatever decision he comes to make, his
         thoughts will remain with all the bereaved families.

         Yours sincerely

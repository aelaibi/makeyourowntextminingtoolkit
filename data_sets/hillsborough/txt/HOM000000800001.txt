                              due to the             sheer weight                  of supporters-            I could occasionally see

 turnstiles a ga i n a n d to my surprise and                    relief       I saw that there was

 only a small           crowd about 5 yards           deep but for        its whole width.                 I had

 not seen where            the m ain bulk of supporters             had gone         to a n d my only

 belief was that             they had somehow entered the ground q u i c k l y through

 the turnstiles.              What    I w i t n e s s e d then I watched        in disbelief and

 amazement.           I saw the supporters            clambering      over the t u rnstiles any

 way they could.              The y were a p p a r e n t l y not showing tickets              or paying

  to e n t e r .    Sows     sup po rters     I saw   1iterally diving o v e r the turnstiles

  g r o u n d a l t h o u g h there was no       reason for this behaviour.                   I was

 ■instantly        r e l i e v e d at this    stage to see the         problem of e ntry had been

At     a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.1 0 p m    I went   into the Lane        leading to the South

 Stand where           I had seen other officers                running.           I saw several other

 officers        tending        to injured         persons just        inside the      lane,       near to the

 corner of the south and w e s t                    stands.     Some     of the      injured were        laid

 on the ground.               Some had white           blankets       of a type normally            carried by
am b u l a n c e s    over    their bodies and          covering      their faces.         It was

apparent         that    there was an eme r g e n c y and there had been a disaster

though        I was     not a ware at that           time the extent nor the

 circumstances.               I reasoned that          there w ou l d be man y officers             inside

 the ground a n d            I looked a r o u n d and saw supporters              leaving     the

 ground.         M a n y were       injured or d i s t r e s s e d and were s t a g g e r i n g about         in

 shock and disbelief.                   I realised       that     this area w o u l d be a major

 route for the e m e r g e n c y services                a n d my efforts and those of the few

 remaining           of f icers was a s s isting         a nd     comforting the     injured and

 attempting           to keep       people moving        who were    leaving the g r o u n d v       I:      *t •

  time other o f f icers and                I were being verbally ab u s e d           in a most

  violent manner.               I fully expec t e d being a s saulted at a n y moment.



  I observed that              officers      had formed themselves             into a line near to

  a nd   protecting           the    injured and dead a n d naturally creating an avenue
  in which supp o r t e r s       could     leave without         hinderance   to the     injured.



  I saw one officer who was                 in full      unif o r m but without a helmet

  r e m o nstrating w i t h violent an d a n g r y supporters at the m a i n gates.

  In order       to quie t e n the s i tuation and at serious                risk to myself       I

  went      into the mi d d l e    of these      supporters and took an unusual                course

  of act i o n and      i n structed the Police O f f i c e r         to go away w h i c h he did.

  This seemed to a p p e a s e         them.



  It was now a p p a r e n t t hat there had been a major disaster                      but still         no

                           Everyone at the scene had a task                      to perform.            I recall a Doctor

                arriv i n g and a s k i n g where          he was        required.          Supt.      Marshall        deputed an

                officer     to take          him to the gymnasium.                  A short while            later another

                Doctor a r r i v e d and         I sim i l a r l y deputed another                officer       to take him to

                the gymnasium.



                I assisted another               officer    to     console an           injured man who              I know to be

                                         (approx.      30 years).              He was sat on the tarmac at the

                side    of his      father who was a p p a r e n t l y dead.                                               did not

                want to be         conveyed to Hospital                 nor s e p a r a t e d from tiis father and I

                 instructed a P o l i c e Offi c e r          to      remain w i t h him.,                 ,.                 :



                 As the time        elap s e d    it became        clear as to the severity of the

                 disaster a n d at sombre mood befell                       the    crowd-        I continued with my

                  I returned with these officers to R o t h e r h a m where we all                                   retired from

                  duty.



                  To   summarise,        it is my genuine               belief      that supporters             entering the

                  turnstiles        between       1450 and       1500 hours were               in imminent           danger       of

                                                                                                                          R 12

                   being     killed or s e r i o u s l y     injured as a result of the huge volume of

                   fanatical       s u p p o r t e r s arriving    enmasse,         all         intent and anxious       to the

                   point     of d e s p e r a t i o n to get    into the ground at any                   cost before the

                   kick    off.      This was       confirmed by the a n x i e t y of man y other                    supporters

                   who were f r a n t i c a l l y    pleading      for the kick off to be delayed and for

                   the Police        to do something a l t h o u g h the s i t uation dev e l o p e d so

                   quickly and w i t h the behaviour                 of the      crowd this was             impossible.



                    I am s a t isfied that the officers                 I could see behaved                 in a

                    circumstances         prevailing.

                    the    pressure for a short while                 on the turnstiles,                the behaviour and

                      moving     people.     In my opin i o n this w o u l d have         been the queue had they

     Thank you for your                                letter    of             H     April      with       this    one            from
     Mr K Jones of Llanelli Rugby Football Club who are concerned
      about the implementation of the recommendations contained in the
      Final Report by Lord Justice Taylor.

      I do understand the Club's concern.                                              Safety certification under
      the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) was always
      intended to be                     a     flexible system which would not force clubs,
      such       as     Llanelli, to close                   down         but rather to enable them to keep
      open, operating within safety limits for the number of spectators
      who       could be safely accommodated at the ground.                                                       Each safety
       certificate is therefore individual to a particular ground*                                                                   It
       should reflect what is necessary or expedient in order to secure
       reasonable safety for the specified numbers of spectators to be
       admitted at that ground.

       Lord Justice Taylor's report does not change the position.                                                                    He
       made clear in the report that its emphasis was on soccer and that
       crowd problems were directly related to the nature of the event
       and the number of people attending it.                                                 He did not intend that
       his        recommendations,                      which       apply             primarily          to      major      so c c e r
       grounds, should be followed blindly elsewhere,                                                    we have attempted
       to explain this in Home Office Circular 11/1990 which we sent to
       local authorities together with the Final Report.                                                          I enclose a
       copy for your ease of reference.

                  Government                  has       accepted                the    principle            of     all       seated
          ;commodation for football league grounds,                                                   In the schedule to
         y     statement on                    29 January             I said that                  application of                  this
         ■©commendation                    to      other     types              of     sports        ground       may      not       be
        practicable and that                            we   would discuss ’he position with the
        r e p r e s e n t a t i v e sporting bodies concerned.                                      This is being done.
        X 1 the M e a n t i m e we do r :, o t expect safety certificates to toe used
             : order to achieve a 1 1 seated accommodate on at such groui                                                             -

  Nevertheless,         I hope the club finds some reassurance in that
  although some of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations may apply
  to a ground such as theirs,                 they should not be subjected to
  unreasonable requirements as a result of the Final Report.                               If
  the club encounter particular difficulty we are always willing
  to try and assist.                 We cannot however intervene on individual
 terms and conditions contained in safety certificates.                        These are
  entirely a matter for the local authority concerned.                           if the
 club consider that terms and conditions in the safety certificate
 are unreasonable they have the right to appeal against them to
 the magistrates' court.


 I am arranging for a copy of this correspondence to be sent to
 the Chief Executive of Dyfed County Council, who are responsible
 for the issue of the safety certificate for the Llanelli ground,
 so that the council are aware of your interest and concern.

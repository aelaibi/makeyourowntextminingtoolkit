               After a quick           packed meal        we drive out            to the F oxhi 1 1 area,,             Things

               are      very quiet      for ages.         After a w hile we              receive a report             that     there

               are a lot of football               fans    in the Fox P ublic House on Foxhill                          Road.

               words      with the      landlord and we            leave.          This was          probably aro u n d      1230

               hours.        A short      time     later we have a report                    of youths      urinating

               out s i d © a chi p s ho p i n Traf a 1 ga r R o a d .               W hen we         tur n u p t,he youths

               have      gone and      the are a     is quiet,.         S h o r t l y a f t e r w a r d s we are      told that

              a youth has just, u r i n a t e d           in s o m e o n e "s garden on Wilcox Road.                        We stop

               a group of about              four Liverpool         supporters           walking        uphill    a way from

               the      ground.       T h e y are al'J. drinking          beer      from      cans,     none admit

               urinating.            We tur n them ar o u n d and direct                 them towards         the     ground.

               I t ’s pretty obvi o u s          that they      intend drinking                for a b i\ longer            before

We    carry on p atrolling                   the Foxhil'i area and                       i t ’s still         compa r i t i v e l y

quiet.         The Fox          is gettin g         busier          but    nothing          e xceptional            happening.

The Gate and the T ra ve l l e r s are                         closed and just                  letting          regulars         in

the    back doors            by the        looks of           it.

At approx.           1303 hours we are                 directed            to

                                where      some youths              have a l l e g e d l y stolen                some

property.            We    see the         c omplainant who                states         that six youths                 have

been     into the          shop.          T h e y ’ve all       picked up a handful                        of sweets         and

run outside.               She a t t e m p t e d     to stop one                   of them and was               clouted on

her    head for           her     troubles.          They all             got       into a white            van and she

took     the     registered              nurnber.

At    1320     hours        the    van     is spot t e d and we                    follow     it i n t o     the     car     park

of t h e W h i t e        Horse      on the opposite                 side          of Halifax Road.                 Th©     six

youths        are    arrested.             They all           smell       of       drink apart            from    the     driver.

They all        deny       being         involved,        a couple are a little aggressive.                                       We

take     them to E c c l e s f i e l d          Police S t a t i o n and book                       them    in etc.          This

takes        until    approximately                1445    hours.              PC    O gi l v i e    is    left    at

We a c t u a l l y    resume        from E c c l e s f i e l d        shortly           before        the    last       prisoner

is    incarcerated,                W hen we        begin to          receive           t r a n smisions          from the

ground a g a i n we             can hear        that there            is       a    problem w i t h         the     crowd at

open a gate           to     relieve         the    pressure.              There        is ob v i o u s l y a problem

with     the    c o m m u n i c at i o n s    due    to   the        noise          of the     crowd.            We a r e   having

problems        hearing m e s s ag es              ourselves.              Foxhill          appears         quiets,       we drive

a r o un d    the ground and this are a                       is also              rather    quiet.          We d o n * t go           in

for our        s c h e d u le d meal         break as they are                      obv i o u s l y having         problems

inside       the     ground.             We start      hearing            requests          for ambulances.                 We

park    in L e p p i n g s      Lane and           people are             leaving         the g r o u n d .        We hear

that    there        is a f a t a l i t y       inside,         then we hear that t h r & e                       are     dead.        We
 c a n ’t believe            it.     More     people are            leaving      the ground now and

 L ep p in gs Lane           is filling         up.     A lot of the fans are                    having a go at

 the offi cers          on horses,,           who are at            the side       of us.        1 hey are     dragged

 L e p p i n g s Lane        stand.

 T ra n si ts are           r e q u i r e d to act as ambula n c e s .              PC H u t c h i n s o n   takes     the

 transit        to P e n i s t o n e Roa d and we                d o n ’t see him again.              At the

 L e p p in gs Lane          end we are d i r e c t e d to the                 gymnasium.         I see a line of

 Police        o f f icers      across       the tarmac           betw e e n the N orth stand where                  it

 joins        the kop a n d the gym.                  They are          preventing       people       getting access

  to the gym area.                   I see stret c h e r s          being      brought     out    of the      gym with

  injured        people        on that are          being        placed       into ambu l a n c e s    and taken

 •a w a y .    People        ar r i v e   at the      line       of P o l i c e m e n saying      they have       lost

  relatives and              friends.          They are          not a l l o w e d through.           We     set up a

  mak e s h i f t    c a s ualty enqu i r y         desk and           fill    sheet after        sheet wit h

  d e t a i 1s of m i « s ing         people.         Ins pe c I or R o b i nson comes            ba ck f r o m the

  gym and tells me                 that     there are at            least      seventy five         dead and

  possibly more.                We    initially         sit      the    relatives and friends                 in the

  No r t h stand a n d          sometime         later a coach arrives                  for them,.

  Wh e n everyone            had gone we wa l k e d              to C l a y w h e e l s Lane w here we          found

  our    transit.            We were        d i r e c t e d to    take a meal         break      but we d i d n ’t

  feel        like   it..      We a t te nd e d     two    reports        of football         fans fighting at

  the N o r t h e r n General             Hospital        but on each o c c asion they had gone and

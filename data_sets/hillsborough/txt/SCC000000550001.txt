GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTORS OF FEATURE ARTICLES


Community Care welcomes articles from readers about any aspect
of social work policy or practice.           However please bear in mind
that we receive a large number of articles.                  Our job is made
simpler, and the chances of your article being accepted are improved,
if you stick to these basic guidelines.


LENGTH
Articles should normally be up to 1500 words long.                    Manuscripts
longer than 1800 words will not normally be considered for
publication unless they have been discussed by telephone with the
editor, deputy editor or features editor beforehand.


COUNTING WORDS
Contributors are expected to do their own rough word count (to be sure
that the article is not too long).            The easiest method is to take a
"typical 10 line chunk     of the text, and calculate the average number of
words within that.       Then multiply by the total number of lines in the
article.       The total should be given at the end of the article.


PRESENTATION
All articles should be typed double-spaced, with a margin of about 1%
inches on either side (to allow editing changes to be written in) and
about 2 inches left blank at the top of page 1.                     Please type on one
side only of each sheet of paper.            These guidelines also apply to
material printed on a word processor.


REFERENCES
We never list references at the end of an article.                     They should always
be incorporated into the text (see example, next page).


                                                                               /Continued
Feature guidelines/ page 2
                                                                            /

Example:
   "Pritlove argues that research and social work are part qf the same
   process (Group Homes:    An Inside Story, Joint Unit for Social Services
   Research/Community Care, 1986).       Both, he says ..."
When giving references please ensure that the following information is
included:    author, title of book, publisher and date of publication
(if a magazine article give title of article, title of magazine, and
issue date).      Do not give a surname - only reference.


ABBREVIATIONS
When using shortened forms of the names of organisations, spell out in
full at first mention, with the abbreviated version in brackets, thus:
   "The same applies to community psychiatric nurses (CPNs)..."
For subsequent uses, just say CPNs.


GROUP LABELS
We never use 'label' adjectives in place of nouns.           Thus:
   Don't    use                                       Use instead
   the mentally handicapped                           mentally handicapped people
   the disabled                                       disabled people
   the old/the elderly                                old/elderly people
   etc.                                               etc.


OUR POLICY ON EDITING
The editor reserves the right to make any changes necessary for house
style, length, or legal requirements, but will not change the sense of
an article without consulting the author.         Authors will usually be
consulted if a major cut is required.


If you would like to discuss an idea for an article before committing it
to paper, we are always happy to give an opinion over the phone.

Pen Picture of



I started work in local government from leaving school, progressing from JunioP
Clerk, Education Officers to Wages Clerk, Public Health Service in 9 short years.
After my first daughter was born I returned back to (now) Social Services to
resume my'enthralling career as a'Wages Clerk. After my second daughter appeared
on the scene I attended Sheffield University as a mature student studying
Political Theories and Institution. I put my degree to good use by returning to
the (now) Family and Community Services as a Wages Clerk.
My efforts were rewarded, however by promotion to Admin Assistant, in the
Personnel Section, and then to Senior Admin Officer, the post I now hold.
My involvement with the Task Team is yet to commence - on Sept.4th, but I am
looking forward to the new experience with enthusiasm.

On leaving the building or returning social work staff should call
in at the Admin Office ta record where they are on the signing in and
out board.  (So Admin staff know when someone will be in and for
security and fire drill purposes).

For information about security of offices and the computer system
staff should refer to guidelines and procedures for the information
base.

Office equipment and stationery when requested should be coded to
the Disaster Fund (R FA 900 ....   then the appropriate code) and
ordered direct from General Admin.

Staff should familiarise themselves with information about the
Library on the Library Information Sheet, check fire procedure
notices, and closing times.

Rooms in the Library can be booked for meetings by contacting
Rae or Pat in Libraries Personnel (4709) explain who you are and         ~
which rooms you would like to book and the dates.

The social work team leader and Admin Assistant both have a set
of keys for the Library.

The Admin Assistant has a spare key for the desks and filing
cabinets.-

Post, typing and photocopying is taken to Meade House, there
is a "Meade House" basket in the Admin Room, and a Task Team
post box at Meade House.  Post needs to be collected and sent
each day.

The filing system in the Admin team room should be kept up to
date, and reviewed regularly to remind everyone what information
is held.
EFFECT ON INCOME SUPPORT^PAYMENTS FROM DISASTER APPEAL FUNDS

1 If money paid is compensation for personal injury to claimant or
partner and is put into Trust, then DSS will ignore the value of the
Trust for 2 years or longer if reasonable.

Any payments made from the Trust will count in full as income or
capital depending on whether the payment is made in a lump sum or on a
weekly basis.

If the money is not put into a Trust it will be counted in full.


2 Money put into Trust for a child following a personal injury (to
the child) will be ignored until such time as the child ceases to be
treated as your dependent.


3 Money paid to the next of kin of people deceased will be counted in
full as capital or income depending upon the nature of the payment.


WHAT EFFECT DOES CAPITAL HAVE ON INCOME SUPPORT?


If you have more than £6,000 in capital you cannot claim Income
Support (Capital includes cash, premium bonds, National Savings
certificates etc).

If you have capital between £3,000 and £6,000 DSS assume you receive
£1 per week as income for every £250 or part you have over £3,000.

Therefore if you have £3,501 DSS will reduce your Income Support by £3.

WHAT IF YOU HAVE OVER £6,000 CAPITAL

DSS will not allow you to "give the money away" or "spend it un­
reasonably" in order that you can claim Income Support.

However, it would be reasonable for you to spend some of your
capital on say:

paying off some of your mortgage,
going on holiday if you needed to get away following bereavement,
pay off any debts you may have, eg HP or rent arrears.

It may be possible to use your capital "reasonably" in other ways but
it would be advisable to seek advice from your local Citizen's
Advice        before doing so.

 HOW TO RECOGNIZE A SUICIDAL PERSON


 There are a number of clues t h a t wil l help you to recognize a p o t e n t i a l l y
 sui cid al person :

 * A FAMILY HISTORY OF SUICIDE

 Suicide, l i k e alcholism, d ep re ssi on , and many o t h e r p s y c h i a t r i c symptoms even
 including phobias, f r e q u e n t l y tends to run in f a m i l i e s . I t can almost be said
 to be contagious, but i t should r e a l l y be thought o-f as learned behaviour from
 someone who has s e t an example.

* A HISTORY OF PREVIOUS SUICIDE ATTEMPTS

The f i r s t attempt a t s u ic id e i s extremely d i f f i c u l t f o r the c l i e n t . I t is
usual ly impulsive or the r e s u l t o f a severe or prolonged s t r e s s . But once a
person has made one su i c id e at tem p t, i t seems to be e a s i e r f o r him to make
others              and the chance of his succeeding is markedly g r e a t e r . This is
e s p e c i a l l y so in the f i r s t two or t h r ee months following any given attempt.

* A RECENT COMMUNICATION OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, WORDS, OR ACTIONS

The person will almost always give some preceding communication of a s u i c id e
i n t e n t . I t has been said t h a t 50% of persons who have attempted s u i c i d e have
seen a physician within the previous month, 25% within the previous week, and
1% on t h a t very day. These are not very helpful s t a t i s t i c s , however, f o r most
of the people do not announce to the doctor t h a t tbey intend to commit s u i c i d e .
Instead, they p r e s e n t with a s p e c i f i c or vague complaint - and of course,
many have not consciously considered s u i c id e a t the time they see a doc to r or
oth er helping agent.

* A DEPRESSED MOOD

with f e e l i n g s of g u i l t or shame, e s p e c i a l l y i f accompanied by a g i t a t i o n . While
the sense of g u i l t is a strong i n d i c a t o r of su i c id a l r i s k , the f e e l i n g o f shame
is an e x e p t i o n a l l y strong n d i c a t o r .

* MARKED HYPOCHONDRIASIS

or somatic de lu sio n s. The c l i e n t of te n complains of stran ge f e e l i n g s in the
head or has an unshakeable b e l i e f t h a t he or she has a " t e r r i b l e d i se a se " such
as s y p h i l i s or cancer, or a vague but "undiagnosed" t e r r i b l e d is e as e or one
which he thinks "no one will t e l l me about".

* OBSESSIVE FEARS

of going beserk or of making a s p e c t a c l e of himself in f r o n t of o t h e r s . A strong
sense of embarrassment or of shame i s a malignant sign.

* THE ABUSE OF ALCOHOL OR DRUGS


* AGE

In gene ral, the o l d e r a person i s , the more l i k e l y he i s to commit s u i c i d e
s u c c e s s f u ll y ; the younger he i s , the more l i k e l y he i s to make a s u i c id a l
g e s t u r e . However, the s ui c id a l r a t e in adolescents i s a t t h i s time i n c r e a s i n g
r a p i d l y (a lso the r a t e f o r women in comparison with men). Adolescents a r e
almost as un p re d ic ta b le as schiz op hre ni cs , and any signs of s i g n i f i c a n t
a g i t a t i o n or depression should be given careful c o n s id er at io n .

* LIVING ALONE
I f a c l i e n t l i v e s alone or i s otherwise i s o l a t e d from the r e s t of the family
the suic ide i s increased. The f e e l i n g of being alone or lonely i s even more
important than the f a c t of being alone.

* SERIOUS ILLNESS
The presence of a seri ous physical i l l n e s s such as cancer or any o th e r chronic,
p o t e n t i a l l y f a t a l , or extremely uncomfortable i l l n e s s adds to the r i s k .

* MARITAL STATUS
Divorced people have a higher s u i c id e r a t e than si n g l e people, and they in
turn have a higher su i c id e r a t e than married people.

* SEASON OF THE YEAR
I n t e r e s t i n g l y , people are most l i k e l y to commit s u i c id e in the spring or autumn.
For many people, Christmas i s the unhappiest time of the year . While the
su i c id e r a t e i s not a c t u a l l y g r e a t e r a t t h a t time, the su ic ide s t h a t occur
during the Christmas holidays are more dramatic.

* A RECENT LOSS
A r ece nt l o s s of a loved one by se p a r a ti o n , divorce, or death also o ft en t r i g g e r s
su ic id e .




These are the t h i r t e e n most important clues to a l e r t you to the p o s s i b i l i t y
t h a t a person may be contemplating su ic id e or may do so in the f u t u r e .

Tracings

tracings came about as a result, of requests from people
who felt           need to contact and thank members of the
Sheffield public who had assisted them on the day of the
di saster.
Requests were also being received from members of the
Sheffield public wanting to know what had become of the
p e o p 1e t h a t t.h e y h a d h e 1p e d .
Given the vast numbers of people present both inside the
stadium and involved in helping, 'Tracings as they came to
be known often took a great deal of time and
unf ort unat. e 1y wer e not a 1ways successf u 1 ,

!vle th o d o f T r a c in g

The methods used in tracing depended on the nature of the
request.
1) Requests for the names of social workers who had
helped on the day could be traced through the information
that, the task team held on all F&CS workers who had been
involved. This information was easily available because
all social worker© who had been   involveed over the
weekend of the disaster had,   within a few weeks after
the disaster, completed a questionnaire indicating the
nature of their involvement and with whom, as part of
their debriefing,. These questionnaires had been examined
by admin staff and cross referenced on the computer with
details of the bereaved and injured, where these were
available- Thus, named workers were linked up with people
they had assisted,

2) Requests by survivors or the bereaved, for the names
of members of the Sheffield public who had helped but
were not F&CS staff proved more difficult. Requests were
made for the names of St.John’s arnmbulance personnel, .
nursing staff at both the Northern General and Royal
Hallarnshire hospitals, local residents living in the
hil.lsborou.gh area and people who had driven survivors
back to their home towns, among others. Finding such

and on occasions using the local press who were usually
helpful and printed the request free of charge.

3) Requests by rescuers wishing to know what had happened
to someone that they had tried to help were also made to
the task team,, Where the name of the person who had been
rescued was known it was possible to give some details
about their fate, eg the date on which they were
discharged from hospital. Where the name of the person
was not known, details of clothing worn were often the
only clue available to the identity of the person, and
not surprisingly these tracings were largley
uns at isfact or i1y resolved.
Record ing Invo1ved
 A record sheet was kept of tracings. This included s
details of the person wishing to make the contact -
details- of the person being traced -
d e t ails o f a 11 e m p t s rna d e
the name of the social worker working on the tracing-
the result of the tracing attempts.

Other Agencies Involved

Performing a tracing task involved contacting numerous
other agencies including the South Yorks Police, St
John’s ambulance staff, hospital staff at. both the
Northern General avid Royal Hallamshire hospitals, social
workers from various local authorites, voluntary bodies
eg. Cruse, as well as members of the Sheffield public
including local residents.

Cone 1us :ion

The tremendous need for people involved in a disaster
<ei ther survi vinq it or invo 1ved in he 1p ing in it) to
have knowledge about and contact with the significant
people that they met at a time of incredible stress and
of whom memories will remain for a very long time if not
forever, is something which is difficult to prepare for
in advance. It is something however which with hindsight
one realises the importance of keeping detailed written
documentation,; as well as thorough debriefing of all
those invo 1ved :i.n he 1p ing in d :i.sastsrs.

1) Task Undertaken
Visits to the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground were
made by both groups of people and individuals, some of
whom were survivors, some of whom were bereaved and their
friends and relatives and some of whom had helped on the
day (inside and outside the football stadium),
The majority of ground visits involved support from
members of the Task Team who were reponsible for booking
the visit with the receptionist at the ground and
escorting the visitors into the stadium, supporting them
< and their social worker, if present) during the visit
and providing them with hospitality and an opportunity to
talk over their experience afterwards.

2) Reason for undertaking the task
Visits to the football ground by bereaved, survivors and
helpers; had started in the week immediately after the
disaster. People had a need to try to understand what had
happened and one way of meeting this need was to allow
people into the ground and to have access to the Loppings
Lane terraces. Many of the bereaved returning to
Sheffield for the purpose of identifying bodies or
attending the opening of an inquest wanted to see the
place where their relative or friend had died and the
football ground became an important focus for them, As
well as the bereaved and survivors local people felt a
need to pay their respects to the deceased and this
included social workers and clergy, local residents,
fire, ambulance and police personnel, who had been
involved in the disaster in some way.
The first visits to the football ground which took place
in the few weeks immediately following the disaster were
supervised by groups of social workers, mainly from the
local area office of the Family and Community Services
Dept, Area 2, based at Meade House and within half a mile
of the foofaall ground. A social work duty system operated
to provide cover at the ground and several social workers
ware on hand to council the bereaved and survivors
returninq to thte stadium.
The Task Team therefore inherited the task of organising
and supervising visits to the football ground from the
social workers who were undertook the supervision of
ground visits in the weeks immediately following the
di saster.

3) Method of undertaking Task
A formalised proceedure was adopted for organising ground
visits because it was felt necessary to standardise the
process. The reasons for adopting a common proceedure
were numerous and were in part a response to the need to
offer support to the staff working at the football
ground, as well as support to the visitors.
Other reasons stemmed from a more practical base and
involved organising the times of the visits around the?
day to day running of the football club in order to cause
the minimum disruption to the business.
Eventually certain days and times were negotiated with
the football club when ground visits could take place and
these were any Mondays Tuesday or Wednesday from 4pm till
Sprn. The method of arranging the visits was as follows
                 i.) The Task Tearn wou 1d r ecei ve a t & 1ephone
call from a social worker representing a bereaved person
or a survivor, or a member of the public, indicating a
desir'e to vi si t t.he f ootba .11 ground .
In the event of the ground being approached directly by
any of the above, the receptionist at the stadium would
refer the caller to the Task Team.
                 2                   > A m u t u a 11 y s u it a to1e d a y a n d d a t e w o u Icl
be arrived at between the Task iearn and the caller.
                 3) The secretary to the football club was
then contacted to ascertain the suitability of the date.
                 4) The date would be confirmed with the
caller if suitable, if not, -alternative dates would have
to be suggested and the process would begin again.

Dear Colleague,
                         Re: Hillsborough Disaster

    I am writing to you to ask if you would be land enough to take part in a
survey on the Hillsborough disaster. I am a clinical psychologist employed by
Sheffield Health Authority. My post was created in response to the
Hillsborough disaster. Part of my role is to collaborate with the Hillsborough
Task Team arid the Medical Research Council in order to carry out a survey.
The purpose of the survey, which has the support of the Unit General Managers
arid ethical approval, is to find out:

  a)   what   effects the disaster had upon staff
  b)   what   supports were available to sta ff and how effective they were
  c)   what   supports should now be made available in Sheffield
  d)   what   provision should be made for supporting sta ff in future diasters.

To succeed it is important that as many people as possible participate in the
survey.

    I     would be very grateful if you would participate in the survey by doing
one of the following:

1) if you were involved or were affected by the disaster through your
   work, or personal life , please complete the enclosed questionnaires and
   return them in the prepaid envelope provided. Please tick 1 in the reply
   section on the next page.
2) if you were not involved or affected by the disaster, please do not f i l l
   in the questionnaires but tick 2 in the reply section overleaf and return
   the questionnaires in the envelope provided.
3) i f you were involved or affected by the disaster but do not wish to take
   part in the survey please tick 3 in the reply section overleaf and return
   the questionnaires unmarked.

It is hoped to contact a small sample of those involved or affected by the
disaster to conduct a second survey. The second survey w ill look in more
detail at stress amongst staff caused by the disaster.

   i would like to thank you for your cooperation.
                         Vours sincerely,



                              Jane Kunkler
                        Senior Clinical Psychologist
Notes on Confidentialitu

Vour name was obtained from the payroll of the Northern General or the Royal
Hallamshire Hospital as it was thought this was the best way to reach the
m ajority of N.H.S. staff involved or affected by the disaster.

1) Replies to the survey w ill be computerised by sta ff at the M.R.C./E.S.R.C.
   Unit of Social and Applied Psychology in Sheffield.

2) No names w ill be w ritten on the survey forms or put into the computer.
   Only survey numbers w ill be used.

3) Personal details w ill be treated in strictest confidence by the
   M.R.C./E.S.R.C. and w ill not be available to hospital management
   or to any other organisation or individual.

4) Any quotations w ill be disguised to protect your identity.

5) The results of the survey w ill be made available to staff.

Notes of meeting 26.7.69 (Wednesday)

Present: Jane Kunkler and
                        on holiday, and it was agreed the agenda did not
         require an additional member of the task team to be present at
         this meeting).

1) It was noted that some members of the task team had met
representatives from vo untary agencies this afternoon at a meeting
arranged by

   The Red Cross have sent in a lis t of names and home addresses so that
volunteers can be contacted but some volunteers have expressed disquiet
at their names being released, it was suggested at the meeting that the
Red Cross contact Jane Kunkler directly to discuss this as the
questionnaires have not yet been sent out to Red Cross volunteers.

   Concerns were raised about confidentiality and the survey. RMcS was
able to clarify some points about confidentiality. All members of the task
team available are to be shown the questionnaires and cover le tte r
tomorrow at Hillsborough.

2) The need to make progress on implementing the survey was stressed.

 ) Payroll lis ts of s ta ff at the NHG could be available on Friday 28th July.
Forwarding addresses (AR to cla rify if this means home or work
addresses) would be available for junior doctors. There is already a lis t
available of s ta ff who worked over the W/E of the disaster.
 Although efforts have been made it has not been possible to make contact
with the Unit Personnel Officer who is the only person able to sanction the
release of a payroll lis t from the RHH.

  !t was noted that the staff of the Psychiatric Units of the NGH and RHH
w ill not be on the two hospital payrolls. (Nor w ill some doctors, ciinice]
psychologists., the school of nursing, and ambulance service personnel.
Ways of reaching these people need to be organised.) However a lis t of
names of Psychiatric Unit staff should be available from Chris Smith
tomorrow and w ill include about 150-200 people.

  Medical Personnel at Westbrook House can help to trace doctors who
have moved posts. AR has lis ts of junior doctors employed 1) at the time
of the disaster and 2) after 1st of August. All lis ts of doctors need to be
cross checked in order to clarify which doctors have/have not moved
posts.

4) implementing the survey.
Possibilities discussed: (action c. decided upon)

a) sending questionnaires to the psychiatric Unit at the NGH fir s t as a
pilot, study as lis ts of names would be available tommorrow. The problem
w ith this is that 1000 questionnaires are being printed w ith a cover le tte r
attached which is most suitable fo r doctors and not other workers as it.
doesn’t include the points that. 1) the unions have been consulted and
support the survey, and 2) the stewards and occupational health nurses
w ill be able to help people complete forms if required. (Union agreement
was not. available at. time of going to press). Also management in the
Psychiatric unit, have not yet been briefed about the the survey and their
support sought.

b) sending questionnaires to junior doctors before the end of July when
they move jobs.

c) sending questionnaires to all doctors at the RHH and NGH as soon as
possible using the 1000 letters and questionnaires already being printed.

     w ill try to get the survey onto the agenda of the medical consultant's
meeting at the RHH on Wed. 1st August. The aim is to obtain their support,
fo r the survey (and ? to ask them to use the information available in their
teams to ensure that the questionnaires reach staff who may have moved
j o b s ) . □ w i l l speak to Dr. Alderson, chairperson of the consultant's
committee at the NGH, to ask him how to obtain the support of consultants
at the NGH. Possibilities to be discussed include \)           sending a le tte r
w ith the questionnaires appologising for not having had the opportunity to
discuss the survey w ith the consultants at their meeting before sending
out questionnaires as the survey needed to be sent, out urgently, 2)
consultant psychiatrists Andrew McNiell and Malcolm Peet who were
involved with the disaster and its aftermath to contact consultants
personally, 3) persuade a consultant who is not either a psychiatrist or an
occupational health physician to contact colleagues.

d) Send questionnaires to heads of departments to complete and think how
best to conduct, the survey in their department.

5}            |has reported that the politicians want a survey to be
conducted. She asked for £20,000 funding for a survey but was told
£100,000 has been allocated to                  re the disaster and that her
funding should come out of that allocation,          is hoping to obtain some
funding for the council part of the survey already planned. It was thought
best that the survey should be proposed to the council by                 ano
                of th e council's
between          and              w ill be arranged to brief       about the
questionnaires and cover le tte r and to discuss how best to obtain support
for and implement the survey in the council setting. (? should this meeting
involve anyone else).

6)     w ill telephone Mr. Reddington, Trust Fund Manager of the disaster
fund, to ask how best to seek funding for a survey from the disaster fund.
A rough estimate of costs was made so that a request for the total cost of
the fir s t survey can be made. (Is the second survey to be conducted in this
6 month period or later?).
m.
People to be surveued
RHH and NGH payrolls                                = approx. 7000 people
people on District and Region payrolls in NHS (ambulance)
   and those in other hospitals who may want to be
   included in the survey having heard about it      = approx. 3000 people
City Council (total employees approx. 35,000)        = guess 10,000
Voluntary agencies
   7 agencies plus clergy each w ith 100 people      = 800 people
                                 Total no. people    = approx. 20,800

Costs of surveu
1000 questionnaires plus le tte r cost approx. £500.00 to print
(Some questionnaires w ill be reusable but some people may
loose their questionnaires and need replacements when prompted
to return their forms. Printing costs w ill reduce with bigger print runs.)
                              20,800 questionnaires = approx. £10,400.00

to type data into computer at £1 per questionnaire      =        £20,800.00

envelopes to send out forms = 20,800 x 12p            =           £2496.00
pre paid envelopes 20,800 x (12p + 14p)              =            £5408.00
postage for non internal mail (eg Drs. moved on)     =               £40.00
reminders to reply (could be sent in pay slip to all
  as a single sheet of paper) 20,800 sheets of
  paper x (.5p per sheet per printed sheet)          =             £312.00
Circular to all heads of departments and heads of
  divisions of eg. medicine, surgery and A&E about
  importance of survey and to ask them to encourage
  staff at staff meetings to participate, to ensure
  survey reaches s ta ff who have moved on,
  (guessed no. of NHS &. Council departments = 300 x
  .5p per printed sheet+ envelope 12p                 =              £37.50

                                         Est. total cost = £39,493.5
AR to ask disaster fund for £40,000.00 either in stages., or as lump sum, or
as regular payment over 4 months according to Mr Reddington's advice.
(Bridging money could be requested of Neil McKay if disaster fund prepared
to pay ultimately). (No further print runs can be sanctioned w hilst DS is
away unless funding is known to be forthcoming.)

7) AR to ask Unit personnel officers for advice about how to distribute the
questionnaires given that the next pay packet delivery w ill be too late
being at the end of August.

8) to stamp delivery envelope "important" -ie. not a circular
   ? add "early reply requested".

Dear

The 30th Anniversary of the foundation of Cruse takes place in the first
week of October this year, and as part of the celebrations we are holding
a service of Thanksgiving in Sheffield Cathedral at 3.p.m. on Sunday
October 8th.    The Lord Mayor and Lady Mayoress have accepted invitations,
and the Master Cutler has also been invited.

We have also invited to this service other organisations, voluntary and
statutory who are working in the same sort of area of concern, particularly
those with whom we were associated during the Hillsborough experience.

We would very much like for members of the Family & Community Services who
were involved at Hillsborough or the Medico Legal Centre to join us at this
service, and there will be an opportunity for each organisation represented
to make a small contribution to the service itself.

To plan this, representatives are meeting at the Cathedral on Tuesday August
15th at 12.30.p.m. Coffee will be provided, but pleased bring a packed meal
as this will be a working lunch.

I do hope this invitation can be extended to all who might have been involved
and that you will be able to encourage somebody to come to this preliminary
meeting.

With Best Wishes,

Yours sincerely,




B. R. Cranwell. (Rev)
Chairman.

Dear Friends,

Cruse 30 Years Thanksgiving Service,
Sheffield Cathedral,. October 8th 1989 at 3.00.p.m.


At the Planning Meeting held recently for this service, it was agreed
that organisations would participate in the following ways -

1.   By a representative from each organisation reading one of the
Prayers of Thanksgiving at the start of the service, or one of the
other readings. Prayers will be in the form of a litany, with a response
from the congregation at the end of each.

As anonymity is important to some organisations, the Prayers have been so
arranged as to cover the work done, but not identifying any one speaker with
a particular organisation.

2.   Towards the end of the service there will be an act of dedication
at which representatives are asked to bring forward something which symbolises
the work of their organisation. For example Cruse in Sheffield will bring a
floral 'Cruse*. A wreath or floral spray, picture or other artefact are
requested, which will be laid around the Paschal candle at the front.

The Sheffield Girls High School Choir (Conductor Mary Cobbold) have kindly
agreed to lead the singing at this service.

Important
 It would be most helpful if you would telephone Val Whitehouse at Cruse,
(or myself after 17th September) to confirm -
a)    Who will    be representing your organisation to do                    a reading.
b)    That youwill be contributing something tothe act of dedication.
       A few notes that will enable me to state to the congregation —                             AAAsepd]

i)    What you are presenting,
ii)   Whatthis symbolises,
will be greatly appreciated.

There will be a short rehearsal in the Cathedral at 5.00.p.m. on Friday
October 6th. Please help to relieve my anxieties about this service by being
represented, and let us know in advance who will be coming if possible.

Thank you for your help.

Yours sincerely,



B. R, Cranwell*    (Rev)

We thank you Lord that you listen.  And today we give special thanks
for those who - in surgeries, in groups, face-to-face, on the telephone -
to those in despair, to those who find difficulty in day to day living,
to those under stress and those who through lack of self respect or
self confidence think of harming themselves or others.

LORD IN YOUR MERCY           “                HEAR OUR PRAYER

We give thanks for those who, having suffered'the death of a child
themselves have been given the special grace-which enables them to bring
support to others. We give thanks too for those who by their skill have
laboured, to overcome so. many of the diseases of childhood which claimed
earlier generations.

LORD IN YOUR MERCY                            HEAR OUR PRAYER

We give special thanks to the members of the Home Care Services, Social
Workers, and all-in the Home Nursing and caring services, have comforted
those who are alone, who have lost a partner, or whose physical
disabilities or other circumstances prevent them from contact with their
relatives or friends. We give thanks for their concern and expression of
love.

LORD IN YOUR'MERCY                            HEAR OUR PRAYER

We remember with gratitude today the work of the Founder of Cruse, Margaret
Torrie, and those who have built up the organisation and its Branches
throughout the Nation over the past 30 years. We give thanks for all who
have contributed to the-Sheffield, Rotherham and Chesterfield Branches, for
those working to establish the Barnsley Branch, and for all those who work
patiently week after week with the bereaved, and serve on Committees. We
give thanks too for those who have helped the relatives and friends of
those who have suffered in major disasters, after Aberfan, Zeebrugge, Bradford
Stadium, Kings Cross, Hungerford, Piper Alpha, the vessel Marchioness, and
for the co-operation between agencies in this city, which has come out of
the HillsuOxOugii Disaster.

Now in a moment of silence, let us each recall the significant losses
in our own lives.
Let us call to mind those who were specially supportive at these times,
and give thanks for all they gave to us.

               The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want;
                 he makes me down to lie
               In pastures green; he leadeth me
                 the quiet waters by.


               My soul he doth restore again,

               My head thou dost with oil anoint,
                and my cup overflows.

The'lump that swells inside my throat
brings pain that tries to choke.
Then tears course down my cheeks -
I drop my head in my so empty hands
abandoning myself to deep dark grief
and know that with the passing time
will come relief.
That though the pain may stay
There soon will come a day
When I can say her name and be at peace.

Norah Leney.


All is not lost

There is no magical anaesthetic for the pain of grief ... We cannot
give to the bereaved the ‘
                         pne thing they most want; we cannot call
back Lazarus, or Bert or Harry from the dead. The bereaved know that.
They know that 'There is nothing you can say.' And they have seen
others turn away, embarrassed by their uselessness.  But anyone who
turns towards the widow and widower and gives confidence that they do
have something to offer at moments of utter despair helps to reassure them
that all is not lost. Goodness is not gone from the world because one
good person has died. Meaning has not gone 'from life because one who meant
so much is no longer present. The loss of one trusted person need not
undermine trust in all of those who remain.

Colin Murray Parkes.

                  Self-giving
Lord of all power,* I give you my will,
in joyful obedience your tasks to fulfil.
   Your bondage is freedom, your service is song,
   and, held in your keeping, my weakness is strong.
                         2
Lord of all wisdom, I give you my mind,
rich truth that surpasses man’s knowledge to.find.
   What eye has not seen and what ear has not heard
   is taught by your Spirit and shines from your Word.
                        3
Lord of all bounty, I give you my heart;
I praise and adore you for all you impart:
   Your love to inspire me, your counsel to guide,
   your presence to cheer me, whatever betide.
                       4
Lord of all being, I give you my all;
if e’er I disown you I stumble and fall;

   I walk in your freedom to the end of the way.

 Leader:          Let us pray


 We remember before you 0 God the slenderness of the threads

 which    separate   life from death
 which    separate   security and stability from fear and disruption
 which    separate   good health from sickness or infirmity
 which    separate   the good from the bad

 Help us and those we seek to serve to know that on both
 sides of those divisions your love reaches out to us.
 Persuade our hearts and minds that in disruption, in sickness,
 in times of danger, in separation or in death, neither we nor’
 those we serve, nor'those we love are parted from you.
 In you may we find our peace.
 And may we all be united in the glorious body of Christ who
 has burst the bonds of death and is alive for evermore, our
 Saviour and theirs, in whose name we pray.                  '

All       AMEN

We pray for all who- give their time, talents and gifts to
furthering the work of healing of body, mind and spirit among those        •
who suffer in any way.
We pray especially for the organisations represented here today, and
in silence we bring to mind the organisations we are individually

Leader:          0 God of justice and truth
                 Who has decreed that we practice justice to one another
                 Forgive us when we are complacent in our attitudes to the
                 poor, the hungry, the handicapped, or in trouble brought on
                 by themselves or by others.
      In a society where those who shout loudest and push
      hardest are often best rewarded.
      Open our eyes to injustice around us, and especially
      any of which we are part, and help us to give of our
      time, our comfort, our possessions and ourselves, in
      the service of others and yourself.

      Through Jesus Christ our Lod.

       despair, to those who find difficulty in day

       skill have laboured to overcome so many
       of the diseases of childhood which claimed
       earlier generations.

        prevent them from contact with their
        relatives or friends. We give thanks for

      The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me,
      because the Lord has anointed me
      to bring good tidings to the afflicted;
      he has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted,;
      to proclaim liberty to the captives,
      and the opening of the prison to those
      who are bound;
      to proclaim the year of the Lord's favour,
      and the day of vengeance of our God;
      to canfort all who mourn;
      to grant to those .who mourn in Zion -
      to give them a garland instead of ashes,
      the oil of gladness instead of mourning,
      the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit
      that they may be called oaks of righteousness,
      the planting of the Lord, that he may be
      glorified.
      They shall build up the ancient ruins,
      they shall raise up the former devastations;
      they shall repair the ruined cities,
      the devastations of many generations.

GRIEF


Deep sobs -
that start beneath my heart
and hold my body in a grip that hurts.
The lump that swells inside my throat
brings pain that tries to choke.
Then tears course down my cheeks -
I drop my head in my so empty hands
abandoning myself to deep dark grief
and know that with the passing time
will ccme relief.
That though the pain may stay
There soon will cane a day
When I can say her name and be at peace.


                      Norah Leney


ALL    IS   NOT L O S T


There is no magicpA anaesthetic for the
pain of grief ...    cannot give to the
bereaved the one thing they most want;
we cannot call back Lazarus, or Bert or
Harry fran the dead. Ihe bereaved know
that. They know that 'There is nothing
you can say'. And they have seen others
turn away, embarrassed by their uselessness
But anyone who turns towards the widow
and widower and gives confidence that they
do have something to offer at moments of
utter despair helps to reassure than that
all is not lost. Goodness is not gone
fran the world because one good person
has died. Meaning has not gone frcm life
because one who meant so much is no
longer present. The loss of one trusted
person need not undermine trust in all of
those who remain.

Seeing the crowds, he went up on the
mountain, and when he sat down his
disciples came to him. And he opened his
mouth and taught them, saying:
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs
is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall
be comforted.
Blessed are the meek, for they shall
inherit the earth.
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst
for righteousness, for they shall be
satisfied.
Blessed are tie merciful, for they
shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for
they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they
shall be called sons of God.
Blessed are those who are persecuted for
righteousness' sake, for theirs is the
kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are you when men revile you
and persecute you and utter all kinds
of evil against you falsely on my account.
Rejoice and be glad, for your reward
is great in heaven, for so men persecuted

     Me remember before you 0 God the
     slenderness of the threads

     which separate life frctn death
     which separate security and stability
     frcm fear and disruption
     which separate good health fran sickness
     or infirmity
     which separate the good frcm the bad
     Help us and those we seek to serve
     to know that on both sides of these
     divisions your love reaches out to us.
     Persuade our hearts and minds that in
     disruption, in sickness, in times of
     danger, in separation or in death, neither
     we nor those we serve, nor those we
     love are parted fircm you.
     In you may we find our peace.
     And may we all be united in the glorious
     body of Christ, who has burst the bonds
     of death and is alive for evermore, our
     Saviour and theirs, in whose name we
     pray.

     0 Lord our God
     Whose son Jesus Christ befriended the
     unloved and outcasts of society, who
     healed the sick, and mourned with those
     who mourned.
     We pray for all who give their time, talents
     and gifts to furthering the work of
     healing of body, mind and spirit among
     those who suffer in any way.
     We pray especially for the organisations
     represented here today, and in silence
     we bring to mind the organi sations we
     are individually involved in.

       all movements which seek to advance
       your kingdom in special spheres of work
       or particular neighbourhoods.
       And make us ever mindful of the
       encouragement given to us by your
       scai Jesus Christ who premised that
       whatever we do for others we do also
       for him.

       We pray in the name of the same Jesus
       Christ our Lord

        0 God of justice and truth
        Who has decreed that we practice
        justice to one another
        Forgive us when we are complacent in
        our attitudes to the poor, the hungry,
        the handicapped, or in trouble brought
        on by themselves car by others.
        In a society where these who shout
        loudest and push hardest are often best
        rewarded.
        Open our eyes to injustice around us, and
        especially any of which we are part, and
        help us to give of our time, our comfort,
        our posessions and ourselves, in the
        service of others and yourself.

        Through Jesus Christ our Lord




 AU      AMEN


 All    Our Father in heaven,
        hallowed be your name,
        your kingdom come,
        your will be done,
        on earth as in heaven.
        Give us today our daily bread.
        Forgive us our sins
        as we forgive those who sin against us.
        Lead us not into tenptation
        but deliver us fran evil.
         For the kingdom, the power, and the
         glory are yours
         now and forever. Amen.
HYMN.       Now thank we all our God.


Now thank we all our God,
With heart, and hands, and voices,
Who wondrous things hath done,
In Whan His world rejoices;
Who fran our mother's arms
Hath bless'd us on our way
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours today.

Through all our life be near us,
With ever joyful hearts
And blessed peace to cheer us;
And keep us in His grace,
And guide us when perplexed,
And free us fran all ills
In this world and the next.

Whan earth and Heaven adore,
For thus it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.

The Work of CRUSE.



The death of a loved one is a
shattering experience. The bereaved
are faced with the painful and
daunting task of coping with all
that bereavement brings. There is
the challenge of finding a new
sense of life and purpose.


All this takes time - nearly always
longer than we think; help of many
kinds may be needed - help that is
not always readily available.


CRUSE - the national organisation
for the bereaved - exists to provide
such help. Founded in 1959, it now
offers support to all bereaved
people, whatever their age or
circumstances.


Branches of CRUSE exist in Sheffield,
Rotherham, Chesterfield, Doncaster,
Barnsley, Bassetlaw.


There are now over 150 Branches of
CRUSE registered in the United
Kingdom, with nearly 5,000 volunteers
covering over 50% of the country.
This constitutes the world's
largest single bereavement care
organisation.



Local Branches are always on the look­
out for volunteers to be trained
as Counsellors, or to assist in
social groups or administration.


If you can help, please contact
CRUSE in Sheffield, 69 Division Street,

 Re. Help available ior people post Hillsborough Football Stadium Disaster

 Dear

 A task team of four social workers and a clinical psychologist has been established
 to work with members of the Sheffield Community who have been disordered by the
 Hillsborough disaster. It is possible that some of those who were more seriously
 affected have or will contact their general practitioner complaining of a variety
 of physical or psychological disorders.

 The role of the Hillsborough Task Team is to provide counselling and support for
 individuals (or groups) who are distressed. A small number of people will develop
 post traumatic stress disorder. The symptons of which are:
     1. Recurrent and intrusive distressing recollections of the event.
     2. Recurrent distressing dreams.
     3. Sudden acting or feeling as if the traumatic event were recurring.
     4. Intense psychological distress at exposure to events that symbolize or
        resemble an aspect of the traumatic event.
    5. Efforts to avoid thoughts or feelings associated with the trauma.
    6 . Psychogenic amnesia.
    7. Diminished interest in significant activities.
    6 . Feeling of detachment or estrangement from others.
    9. Restricted range of affect.
    10.Sense of foreshortened future.
    11.Difficulties falling or staying asleep.
    12.Irritability or outbursts of anger.
    13.Difficulty concentrating.
    14.Hypervigilance.
    15.Exagerated startle response.
    16.Physiologic reactivity on exposure to events that symbolize or resemble an
        aspect of the traumatic event.
The services that our4team can offer ares
          Personal counselling
          Social work support
          Group work
          Stress management
          Practical/financial help
          De-briefing for professional staff/rescue workers
If any of your patients would benefit from the services we provide you can refer them
directly to our office in the Hillsborough library. We are available between 09.00
17.00 hrs. Mon - Fri on Sheffield 734666. Messages can be left on our answerphone
outside these hours. Please contact us if you require any further advice or informa­
tion about the Task Team.

 Dear

Some weeks ago a letter regarding the establishment of the Hillsborough Task
Team along with some leaflets and a poster advertising our services and
whereabouts was sent to your surgery.

I trust that the information has been helpful to your patients. I do however
appreciate that some of your patients may have approached your for assistance
in the days inunediately following the tradgedy at Hillsborough and may not have
returned to the surgery since our leaflets arrived.

We fully appreciates the need for confidentiality to be maintained on behalf of
your patients and would not therefore request names or details of any person
vino may have sought your help. We would however like to ensure hhat details
of our services are available to them should they wish to pursue further support
and counselling. It is for this reason that a letter from the Task Team has
been prepared for you to send to any patient that you feel will benefit from
our services.

          of the new football season is only a couple of weeks away and it
might be expected that some«people will experience renewed emotional and
psychological difficulties. It is important that we try to respond to their
needs as quickly as possible. Youprassistance in helping us to reach these people
is therefore greatly appreciated.

Should you require any further information, letters or 'Coping with Hillsborough'
leaflets please do not hesitate to contact me.

       Dear

      A team of social workers, with a clinical psychologist has been established to
      work with the people of Sheffield who have been affected by the Hillsborough
      disaster.  Our helping skills, we believe, can most directly be offered via
      those professionals involved in primary health care, who will see those most
      seriously affected. We have a wide range of skills and resources which can
      be offered directly to individuals and groups.

      As you will be aware, individuals and communities have been deeply traumatised
      by the disaster, for most the immediate shock reaction may have passed. Our
      role is with those who have been unable to deal with their immediate emotional
      reactions and risk longer term psychological difficulties. These problems
      are generally defined as being post-traumatic stress disorders.  Those affected
      m y present themselves at surgeries or health centres with a range of,
      familiar uo you, symptoms. Our services can now be added to the responses which
      you might make. The following describes briefly the ways in which we can
      help:

      Personal counselling
      Social work support
      Clinical psychologist involvement with for example, stress management
      Help with practical/financial problems
      Group work - therapy/self help
      De-briefing for rescue workers/professional staff who were directly involved

      Direct, telephone made, referrals can be received at our office in the
      Hillsborough Library.

      We would also like to contact you in the near future in order to see if our
      services are meeting the needs.

      Finally, an important part of our work is to describe to the community
      and individuals the expected nature of their reactions and reassure people
      that their feelings will become more manageable. Could you therefore
      display the attached poster and leaflets.

      Thank you for your co-operation.  If there is any further information
      required or supplies of leaflets, please contact me.

      Yours sincerely

Dear* Dr. Popper
I am writing to you as a member of and on behalf of the Hillsborough Task Team.
Our team has been set up to help people who have been involved in or affected by
the Disaster at the Hillsborough Football Stadium.        *
One of the things that we propose to do is to set up a Study/Training day to prepare
ourselves and significant others for the Coroners Inquest.on the Disaster which I
understand is likely to be later this year or early in the New Year.
There are several points of inforaation that I need to know in order to be able to
prepare for the study day, although I can appreciate that you may not be able to
address all of them at the moment.
It would certainly be helpful to know the venue,  the commencement date (or approx­
imate), the proposed structure and order of the'proceedings'    and the names of staff
at the Coroners Court who are likely to be involved with the Inquest.This last piece
of information is required becaase it is our intention to invite some members of
the staff of the Coroners Court to the training day, because it can be expected that
given the magnitude of the Inquest it will create special probleas for the staxT
ana it helps to be prepared for these in advance.
I appreciate that the disaster at the Hillsborough Football Stadium might have
increased the workload of yourself and your staff and that your time is precious
but I would appreciate the opportunity to talk to you in more detail about the work
of tne Task Team, the training day and ways in which we can offer support to your­
self, your staff, relatives of the bereaved, and voluntary and statutory support
workers who are likely to be involved in the Inquest.
I am available between the hours of 9 - 5pm Monday to Friday at Hillsborough
Librafcy - telepnone 734666. I would be able to attend a meeting with you any time
at your convenience and look forward to hearing from you.

Yours Sincerely

      COPING      AFTER          HILLSBOROUGH
 A chance to meet up with other people from Merseyside and
 Sheffield, together with colleagues from further afield, who
 are involved in Hillsborough work.
 This will be an opportunity for those who feel isolated to
 make links with other workers.
 For those who don't feel isolated but would like the chance
 to discuss with others how the work is going, this is your
 opportunity too.
 The theme will be linking up and exchanging ideas. We will
 also be looking at how to take care of yourself whilst
 managing demanding emotional work and handling feelings of
 uncertainty: such as how much to push families and when to
 leave things be; worries about suicide risk; how to help
 people express their anger safely.
 We can also exchange ideas on how to be pro-active and
 encourage people who were at the match to come forward if
 they are finding it hard to cope.

 We are very fortunate to be offered the resource of
 Burton Manor, a Conference Centre in South Wirral, close
 to the end of the M.56 motorway, forour meeting. This
 resource has been donated free of charge by the Principal of
 Burton Manor as a contribution towards the Hillsborough effort.
 For those people who are travelling some distance, we have
 also been offered accommodation on the preceding evening
 if you need it (it would probably be possible to arrange it
 on the night of the Conference as well if you let me know).
 Accommodation will also be free of charge.

 The Conference is being arranged by Jane Harper, an experienced
 Training Consultant, Bereavement Counsellor and Crisis
 Intervention Worker. She has been appointed as the Staffline
 Co-ordinator on Merseyside by the seven Local Authorities
 involved in Hillsborough work, in conjunction with B.A.S.W.
 to co-ordinate an independent staff consultation and support
 scheme.

 It is important that you let her know as soon as possible
 whether you wish to attend the Conference, so she can send
 you details of how to get there and let Burton Manor know
 about expected numbers.   We appreciate that some people will
 be on holiday and are considering holding another Conference
 Later in the year.

 Please note, it may only be possible at this stage to offer
 places to people who are directly involved in face to face
 work with bereaved families and people present at the match,
 in terms of limited space. Numbers are insignificant.
 If you are working with only one person affected by Hillsborough —
 this Conference is for you too.

Dear

I am writing to request a copy of the Calendar news item broadcast at lunch­
time on Saturday 19th August, concerning the Hillsborough football stadium
during which there was an interview with Graham Mckrell,

I did not see the particular news item myself because I was in transit, but
I believe that part of it related to the availability of a team of Social
Workers at the Hillsborough football stadium.

I am concerned that there may have been a misunderstanding about the
availability of the Social Work team at the Sheffield Wednesday Ground itself
We were in fact available from 2pm - 5.30pm, but not at the stadium, we were
in our offices in the Hillsborough Library in Hillsborough Park about 5
minutee walk from the stadium.

We did not have any callers at all and I am interested to discover the reason
It may be ofcoonsee that the fans coped quite well on the day but it may also
be that anyone experiencing difficulties did not know where to seek help.

A copy of the relevant transcript will obviously help us to clarify the
situation and prevent further misunderstandings.

Thank you very much for your assistance in this matter and your kind offer to
broadcast further information on our behalf.




Yours sincerely

This meeting had been set   up to look at the possibility   of the counselling agencies
sharing some form of publicity about their services, particularly now that the new
football season had started. As a significant number of representatives from
agencies had been unable to attend the meeting, it was agreed that the Hillsborough
Task Team should take the   initiative about the form and   worMing of such anadvert
and then approach all the   interested agencies to see if   they wished to be included
for their comments. It was thought that the advert should be placed in the local
paper sometime in September.
It was also suggested that if the ’Coping after Hillsborough’ was remodelled then the
various agency numbers could be included on the back.
The members in attendance fed back how much work they had at the moment as a result
of the Disaster.
|                   |said that things were quiet now with no referrals coming from
the Fire Service. However she plans to go back to the Fire Service to assess how
the situation is now. I            ~~1 told the meeting of his plans to contact the
Secretary of the Fire Brigade Union and the Secretary of the Union to the Ambul­
ance Service. The purpose of this is to look at ways information about help and
counselling could be passed on to their members independently from the employers.

meeting with the Fire Brigade Union.
               informed the meeting that they have no ongoing work at the moment
connected to the disaster. They do however continue to have formal and informed
meetings with the Police through their work and would be prepared to offer help
if requested .
The Hillsborough Task Team members updated the meeting on work being done by them,
including recent approaches to and work with residents around the Sheffield Wed­
nesday Ground, and the setting up of a training day in October for those likely
to be involved with the Inquests.
The next meeting of the full Co-ordinating Group is on Tuesday 19th September at
2.30pm at Hillsborough Library.

is c e r t a i n l y      a lot       of    interest.          The main        problem            is    that       there     a re
insufficient              places       to m e e t    the       requests.            We    are     hoping       to     record

Your reference

Dear Mr Pemberton

I am writing to you to invite two members of the Hillsborough Family Support
group to a Study Day organised by the Sheffield Hillsborough Task Team. The
aim of the Study Day is to prepare for the Coroner’s Inquest which is to be
held in Sheffield, although as you will be aware, no date has been set as yet.

I have enclosed two invitations along with itineraries and directions of how
to get to the Lodge Moor hospital conference centre, where the Study Day will
be held on Friday 6 October 1989. I would have liked to have offered more
places to the Hillsborough Family Support group but because places are limited
for everyone, I regret that this has not been possible.

The purpose of the day is to bring together those who are likely to be in­
volved in the Inquest, to discuss some of the issues that might arise during
the Inquest proceedings.  This obviously includes yourselves, some social
workers and solicitors. Speaking at the Study Day will be speakers from Kent and
London who were involved in the Inquests following the disaster at Zeebrugge
and Kings Cross, a solicitor representing the Steering Committee and a Coroner
from a neighbouring authority.

I sincerely hope that two of your members will be able to accept this
invitation and look forward to meeting them. I would be grateful if you could
indicate who will be attending the Study Day on the reply slip and return it to
me at your earliest convenience.

I fthere is anything that you wish to discuss with me prior to the date of
the Study Day, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I would be happy to
meet with you or other members of your group to discuss the Study Day in
more detail if you should wish this. I will telephone you sometime during
the week before the Study day to confirm arrangements if I have not heard
anything from you before this time.

A. copy of this letter has been sent to Mr Trevor Hicks.

Once again, I do hope that two of your members will be able to attend and
look forward to meeting them on Friday 6 October.

Yours sincerely




Social worker

Dear Mr Pemberton

I am writing to you to invite two members of the Hillsborough Family Support
group to a Study Day organised by the Sheffield Hillsborough Task Team. The
aim of the Study Day is to prepare for the Coroner’s Inquest which is to be
held in Sheffield, although as you will be aware, no date has been set as yet.

 I have enclosed two invitations along with itineraries and directions of how
 to get to the Lodge Moor hospital conference centre, where the Study Day will
 be held on Friday 6 October 1989. I would have liked to have offered more
 places to the Hillsborough Family Support group but because places are limited
 for everyone, I regret that this has not been possible.

The purpose of the day is to bring together those who are likely to be in­
volved in the Inquest, to discuss some of the issues that might arise during
the Inquest proceedings.  This obviously includes yourselves, some social
workers and solicitors. Speaking at the Study Day will be speakers from Kent and
London who were involved in the Inquests following the disaster at Zeebrugge
and Kings Cross, a solicitor representing the Steering Committee and a Coroner
from a neighbouring authority.

I sincerely hope that two of your members will be able to accept this
invitation and look forward to meeting them. I would be grateful if you could
indicate who will be attending the Study Day on the reply slip and return it to
me at your earliest convenience.

If there is anything that you wish to discuss with me prior to the date of
the Study Day, please do not hesitate to contact me.  I would be happy to
meet with you or other members of your group to discuss the Study Day in
more detail if you should wish this. I will telephone you sometime during
the week before the Study day to confirm arrangements if I have not heard
anything from you before this time.

A copy of this letter has been sent to Mr Trevor Hicks.

Once again, I do hope that two of your members will be able to attend and
look forward to meeting them on Friday 6 October.

Yours sincerely




Social worker

Sear

Thank you very much for sending me a copy of the notes
of the meeting held on the 7th of September between yourself,
Angela Rowland and me. I would like to make a few comments
on the numbered paragraphs

        1.     If the S.P.P. were to bring for example, manslaughter
               charges then the Inquest might well be considerably
               shorter than it otherwise might be. If on the other
               hand he were to bring charges of a minor nature, this
               might not have any effect on the length of the Inquest.
               It is very difficult for me to estimate the length
               of the Inquest. Three months I would have thought
               would be the absolute outside, but I would hope that
               it might be a little bit shorter than that.

      2.        Obviously I have not yet decided on the location and
                whilst I think that Watery Street might well be suitable
                if a major prosecution were undertaken by the D.P.P. I
                would have to assess it at the time.

      4.        I think Mr. Potter will give you a talk on the functions
                of Coroners in general and no doubt will explain the
                effect that proceedings for say murder or manslaughter
                has on the Ooroner's jurisdiction, but I do not think it
                is correct that he will focus on the outcome of the
                S.P.P. investigation, in fact it must be clearly
                understood that he will not be in a position to make
                any comments on Hillsborough at all.

I hope this clarifies the position slightly.
Mr. Potter
Coroner
South Yorkshire Bast District

                                                   HTT.AR.BW                    25 September 1989


Dear Mr. Potter,

I understand from Dr. Popper that you have very kindly offered to
sp«ak at the training day arranged by the Hillsborough Task Team
to prepare for the Inquest following the Hillsborough disaster.

I have enclosed an itinery along with directions of how to get to
the Conference Centre at Lodge Moor Hospital Sheffield, where the
Training Day will  take place on 6 October 1989.

I also understand   from Dr. Popper that you will not be in a position
to make any comments at all on Hillsborough and I fully appreciate
this. However you   will note from the Itinery that we have included
"Options following the D.P.P's Report** after yourtfektk on the work
of the Coroner's Court. The kind of information that we require is
more general and could be applied to any similar situation not
specifically to Hillsborough. We were therefore hoping that you
might be able to give some indication of the types of inquest that
might take place depending on the decisions of the D.P.P.

I will of course make sure that our chairperson, namely assistant
director John Pilling, is fully aware of your position in being
unable to discuss Hillsborough and it would perhaps be helpful
if he can indicate this at his introduction to your speech.

For your information, th e majority of people w h o will be a t t e n d i n g
the Training Day w il l be social workers, w i t h s o m e r e p r e s e n t a t i o n
f r o m s o l i c i t o r s and the H i l l s b o r o u g h r a m i l y S u p p o r t G r o u p , w h i c h
is the s e l f h e l p group set up by members o f t h e b e r e a v e d families.

If you would like clarification on any particular point or further
Information about the Training Day please do not hesitate to
contact me.

I would be happy to meet with you prior to the T r a i n i n g D a y                             to
discuss things In more detail if you should wish this.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for taking the
time to speak at our Training Day and to let you know how much this
is appreciated.

Iwfclll contact you in a few days before the Training Day to confirm
the arrangements.

I look forward to meeting you on 6 October.

Yours sincerely,




social worker

Dear :

I hope that this letter finds you well. I an writing to you principally to thank
you for taking the time to attend our inquest training day on Friday, 6th October
but also to let you know how much the day was appreciated by those who attended.

Unfortunately you missed the plenary session because you had to leave early for
your train, but I would like you to know that the feedback from both social workers
and members of the Hillsborough Family Support group was extremely positive.
Everyone, without esception, felt that they learnt a great deal from the day
and that it was a huge success. Your contribution played a large narfc in making
it a success and your presence was, I ax sure, a source of comfort and strength to
the members of the Hillsborough Family Support group, namely Mr Pemberton and Mrs
Sefton.

I trust that we can do something positive with what we have learned from your own
experience and it is ray intention to convey the issues that you talked about to our
Coroner, Dr Popper, and hopefully prevent a similar situation arising to the one
that you found yourself in when the Kings Cross inquest took place.

I would be grateful if you could send your travel expenses claim directly to me
and I will reimburse you as soon as possible.

Once again, thank you very much for attending and speaking at our inquest training
day.

I wish you well in the future.     Take care of yourself.

Yours s i n c e r e l y ,




on behalf of Hillsborough Task Team

Dear Mr Potter,

I am writing to you on behalf of the Hillsborough Task Team to thank you for your
most Informative and comprehensive talk on Friday, 6th October, about the work of
a Coroner and the function of a Coroner's Court.

Unfortunately, you were unable to remain to hear the other speakers, but the
feedback at the plenary session from those attending was that the day was a huge
success and everyone had learned a great deal. Your Introduction to the work of
a Coroner's Court was in part responsible for the success of the day because it
enabled people to understand the legal machinery governing Coroners’ Cowpfcs.

I would be grateful if you could forward your travel expenses directly to me at
the Hillsborough Library and I will reimburse them as soon as possible.

Thank you once again for your valuable contribution towards the success of our
training day.

Yours sincerely,

Dear

I hope that this letter finds you well and trust that you had a safe journey back
to London last Friday. I would like to thank you most sincerely on behalf of the
Hillsborough Task Team and the people who attended our training day on 6th
Octcberj 1989, for your presentation concerning the Kings Crass inquest.

Unfortunately you had to leave before the plenary session and you were therefore
unable to hear the very positive and enthusiastic f^edbac^ from the course
attenders. I believe that the training day fulfill?ri twc functions; firstly it
provided people with much needed information about how to prepare for an inquest
following a major disaster, but secondly it gave people an opportunity to neet
and to give and receive support from one another and everyone found this very
reassuring.

I have enclosed a letter for Sophie and would be gratefui if you could forward it
to her. Please send your expenses claitns to me and I will reimburse you as soon
as possible.

Finally, I would like to say that the Training Day was a hui*e success and Sophie's
Bad your own contri butions played a large part in raaking it such a success.

Thank you once again for your efforts.

I wish you well for the future.

Dear Mr Fraser,

I am writing to you on behalf of the Hillsborough Task Team to thank you for
your most informative presentation at our Inquest Training Day on 6th October,
1939.

My apologies once again for failing to make it clear to you that I wanted you
to actually speak on the day. I think I did mention this to the Secretary and
assumed that the information had been passed on. I am not, however, sorry
that I asked the Liverpool solicitors Steering Committee to participate,
because your contribution to the day was in part responsible for its huge
success.

The  feedback from those who attended has been most enthusiastic and positive
and we have already had letters of thanks from people who found the day of
great value to then in their work with bereaved families.

I would be grateful if you could forward your travel expenses claim directly
to me and I will reimburse you as soon as possible.

Thank you once again for your time and I look forward to meeting you again in
the future.

Dear Mr Wilkinson,

I hope that this letter finds you well. I am writing on behalf of the Hillsborough
Task Team to thank you for your most thought-provoking and moving presentation about
the Seebrugge disaster, on Friday, 6th October.

It was a shame that you had to leave before the plenary session because the feedback
from the people who attended was extremely positive and enthusiastic. The training
day was a huge success and your contribution played a large part in making it such
a success.

I believe that the training day fulfilled two functions; firstly it provided people

Dear f            1

Many thanks for your letter of the 11th October, please accept my apologies
for the delay in responsing.

Thank you for your kind comments about my contribution,  I certainly
felt the meeting was worthwhile and I learned from others who spoke
and from many of the people who attended.

I firmly believe that contact between your team and our Committee should
be retained for a number of reasons and if I receive information which
I feel might be of benefit to you I will certainly pass it on.

In all the circumstances I do not propose                                  making      a   claim       for   expenses
but thank you for your very kind offer.

Yours sincerely

               to be played at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.


The 29th of N o v e m b e r will be an evocative and emotional occasion for
all who will be involved. This will be the first time since the         '- - ■ •
disaster the two teams have met and many people who were survivors
or at the ground on the 15th of April will be v i s iting the ground
again. For those who saw the tragedy unfold from a distance the
29th of N o v e m b e r could be an equally powerful occasion.

Careful prep a r a t i o n s have been made to ensure that a c o m p r e h e n s i v e
service is a v ailable for all who might need it on that day and
afterwards. Advice and c o u n s e l l i n g support will be readily
ava i l a b l e at the ground for v i s i t i n g spectators, S h e ffield Wed n e s d a y
fans and people who will be w o r k i n g there on that night. For the wider
She f f i e l d public the t e lephone 734666 will be M w w d until 1~B=#e
10.30 pm.                                                  SU flW

These services will be provided by a team of social workers
from Sheffield, the North West and c o u n s ellors from local
v o l untary o r g anisations. A local community centre, near the
ground will be used as a base for the evening services and
two local churches
will also be open.

These services have been planned and c o - o r d i n a t e d f o l lowing

Dear

I called to see you at 10.00 a.m. on Friday, 24th November as arranged tn
my earlier letter of 16th November. Unfortunately, you were not in. I
understand from your neighbour that you work during the day and so it Is
obviously difficult for you to be available during the daytime. It may be
that you did not receive me earlier letter and if this is the case, I would
like to explain the reason for my visit. I belong to a team of social
workers set up to work with people following the disaster at Hillsborough.
We are currently undertaking a review of people referred to us in the weeks
immediately following the disaster, and we are visiting people who were
involved as part of this review.

I would like to come to see you at a time that might be more convenient to
you and I would be able to visit on Monday, 11th December at 6.00 p.m.

If this time is inconvenient, or you do not want me to visit you, please
write or leave a message for me at the Task Team office.

I look forward to meeting you.

an exhaustive list, there are other names that I have on the computer, but they
are people who have had no involvement with Hillsborough families for some months
and do not expect to have any involvement in the future. I can let you have
these names if you require them.

I have dismissed your offer to visit the team sometime in December with     and

someone of our choice to assist us with our communication problems.

Dear Mr ___

1 a® writing on behalf of the Hillsborough Task Tears and residents of
Sheffield and Liverpool to thank you for your most generous donation of
food on the evening of Wednesday, 29th November at the Sheffield Wednesday
v Liverpool football match.

As you w i n be aware, it was the first time that Liverpool had played at
Hillsborough since the disaster on 15th April, when 95 Liverpool fans lost
their lives and it was obviously a very emotional night for many people.

As a result of your donation, we were able to provide our volunteers and
members of the public with both hot and cold food and hot drinks. The hot
food aid drinks were particularly welcome because it was a very cold night
and I can assure you that your gesture was very much appreciated by all.

Thank you once again for the tremendous assistance that you gave us in
providing nourishment for people on a very cold, difficult night.

Yours sincerely,




Social Worker

 Dear Superintendent Sleath,

H a m writing to you on behalf of the Hillsborough Task Team to let you know
how much we appreciated the co-operation of the South Yorkshire Police at
the Sheffield Wednesday v Liverpool match at Hillsborough on 29th November.

We would like particular thanks to go to Sergeant Vic Smith, who manned the
barrier at EsSdale Hoad* He dealt with the general public in & very sensitive
and caring manner and helped to defuse soae potentially difficult situations.
He was certainly the right man for the job.

We would also appreciate the opportunity to talk to you in more detail about
how you felt things went onthe night and to find out whether the service
that we provided met the right needs.

Now that the 29th November has passed, we are starting to look towards the
anniversary of the disaster next April, it would obviously help us in the
planning and co-ordination of our services for the anniversary if we knew
how our efforts on the 29th had been received. I would be grateful if you
could contact me at the Task Teas in the near future to arrange a meeting to
discuss the above.

Thanks once again to the South Yorkshire Police for their assistance and
co-operation onfcthe night.

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours sincerely,




Hillsborough Task Team

Dear

I am writing on behalf of the Sheffield Hillsborough Task team to thank
the Wirrall Team for the assistance you provided us with at the Sheffield
Wednesday v Liverpool match on 29th November.

It was obviously a very emotional and difficult evening for many, but we
know that it was a help to ourselves and people returning from Liverpool
to have support from your team, and for many, the sight of a known, friendly
face was reassuring.

It would help our team in our recording of the 29th November if you could
send us details about your team's experience of the night’.
We have enclosed a list of headings that will help you to provide us with
the kind of information that we need. We appreciate that it’s not a good
time to send even more work your way, but the infomation could be useful
to us in our planning of future events like the anniversary and the Inquest,
and evaluating the usefulness of the service we provided on the night.

Thank you once again for your help and support on a cold and difficult
evening.

REF.NO.

              Few problems, other issues, work.          coping better.        other
              issues - a reversal of the earlier situation, Next visit in January,
              probably the final one. Coped with match.

              Missed one appointment. No further contact initiated by client.
              Unannounced visit made - no reply.  Card left.

              Trying to trace victim whom she helped into an ambulance. Efforts being
              made to trace.   May be seen in JaNUARY. Went to the match. Didn’t
              react well. Could be a final check.

           No contact 2 - 3 weeks. Needs little           this team - may have need
           to be in touch if difficulties with the      family, but next contact
           possibly final one. All relevant papers sent to Liverpool.

           Seen week ago - feeling better - didn’t think he needed to talk any
           further now that he has shared his experience and realised some of his
           feelings were '’normal” ones. Will telephone in January.

           Review Cases

          Cancelled at very short notice - wife said he is o.k. now - would contact
          us if necessary. N.F.A.

          Uorks at the ground as well as the Hallamshire Hospital. Found it
          difficult at first - seen G.P. - has been back to the ground - more times
          ~ easier - didn't need to talk about it again.   N.F.A.

          School boy - will contact teacher.

          Nurse in Bradford - helping an ex-boyfriend of ahr daughters, who was a
          victim.    The youth lives in West Riding - advice given.

Dear Mr Fraser,

I hope that this letter findssyou well. Please find enclosed our account
$f what we think you said at the Training Day on 6th October, 1989. I trust
that it is an accurate reflection of what you said, though I ’m afraid that
we got rather confused on some of the points. However, we did our best.

I will ring you in a few days’ time to discuss the document with you and if
there is anything you wish to change (unless, of course, it’s the whole
thing!), perhaps we can sort it out over the telephone.

Thank you very much for the assistance that you have already given us and
in anticipation of your future help and advice, which I ’m sure we will need.

Yours sincerely,

28th March 1990

Dear Don

RE;   PTT.TSBOROUGH INTERIM INQUEST BRIEFING DAY

Many thanks for your letter of the 22nd March.

I confirm I will be delighted to attend your Training Day and assist in           any
way I can.

I d o not know how much information you already have about H.M. Coroner’s
proposals for dealing with these Inquests but by way of background I am
enclosing the following copy letters which I trust will be of assistance:-

1.   Letter from H.M. Coroner to all Solicitors acting for bereaved families
dated 14th March 1990.

2.    Letter issued by this Comittee to all Solicitors.

3.    Letter issued by me to my own clients advising them of the position.

If there is anything in these three letters which requires clarification
before the 5th April please let roe know and I will try to assist.

Do  you want      me to confine my talk to the group to what I    think will happen
inSheffield or     do you want me to widen the scope my address to deal with
either Coroner's Inquests generally and/or the role of this Steering
Committee has played in the legal aspects arising from the Disaster since
its inception. Naturally if you want me to simply confine myself to the way
I think the-interim Inquests will run my talk will be rather shorter than it
might otherwise be.
I lock forward to roeeting you and your colleagues on the 5th April,  I
anticipate arriving at the Manor at about 9.30 a.m. for a chat with you
before hand and trust this is in order.

Yours sincerely
    then they will be sympathetically considered and if it is conveniently
    possible to deal_ with them at the hearing it will be done.

    It may also be that either you or your clients may be aware of other
    witnesses who are not referred to in the summaries. The case files do
    not contain every witness statement which has b e e n obtained.
    Statements which are thought not to advance the evidence ave een
    excluded from the files prepared for me. However if you wish me to
    consider any particular statement which you are aware of and v Jicft
    is not mentioned in the summary please let me have details so that
    may consider it.

    I think that in the majority of the cases it will not be necessary to
    call the pathologist to the inquest but there may be a few cases where
    a client particularly wishes to hear the pathologist m person, j.
    that applies to any of your clients please let me know as soon as
    possible. I will then consider the evidence in the light of this
    request.

    I have to make it clear that under no circumstances will any South
    Yorkshire Police-officer be called to give oral evidence at these
    resumed hearings. From my assessment of the files to date I        1
    is unlikely that I will be calling any witnesses other than w m -
    officers and possibly in a few cases the pathplogists to give oral
    evidence.

    The case files are in the course of being prepared and in order to
    give you as much time as possible and also to spread the load over
    a period it is proposed to start sending out the summaries towards
    the end of this week or the beginning of the next. A consequence o
    this is that some families will be aware of the contents of the
    summaries before others. I would be grateful if you would make it
    clear to your client(s) particularly if they are the ones whose
    summary has not yet been sent out t h a t there is nothing sinister in
    this but that it is simply a question of logistics.

    I am not yet in a position to let you know when any particular inquest
    will take place. I will of course try to let you have as much notice
    as possible but I am sure that you will appreciate that this is quite
    a complex operation and that you must be prepared f o r alterations m
    listing information even at the last moment. I appreciate the^
    inconvenience that this may cause and I will try to minimise it but
    fear that it is inevitable.

    In this    connection I would be grateful if you would please let my
    listing    officer whose address appears on the attached sheet know
    whether    you are presently aware of any of your clients who do not
    wish to    attend the inquest relating to their loved one.

    Please also let my listing officer know whether there are any major
    committments of your clients which might make it difficult for them
    to attend on any particular dates. Whilst I will try to take such
    information into account it may not be possible to meet all wishes
    and the final decision on timing and date will be taken by me and my
    officers.     /


    Yoy/s faithfully,

 To solicitors on the record
 acting for Bereaved relatives,
 and to the Hillsborough Steering Committee.


 Dear Sirs,

                           Limited Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough

 You will of course be aware that I have decided to resume the Inquests
 (on a limited basis) into the deaths of the persons who lost their
 lives on 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.

 You will also be aware that the intention is to take the post mortem
 evidence together with a summary of the evidence as it relates to
 location of the deceased, the time of death as far as it can
 reasonably be established and to clear up any minor matters such as
 spelling of names.

The basic format for the inquests will be that the evidence will
be presented either by way of documentary evidence eg. post mortem
report or in the case of the summary by presentation by a West
Midlands Police officer.

The evidence will be presented in a non adversarial fashion and is
intended to give to you and in particular your client(s) non
controversial evidence as it relates to each individual deceased
which is available. I am sure that you will appreciate that the
quality and quantity of evidence which it has been possible to obtain
varies from person to person.

It must be clearly understood and it is the basis on which I have
decided to resume the inquests at this stage that no evidence will be
taken nor will questions or comments be permitted which could be
considered as attacking or criticising anybody or person incorporate
or otherwise or which could in any way be construed as obstruction or
compromising the investigation which is still being undertaken by the
DPP and on which to date no conclusion has been reached.

In order to enable you and if you so wish your client(s) to be aware
of the scope of the evidence a copy of the summary will be sent to
you as soon as possible in order to enable you to consider it and in
particular to enable your client to be prepared for the evidence.

Although it will not be possible to recast the summaries into a
different format it may that in some case there may be a particular
point which is not clear to you or there may be some question which
your client is particularly anxious about and which is not clearly
dealt with on the summary or the post mortem.

In such a case please let me know the point or question that you wish
to have more information on. I cannot give any undertaking that
questions submitted can or will be dealt with but provided that the
points or questions fall within the parameter of the resumed inquest

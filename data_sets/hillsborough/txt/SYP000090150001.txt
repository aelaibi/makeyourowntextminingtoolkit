              On S at u r d a y    15 April     1989     (150489),          X a t t e n d e d the football      semi    final

              m a t c h between L iv erpool          and Notts Forest at H i l l s b o r o u g h.             I am a

              Liverpool        supporter .

              I did not go wit h ^ r / o r g a n i s e d          party.        I got my ticket         from my uncle

              who   is a steward at Anfield.

              It was a £6 ticket             for Leppings Lane               standing,

              I t ravel led to t he game             in a van wii t ^ several              other    lads one of them           I

              stop pe d with was

              We stopped on the way to S h e f fi el d                  in a lay by to sleep for the night

              because we          left on Fr id ay night.

              We a r r iv ed      in S h e f f i e l d at about     10 am       (1000)    and    parked the van         near

              to the station.

              We e v e nt ua ll y made       our way to the           ground at         1400 hours       (1400).       On the
                                                                                                                    PAGE             2
                                                                                                                    S3441

            w ay to the ground              I did not see any one drinking.                          I saw a few Police

            O ff i ce r s   on the wa y to the ground they were                        stood on the           corners of

            side    roads.          I did not see anyone drunk or any fighting.

            We w a i t e d outside          the ground for              some other mates           to arrive.      As we

            w a i t e d the    crowds       built    up and       it became        very    crushed.

            At a bout       1430 hrs        <1430)       w hen they had not a r r i v e d we joined the                  crowd

            to try to get            in.     It was       very packed.           While     I was      in the    crush    I saw

               few kids going              over    the walls and getting               in to the g r o u n d .

            At a bout       14.55 hrs        (1455)       I saw p e o p l ^ g o j/ng in at the side              I fol lo we d

       C_   and went         in thro ug h the big gate by/the Vj^tfr.                         As     I went    through     I

            saw a couple of stewards and a Special                              Constable.

            I did not hand my ticket                     in.     I. noticed someone offer his                  ticket    to a

            steward.          The    stew ar d just        s hr ugged his         s ho ulders and did not take                 it,

            I did not see any signs                  showing me w here             to g o .    All     I saw was     the

            tunnel        and went     that way          I did not see any stewards                   or Police Officers

            by the tunnel.
                                                                  //

                    we were     not        crushed at^ this             time   although       it was    very    packed.         As

            we were stood there               the    pressure just              increased and after a couple                   of

            m in ut e s             said he       could not breath.               I was    having      trouble    breathing

            and    I felt      sick.        I could see          people        climbing    over      the fence at       the

            front.          I noticed a man at the side                    of me he had gone a very sickly

            pale ye 11ow        colour.           He was       being m o ve d     by the    crowd.       I grabbed hold

            of him because            1 knew there was              something wrong?            he    looked

            unconscious.            He star te d         to slip down.            I tpied to hold on to him as
                                                                                   /

            did not' see him again*                  I w ould describe            him as his middle 4 0 ’s , white

            m a l e 5*9 short hair               going    grey,     cle^n shaven.             I do not know what he

            was wearing.

                                                                                                          S3441

At    this       time    there was       people     climbing     over    our heads.        There was a

young       lad about          13 years     of age just       in front        of us.     He was      crying we

h elped him up and he went                   over    the    top of the        people over       the fence at

the front and onto                the    pitch.

D uring      this       time    there were        people    climbing     over the fence and getting

out of the          gate.        There was        Police Offic er s by the fence           telling

people to go back                in.

E v e n t u a l l y the       pressure    eased and most         of the       people    had gone.          I

looked a r o un d and            I saw a load of dead bodies at the front                        of the         pen.

I also saw          the       broken barrier,        I just     burst     into tears.      One      of the

lads    I had       t r avelled        to the game with was          in the     stands. He       pulled           me

up into the             stand.     I sat     there    looking at        the    pitch,    there was

t housands         of people       on the     pitch.        I saw some friends           on the      pitch and

I went       down on to the             pitch to see        if all my mates j^ere alright.

One    of the       lads       that went with us                                 had been taken off

the    pitch on a stretcher when we were a 1/1 /tog^-fher                          (everyone         that went

in the van)             we went    to the opposite           end i^f the ground where               the

injured and dead had been taken.                           We were   told that         he was    not there

and to try the hospitals.                    We went        to the first one and he was                   not

the r e ,



We all went             for    s omething    to eat and then t ravelled home.

I did not wi tness a ny thing                 that    1 would     consider       to be a criminal

1 think          that    the Police were          very slow to        react     to the               ^on and

There was           a lack of first aid facilities.                      The other       emergency

services were             slow to       respond as well.

I think          that Liverpool          should have        been given a larger a l l o c a t i o n of

tickets.           Also Liverpool           should have       had the     larger Kop end of the

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry
I enclose, for your information, a letter dated 27 April 1990 which I have received from
the Administration and Legal Department of the Sheffield City Council. The letter
encloses correspondence, unfortunately without means of immediately identifying the
author, received by the Council from Belgium.

As you are continuing to deal with all aspects of the events at Hillsborough, I forward
the correspondence for your information and any action you may deem necessary.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
I refer to your letter dated 27 April 1990 and thank you for forwarding the
correspondence received from an un-named source in Belgium.

I have forwarded the letter to Mr L Sharp who is currently in charge of the West
Midlands Police Enquiry Team who are dealing with all aspects of the events at
Hillsborough in the course of their current enquiry. Should they be able to identify the
writer, I am sure that you will be informed as requested.

Yours faithfully

                   Dear Sir,

                   Safety of Sports Grounds
                   Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 15th April 1989

                   Please find attached a copy of a letter I received on 24th April 1990 concerning
                   the tragic events at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April last year.

                   It would seem that the person/s (apparently foreign police officers - possibly
                   Belgian) were witnesses to the disaster.  Unfortunately from the information
                   contained in the letter I am unable to trace the writer.  In view of the
                   comments of               you may wish to make some further enquiries.

                   If it is possible to trace the writer I would be most grateful if you could
                   forward details of his address or police division so that I may write to him.

                   Yours faithfully,




                   Head of Department

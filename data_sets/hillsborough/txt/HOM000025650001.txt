           Dear Mr Bilbe

           TEE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY: MEETINGS BETWEEN THE PTXYTRAT.T. ASSOCIATION AND
           THE HOME OFFICE

           I telephoned you on 1 May and you agreed to let jne know how often the
           meetings take place, and the results of any discussions on International
           matches and all-seater stadia. I also need to know whether Wales has
           been discussed in this respect and specifically whether a National
           Stadium in Vales was considered at any of the meetings or if not, whether
           this topic is on the agenda for discussion.

           As explained to you, this information is required to answer an Ml-
           letter to our PUSS, and as time is short, I would oe grateful if y-^v
           could ensure that a reply is FAX-ed to me hy 21 May.

                                                                             (                  Yours sincerely




                                                                                                R M BAIiDACCHINO

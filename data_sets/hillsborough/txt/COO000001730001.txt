                      I

Thank  you  for your   letter of 29 January about      the Home
Secretary's statement on 29 January following publication of the
Taylor report.

As you know the statement referred to work continuing on the
scheme to see how the shortcomings identified biy Lord Justice
Taylor could be overcome in case we needed to return to the
matter again. I accept that any costs stemming from such further
work should be met from within existing provision.

I am sending copies of this letter to the Prime Minister,
Geoffrey Howe, Douglas Hurd, David Waddington, Malcolm Rifkind,
Patrick Mayhew, the Lord Privy Seal, Timothy Renton and to Sir
Robin Butler.




                                                       .       y
                                        COLIN MOYNIHAN

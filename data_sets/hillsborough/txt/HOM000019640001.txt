I am grateful to you for confirming the arrangements for Lord
Justice Taylor's visit to Old Trafford on Friday 6 October. As
you suggested, he will arrive, accompanied by Mr Whalley, at
10.30am at main reception, where he will be met. The visit will
conclude with a working lunch prior to departure for Maine Road,
where Lord Justice Taylor is expected at 2.30pm.

In the meantime, Lord Justice Taylor was interested to read press
reports of crowd disturbances and ticket allocation difficulties
at last weekend's game with Manchester City. He would like
further details of the problems which occurred and wonders
whether you could provide a full report of the day's events. He
would be grateful to receive this as soon as possible.

At his request, I am writing in similar terms to the Club
Secretary at Manchester City.

                                        Yours sincerely

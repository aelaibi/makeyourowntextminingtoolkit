be    patient,             not       to    push,      and       t h at    there      was     ample          room    in the           ground.




A    fe w m i n u t e s         after        1 500    hours        the     turnstiles             began       to    close.               Serial

5 were       to       remain          on     duty                t another           se r i a l    were       refreshed.                  w&

were      due     to       be       ref r ejsfied 1a t e r .




At    about       1510          hours        one     of    the     turnstile           operators             i n f o r m e d me          that

they were             a    lot       of    people         on the         pitch.        At    this       stage       I assumed                 that

there       was       a    public          order      situation.                I walked          up    to    turnstiles                 19-22

on the       corner             of    the     West        and S o s u t h       Stand..       I went          inside           and       c o ul d

see     people            on    the       pitch and          people        climbing          over       the W e s t           Stand

fencing         and        police          officers          helping        them       over.




I was       then ap pro ach ed                   by a m a n        wh o    introduced             himself          as    an     off-duty

Chief       Inspector                that     many        people         were    in j u r e d .        He    requested              that       I

help      clear           the       area     for     ambulances.                Shortly       after,          two       f i r'e.

appliances                arrived          and     I made        sure      t h at    they were              parked       so as           to

enable       access             to a m b u l a n c e s .




A    fire    office r then                   i nf o rmed rne that               some      casualties            would          be    brought

out     form      the          turnstiles            19-22       to a w a i t       for     ambulances             and        could       I

maintain          a       casualty           clearing           area.




As    casualties                were       brought         from      the    ground          I directed             them        over       to a

n ea rb y wall             so       that     there        was    still      sufficient             room       for       ambulances                 to

turn      round.               S o m e •of    these        casualties            were       walking          supported              by

others,         some           on    boards        and     stretchers.



I then       remained                at    the     South/West             corner       ana    directed             ambulances                 in

and     out.          I assisted              in k e e p i n g       the    road       clear       and       directing              doctors

       At   t hi s    stage     I would   make     one   observation.          That   is   t ha t    it w as    some

       time    before         I fully   realised      exactly what       was    happening,          as   neither

       myself        or m y    colleagues     working      in t h at   area were      in   possession          of a

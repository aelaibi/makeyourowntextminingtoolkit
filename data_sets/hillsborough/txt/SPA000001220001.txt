Dear Bill

Hillsborough private prosecution

Some time has now passed since the very satisfactory outcome to the Hillsborough trial, and
after taking a far too short break, I am now busily writing to people to thank them for their
assistance throughout.

Accordingly on behalf o f David, and all those involved in his legal defence team, may I
thank you and the South Yorkshire Police Authority for all the support that they have given
in relation to the proceedings instituted by the private prosecutor.

In saying this, of course I know that it has been a difficult road, and that many difficult
issues had to be dealt with along the way. This has always been understood, and I know
David very much appreciates the fact that he was able to endure the trial with the
knowledge of the full public support of the Authority. It is very hard to value the impact of
this but I can assure you and the other members of the Authority that it was considerable
and very much appreciated.

I understand that you have a meeting this Friday and would be very grateful if you could
circulate this letter at the meeting. Naturally we are focusing considerable efforts on
claiming back costs from Central Funds and I will continue to liaise with Messrs Garretts in
that regard.

With best wishes

Yours sincerely

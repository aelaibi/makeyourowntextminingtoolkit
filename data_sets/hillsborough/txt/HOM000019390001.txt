HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your letter of 7 September kindly offering the
services of your clients to guide Lord Justice Taylor on his
visits to football grounds.

Lord Justice Taylor was grateful to you for your offer, and
appreciates the helpful thought lying behind it of enabling him
to draw on the knowledge of those familiar with individual
grounds. But he would prefer to make his own arrangements to
meet the point you have in mind. When he visits grounds he will,
of course, be doing so in the first instance as the guest of the
host club. But he intends to see round as much of each ground as
possible and to spend some time in the course of his visit
watching the match from the areas used by the general public and
discussing arrangements for crowd control and safety with them
informally in the course of his visit. I think this will meet
the point which lies behind your kind offer.

            Dear Sxir
                                                                     HILLSBOROUGH


           •we write with reference to various comments made by                                                               Lord Justice
           Taylor at the Press Conference prior to the release                                                                of his interim
           report. At that time Lord Justice Taylor indicated                                                                 that during
           the early parts of this football season he intended                                                                to visit as
           many football grounds as possible, with the added intention that
           he visitetf as many different types of grounds as possible, and
           grounds from various Divisions of the Football League. If Lord
           Justice Taylor feels that he would find it useful to have a guide
           at the grounds he visits, and that this guide should be a
           supporter who knows the relevant ground, then our clients would be
           happy to offer their services in this capacity.


           If His Lordship would like to take up the invitation no doubt you
           will contact us as you feel appropriate.

            Yours faithfully

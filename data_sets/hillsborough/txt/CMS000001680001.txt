             The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter of 6
     December about the provision of ambulance services at football matches.

             The terms and conditions contained in a safety certificate are a
—n   matter for the issuing authority.      Recommendation 42 of the Hillsborough
 J   Inquiry interim report has the effect of drawing the appropriate ambulance
     authority into the consideration and provision of ambulance cover if a crowd
     of at least 5,000 is expected at a football match.       Our view is that an
     ambulance provided by or on behalf of the ambulance authority would fulfil the
     objective of that recommendation.

             We have consulted the Department of Health about the provision of
     cover during the ambulance dispute. We understand that on 19 September the
     Chief Ambulance Officer of South Yorkshire Ambulance Service wrote to Mr
     Bouesels of your Administrative and Legal Department guaranteeing cover by
     qualified NHS ambulance personnel at all the City's Football League grounds.
     Since then apparently all football matches which have required cover have been
     provided with it. We understand that the Ambulance Service will continue to
     provide cover and that the Chief Ambulance Officer would be happy to confirm
     this with the Council.




                                                            P R C   STORR

               I am a single man and I live at the above address with my sister and
                                                                           t
               my parents for the past 3 or 4 years I have had a season ticket for

               the Liverpool football games.            I support Liverpool and went to all

               home and away games.

               On Saturday 15th April         1989 ( 150489) Liverpool were to play Nottingham

               Forest in the FA Cup Semi Final and the game was to take place at the

P^jZ^Jbdl      Hillsborough S tadium i S ^ j e f f i e l d .    I had been to the previous seasons

        '£^a /Va Cup Semi Final, Wvo^m^^Jfcffe same teams at Hillsborough Stadium,

 ^>p ^ ^       On that day I had stood on the Leppings Lane terrace area,                            behind the

               goal,   I was with     a mate                        at about 2.30 pm (1430)                it was

           *   really packed in this part of the ground and people were still

               entering the terracing using the tunnel to do so.                          It got so packed in

               the terracing that at about 2.45 pm (1445)                            and I battled our way
                                                                                                                          PAGE       2
                                                                                                                          S3503

towards the rear of the terracing and continued to have to struggle to

get out of the terracing using the tunnel to do so.                                                    We had been in

pen number 3 and we then made our way around the back of the West

Stand into the area of terracing known as pen number two.                                                              It was just

like being in the top of this part of the ground it was busy but you

were able to move about.                                and I stayed in this part of the

terracing and watched last years game.                                     I remember thinking to myself

that I would never go into that part of Hillsborough Stadium,

immediately behind the goal,                          or the terracing in the future.

For the game on 15th April                       1989 (150489)                  I obtained my ticket from

Liverpool Football Club as I am a season ticket holder.                                                          I had

specifically requested a stand ticket as after the experience of the

previous year,              I was determined that I would not stand on the

terracing at Leppings Lane.                           I managed to obtain a ticket for the West

Stand,           this cost me £12.00.

                                               ]
On the day of the match my fa^i/ei<> a n a ^ T left our house about 9 am

(0900) and went to Liverpool                          supporters           club, where we met up with

friends and were to catch our coach to Sheffield only dad ha,d                                                             =»

We travelled on a Star 1in^Z/pafh leaving the Liverpool supporters

club,           near Anfield at ab'out lO'^sffT (1000) we d i d n ’t stop on the way,

arriving in Sheffield at about                            11.30 am (1130) - 1145 am (1145).                                     It

was a dry day.               I got dropped off outside the football ground,

With my dad and our friends we walked up                                        a hill, away from the

ground,           to find a pub for a drink and something to eat.                                               The first pub

we went to was closed and we had to go a little further to the next

one which was open.                  This pub was situated on the top of a hill.                                                I

can't remember the name of it.                              We went        in for a drink,                     I d o n ’t drink

much and only had one shandy.

About S.30 pm (1430) with my dad and the others we walked from his pub

down towards the footbll ground.        The area was not too busy at first

but the closer that you came to the football         ground the more    congested

the area became.

I saw a few policemen on street        corners as I walked down to the

ground.     The mood of people on the street was good.       No one was drunk

and I never saw any disorder in the area.

We arrived outside the ground ajy5u?^^^^Jpm (1445)          to 2.50 pm (1450)

I didn't see many Police in t h ^ s ^ ^ e a .   I did see two on horseback and

two standing near the turnstiles attempting to organise people into
                 4-T-iS
queues and another was on a wall on too of the turnstiles he appeared

to be lifting people, young kids,       out of the crowd.

It wasn't like a queue outside it was choca with everyone just there

in a crowd.     It is only because I knew where I was going that I made

my way towards the correct turnstils entrance.         At this time I was

with my dad,                     fnd                 , we all had tickets for

the West Stand.     We all four managed to stay together outside            in the

crowd but never got separated.         I was a bit frightended in the crowd

outside.     As I got near to the turnstile      1 became aware of a young lad

behiind me, he was with his dad and his dad was behind the lad trying

to get him into the turnstile.         I could see that this young lad was

close to tears and he held one arm accross his lower chest,            it

appeared as if he was holding his ribs,         the boy was in considerable

distress.     I turned myself half round in the crowd and put out my arm,

allowing the lad and his father to enter the turnstile ahead of me.                  I

would describe the young boy as white, about 16 years old, with dark

hair about 5'9 tall.      I can't remember his clothing.       The man with the

boy was about 35-40 years,      I can ’t remember anything else about him,

only that he thanked me for letting his lad get in the turnstile ahead

of me.

                                                                             S35Q3

I entered the ground through a turnstile I gave my ticket to the

turnstile operator and went      inside,   I never saw any of the large

gates at the ground open at any time.

Once   inside the turnstile    it was busy but no pushing,           I met up with my

dad and                  and                    I d o n ’t remember seeing <&ny

policemen in this location.

We made our way to the stairs leading to the W^st/SffajadV thgjre were

between 6 and 8 stewards on the stair area checking your tickets and I

had to show the stub that I had handed back to me by the turnstile

o pe rat or.

We got into the West Stand,     just as the teams ran out onto the pitch.

The crowd was normal    in the stand it was not    'C h o c k a ’.    We found our

seats and settled down to watch the match.        I saw the kick off on the

game started and I continued to watch the match as BEARDSLEY hit the

bar.

Immediately following this incident,       I saw a steward or a policeman

running onto the pitch towards the referee,       to get the game stopped

the teams went off the pitch.

From my position I saw fans climbing over the perimeter fence,                from

the Leppings Lane terracing area, and others trying to pull the

fencing down as they stood on the perimeter track.

I could see the terraicng behind Leppings Lane goal area,               it was just

solid,    people could not move anywhere.

I saw people on the football     pitch.    I remember two policemen trying

to revive a male figure on the ground by pumping his chest and giving

the man mouth to mouth resuscitation.       After a while       I saw that the

two policemen had to leave this man 1 c a n’t remember much about this

man,   but he had dark or black hair.

More and more    people were by now on the pitch and others were still

climbing over the perimeter fence from the Leppings Lane end.

     I saw one ambulance arrive onto the pitch, and it stopped behind the

     goal at the Leppings Lane end, and I think they got a few people            in

     the r e .

     I can remember the fire brigade      coming down.    Fans and Police were on

     the pitch.     I saw a continous flow of people being carried across the

     pitch on hoardings, mostly carried by Liverpool supporters.            People

     lying on the pitch,     had by now some of them had their faces       covered up

     with clothing.     I then presumed that the people being covered up must

     be dead.

     People at the front of the west stand were pulling people           into our

     stand from the Leppings Lane terrace below.         I couldn't    clearly see

     the people being pulled out of the terrace.         Because of   what was

     happening at the front I stayed back,      to allow people at the front

     room in which to work.

     I can remember the loudspeaker saying the game had been postponed at

     about 4 pm (1600) my dad             and            and I left   the West Stand

     and walked back to our coach, which was in a long row of coaches,           in

     an industrial estate.      At the coach we waited for the others to

     return.     Everyone   returned to our coach,   except for two young lads,

     who had sat near the front,      but I later found out they were alright.

     I was not injured as a result of the football disaster           I did not lose

     any property.

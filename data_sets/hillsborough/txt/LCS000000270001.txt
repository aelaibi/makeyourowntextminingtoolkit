Dear Colleague,

                              Re: Hillsborough Disaster

     Following our meeting on 29th April a number of officers have pursued
enquiries to procure financial support for the Regional Unit to co-ordinate activity.
The services we envisaged being provided by the Unit, which were described in the
report, have been maintained on a limited basis through co-operative arrangements
between local authorities.   However, this is far from ideal and sis well as imposing
additional responsibility on services which are already overstretched it cannot do
justice to the tasks.

     Neither the E.E.C. nor Government have agreed to provide any financial support
other than their donations to the Hillsborough Disaster      Appeal Fund. The
Government in their reply, a copy of      which is attached, have indicated   that theyar
prepared to consider an application to the Department of the Environment, under the
Bellwin Rules. It seems clear that any funding will require a protracted period of
negotiation before it is available.   During this period the service co-ordination is
at great risk of breaking down which I find very unsatisfactory as I am sure you do.

     The impact of Hillsborough upon individual authorities varies considerably as
does the capacity of each Council to      commit any further      resources.   I    am on
well aware of the resource issues in      the light of the commitment that has been
necessary for Liverpool City Council.   A close examination of the requirements and
the expenditure to date does reveal a possible way forward.

     Given the direct service requirements within the City I would be prepared to
underwrite the initial operation of the Regional Unit on a more limited basis than
originally envisaged.   This would enable the position of the Helpline, Database and
Outreach Co-ordination to be properly managed and at the same time allow continuing
input of staff time from all local authorities sis they are able.  It would not
provide an ideal or perfect solution but rather establish a core on which we can build.
It also recognises the prompt action of NWASSA in financing the appointment of a
training officer which further reduces the need for resources, identified in the
Report of the Directors of Social Services.

     My aim would be to sustain action across the range of activities provided by the
Regional Unit and the attached schedule shows the total costs for this stage of
development.   At present I am not expecting any explicit commitment of finance from
individual authorities unless they are in a position to offer it.   I would propose
that the matter should be progressed as quickly aspossible and funding should
continue to be pursued.   The circumstances can bekept regularly under review by
our officers and they can report back at the earliest opportunity, when any finance
is offered.   Requests are being made to the Football Association and Liverpool F.C.

     At the conclusion of our meeting on 29th April it was decided to hold a further
meeting when the outcome of our requests for resources from EEC, Government and other
sources was clarified.   To date there have been positive responses from just a
couple of private section bodies and £20,000 promised by CCETSW,
                                           trainingt                         I would
be happy to host a further meeting in Liverpool orto attend a meeting in another
venue.   Perhaps colleagues would let me have their views on this.

                                  Yours sincerely,



                                  Keva Coombes,

Mr. M. Reddington,
Manager,
Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund,
P.O. Box 220,
4 Water Street,
Liverpool, L69 2PN.



Dear Mr. Reddington,

                       Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund

     The Social Services Departments, together with other statutory and
voluntary agencies have collaborated to provide direct assistance to survivors
and families^^ff Hillsborough.  The work I know is appreciated and understood by
the Trustees and yourself. The co-ordination and management tasks across seven
local authorities to say nothing of the administrative and communication problems
requires financial support.

     I realise that David Mason has already discussed the possibility of financial
support from the Appeal Fund to enable these services to be maintained and developed
in line with emerging patterns of demand.   To date the largest burden has fallen
upon the City in both staffing and financial terms. I am becoming increasingly
concerned about this position and our capacity to sustain the services given our
own financial position.

     Would you please arrange an urgent meeting ideally within the week for myself
and David Mason to meet with the Trustees, or at least the Chair, and yourself to
explore this problem and possible support from the fund.

     I      cannot stress too strongly the urgency of the situation and trust you will
use your good offices to set up a meeting quickly.

                                   Yours sincerely,




                                   Keva Coombes,
                                   Leader.

              jm       was originally proposed to have separate posts to co-ordinate
                    Helpline and Outreach. These have been amalgamated into one post
                    at this stage.

              2.    The training co-ordination post has been deleted as there is a
                    training officer post financed by NWASSA.

              3.    Four posts of Social Worker to develop outreach work have been
                    deleted. Input from SSD teams as available and required.

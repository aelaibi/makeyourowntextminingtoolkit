               actually met up with Sgt WRIGHT until after the incident had

               occur re d) .

1503 hr s      On duty in the gym when I was informed by Insp DEWS that

              assistance was required on the pitch.           together with other

              Officers I walked into the g r o u n d , entering by the corner

               gate at the Kop end of the North Stand.          I was carrying

     Ifilfd   a   Personal     radio.   At t his stage the match was stil

               being played.       I walked around the edge of the pitch in

               front of the North Stand.        As I approached point N I saw

 W A D Or     . what appeared to be an invasion of the pitch.           I have no

               idea whether any message had been passed through the

               personal   radios or not,     the noise was too loud        he^r.      I

               saw one man was shouting at one of the p l a y e d , fZM^iyL.Pm

              and I walked onto the pitch and took hold of the man and

              escorted him off the pitch a n d around the edge          in front of

               the North Stand towards where we had entered the ground.

              The man was shouting that he was in pain,           the man then

               informed PC LAW and I that people were being crushed at the
                                    /
               front fence of /the West Stand. Togqft per wj^Sti PC LAW we

               found a St 'j'Qhns Ambulance     repr^sjmt^arrive and left the

              man with / e r .     We then both returned to the West Stand where

               I saw/y hat appeared to be a mass of people crushed up

              ag ainst the fe n c e .

              Most of the people were crushed up ^rounj/ t j ^ N g ^ e area, that

               led on to the pitch from behind the goal a r | ^ / A t        this

               stage I did not actually realise that anyone had

               been killed.       With the assistance of other Officers       I

               climbed up and over the p e r i m e t e r / e n / eiand dropped down

               into the West Stand.        I dinJ^/over    ItvL^ence because the

               gate was blocked by the solid mass of people.

                     As I looked around I was surrounded by bodies.              There was

                 6   a large pile of bodies situated all around the

                     gate area      leading on to the pitch.         I would estimate around

                     60 bodies were piled up in that area.             Where were the

                     ambulances!      I then began picking up any one who appeared

                     to be alive but injured and with the assistance of

                     spectators    I held them up where other Officers who were

                     leaning over the top of the fence pulled them up and

                     over the f e n c e .   I specifically remember one youth of ar oun d

                     •12-14 years of age, male, white,          approx / feet 4 inches

                     tall,   light coloured hair.        To my knowledge he was wearing

                     hold of his arm and tn/ed t<         >U Jrjl ,he youth over the top but
®   h u
                     did not have the strength. /The youth appeared to die as he

                     was being held.        X       tr/ing to push him up, the WPG was

                     trying to pull him over/but I was not tall enough to get him

                     over and she was not s/rong enough.

                     At that stage a n o t h e / O f f i c e r who was on the pitch

                     side of the fence slw what was happening,            climbed up onto

                     the fence and pvj. 1/ed the youth o v e r .      I have no idea as to

                     whether the youth lived or died.            I believe him to be dead.

                     Still no a m b u la nc es .   At this stags    I still had my personal

                     radio but I cannot say whether or not any messages were

                     being passed,     things were happening too fast and the radio

                     never even entered my head.          The pile of/bodies was still

                     there. A man then began shouting at m                help his w i f e ,

                     down a n d gave the woman                        uth resuscitation. This

                     went on for some 2-3                                realised she was dead.

                     Someone told me to <jj>                            er head,    so I did.     Her

                     husband still screaming refusing to believe she was dead.

                     My radio was connected to my anorak therefore that was the

                     last I saw of it.  By now the front of the stand was
                                                            y
                     beginning to thin out, however, t h ^ e was still a lot of

                     people f rom about half way up^fhe st a n d .           My attention was

 ^J2a ^              then drawn to a man, whit>f^ jir^prob^5yyears with dark

                     coloured hair,      t h in vqX' t op >-<he man        approx 6 feet t a l l ,
£>   c ^ c k a d d   I cannot say what he         was wearing.         This man was still

                     alive,   he was breathing and his eyes were open,                he was

                     conscious but unable to speak. The man was too large and too

                     injured to go over the top of the fence and the crowd was

                     too thick,    leading back on to Leppings Lane.

                     I saw Officers on the outer fence kicking the fence trying

                     to cause a hole.        I left the man and began pulling at the

                     fence,   causing a hole in the fence.              By this time the crowd

                     behind me was thinning out,          so with the assistance of

                     spectators     I returned to the injured man and carried him out

                     in to the area through the tur istiles but not in the stand in

                     the away fans entrance and enc l osu re s.            I was then

                     approached by a.man who stated                        doctor and I left

               I took over the heart massage f rajffT the spectator   in turn

               with the other Officer.    Thiv'werit on for some 3 minutes

               before a St Johns ambulanjgS reprs-arfejftative came to us and

               told us the man                          thgjr'carried the man

               above,

               I then assisted fans to climb out towards the hole in the

               fence on to the pitch.    I then assy»<ed in carrying bodies

               out on to the pitch, placing t>fem on bill boards and

               spectators were carryin^ftnem to the police room (gym,) . Once

               on the pitch and when all the bodies and injured had been

               taken to their respective places, a mixture of Police and

               fans were just milling around,    everyone was very upset,       some

               of the fans became violent towards the Police,     blaming them



               Sgt WRIGHT and Inspecto,jr DEWS and     to    the Liverpool      fans




               Off duty.

Mood of the fans ~ most of the fans wep# very helpful          in my part of

the day, some were very angry blaming the Police for wb*S*t had

happened.       Most of the fans were Jrery quiet,   both before anji after the

match.     When we transported the^fans f rom Midland E&atia*f to

Hillsborough before the game ynad started we just smnysfid the fans on

Leppings Lane where the            piled up.    I don't /ei^ember seeing a

Communications - I have no idea whether any radio message was passed

or not,    I ’m sure if there was I would not have heard it in the panic.

               On |9th October        1989 I was shown video footage and photographs of the

               Hillsborough disaster by PC                   of the West Midlands Police,

               Having viewed the mortuary and clothing photographs I believe that the
                      *                                                a/S73      /
               female whom I tried to resusitate in pen 3, to be No. 35 ChrissLi-rfe

               Anne JONES.      As I mentioned in my recollection,                 she was wearing a red

               top and her husband was with her.              I attempted to resusitate her for

               several minutes without success.              I realised she was dead so I cover'ed

               her with my anorak and went to the assistance of others.

               I have indicated on a plJi0 /Cff the pen area,                 (ref No MRF-1 )
                                       i        -



               (Ex. No.          ).        The area where this action took place by way of a

               coloured dot.

               I believe that the young boy whom I passed o^e-r the fence to blonde
 (s/aci 9 9 ?                                       /v%sk          /                                    "
            P o l i ce Woman is No.           1 Thomas Anthoj^JjfflflARD.         I do not recall his face

         but I remember that he was wearing a blue anorak type jacket and brown

         cord jeans.

         I passed him up to the Police Woman who was leaning over the perimeter

         fence into pen 3.    As a result of f u r t h e X e n q u i r i e s   I now believe that

         this Fjolice Woman is WPC Fiona          cl>grdsQn.

         I have i n d i cated on a pi^ain ^ / f the pen area (Ref. No MRF - 2)

         (Ex, No,        ) the area where I came into contact with No.                1 Thomas

        A n t h o n y HOWARD by way of a coloured dot

    Subject:            Hillsborough

    Just to let you know the outcome of the call to Kevin Robinson of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, who
    wanted a copy of the schedules we had provided to ADLINGTON.

    As we discussed, I told him that this disclosure was to a party in the legal proceedings i.e. the solicitor to the
    Family Support Group, as part of the legal proceedings. I explained we were not able, as far as I had been told,
    to disclose them to any party not involved with the proceedings. I suggested that perhaps he could get in touch
    with the FSG, but he said they had had a falling out. He said he thought he was entitled to them as they
    represented some relatives, but I reiterated the position above.

    He seemed to accept this, but might write to Chris, to appeal/clarify this view, as he asked for name/addresses
    etc.

        The Right Hon. Douglas Hurd CBE MP                 fVyv< fliA
        Secretary of State
        Home Office

        Following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim
        Report on 4 August 1989, you made a statement in which you
        indicated that you would be looking to me for a report on the
        action I proposed to take in the light of Lord Justice Taylor s
        findings.

        I enclose for your information a copy of a report which
        indicates the actions I have taken so far together with copies
        of documents that I consider relevant.

         If you require any further information please do not hesitate to
         contact me.

           REPORT TO THE RIGHT HON D HURD CBE MP, SECRETARY OF STATE
              REGARDING THE ACTIONS OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
               FOLLOWING THE PUBLICATION OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S
                        INTERIM REPORT ON 4 AUGUST 1989




      Acceptance of the Findings of the Report

      Immediately following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim

      Report on 4 August 1989, I made a public statement of acceptance of the

      findings and conclusions of the Inquiry insofar as they related to the

      South Yorkshire Police (copy of press release attached at Annex 'A').




1.2   Note was taken of the criticisms contained in the Report which were

      directed towards members of the South Yorkshire Police both individually

      and collectively.   As I had previously indicated to my Police Authority

      that I assumed full responsibility for police action in relation to the

      incident, I thought it appropriate to offer my resignation to the

      Authority so that members would have the opportunity to consider my

      continuance as Chief Constable.   I wrote to the Chairman of the South

      Yorkshire Police Authority, Councillor Sir John Layden JP, on 4 August

      1989, to this effect (copy of letter attached at Annex 'B').




1.3   My offer of resignation was subsequently considered at a Special Meeting

      of the Police Authority convened on 14 August 1989.    The matter was

      debated by the Authority members who unanimously resolved to decline the

      offer of resignation (copy of Police Authority report attached at

      Annex 1C 1).




2.    Implementation of the Report's Recommendations

2.1   The recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report

      included many which were already identified as necessary in the light of

      the events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.     The South Yorkshire Police
                                        -   2 -



      were therefore well prepared to ensure that they were      swiftly implemented

      at football grounds in this area.




2.2   I nominated my Deputy Chief Constable, Mr Peter Hayes      QPM LLB MA,   as

      required by recommendation 26, to liaise with the management of each

      football club and with each local authority concerned in respect of

      future crowd safety.   He, in turn, selected an 'Implementation Team1

      which included the local ground commanders who have a responsibility for

      policing each of the five football league clubs in the County, and

      officers with specialist knowledge in communications, CCTV and training.




2.3   The 'Implementation Team' has met      regularly since that time and Mr Hayes

      has arranged and chaired meetings with representatives of the clubs and

      representatives of each of the local authorities concerned.       There has

      been, to date, positive response by all parties to the recommendations

      proposed by Lord Justice Taylor.       It is pleasing to be able to report

      that by 18 August 1989 - just two weeks after the publication of the

      Taylor Report and before the start of the current league programme -

      signed written agreements between each of the five football league clubs

      and the police were in being and the relevant 11 asterisked

      recommendations had'all been implemented.




3.    Criminal Investigations Resulting

3.1   During the course of the Hillsborough Inquiry the question of

      manslaughter by the criminal negligence of my officers was raised by

      Counsel for the bereaved, Mr Benet Hytner QC.      Furthermore, attempts were

      made to obtain a private prosecution against me and Sheffield Wednesday

      Football Club for this offence.
                                      -   3 -



3.2   It was clear that the Report of the Hillsborough Inquiry would fuel

      renewed attempts to pursue such a course.      I therefore wrote, on the

      morning of the Report's publication, to the Director of Public

      Prosecutions, Allan Green Q C , (copy of letter attached at Annex 'D ')

      asking for his decision on the question of criminal prosecutions against

      any member of the South Yorkshire Police for such an offence.      I thought

      it appropriate to suspend from duty the police commander of      the

      Hillsborough event, Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield,      pending the

      outcome of Mr Green's deliberations.      Mr Duckenfield remains suspended.




3.3   On 15 August 1989, Mr Green wrote to me setting out his view that the

      matter should be subject of a full criminal investigation (copy of letter

      attached at Annex 'E').   The West Midlands Police had done much of the

      necessary preparatory work in gathering evidence for Lord Justice

      Taylor's Inquiry.   It seemed sensible, therefore, to invite Mr Geoffrey

      Dear QPM DL LLB, Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police Force, to

      undertake the investigation on my behalf.     He has agreed to   do so. A.

      report, in due course, will be submitted to the Director of      Public

      Prosecutions.




4.    Matters of Complaintr and Discipline

4.1   Additionally, I have asked that if, during the course of their

      investigation, the West Midlands Police officers discover any matters

      which might suggest that offences were committed     against the Police

      (Discipline) Regulations 1985, of a non-criminal     nature, those offences

      should be brought to my attention and be fully enquired into by the West

      Midlands Police on my behalf.   This is agreed.
There are currently five matters of public complaint about the actions of

South Yorkshire Police officers, arising from the Hillsborough incident.




Three of these matters have been raised by a single complainant,

Mr Trevor Hicks.     Two relate to the actions of the senior officers in

command of the policing operation at Hillsborough on the day and these

are being supervised by Captain E Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints

Authority.   Those investigations presently lie with Mr Ken Cooper,

Assistant Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police, but it is proposed

that the complaints will be referred to Mr Geoffrey Dear for

investigation along with the criminal matters.    The third complaint from

Mr Hicks is of incivility and is being investigated by one of my own

superintendents.




There is a fourth, and separate complaint, of corruption, namely of

police officers offering to allow fans into the ground on payment.     This

complaint is being investigated by Superintendent Carlisle of the Greater

Manchester Police.




The fifth complaint is only recently made by a man who attended the

football match and Alleges that he was assaulted by police officers.       I

have asked Mr Dear to begin an investigation into this complaint when he

commences his general enquiries in this area.    This case, again, is being

supervised by Captain E Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints Authority.




Coroner's Inquest Regarding the 95 Deaths which Arose

The gathering of evidence on behalf of HM Coroner, Dr Stefan

Popper LLB BMedSci BM BS MRCGP, in relation to the 95 deaths that

occurred at Hillsborough, is continuing by the West Midlands Police.
                                        -   5 -



5.2   The Coroner opened the Inquests on 19/20 April 1989 and adjourned them to

      a date to be fixed,     He had set aside three months to hear the inquests

      beginning in January 1990.     I understand, however, that the Director of

      Public Prosecutions has recently written to Dr Popper requesting that the

      inquests be deferred until after the results of the on-g;ing criminal

      investigation are concluded.




6.    Civil Actions

6.1   To date eight writs have been served upon me, alleging negligence by my

      officers on 15 April 1989. leading to loss, injury, damage and, in two

      cases, death.




6.2   The writs are to be defended by our insurers, Municipal Mutual Insurance

      Company.     I am told by the Insurers solicitors, Messrs Hammond Suddards

      of Bradford, ttuu. three of these actions will be representative actions.




6.3   The presiding Northern Circuit Judge, Mr Justice Rose, has taken personal

      charge of the interlocutory proceedings.    He has called a Directions

      Hearing on 26 October 1989, at the High Court in Manchester.     It is

      anticipated that a trial date, for each of the actions, will be set at

      that time.

STATEMENT OF PETER WRIGHT, CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE,
IN RESPONSE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY REPORT

The report of the Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor has been received by
me and I have noted the criticisms that have been directed against
members of the South Yorkshire Police both individually and collectively.

To., make it clear to all concerned I would say at the outset that I
accept the findings and the conclusions of the Inquiry insofar as they
relate to the South Yorkshire Police.

The fact that we are held to have contributed to the terrible tragedy
of Hillsborough is a matter of profound sadness to all members of the
Force, and both personally and on their behalf I once again extend my
heartfelt regret to those who have lost loved ones or suffered injury.

Lord Justice Taylor and all concerned may be assured that the South
Yorkshire Police will pursue every action available to them to ensure
that such an event could not occur again.    I am grateful for the
comments he has made regarding the manner   in which the Force has
handled crowd control and public order events generally and for his
recognition of the heroic efforts of many   of my officers on the day.

The Home Secretary has asked me for a report on the action I propose
to take in the light of the Inquiry and this will be pursued. Before
responding to the Home Secretary it will be necessary for me to consult
with members of my Police Authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions,
the Police Complaints Authority, and others.

t t p v x,ppor't to 11?s ^c1^ c ° ^11 ^ c i ^ v on ^ ^ ^  X i.nciz.c2.t.sci
I accepted full responsibility for police action in connection with
this event.      In pursuance of this responsibility, and in the light of
Lord Justice Taylor's findings, I have written to my Chairman and
offered my resignation to the Police Authority so that members will
have the opportunity to consider my continuance as Chief Constable,
and my Office is now at their disposal.

 You will now have received a copy of the Report of the Inquiry conducted
 by Lord Justice Taylor into the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.
 The Report levels a number of criticisms at members of the South Yorkshire
 Police and indicates that the police handling of events was a contributory
 factor to the disaster that occurred.

 You will recall that at the meeting of the Police Authority on 21 April I
 made a statement in which I accepted full responsibility for police action
 in connection with the event.

 In the light of Lord Justice Taylor's findings I have decided to offer my
 resignation to the Committee in order that members can review my position
 as Chief Constable. Accordingly my Office is now at the disposal^of the
 Committee.

-I have forwarded a copy of this letter to R C Johnston, Clerk to the South
 Yorkshire Police Authority.

The Report of the Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor into the
tragedy at Hillsborough has been published today.   In his findings Lord
Justice Taylor criticises a number of officers of the South Yorkshire
Police, particularly Chief. Superintendent David Duckenfield.

During the course of the Inquiry the question of manslaughter by criminal
negligence was raised by Counsel for the bereaved and injured and attempts
have already been made to obtain a private prosecution against me and the
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for this offence.

I ata of the view that the finding of the Inquiry will cause renewed
attempts to be made to pursue private prosecutions against the aajor
parties involved including Mr Duckenfield.

The question of criminal offences arising out of the events at
Hillsborough will continue to be raised and I should be obliged if you
would give this question your consideration and let me have your advice.

All the available evidence collected^during the course of the Inquiry is
in the possession of Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of the West
Midlands Police.

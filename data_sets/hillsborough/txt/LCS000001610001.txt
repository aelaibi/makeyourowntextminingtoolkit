traum a where do you or your family go for help and
understanding?
   A new voluntary project in Liverpool has set itself the task
of providing some answers. Liverpool Children’s Project
began work in April as a result of the Children’s Society’s
response to the Hillsborough Disaster.
   Paul Barnard led th at response and he was particularly
concerned to listen to children and young people. He
worked with them, their families and friends and their
communities to help them find ways of expressing their
feelings, understand what had happened to them and step
beyond, into the future.
   The experience gave rise to this new project which Paul
Barnard is now leading. It works directly with children and
helps create opportunities for their voices to be heard. It
aims to raise awareness about the needs of children
experiencing bereavement and traum a and plans activities
and events which will be fun - to help children and families
regain their confidence and self-esteem.
   Liverpool Children’s Project has just produced a leaflet
about itself and is seeking to make contact with others
involved with the delivery of services, especially where these
apply to children. Project Leader, Paul Barnard, cites in
particular: ‘Policy-makers, planners, managers and trai­
ners, as well as those practitioners involved with children,
families and communities, to whom our work would have
specific interest and application.’

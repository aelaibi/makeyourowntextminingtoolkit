positions are man n e d                in the morn i n g and two                   postions        in the afternoon:,

On the a f t e r n o o n of           15 April          I was    on duty w i t h                                    There       is

a s w i t c h b o a r d at Ins         reception           destc and                            was     p o sitioned

there      on ext e n s i o n SOS and              I was      on the m a m           switchboard            in the

7 e I e pnone Ex change              on extens i on 201 .

J. have      never         been     involved       in a major            disaster        bef o r e .       S o m etime

during       the a f t e r n o o n     I recall           hearing        sirens which           I thought           were    from

fire     engines.             I w o n d e r e d where       they were         going and w o n d e r e d whether

they might            be coming        to the hospital              as we often             receive         hoax     calls.

1 instinctively                looked at          the fire a larm screen                  but    it was        not

a t i v a t e a..      A few m i n u t e s 1a l e r                               t e l e p h o n e d me    % o say S o a t n

Yorkshire            Po 1 i ce had     t e l e p h o n e d and     indicated           there     had been an

accident          at Hi 1 lsborough.               He told me we were                  on casualty stand                  by.

This     was at about 3.1 0                 om.      He    confirmed         he had t e l e p h o n e d        the A A E

Department            and he a s k e d whether              he should         inform anyone                else,,     I tola

him he had Getter alert                      the A s s istant            M a t r o n on duty,         w hich he did.

         then        closed down nis              position on the             r e c eption and he              came       into

the T e l e p h o n e E x c h a n g e       on    to e x t e n s i o n        L      I a sked      him whet he r he

was    sure       it was       the    police who          had t e l e p h o n e d and         I a sked       him     to

repeat       the message.              He    r epeated       that S o u t h Yor k s h i r e           Police        had said

there was an accident                   at H i l l s b o r o u g h and that             C a s u a l t y should        be on

s tand     by.        He did not        refer        to the      football          ground and           I assumed          the

a c c ident       might      possibly        be a road traffic accident.                           He      c o n firmed     he

had    informed            the A & £ Department.                   1 could not            u n d e r s t a n d why     the

•The Royal        Hai lamshi re Hospital,                  indicated       they were       on stand by and

this made me wonder w h e t h e r                     the N o r t h e r n General        might    be on a major

alert.



At about        this      time      the    switchboard           started        receiving a large a number

of t e 1 aphone        snqui r i es f •”om memfae,/'s of the                    pubi i c , medi :::a 1 staft       and

about 3.35         prn.     She a s k e d what was               h a ppening and         1 said    I did not

know.        She asked what we were                     doing about         it.      I a sked     if a major

disaster        had been         called and she               indicated         casualties were a l r e a d y

arriving        in the C a s u a l t y D e p a r t m e n t         and that we        had better        implement

the Major         Disaster       Plan.           At about        that     time                     receivea a

mess a g e     on the       console        that all         medical       ana    surgical    Doctors        should

I implem e n t e d        the    rest      of    tKe    call     out     procedure       in the Major        D .1sast

because        they had         teldsman&d            .n to the D e p a r t m e n t .

The    call     out    sequence           is    listed on page            16 of the Major D i s aster              Plan,,

U nder    paragraph 2 a there are                      several      key    people and D e p a r t m e n t s      to be

receptionist,             but    it was         not    nec e s s a r y   for me    to alert       them as       they

already        knew of the s i t u a t i o n acc o r d i n g              to Mrs Williams.            Similarly,

the    requirement          to      contact       the Senior Nurse               nanager was       u n n e c e s s a r y as

                       was a l r e a d y        present and knew of the                  situation,,

LINE T O TAKE

T h e tragic events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 w hich resulted in the death o f

96 Liverpool supporters were fully investigated by Lord Justice Taylor, w ho found

that this disaster was caused by a complex com bination o f several factors w hich are

fully explained in his interim and final reports. It w ould not be appropriate for the

G overnm ent to com m ent on press reports o f personal comments contained in an

autobiography.

BACKGROUND NOTE

O n 15 April 1989, 96 Liverpool supporters were killed at the FA Cup semi-final
b e tw e e n N ottingham Forrest and Liverpool staged at Hillsborough.         An
adjournm ent debate on this issue (inspired by a recent "C ook R eport" television
program m e and unconnected to the Brian C lough autobiography) will be held on
26 O ctober, at the instigation o f Sir M alcolm T ho rn ton M P.

T h e autobiography o f M r Brian Clough, the form er N ottingham Forest manager,
is due for publication next m onth. Press reports indicate that M r Clough has stated
in this book that he believes the Hillsborough Stadium disaster was mainly caused by
the behaviour o f other Liverpool supporters arriving late at the ground. This is
obviously an extremely sensitive issue in Liverpool.

Lord Justice Taylor, who was charged by the H om e Secretary w ith investigating the
causes o f this tragedy and m aking recommendations to ensure there w ould be no
repeat, published Interim and Final R eports in August 1989 and January 1990
respectively. Taylor found that: "The immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding
and hence the disaster was the failure, w hen gate C was opened, to cut off access to
the central pens which were already overfull". There were m any other contributory
factors how ever, and it is true that Taylor also stated: "The presence o f an unruly
m inority w ho had drunk too m uch aggravated the problem".

T h e Final R ep o rt contained 76 recom mendations to prevent a repeat occurrence,
by far the most im portant o f which was that standing accom m odation should be
eliminated. The Governm ent accepted the R eport, but has decided that in order to
target most effectively those clubs where the problems o f safety and crow d control
are greatest the all-seater requirem ent will only apply to clubs in the FA Prem ier
League and First Division o f the Football League, w hich were given until August
1994 to go all-seater. Clubs in the Second and T hird Divisions will be perm itted to
keep some standing accommodation, provided the terracing is safe. By August 1994
th e vast majority o f the 46 Prem ier League and First Division clubs had all-seater
grounds or had closed their last remaining standing accom m odation and were
w orking on its conversion to seating.

LIN E T O TAKE


Lord Justice Taylor was charged by th e Home Secretary with fully investigating th e causes o f the
trag ic even ts at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989 which resulted in th e death of 96 Liverpool
supporters. Taylor's findings and 76 recom m endations w ere outlined in his Final R eport which
w as published in January 1990.


It would not be appropriate for the Government to com ment on press speculation surrounding
Mr Brian Clough's forthcom ing autobiography.




BACKGROUND NOTE


W e understand from press rep o rts th a t th e Autobiography of Mr Brian Clough, th e ex-
N o tting ham Forest Manager, is due for publication next month. T here was som e press
speculation last w eekend th a t Mr Clough has suggested in his autobiography th a t the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster was caused by drunken Liverpool supporters arriving late at th e
ground. Mr Clough, as manager of Nottingham Forest, was present at Hillsborough on th e day
of th e disaster.

Lord Justice Taylor's Interim and Final Reports on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster w ere
published in August 1989 and January 1990 respectively, following the tragic events at an FA Cup
semi-final th e re on 15 April 1989, at which 96 people died. The Final R eport contained 76
reco m m end ation s, many of which, including a reduction in th e perm itted crow d density on
te rra ces and th e removal of spikes from perim eter fences, w ere included in a revised edition
of th e G reen Guide, published in 1990.

By far th e m ost im portant of Taylor's recom m endations was th at standing accommodation
should be eliminated at all grounds designated under th e 1975 Act. The G overnm ent accepted
th e R ep o rt, but chose to limit th e all-seater requirem ent to football, due to th e particular
problems of safety and crow d control experienced in th at sport. Accordingly, clubs in th e old
Division I and 2 of the Football League w ere given until August 1994, and at tho se in Divisions
3 and 4 until August 1999, to go all-seater. In July 1992, following a review of the all-seater policy
t o en su re th a t it targeted m ore effectively th o se clubs w here th e risk is greatest, it was
announced that all clubs in the FA Premier League and th e First Division of th e Football League
w ou ld still be required to go all-seater by August 1994 , in accordance with Taylor's original
recom m endation. However, clubs in th e Second and Third Divisions would be perm itted to
keep som e standing accommodation, provided th e terracing was safe.

By August 1994 the vast majority of the 46 Premier League and First Division clubs had all-seater
grounds o r had closed th e ir last remaining standing accommodation and w ere working on its
conversion to seating.

w h ich appear a t the top of page 260 in the

   Recalling the Hillsborough disaster, which claimed 96
lives, Clough writes: 7 will always remain convinced that
those Liverpool fans who died were killed by Liverpool peo­
ple. All those lives were lost needlessly.'
    Clough is now living in near reclusive retirement and
there are many, not least the relatives of the dead, who
will judge as heartless and shocking his gratuitous deci­
sion to exhum e the events of that terrible day, April 15,
 1989. B ut two things must be remembered. Clough, whose
N ottingham Forest team were contesting an FA Cup
sem i-final at Hillsborough, was a close witness to the
catastrophe. And there are many who, though they

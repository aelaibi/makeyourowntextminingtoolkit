     It is my intention to hold an Interdepartmental Meeting to review
co-operation in continuing to provide services following Hillsborough. The
purpose of this letter is to invite you to nominate, if you so wish, a representative
from your Department. I would suggest this should be at Assistant Director level.

     The meeting is to be held on Monday, the 19th June at 10.30 a.m. venue to be
arranged.

     At this first meeting a review will be made of action to date and pattern for
the group.

     Please let me know as soon as possible s the name of your representative should
you intent to participate, when further details will be forwarded.


                                  Yours faithfully.




                                  Director of Social Services.

David,

Have liaised with Carole and the two dates most

suitable for an Interdepartment Meeting - post

Hillsborough — are Monday 19th June — morning or

Thursday, 22nd June — afternoon.    Perhaps you would

indicate which you prefer so I can firm up date and make

arrangements to circulate details to other Directors.

             During this time I made two journeys in company with j?'C 272 FQERS.



             I arrived at Hillsborough at approximately 2.50 pm (1450) where                  I went

          told them to make their way towards th               ings Lans end of the

          ground.     I made my way along with PC BOERS.        Upon reaching the halfway

          line    I saw that there were several, fans on the pitch behind the goal

          area.     I made my way across the pitch towards the goal area.         Upon

          reaching the goal posts I realised what was happening and I began
                                    /
          helping any injured persons onto the p i tc h. I also assisted in

          conveying    injured s^ersgms to the gym a r e a .   This   was made possible by

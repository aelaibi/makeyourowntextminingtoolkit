I heard        large     groups           of Liverpool              supporters       walking       up and down,

saying,,      i:A n y spares          b o y s ? !T. This        request was          repeated          by as many as

five    or     six di f f e r e n t        groups        walking       up and       down the       road.

Ground.

All      the    time       I was        outside    I could smell             the    stench of         intoxicating

liquor         from all           the    discarded       cans     on the      road,        some     half    full,    and

Dottles          left      littered about            the     place.        Over     the air a ga in          I heard

someone         pleading           for    the    gate    to be opened and the voice was                        getting

desp er ate.             The      next    moment     I made my w a y           to L.e p p i n g s L n t u r n s t i 1 e s

w h er e    I saw        people w a l k i n g      about,       dazed atid confused.

I saw one m a \ c o m i n g               out    crying and         someone     sKouted at me, "You dick
                                                                                   sO Ca T r z k r -

P o l i c e m e n outside           tSe G ro u n d and a g ai n verbal                insults        came out       such

as,      " Bl oody murderers,               the    blood's        on your       hands'1.          I saw     people      being

ca rried         out     from L ep pi ng s        Ln and        laid on the         terrace at         the    side      of

the Ground.                1 saw        people    choking and being                sick and         people    being

 ca rr ie d      out were          s e m i- co ns ci ou s.       1 ran over         to this area and gave

assistance             where       X could,,        I could see           several          bodies    laid out with

fclanKets over               their       heads,       I then      realised         that      there were       dead

peo pie be i ng            c a r ried oist.        At    thi s moment          i n t ime      I was    unaware        what

had gone           off     inside        the Gr ou nd      or    caused      the    deaths.          Again,    fans       very

t h r e a t en i n g     came and         shouted,       "You fucking           dick        heads,    what    good are

y ou out here?”

An     Inspector           came     over and       told me and            other     Officers         to keep    people

a wa y     from the         bodies.         Again,       faHs     shouted,         "You useless            cunts".        I

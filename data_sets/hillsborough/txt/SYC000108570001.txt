g                     MONDAY, 3rd DECEMBER 1990

             THE CORONER:    Good morning.

                     GRAEME HORST Called (Sworn)

                            By THE CORONER

    Q. You are Graeme Hurst? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. And your address? - A.
       Liverpool.

    Q. You are a sales representative, I think? - A. Not any
       more, I asa general manager.

    Q. Good, well done. On 15th April 1989 you decided to come
       to Sheffield to see the semi-final between Liverpool
       and Nottingham Forest? - A. Yes, sir.
D
    Q. You travelled with your brother-in-law and Kevin and
       Carl Rimnier, is that right? - A. I did.

    Q. You left home at about 10.30, is that right? - A. That
       is right.

    Q. And I think you got to Sheffield by about 2 p.m.? - A.
       To Sheffield probably a bit later, about 2.15 - 2 to
       2.15.

    Q. I think you said you had a trouble free journey? - A.
       tfe did.

    Q. The group split up because the tickets were for
       different sections but you and Carl were together
       initially, is that right? - A. That's right.

    Q.    Both of you were going to go onto the terraces,    is tnat
         correct? - A. That's right.

    Q. You arrived at the Leppings Lane end at what tiiae
       approximately? - A. About 2.30.

    Q. The turnstiles were empty, busy, what was it like? - A.
       ho, we couldn't even see the turnstiles, tnere was that
       many people trying to get to them.

    Q.    In fact, it was a large mass of people, theyweren't
         standing in straight lines? - A. It was.

    Q. Did you see any Police Officers around the turnstile in
       that area? - A. Actually, as I say, I couldn't actually
                                                 G. HURST




see the turnstiles themselves.  The only visible Police
Officers were the ones mounted on horses that were
above head height.

Here they within the crowd or outside the crowd, or
where were they? - A. They were inside the crowd.

when you first saw them you might not have been able to
tell where they were, but did you eventually locate
them as being outside the perimeter gates?  Do you know
what I mean by the perimeter gates? - A. I have a
feeling I do, and I think they were inside the gates.

We will just put this up. We are not going to    spend
much time talking about it, but C258, you will   see it
on the overhead - do you remember seeing those   at all
at any point in time? - A. Yes, I went through   those.

Where would you say the Officers were, this side or
that side, that is all I am interested in at this
stage? - A. I would think the other side of the gates.

In fact, you got quite close to an Officer on a horse
in the end, you and Carl? - A. Yes, that is what
separated us.

Had you by then got through these outer perimeter
gates? - A. Yes, I believe we were, yes.

Were you sure that you had got through the perimeter
gates? - A. Yes.

Then the horse separated you and you lost Carl after
that? - A. That is right.

Lots of people behind you, yes? - A. Yes.

Were you experiencing any forward thrust from the crowd
from behind? - A. Yes.

Did you want to get out of that that? - A. I did.

Were you, in fact, able to manoeuvre yourself .out of
that crowd at that stage? - A. I allowed people trying
to pass me to pass me, and I edged ay way to the right
hand side more so - I couldn't force my way backwards,
but it was easier to go sideways and out of the crowd.

You eventually freed yourself from the crowd and tnat
was about what time? - A. I think it was about 10-to-3.

You stood by the river, near a fence, and you just
hoped .... - A. That's right.  There was a fence and I
think there was a river behind it, and I just stayed by
                                               G. HURST




there just watching to see what was happening, just
allowing things to happen.

You could see a big blue concertina gatef is that
right? - A. I could.

Was that gate eventually opened by some Officers, as
far as you .... - A. That's the gate that was opened,
yes.

Just as a matter of interest, just before the gate was
opened were there a lot of people hard up against that
gate, as you saw it? - A. I didn't think so, no, as I
could virtually see the full gate. It didn't appear to
me to be being pressurised.

You and quite a lot of people or just a few walked
through that gate? This is no criticism of you by the
way, I ara just establishing what happened. - A. No,
okay.  At the time I walked through, I believe in
relative ease.   Had there been a large amount of people
I probably wouldn't have even tried it.

This was shortly after 2.50 I think, was it? You
hadn't been on that river bank for very long? - A. No.

We know the gate was opened from other evidence twice,
but was it opened wide open or just a little bit? - A.
When I went through it, it was opened wide.

You then went to the toilet I think, once you got
through? - A. I did.

Could you see the signs for those? Had you been to
Hillsborough before, perhaps I should ask that? - A. I
had been to Hillsborough before but I had not been on
the Leppings Lane end.

So this was the first time you were there? - A. It was.

You found the toilets because you saw the signs? - A.
Basically, I wanted to go but I could also see that my
tunnel entrance, which was from memory "B", the toilets
were just to the left of them.

Yes, you are quite right.  Then having been to the
"loo", you went down the tunnel, in fact? - A. I did.

Was that because you didn't know of any other way to
get to the stands or was it because you wanted to go
behind the goal? - A. It was because that is where ray
ticket said I should go, through that particular
tunnel.
                                               G. HURST




The ticket, I think, had a "B" entrance on it? - A. It
did.

And there was a "B" next to where you were standing, is
that what you are relying on? - A. That's right, yes.

In fact, you must have gone along the left-hand side of
the tunnel? - A. The wall was on ray left-hand shoulder.

And you entered I think, eventually, Pen 4 - we will
come to that in a moment - the left-hand pen, is that
right? - A. If that is Pen 4, yes.

Was it the left-hand pen? - A. It was the left-hand
side of the goal as you are looking onto the pitch.

Yes, that is the one we call Pen   4. - A. Right.

What was the tunnel like when you were going through? -
A. It was jam packed solid with people.

When you say jam packed solid are you saying that one
could not move, or ...? - A. You were generally carried
with the flow of people all wanting to get onto the
terraces.

Were they walking, running or just pushing? What were
they doing - just standing? - A. Standing, but slowly
moving forward, again with the flow. There was no way
you could run. There wasn't    the space to run.

Too many people? - A. Yes.

Did you - I don't know if you remember, but this tunnel
rises slightly, levels off and then dips towards the
terrace.  Can you remember that? - A. Not being honest,
no.

Could you see the pitch at all whilst you were still in
the tunnel? - A. I could see the goal and I think the
pitch was at eye level.

Could you see whether or not  the players were on it,
playing or not? - A. The players were on it and they
were just getting read to kick off.




                  /Q. So they were lining
                                                                  5




                                                         G. HURST


    Q. So they were lining up you mean? - A. Yes.

B   Q. In their true position, so to speak? - A. Yes.

    Q. You then exited on to the terrace, is that right? -
       A. That is right.

    Q. I think the game kicked off just as you got there? -
       A. Yes.

    Q. When you first exited on to that terrace what was it
       like? Do not tell me when you were half way down or
       anything like but when you first got to the open air
       in the tunnel? - A. Okay.  Basically there was no
       room really to move.  You just had to go with the
       general force of people.

    Q. In which way were you being carried, because that is
       basically what you are saying? - A. Basically forward
       but my own instinct said go towards the side.  You
       couldn't actually go sidewards and so it was more a
       question of diagonally.

    Q. You finished up on a dividing fence between another
       enclosure, is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q.   That we call Pen 5? - A. Yes.

    Q.    That one was empty so far as you remember? - A.     I
         never actually got into the pen.

    Q. You could see through the railings, could you?
       Perhaps you did not, perhaps you did not look, but if
       you did not see it, do not answer? - A. No, that sort
       of thought wasn't even on my mind.

    Q. How crowded would you say the enclosure was as you
       traversed it? - A. It was jam packed.  You can always
       tell if you can only see people's tops of heads
       rather than chest high.  You couldn't move in there.

    Q. Are you an experienced football goer, if that is the
       right word? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Have you been on packed terraces before? - A.      I have.

    Q.   Where were they? - A. I have been on the Kop.

    Q. On the Kop in Anfield? - A. Yes, and I have been at
       Wembley.
                                                           b




                                                      G. HURST


Q. Particularly when you entered, how did that compare
   with those situations? - A. Because it was the worst
   crushing experience I have ever experienced at a
   football match.

Q.   Just tell me how you got out? - A. I climbed over the
     fence on to the side into the pathway, for want of a
     better word, which allows you to get on to the pitch.

Q. That is   what we call Pen 5 pathway. Was that clear
   of people? - A. I helped people climb over before me
   and people after me.

Q. Yes, we    know that.  What I mean is,was it jam
   packed?    - A. The actual pen itself?

Q. Yes. - A. No.

Q. Was  the match still in being when you climbed over? -
   A. Idon't think it was if Iremember.   No, I think
   the game had already been stopped by the time I had
   climbed over.

Q. I would like you to put a cross on the   map with a pen
   and I want you to put the marker where   you finished
   up, so to speak? - A. Right.

Q. Can  you go to the overhead? This will be C.309.  Can
   you  orientate the witness please? Is that where you
   exited from the tunnel? - A. That is where I came on
   to the tunnel.

Q. Do not mark that position.  Mark the position with a
   cross where you finished up against that dividing
   fence.  It is just in front of a barrier, is that
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. What I am interested in is this, and if you cannot
   help me you will have to say; when you were in the
   gangway or Pen 5, did you notice whether people were
   coming past you towards the pitch side from behind
   you, in other words, from further up? - A. Yes.

Q. In what sort of numbers? - A. Just singular.  With
   the nature of the pen you couldn't exactly get a lot
   of people in it at once.

Q. There were a few coming down from the top so to
   speak? - A. There were.
                                               G- HURST


Then I think you went on to the pitch and eventually
found your relatives who were, of course, in a
different part? - A. I did.

Unfortunately, as we know, poor Carl lost his life,
did he not? - A. Yes.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:

Could you look at C.263? Mr. Hurst, that is a view
of the tunnel which you entered? - A. Yes.

Do you see the letter B on the left hand side? - A. I
do.
Is that the letter you were referring to when you
said you went down that tunnel because you had a
letter B on your ticket? - A. I did, yes.

You have mentioned that when you were in the tunnel
you were carried with the flow of people? - A. I was,
yes.

You also said when you entered the terrace you had to
go with the general force of the people? - A. That is
right.

Was the picture then that really you had no choice
but to move forward with the crowd? - A. It is.    Had
I been able to move backwards, go in through the
tunnel I would have got out.

When you entered the terrace, is it fair to say that
that terrace was full? - A. It was.

If I had   tapped you on the shoulder and said, "I am
going to   introduce a few more hundred, up to a
thousand   more people on to that terrace, what would
you have   said? - A. That you probably would have been
insane.

You said that your instinct was to go sideways? - A.
It was.

Did you realise until the day of this disaster that
in fact you could not move sideways right across the
terrace? - A. No, I was not.

That in fact your way was barred by radial fences? -
A. I did not know that.
                                                        G. HURST


Q. Is it normal behaviour when you go on to a terrace
   that you enter at the back and then you try and move
   sideways across the terrace if,you can? - A. Normally
   I would say it isn't.  On-the few grounds I have been
   to normally you enter from either side.

Q. So you go from the sides? - A. Normally.

Q. On this occasion you did not realise you could go
   from the sides? - A. No, basically I just followed
   what the ticket said.

                  Cross-Examined bv MR. CATCHPOLE:

Q. Mr. Hurst, when you came through the concertina gate
   no-one asked you for your ticket I assume? - A. No.

Q.   So you held on to your whole ticket?     - A. I did.

Q.    Normally when you go through the turnstiles... - A.
     Part of the ticket is kept.

Q. Could we look at C.288 please?  If you have your
   photocopy it might be easier.  Mr. Hurst, do you see
   the front of the ticket there? - A. I do.

Q.   It says,   "Leppings Lane standing"? -   A. Yes.

Q.   Is the left hand side of that ticket as you look at
     it with the perforation the stub that would normally
     be handed in at the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. You see as you go down it says, "row, seat, entrance
   and gangway" down on the left hand side? - A. Yes.

Q. Now "row, seat and gangway" do not apply when you are
   on the terraces, do they? - A. No.

     THE CORONER:   That is what he is looking at, Mr.
Catchpole, so that you can see the quality of it but it is
the same as that on the screen.

Q.       MR. CATCHPOLE:  It says "entrance B" on that left
     hand stub? - A. Yes, that is right.
                                                     G. HURST



             So if you had gone through those turnstiles that would
             have been handed in and the turnstile operator would have
             kept it? - A. Presumably.
B
             On the right hand side, which is the one y o u w o u l d have
    Q.
             kept, it does not have anything except L e p p i n g s >Lane.
             Standing." and then "Liverpool Area ? - A. That is right.

    Q. Could you look at C.257? - A. Right.

    Q. Do you see those turnstiles there? - A. Yes.
             They are, take it from me, the turnstiles that if you
    Q.
             have a standing ticket for the Leppings Lane terraces you
             should go through in the event that someone doesn t open
             a big gate. - A. Right.
             Over the top of the turnstiles do you see the letter "B ?
    Q.
             - A. I do.

    Q.       If you had gone, looking at your ticket, through the
D            normal route, and this is not any criticism, you would
             have looked at your ticket, you would have gone to the
             entrance to the ground, would that entrance have been the
             turnstiles? - A. I would have presumed so, yes.

    Q. That would have had the letter B over the top? - A.
       Right.

    Q.
             You would have had that stub taken away from you. - A.
             OK.

    Q.
             When you got into the ground you would have been left^
             with the other half of the ticket which has no lettering
             on it? - A. Yes.
             Do you think the fact that purely by chance a gate was
             opened and no-one took your ticket possibly led you to
             believe, mistakenly, that the letter B on the stub that
             would have been retained was referring to the B that Mr.
             King referred you to, over the tunnel? - A. It does now,
             y es.

                   THE CORONER:    Thank you.    I am very grateful to
              you for coming.

         Are you a Liverpool supporter? - A. Yes.
    Q*
         You. decided to come to the semi-final? - A. Yes.
    Q.

    o. You came on an organised party on a coach? - A. Yes.

    Q*
         With some friends, I   presume? - A. Yes.

         Although it was on a coach it w a s independently
    Q.
         organised?   It wasn't an official party, as sucn. - A.
         Yes.

    Q.
         What time did you leave Kirkby? - A. About ten o'clock.

         In your statement you said 10.30-10.45, is that wrong?
    Q.
D        It doesn't matter, I just want to know. - A. It was about
         that.   I think we got there at ten and left about...

    Q.
         I see, got to the bus stop or the coach stop and then
         there was a bit of a delay? - A. Yes.

         Then the coach drove more or less non-stop until, I think
    Q.
         you said, about two miles outside Sheffield? - A. Yes.

         Did you have a reasonably journey up to that point? - A.
    Q.
         Yes.
         I take it it stopped because there was a small pub tciere
    Q.
         and you got out? - A. It was organised we were going to
         go there.

    Q. It was pre-arranged,     so to speak? - A. Yes.

    Q. Do you remember the name of the pub?   If you don t it
       doesn't matter. - A. No, I haven't got a clue.

         You didn't stay there very long because I think you came
         and parked near a supermarket near Leppings Lane at about
         what time? - A. It would be about 2.30.

     0. I think there was a supermarket there? — A. Yes, Gateway.

     0 . You left the coach, is that right? - A. Yes.   The coach
         didn't park there because it was 2.30, so he dropped us
         off and we made our way...

    Q.
          find... - A. Yes.    I can't remember where.
    d
          At that point there were some police officers in that
    Q.
B         area but-you had no contact with them as such? - A. No.

          You weren't the only supporter who was in that area,
          there were others as  well? ~ A. Yes.

    Q. A lot?      A few? - A. Loads.
          As far as you were concerned everything was perfectly
    Q.
          normal, no fighting,  no... - A. Yes, just a normal match
          day.
          Did you see anybody carrying cans of alcohol at that
    Q.
          point? - A. I can't remember.   Probably were.

    o. Whether they did or they didn't they were, as far as you
       were concerned, perfectly all right? - A. Yes.

    Q.
          You arrived at the ground at about 2.40? - A. Yes.
D
    Q.
          Had you been to the match in 1988 as well? - A. Yes.

    Q.
          What time did you arrive at the ground in 1988? - A.
          About 1.00 to 1.30.
          So quite considerably earlier in 1988? - A. Yes.
    Q.
          In 1988 I take it - 1988 we are talking about now - when
    Q.
          you arrived were there crowds outside the turnstiles. -
          A. No, there were no queues at all.   It was virtually
          empty.
          However this year it was a bit different? - A. Yes.
    Q.
          Just very briefly tell me what it was like?     - A. Everyone
    Q.
          seemed to arrive at exactly the same time.        It was just
          a mass disorder.    No queues whatsoever.

        0., You are saying "everybody".   Are we talking about
            hundreds or thousands of people? - A. Hundreds.
            Hundreds of people outside.

        o., Did you see any mounted officers? ~ A. Yes.

        o., About how many did you see? - A. About half   a dozen.

          . Where were’ they?  Were they outside the perimeter gates

            or were they within the perimeter gates? - A. Both, some
            in and some out.

    Q. Do you know what I mean by the perimeter gates? - A. I
       think I do.
    0.   Just stick it up, it is C.258.   Those ^ e the perimeter
B    '   gates.You say there were some    on the outside   this
         side of the photograph - and some on the xnsxde. - A.
         Yes.
    0    I think you describe what these mounted officers were
         doing.   Can you tell me what you saw they were up to. -
         A. They were filtering them through so many at a txme.

    0. You put your hands like this.   Are you saying the horses
       were horizontally across the gate?  Is that what you are
       trying to say? - A. Yes.
    0. How were they effecting the filter?   What were they
       doing with their horses in order to filter, as you put
       it? - A. Blocking people from going through.

    Q. Did they let people through in batches, or tf.iat? - A.
       Yes.
D
    Q. How did they do that? - A. The horses just moved.

    Q. What you are saying is they were in a line head to tail?
       - A. More or less.
    0. It is very difficult to-put horses absolutely in line but
       that was the general impression you got? - A. Yes.

    Q. Then they moved and people got through. - A. Yes.

    Q. Could you see whether the gates behind the horses were
       open or shut? ~ A. I couldn t see.

    0. But the people who went through this row of officers,
       vanished, so to speak, or disappeared from your sxght,
       would that be right? - A. They just went.  Well, you
       could still see them because horses are bxgger, lxke.




                          0. Because there was,

                                       T.K. HILTON


Q. Because there was quite a crowd ahead of them as well,
   wasn't  there? - A. Yes.

Q. So you could see these horses and you recognised what they
   were attempting to do? - A. Yes, because we did actually
   get stopped and then we went through.

0. Were there people around you, behind you, who appeared
   to be pushing forward at that point? - A. Well everyone was
   trying to get in, yes.

Q.    They were trying to get in? - A. Yes.

Q.    Was it quite severe pressure? - A. No.

0. Just gentle nudges.  You said, I am just reading what you
   said in your statement, I want to try and establish what
   the facts are.

            "At the Leppings Lane point of the ground the
            mounted Police were letting 100-150 people
            through a cordon at a time, but   the number
            of people trying to get to the turnstiles was
            so great that I felt myself being forced   down
            to the ground because the people at  the front
            were pushing back and those at the back were
            pushing forward by this time."

      Now that does not sound quite like what you have just told
      me.  Can you just tell me what it was really like at that
      position when you were there? - A. It just was not bad.
      It was just normal for a normal football match.

Q. I see.  Eventually you got through the cordon with your
   friend.  That is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. And you then approached the turnstiles.  Was it those turn­
   stiles that you can see in the back there labelled A
   with a letter B above them? - A. I could not see any ....

 Q.   Once you got through the cordon of horses could you see
      them? - A. We just made our way towards where the people
      were.

 Q.   So   you weren't actually looking out? — A. No.

 Q.   But you could see there were people and you took it they
      were aiming for a turnstile? - A. Yes.

 Q. I think you actually eventually got through one? - A. Yes.

 Q. And that was at about what time? - A. 10-to-3.

 Q. 10-to-3 or 5-to-3? - A. I didn't look at my watch.
                                                                    14

                                          T.K. HILTON


    Q. You don't know.   About that time? - A. About that.

    Q. Anti I think you had lost your friend hadn't you at this
       stage? - A. Both of them, yes.

    Q. You didn't go down the tunnel, did you? - A. I went sort
B      of, I think I went round, I am not sure.

    Q. And you didn't see any big concertina gates open at all?
       - A. No.                                           '

    Q. Had you been to this ground before? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you know one could get round the side? - A. The year
       before I had been in the stands.

    Q. So what made you decide to go round the edges rather than
       round the middle? - A. I don't know.  I just did.

    Q. Did you see any signs directing you in that direction?
       - A. No.

    Q. You did the right thing in the event.  You did not look
       but you decided ___   Did you go left or right, can you
D      remember? - A. It was right.

    Q. And perhaps one other thing on the turnstiles. In fact
       although you proffered your ticket the turnstile operator
       never took it off you, did he? - A. I still had it.  I
       gave it up to the Hillsborough fund.

    Q. Were there people pushing behind to try and get through.
       Were people anxious to get through the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

    Q. Because it was getting near the ....  A. Right outside the
       turnstiles that is where the real pushing was like.

    Q. I see, so there was some pushing     there? - A. There was   a lot

    Q. Was it severe or not? - A. Very.

    Q. Did you have the impression that  people were  getting hurt?
       Were you hurt, perhaps I will ask you? — A. No, my mate
       was having trouble staying up and I said:  "Keep on your
       feet like".  People were treading on the back of your legs.

    Q. This was from pressure from behind you? - A. This was just
       right outside the gates.

    Q. Did you see any Police Officers right outside the turnstiles
       - A. No, I didn't look.

    Q. You don't have to.  In fact the area just behind the turn­
       stiles before you set off to go round the side was fairly
       clear of people? - A. Yes.

You went round the side.         Is that correct? - A. Yes.

Do you remember which enclosure you entered? - A. It was
1 or 2.  I can't remember now for sure.

It was on the edge near the South Stand.            Is that right?
- A. Yes.
      THE CORONER: Could we just put the plan up.   We
will just show you a plan because it helps us tounderstand
what you are say-ing.

Can you orientate yourself on that plan?  Are you any good
at plans?  Do you want to look at the model first oj . all.
Would that be easier for you? - A. No, it is all right.

Go up to Sergeant Griffiths and with the pointer just show
us where you went?

       MR.   JONES:   This is C27 4 sir.

       THE   CORONER:    Where    did you go? - A. H e r e .

 In fact you might as well, this is one of the acetates which
 you can mark.  Mark it.  Put a cross where you went? - A.
 There.
       MR. JONES:       The marked copy,    sir, is now C310.

       THE CORONER:  It is exactly the same as 274 but it has
 now got a cross on it which converts it into something.

       MR. PAYNE:       Sir, we could not actually see where he
 marked it.
       THE CORONER:   Put it up again.  He is just signing it
 so that we know.   Can you stand to one side because Counsel
 can't see it.  Sergeant Griffiths, with your pointer just
 point where the cross is so that people can see it or the
 mark.  Can you see Mr. Payne?

       MR. PAYNE:       Yes,   thank you.

       THE CORONER:  Come back,         would you?     Had the match
 kicked off at that point? - A.         No.

. Were the players on the field?        - A. No.

. So nothing was happening apart        from the noise?    - A.   And
  singing.

. The usual? - A. Yes.

. Were you happy in that location? - A. Yes.

Did you stay there throughout? - A. No.

Tell me what you did? - A. I went to look for my friends
because I wanted to be near some friends.

What did you do? How did you progress? -     A. I don't know.
It is just a bit    of a blank now how I got round or where I
went.
Well did you go back out or did you stay? - A. I know I
went into one of the other pens but I don't know how I got
there.  I can't remember now.

It is quite important to try and remember this because it
is a very important point you see? - A. I just can t remember.

Do you know which pens you entered? - A. That one there
and I was in one  of the other ones to the left.

Did you move up    the plan, so to speak, up towards    the North
Stand? - A. Yes,   I moved towards that area.

Did you     climb across dividing barriers? - A. No.

 Did you    go out on to the pitch and walk along the front?
 - A. No.
 You stayed within the terracing? - A. Yes,       I stayed within
 the terracing.

 Perhaps I can help you there, there are gates at the back
 of the terracing.  Did you walk along the back wall at all?
 - A. I could have been.  I am really not sure.

 Do you remember crossing the opening of the tunnel on the
 inside of the ground? - A. No.  It is all a blank now.

 In your statement, I will just read this to you and may be
 it will  refresh your memory and if it doesn't say so:

       "I made my way from Pen 1 or 2 back in front
       of the West Stand by the opening of the tunnel.
       This would be about 3.05".

  Does that bring anything back?        It does not bring anything
  back.  Were you caught up in any surges? - A. The next
' thing I can re m e m b e r then was Liverpool were on the attac
  and I think Peter Beardsley hit the post and next minute
  it just went blank again then.

, Where were you when that happened? - A. I think I was in
  Pen 4 then.

 So you are saying that you do remember, though you can't
 remember how you got there, but you were in Pen 4 when
 Beardsley hit the cross? - A. Yes, I remember that.

Q. You do definitely? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember anything else about what happened after
   that within that enclosure? - A. All as I can remember
   was just climbing out.

Q. Which way did you climb out? - A. Over the fence.

Q. Front? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you remember how you got there? - A. No.

Q. You can't remember anything else about the event at this
   stage? - A. No.

                      Cross-Examined by MR. H A L E :

Q. I think you are one of the first people if not the first
   to have actually gone through the turnstiles to get on.
   You would not know that, I am sorry, I am just making
   that as a comment but you went through the turnstile.   Is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Have you    been to many football matches? - A.      Yes.

Q. Are the turnstiles by and large the same at all places?
   - A. The turnstiles are but the area towards the turnstiles
   a r e n 't .

Q. No,   I mean the turnstiles themselves? - A. Yes.

Q. So if you were going to a strange ground and you had never
   been there in your life before, nevertheless you would have
   a pretty good idea of what the turnstiles are like? — A.
   Yes.

Q. How they operate? - A. Yes.

Q. And I am  sure everybody knows, some of the ladies on the
   jury may not if they have not been to football matches,
   but the whole point of a turnstile is to let one person
   through at a time? - A. Yes.

Q.-And it is on a ratchet, it only goes at a certain speed?
   - A. Yes, it has got to- be clicked before.

Q. Yes.  In your experience can you speed that operation up
   by pushing and trying to get through faster? - A. Well
   some people do, yes.

Q. But do they succeed, do they make the machinery go faster?

            Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Could you give your full name again, please, clearly? -
A. Thomas Kenneth Hilton.

It is obvious front your evidence that some of the
things that happened are clear in your mind and others
are not clear at all, and I am only going to ask you
about what is clear in your mind, do you understand? -
A. Yes.

If you are not sure about anything then say so. The
first thing is the difference between the two events in
1988 and 1989.  You have given your account of what
happened and your comment was that in 1989 everyone
seemed to arrive at exactly the same time. That is
your general comment? - A. Yes.

I wonder, since you were one of those who arrived at
different times on the two different matches, can you
explain why it was that in 1989 so many people arrived
shortly before the kick off? - A. I couldn*t say, no.
I had heard there was a lot of roadworks on the way to
Sheffield in 1989, but the year before was just so much
better.  The Police were meeting us at the motorway and
taking us in at certain times, and obviously the year
before they took us in earlier.

But in 1989 you just drove straight through.  Here you
held up on the roadworks? - A. I can't remember.

So the only thing you can say is roadworks? - A. Yes.

Now describe in as much detail as you can the attempts
by the Policemen on the horses to filter the crowd.
You have got them positioned and you demonstrated with
your hands, the hands each facing inwards, and you have
said what you thought the Police were trying to do.
Now what did the crowd do when they approached the
Policemen on the horses?- A. They were trying to get to
the turnstiles as quickly as possible.

Yes, that is what they were trying to do.  Describe
what you say, can you?  In your own words describe what
you saw the crowd doing. - A. Just running, walking and
running towards the turnstiles.

Walking and running towards the turnstiles, and then a
big mass of people built up? - A. Yes, and then the
Police let .... (inaudible).

I am sorry, say that again? - A. The Police probably
let them through because there was a mass building up.
                                                  T. K. HILTON




Q. Just describe what you saw, and what did you see the
   people doing when they arrived at the horses? - A. Some
   people were running under them.

Q. Running under the horses? - A. Yes - not many, but a
   few.

Q. What else? What picture - you see the Jury weren't
   there and they can only rely on what you saw, and other
   witnesses, of course. - A. Just the Police were just,
   with the horses, horizontal and then they would just
   back up a bit and let a few people through, and people
   were running underneath them and round them.

Q. People were running underneath and round them? - A.
   Yes.

Q.    You have not actually - it is not your fault, you
     haven*t been asked - what is your experience of going
     to other football matches? How long have you been
     doing it and how many matches? - A. Quite a few years.
     I have been to a lot of football matches.

0.. At different grounds? - A. Different grounds,    yes.

Q.   Is it you? experience that when a large crowd arrives
     all at the same time outside a football match - do you
     understand what I am saying? - A. Yes.

Q. It is difficult for the Police then to control the
   advance of the crowd? - A. Yes, but normally they don't
   arrive all at the same time.

Q. Normally what? - A. Normally they don't arrive at the
   same time.

Q. No, quite, I appreciate that.  Have you ever in the
   matches you have been to ever seen so many people
   arriving at the same time shortly before the kick off?
   - A. Never.

Q. Never anything like this before? - A. No.

Q. Just give a bit more information about your experience
   so we know what you are describing.  In other matches,
   I mean, how often and where and when and all that? - A .
   It is not so congested, you know, the roads ....

Q.    No, I want to find out how often you have been to
     football matches.  How old are you now? - A. 21.

As a Liverpool supporter? - A. Yes.

Do you go to Anfield to watch them play there? - A. I
used to, yes.

How many seasons? - A. I used to go every season from
about 1977 onwards.

How many matches each season? - A. Most of thera.

That's at home? - A. At home, yes.

What about away matches?   Did you go to those? - A. We
used to go FA Cup matches, most of them.

Every cup match? - A. Not every one, no.

I am sorry, I can't hear what you are saying. - A. Only
most of them, not every one.

Most cup matches? - A. Yes.

That's away.  Did you also go to League fixtures away
from home? - A. Only some.  Only if it was a special
occasion, like we were down there visiting, or whenever
we were visiting we would go to the match.

How many seasons are you talking about? - A. About
eight.

About eight seasons? - A. Yes.

This is the biggest crowd you have ever seen arriving
shortly before the kick off? - A. Yes.

Thank you.

You were asked by Mr. Hale - the gentleman, he won't
mind me describing him, with a beard - about
turnstiles, and you said turnstiles are normally the
same at every ground? - A. Yes.

But the area outside is different? - A. Yes.

Can you give us some examples of how different the area
outside can be? - A. Well on there, on. the picture ....

Which picture are you looking at?- A. C258 - I have
never really seen anything like that before.

0. i/hat was it about what you saw and what you can see in
   that picture which struck you as different? - A. There
   are too many fences dividing the turnstiles.

Q. The turnstiles which you went through, there were seven
   of them, just seven.  Is it your experience that, in
   fact, you can have a far greater number of turnstiles
   for you to choose to go through? - A. Yes.

Q. You will see looking at the same picture that the
   turnstiles you were going through, those seven, are in
   an arc, they are not straight across they are arced? -
   A. I can't tell.

Q. You can't tell.  The area where you have to wait, if we
   can see if I can find a better photograph for      you - if
   you look at 260 for the moment - you see beyond the
   cones - you see the roadway, don't you? - A. Yes.

Q. You see, when you arrive at this ground you come to a
   bend in the road and the arc of turnstiles is across
   the bend in the road, and there is a waiting area
   between the roadway and the perimeter gates.   You may
   not be able to see it on that.   Let me see if I can
    show you on 256. You see there isn't the roadway, that
    is a sort of concreted forecourt area, you see? - A.
   Yes.

Q. So what can differ from ground to ground is the amount
   of space which is available for you to queue up at the
   turnstiles, do you understand? - A. Yes.

Q. So the differences can be the number of turnstiles, the
   number of fences and the amount of space, right? - A.
   Yes.  I have never really seen fencing like that at a
   ground.

Q. If we look at the amount of space available outside the
   seven turnstiles, if we look at C254 again, please, you
   see that is the perimeter gate leading to the seven
   turnstiles which you had to enter, and do you see there
   is a fence on your left, isn't there? - A. Yes.

Q. And there is another fence on the right? - A. Yes.

Q. Would you agree with me that that is a very confined
   space for people to have to queue? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it your experience that at other grounds you have a
   far greater number of turnstiles and a far greater
   amount of space? - A. Yes.

        THE CORONER:   Mr. King, I think, I am not giving
   anything away, there are 63 turnstiles around this
                                                    T. K. HILTON




ground, and it may be that there are a thousand
turnstiles at other grounds.  What is it that you are
trying to establish with this witness?

     MR. KING:   With respect, sir, for seven - well, I
will put it through the witness:
Those seven turnstiles were the turnstiles with letter
"B" over it - you may be able to see it there.   I don't
know if you can on that photograph.   Those were the
turnstiles through which everybody who was going on the
terraces had to go through. That was about 10,000
people, and what I ara asking you is, you have had on^
many occasions had to go on terraces to stand, haven t
you? - A. Yes.

Have you ever had the experience of going to a ground
where you yourself had a choice of a much larger number
of turnstiles to get to the same area? - A. There is
not normally more turnstiles but there is just a
greater amount of space to queue up.

So be it.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I will take that further with
other witnesses:

When you got into your pen originally that, I think,
was Pen 2 you originally got on, what was it like in
Pen 2? How crowded was it in Pen 2? - A. Reasonable,
just a reasonable amount of people in there.

Was there space for you to get into it? - A. Yes.

You had no difficulty getting into Pen 2? - A. No.

Thank you.

             Cross-Examined by   iMR.   CATCHPOLE

Mr. Hilton, when you went through the turnstiles you
said you went over to the right hand side, and went
round into Pen 1 or 2? - A. Yes.

Do you have any clear recollection about what your
movements were? Did you get a programme when you went
through the turnstiles? - A. No.

You just went round there? - A. Yes.

Do you have any recollection of whether it was
difficult or not to get there, easy to get there? - A.
No, I only remember going round.
                                             T. K. HILTON




fou found you way there quite happily? - A. Yes.

Going back outside the ground, can I just ask you to
look at C305? You said very fairly this was the
largest number of people you have ever seen arrive at a
football match at the same time? - A. Yes.

This photograph was taken slightly before you arrived,
but you presumably would have assumed that a large
number of people arrived in front of you because you
would have seen a large number of people waiting when
you arrived, about 2.40.  Do you see all these people
standing here, there is some space between them, they
are waiting, it doesn't appear that they are pushing
forward? - A. No.

They look as if they are waiting to get in through the
turnstiles outside the ground? - A. Yes.

Was that the scene that you saw when you arrived,
people standing waiting patiently to get in? - A. I
can t remember.

Do you remember what you said about what it was like
outside those turnstiles? - A. When we actually got up
to it, it was chaotic.

Well you can see the turnstile wall, it is right on the
right-hand side.  Does anyone look as if they are in
discomfort there? - A. No.

So this scene is very different from the one that you
were describing? - A. Yes.

Thank you very much.

           Cross-Examined by HRS. McBRIEH

Mr. Hilton, you say you had never seen so many people
arriving at the turnstiles in such large numbers.   Do
you think that there could have been ticket-less fans
amongst those crowds that you saw? - A. There could
have been.

Therefore swelling the numbers there? - A. I know from
experience that some people do go down without tickets.

Especially as Liverpool had been allocated such a very
poor allocation? - A. Yes.

And it was such an important match.

     THE CORONER:      You have gone far enough, I think.
                                            T. K. HILTON




     MRS. McBRIEN:   Are ticket-less fans normally
filtered out quite a distance away from the turnstile
area? - A. Well normally ....

     THE CORONER:    Hang on ....

     MRS. McBRIEN:    In your experience, I meant.

     THE CORONER:   You can answer that.  In your
experience have you ever been filtered out? - A. Yes,
the year before we had been asked to show our tickets
before we went through.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   What point was that, please? - A.
It was quite a fair bit down the road.

Which end of the road are you talking about?   The
garage end or the ...? - A. The garage end.

How was tnat being operated? How were the Police
filtering out the fans? - A. There was a metal fence
across and you had to show your ticket before you went
past.

So that year, of course, there was going to be less
people ....

     THE CORONER:    No.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   All right, I think that is enough.
Thank you, Mr. Hilton.

            Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL

Mr. Hilton, your experience that year, 1989, was that
you were dropped off outside a Gateway Supermarket at
about half-past-2? - A. Yes.

It is a large supermarket, that Gateway, isn’t it? - A.
I have seen a lot bigger.  It is not that big really.

But it has its own car-park surrounding it? - A. Yes.

And it is about three-quarters of a mile from the
ground? - A. I don't know how far it is.  It is not
that far away.

You recall reaching the back of the crbwd outside the
Leppings Lane entrance at about 2.40, is that right? -
A. It would be about right, yes.

And you describe the scene there as one of chaos, I
think? - A. Yes, when we got through to it, yes.
                                            T. K. HILTON




But it was a scene of chaos which you negotiated by
first of all getting through the crowd outside the
perimeter gates and then making your way through the
chaos inside the perimeter gates to the turnstiles and
through the far side of the turnstiles in about 15
minutes? - A. Yes, about that.

Because you said that you were through the turnstiles
by about 5-to-3? - A. Yes.

Do you remember noting what time you had got through
the turnstiles or is that a matter of impression? - A.
Impression, yes.

A matter of impression? - A. Yes.

You told us that you went round the end of the stand,
into what we know as Pen 2, or Enclosure 2. Can you
remember, I don't think you have been asked this yet,
when you arrived on the terrace in Enclosure 2 was
anything happening on the pitch? - A. No.

Had the game started? - A.   No.

Had the players arrived on   the pitch? - A. No.

The only event that you recall happening is the event
we can see happening on video, when Beardsley hit the
crossbar - you remember that? - A. Yes, the post or
crossbar, I don't know.

Post or crossbar - I think   we know from other evidence
that it was the crossbar.    At that stage you were in
Enclosure 4? - A. Yes.

And at some stage in the preceding minutes before that
you had made your way from Enclosure 2 to Enclosure 4,
is that right? - A. Yes.

Although you don't precisely remember how you got from
Enclosure 2 to Enclosure 4, what your recollection is
firm about is that you did not leave the terraces in
order to do so? - A. Yes.

So somehow you made your way from Enclosure 2 through
Enclosure 3 and into Enclosure 4, that would follow,
wouldn't it? - A. Yes.

It was a manoeuvre or a journey that you weren't
deterred from making by the volume of people, were you?
- A. No.

        Q. Nor was it a journey which you found it impossible to
           make because of the volume of people? - A. Obviously,
           no.

Q. If you did not leave the terraces it would seem you
   either got over the fence into Enclosure 3 or made
   your way via the gate at the top of the radial fence
   between Enclosure 2 and Enclosure 3. Can you
   remember which of those means of getting into
   Enclosure 3 you adopted? - A. I would have gone for
   the gate.  I wouldn't have climbed over.

Q. I am sorry? - A. I would have gone for the gate and I
   wouldn't have climbed over.

Q. Again having got across Enclosure 3, would you have
   climbed over the radial fence between Enclosure 3 and
   Enclosure 4 or would you have gone across the top of
   the radial fence and across the mouth of the
   tunnel? - A. I wouldn't have climbed over any fence.

Q. You would have gone via the tunnel if your
   recollection about staying on the terraces is
   correct? - A. Yes.

                  Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. Have you ceased to be a Liverpool supporter because
   you say you no longer go to Anfield?  Is that the
   reason why you do not go there any more? - A. No, I
   am still a Liverpool supporter.

Q. But you are not watching matches at the moment? - A.
   No.

     THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to
have a coffee now.  Before we go, can I just say something?
In one of the sessions when you were not here it was
suggested that you should have a look at the video.   In
fact, it had been in my mind that we should do that and the
suggestion is that we should do it sooner rather than
later.  I think that is right actually.  I think we are
going to make an arrangement at some time to watch that
video again.  I know it is upsetting but this time round
you will see a lot more.  It may be that we will have to
watch it again because there is a lot on those videos and
it will make things clearer.  We will decide how we are
doing with our witnesses but be prepared for the video.   Is
that all right? Yes.

       was actually stopped by the Police? - A. Yes.

B   Q. What did they do? - A. Just got on board and asked

    0. Did not search everybody or anything like that? - A.

       jogging.

Q. I forgot to ask you but outside the gates which yotO
   have described as being shut, were there any
   horses? - A. Three.

Q. Which way were they facing?  Into the crowd or in
   line with the gate? - A. Sideways on for to stop you.

Q. Did you hear one of the Officer speak to the crowc? -

   that .

Q. Why was that? - A. They were ducking underneath the
   horses.

Q. So he was not very happy about that? - A. No.

   picture can you see a van? - A. Yes.                q

Q. Can you point to the van first of all?   Do you sea
   that van? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it beyond that van? - A. It was round about

Which would indicate you were going to the right
behind the van? - A. Yes.

This gate was opened.  You do not know how it was
opened but it was open? - A. Yes, opened.

It was wide open? - A. Yes.

This is after 2.55, is that right? - A. Yes.

You cannot say how many minutes, I do not suppose? -
A. I haven't got a clue.

As you were approaching it, did you see people
climbing over turnstiles and so on? - A. Yes.

In fact I think you saw an Officer who was helping
people? - A. Yes, he was telling them for to get down
at first.
Pardon? - A. He was telling them for to get down at
first and then he was helping them up.

Then he helped them up? - A. Yes.

So when you first saw this gate which you went
through, not the perimeter gates, was it shut or
open, can you remember that? - A. It was shut when we
first went in. They were all shut once we got
through the gates.

When you got through these perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

Everything was shut? - A. Yes, beyond that was shut
again.

Then they said, "Keep to the right, lads" and you
said there was a crush there, is that right? - A.
Yes, and then they opened the gates.

Then they opened the gates and then you and others
went in? - A. Went in.

You had never been to the ground before.   Your
brother John had I think? - A. Yes.

I think you were towards the tunnel,   is that right? -
A. Yes.

             Q. Just as a matter of interest why did you do that? -
                A. You had no option.
         B
             Q. Pardon? - A. You had no option you had for to go in
                with crowd.  You couldn't turn around and try to
                find....

             Q. You could not see any other signs? - A. No.

             Q. Did you actually look for any other signs or did you
                not? - A. Once we knew they had opened the gates we
                just went to it.

             Q. You did not stop to look around and say, "Where shall
                we go" and then see a sign? - A. No.

             Q. Was it because the crowd was going in that direction?
                - A. The crowd was going that way.

             Q. Then there was a bit of jeering and singing? - A.
         D      Yes.

             Q. The wrong team but we will forget that.    You got into
                the tunnel? - A. Yes.

             0. What was the tunnel like when you got in? - A. It was
                full.

             0. Was it full by which you mean blocked? - A. No,
                full.

             Q.   But you were able to make progress? -A. Yes.

             Q.    Were you and the others walking, running, pushing or
                  what? - A. A bit of a push really.

             Q.   Pardon?   - A. A bit of a push.

             Q. Because there was a bit of congestion ahead of you? -
                A. Yes.

             Q. Can you remember before you got. on to the terraces,
                when you were still in the tunnel, were you able to
                see whether the players were on the pitch at all? -
                A. I think they were really.

             Q. Because you can actually see the pitch from certain
                positions? - A. Yes.  They might have been
                practising.

0. You do not remember them playing at that point? - A.
   No.
Q. When you exited from the tunnel, when you came out,
   which way did you go? Did you go to the right hand
   enclosure or the left hand enclosure? - A. What?
   When we went on to the terraces, do you mean?

Q. Yes. - A. The right hand side.

Q. Did you, as a matter of interest, know that this
   terracing was divided into segments? - A. Not a clue.

Q. You did not know that? - A. No.

g. But you went into the right hand side? - A. Yes.

Q. I want you to tell me as you came out of the tunnel
   what was happening on the pitch first of all? - A. I
   can't really remember that.

Q. What was the terrace like? - A. There was people
   trying to get out.

Q. How crowded was it? - A. Packed.

Q. Was it so crowded that you thought, "My goodness,    I
   am turning round and going back"? - A. Yes.

Q. You did not turn round because you felt you could
   not, is that right? - A. No, I went straight forward.

Q. Did you go voluntarily forward? Did you decide on
   going forward and you went? - A. No, you had no
   option, you had for to go.

Q. Why was that? - A. Because of the crush behind us.

Q. So you are saying you were being propelled forward? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Is that correct? - A. Yes.

Q. If one is propelled forward there are at least two
   varieties.  One is that you are propelled, totally
   unable to do anything about it? - A. Yes.

Q. And the second propelling is that you are pushed
   forward but you can still have some control over your
   movements.  What was it? - A. Oh no, it was the first
   one.  You had no option.
                                                                 J /

    Q. Did you go straight down the middle? - A. Yes.
B
    Q. By that railing in the middle or not? - A. Close to
       there.
    Q. In fact at that point how far down the terrace did
       you get before there was a pause in your progress?
       Was it halfway down, quarter of the way down, three-
       quarters? - A. I can't remember really.  Where I
       ended up is where I stayed.

    Q. Tell me where you ended up? - A. About fifteen feet
       away from the fence, something like that.  Not so far
       away.
    Q. We will get you to show us on a little plan in a
       moment but at that point had the match already kicked
       off or was it just starting to kick off or what? - A.
       I could see Ian Rush running around with his track
D      suit top on and Bruce Grobbelaar.

    Q. Did you see the match kick-off? - A. No.

    Q. You are quite sure? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you hear a whistle? - A. Yes, I heard a whistle.

    Q. You did not see it but you heard a whistle? - A. Yes.

    Q. I think you thought that might have been it? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. Did you hear any cheering? - A. Yes.

    Q.    Was it coming from within the enclosure inwhich  you
         were? - A. I don't think so. I think it was coming
         from the back of us really.

    Q. From the back of you? - A. Yes.

    Q. In the enclosure but from the back of you? - A. Yes.

    Q. You are not talking of the people in front but the
       people behind you? - A. Yes, it must have been
       because there was no cheering where I was.

    Q.   No cheering where you were? - A. No.

In your own words just tell me what it was like where
you were fifteen feet from the front? What was it
like at that point in that position? - A. Terrible.

Were you able to move at all? ~ A. No.

Were you able to shout? - A. Bits.

A bit.  Did you in fact shout? - A. "Get back, get
back" really, yes.

You shouted "Get back"? ~ A. Yes.

Did you hear other people shouting "Get back"? - A.
Yes.
Is this just within the enclosure or did you hear
them from the pitch side as well? - A. No, not then.

Not then? - A. No.
perhaps we ought to get you to mark the plan because
it will be easier.  Can you just stand up and walk
round to the overhead projector? Show the position
you were describing? Can you do it?

         MR. JONES:   That is C.311,   sir.

Q.        THE CORONER:   You have marked a position where
     there was a barrier in front of you, fairly close to the
     dividing fence, and diagonally away from the gate. - A.
     It might have been a bit further across, you know, but l
     can't remember properly.

0. It is very very difficult.    So at that point you were in
   this crowd.   You couldn't move.    You could just about
   scream.   You were shouting, "Go back.     People around
   you were shouting, "Go back.1'? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened then?   At this time the match was already
   in place, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. You are sure? - A. Yes.

0. What happened then?   Can you remember? - A. There was a
   policeman on the fence trying to help because he knew
   what was going on and he was trying to bend tne spikes
   down.

Q. He was trying to bend the spikes? - A. Yes.

0. Did he succeed in that, as a matter of interest?       - A. I
   can't remember.

Q. Did you see the gate, by chance?    - A. Yes.

Q. What was happening at the gate? - A. People were trying
   to get out.

Q. Trying to...? - A. They were shouting to open the gates.
   I can t remember much after that.

Q. Did the pressure get even worse?    - A. Yes.

Q. Was it just a general increase or was there a surge?          - A.
   There was a surge.

Q. So there was a sudden increase in pressure?       - A. Yes.

0. When was that?   Can you remember?   Can you relate it to
   anything that happened on the field? - A. I think it was
   Peter Beardsley at the crossbar.

Q. So you say at that time - I think that is 15.04 - you
   felt quite a strong surge? - A. Yes.

0. In fact you are pretty accurate because you say about
   five minutss past three in your statement - between five
                                        G. RICHARDSON


past three and ten past three.      Did you think you might
fall over? - A. Oh, yes.

And you wanted to get out? - A. Oh, yes.

Like most sensible people would have done.   Did it ease
just a tiny bit in front of you so you were able to move
forward?   What happened?   How did you get out. - A. We
went back the way we came in.

You went backward.   Does it mean it cleared a little bit
behind? - A. It just eased.

Can you say how soon after Beardsley hit the crossbar?
A. Oh, it was a good few minutes   after that.

A good few minutes.   So you went     back up towards   the
tunnel, is that right? - A. Yes.

When you got there I think you were asked by an officer
to help carry somebody out, is that right? - A. Yes.

You had actually on your coach seen somebody called
Vincent Fitzsimmons? - A. Yes.

You didn't really know him, he was not a     friend? - A. Oh,
no.
You never saw him on the terracing as      such?   - A. No.

Did you   see people trying to help, or not?  Or did you
see people not trying to help, or do you not remember
anything about the gate? - A. I saw a lot of camera men
with their cameras, that's about it, taking tneir
pictures. . —

You saw people approaching towards it? - A. Yes.

You have shown yourself on that plan as being behind that
particular barrier.    In your statement you say - can
you see those dotted lines? - A. Yes.

That is   a barrier which broke.    - A. I would   probably be
behind that one instead.

That is what I want to find out because in your
statement, although you don't remember it b r e a k i n g y o u
seemed to think you were actually behind that barrier
•which broke.  Is that right? - A. Yes, because there was
a little surge forward and people went over.

Having identified that for you, do you want to change
your mind about where your cross is? - A. Yes.
                                         G. RICHARDSON


I want you to put where you think you were? - A. I think
I was behind that one.

Would you then go back to that plan?    Don t put a
circle, just put a cross.    Yes.   In fact it is the
same position but just a little bit further along.    I am
interested in this.   You didn t see it break, that s
right? - A. Oh, no.

You said there was a little surge...     - A. Forward.

Can you remember - again, was itassociated with anything
that was happening on the pitch? If you cannot
remember, don't guess. - A. When there was a surge - lert
it for a bit and then we went again.    Just a little -
like a stutter.

So there was a biggish surge, which you thought was
Beardsley hitting the crossbar and then there was a
little forward movement in front of you and you put two
and two together and you think that might be when it
collapsed? - A. Yes.

But you didn't see it? - A. Oh, no.

              Cross-Examined by MR. H A L E :

If I can just deal with the time that you arrived,       and it
wasn't too bad then? - A. No.

Then it just developed and people were becoming anxious
because kick-off time was coming and they wanted to get
in? - A. Yes.

If there had been a barrier across theroad   along which
you had approached, if there had been abarrier^ some
distance away, would you have been held up by tnat
barrier? - A. Yes.

Would there have been lots of other people held up by
that barrier too? - A. Yes.

     THE CORONER:    Can you speak up?

     MR. HALE:   As the time, for kick-off approached, do
you think that being held up a further distance away from
the ground would have pacified people and made them less
anxious about getting in? - A. I doubt it.

I'm sorry? - A. I doubt it.      I don't think so.

Because they would have had further to go and they would
have had to run then, wouldn't they, if they were going
                                                                     42

         the kick-off? - A. Yes.

    Q. Go on. - A. Well,     I can't really say.      I don't know.

    Q. We need to know if it is just two or three or ten or
       twenty or what? - A. About ten roughly.

         That sounds about the same number of times then...  - A.
         1 used to be able to go with my mum and my dad because
         they used to go and watch Liverpool and so I could get a
         lift with them.

         and used to go and watch with them.

         me.   Take your time.   I want to get a picture of how

   years to Everton? - A. I stopped in about...         I didn t
   go to a football match from about 1986 onwards.

Q. Up to 1986? -A. Yes.

Q. Nothing after 1986? - A. One or two.

Q. And about the same number of times supporting Liverpool,
   is that what you want to say? - A. I only went and

0. Who did you go and watch after 1986? - A. Just Liverpool.

Q. About how often? - A. Just once or twice.

0. Is that once or twice a year, or what? - A. Once or twice

Can you give an impression?   Is it one or two or what?
A. Quite a few.   Quite a few from what I can remember.

Arriving at about quarter to three? - A. Yes, with us.
Parking up behind u s .

How many seater was your coach? - A. Don't know.

There is a mini-seater coach and then there is an
ordinary coach which holds about 45 or 50 people. - A.
That will be it - 50.

You and your particular group ran down to the ground? -
A. Yes.
Can you help about what the other people on the coach
did? - A. No.

You ran down Halifax Road.   Do you know that that would
bring you to the...   We know because we have seen the
maps.   That brings you to a roundabout? - A. Yes, you go
down the street, go back up.    That's where they park.

When you got off the coach - did you get off in Halifax
Road? - A. Halifax Street or Road, or whatever it was.

Do you remember running down to a roundabout? - A. I
don't know.   I can't remember really.

Do you know you ran down Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

That is where you would go? - A. About half way down and
then we started walking.   We didn t run all the way.
Once we got into Leppings Lane we started walking once we
could see the ground.




             Q. Yes,   that's about half way
                                                                  45

Q. That is about half-way down Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.

Q. Now just, in your own words as you got into Leppings Lane
   while you were still running, describe the crowd that you
   were with? - A. Built up.

Q. What were they doing? - A. Waiting for the gates to open
   really.

Q. I don't want to get down to the ground yet, I want to just
   come into Leppings Lane when you were running towards the
   ground.  Do you see? Now the crowd was, you have said
   "loads of people"? - A. Quite a few.

Q. Lots of other witnesses have given evidence about what
   happened and I want you to give your story without me
   prompting you.  Do you understand? - A. Oh yes.

Q. So what was the crowd doing as they came into Leppings Lane?
   - a . Well you could not do nothing about it. The gates were
   shut so we were just shouting for them open.

Q. Very well.   By now it was what about? - A. 5, 10-to,       5-to.

Q. You have said "loads of people" which is a good description,
   others have said "hundreds".  You would agree with that
   would you? - A. Oh yes.

Q. Arriving about that time? - A. Yes.

Q. At the entrance to the ground there were some Police on
   horses? - A.  Yes.

Q. With the horses crossways to the advance of the crowd trying
   to slow the crowd down and filter the crowd through? - A.
   Well yes.

Q. And people were ducking under the horses,        right? - A. Yes.

Q. Because now it was nearly kick-off time and everybody wanted
   to get into the ground? - A. Yes.

         MR. PAYNE:     Thank you very much.


                      Cross-Examined by MR.' K I N G :

Q. Mr. Richardson, was it your impression -that the reason the
   crowd were getting so anxious was because it was so close
   to kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q. Do I take it from that if it had been not so near kick-off
   that your impression was that they would have been calmer?
   - A. Oh yes.
                                                                  46

        Q. So can I also take it from that that if for example the
           kick-off had been postponed for half-an-hour that, as far
           as you could judge, would have made a great deal of
           difference? - A. If they could have let everybody know
           they were going to do that, yes, it would.

        Q. You were asked before about the effect a barrier would
    B      have had if you had met some sort of Carrier when you
           were going down Leppings Lane before you reached the great
           mass of people and you said:  "It would have stopped me
           because it would have done? - A. It would have stopped me,
           yes.

        Q. The fact was that you and everybody else with you were
           joining a large mass of people who were already there? -
           A. Oh yes.

        Q. And there was nothing to stop you joining that great mass
           of people? - A. Oh no.

        Q. Your evidence was that the perimeter gates were shut and
           people were shouting for them to be opened.  Could you
           see what the scene was like on the other side of the
           perimeter gates? - A. I don't know.

        Q. Can I ask you now about when you had got through into the
           area before you went down the tunnel, so you are now
           through the big gate and you are in the wide area on the
           other side of the turnstiles.   You used the expression
           when the learned Coroner was asking you why you went down
           the tunnel you said:  "Because no other option" and that
           is how you viewed it? - A. Yes.

        Q. in fact you said to the learned Coroner the only other
           option was to go out of the ground and that is how the
           impression to you was once you were in that concourse
           area either you had to leave the ground or you went through
           the big tunnel? - A. Oh yes.

        Q. You used the phrase "No other option" a second time and
           I made a note of it.  It was at the time when you entered
           on to the terraces after you had come through the tunnel
           and you said:  "The terrace was packed.  I wanted to go
           back but I had no option but to go forward"? - A. Yes.

        Q. I want to, if I may, to pinpoint the time of when you
           were aware that people around you were shouting for
           people to get back and you said it was "terrible" around
           you, so you had reached this position 15' away from the
           fence and you said:   "round me there was no cheering"?
           - A. Oh no, screaming.

        Q. Do I take it from that, therefore, that the around you,
           some 15' from the perimeter fence, that people were in
           distress? - A. Oh yes.

    2. Did you have any difficulty realising that? - A. Oh no.
           ✓
    Q. Was this before Beardsley hit the cross bar? - A. Oh yes,
       yes .

B   Q. You have told us about a surge at that time when Beardsley
       hit the cross bar, but your evidence is, it is important,
       that before that time there was already distress around
       you on the terraces where you were? - A. Oh yes.

               MR. KING:   No further questions, thank you.


                      Cross-Examined by MISS S I N C L A I R :

    Q. You said you came out of the tunnel on to the terrace and
       you went straight forward? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did I hear that correctly? - A. Yes.

    Q. You moved down close to the fence that goes down the
       middle of the terrace? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you see the fence as you moved further? - A. Oh yes,
       yes.

    Q.   You knew it was there? - A. Yes.

    Q.   And then you ended up in the position that you have marked
         on the plan just behind .... A. Roughly about there.

    Q.   My note says that you said you did not see the barrier break?
         - A. Oh no.
    Q. Did you see the barrier at all? - A. No, I can't remember.

    Q. well how do you know you were just behind the barrier? - A.
       I didn't say I was.  I said there was a surge.

    Q. I see, so you worked out from what you found out later?
       - A. You see the gate opposite in front where people could
       go out.
    Q. So you worked out later where you had been from what you
       knew about what had happened? - A. Yes.

    Q. Then you said when Beardsley hit the cross bar there was
       a big surge? - A. Yes.

    Q. Which moved you forward? - A. Oh yes.

    Q. And the people around you? - A. Oh yes.

    Q. Then you said shortly afterwards there was a little surge?
       - A. Yes.

Q. "A little movement forward and people went all over"? - A.
   Well not all over. There was a few like you know you were
   forward.  You know if people had moved from in front of
   you you would have fell on floor.

Q. Did you fall over? - A. No.

Q. Did the people immediately in front of you fall over?
   - A. One or two.
Q. I am interested in the time that passed between the big
   surge and then the little movement forward? - A. I don t
   know.
Q. I know it is very difficult, you weren't looking at your
   watch. Would you say it was minutes or seconds? - A. I
   don't know, no idea.

Q. But you said it was a short time? - A. Oh yes.

         MISS SINCLAIR:   Thank you very much.


                 Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE:

Q. Mr. Richardson, I am going back outside.  Sorry to be jumping
   around like this. When you got up to the big gate that you
   eventually went through, the note I got of your evidence
   was there was a crush outside that gate? - A. Oh yes.

Q. Was there a lot of pressure behind you? - A. Not behind
   me, no.
Q. Can you explain exactly.  The crush outside the gate that
   you went through, can you just explain what you saw at
   that point? - A. A lot of people.

Q. All up against that gate? - A. Yes.

Q. And when that gate opened did that crowd just stroll in?
   - A. Went in quickly.

Q. You said in answer to the Coroner who was asking you
   questions about going down the tunnel, the crowd were
   all going in that direction? - A. Oh yes.

Q. And it was in that context you said you had "no option ?
   That is right.

Q. Is that right, it was the crowd who were all going that
   way.  It was not a case of stepping aside or either side
   and getting out of it you just got carried through? - A.
   That is right.

Q. That is your impression of what happened? - A. Yes.

       , MR. CATCHPOLE:   Thank you very much.


                  Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN;

2. Mr. Richardson, if the fans had been held back a short
   distance away from the main gates but had also been told
   that the kick-off had been delayed, do you think they would
   have been less anxious to push ahead? - A. Yes.

          MRS. McBRIEN:   Thank you.


                  Cross-Examined by MR. R U S S E L L ;

Q. You told us you got to the back of the crowd outside
   Leppings Lane perimeter gates at about 5-to-3? - A. Round
   about that, yes.
Q. At that time you are unable to recall or estimate how many
   people, you describe the size of the crowd as being
   "loads and loads" of people? - A. Yes.

Q. You have got an album of photographs there.  Could you
   please turn to C295 which I think is about the best we can
   do at the material time. Now although the time on that
   in the bottom right-hand corner is 14.55 or 5-to-3, we know
   that is in fact about 6-minutes-to-3. If you look very
   carefully in the middle distance you can see a line of
   fencing across the middle of the photograph.  Do you see
   that? - A. Yes.
Q. And behind that there appears to be a throng of people?
   - A. Yes.

Q. With the Police horses among the crowd? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that the sort of throng the back of which you joined
   when you reached the crowd at about 5-to-3? - A. Yes.

Q.   And would it be fair to say that like you the people in
     that crowd were keen to get into the ground in time for
     the kick-off if they could? - A. Oh yes.

Q. How were you able to make your way from the back of the
   crowd to the perimeter gates? — A. I just went straight
   through.

Q. You went straight through? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you have to push your way through at all? - A. Oh yes,
     you had to push your way through.

Q. And you were able to do that notwithstanding that everyone
   else was presumably as keen as you were to get to tne
   perimeter gates? - A. Yes.
                                  G. RICHARDSON



A difficult question this   and if you find it impossible
to answer please say so.    About how long did it take you
to push your way from the   back of the crowd through to
the perimeter gates? - A.   I don't know.

A minute or two do you think? - A. I have not got a clue.
I don't know.
The mood of the crowd that you described outside the
gates was one which was getting more and more angry.
- A. Oh yes.
You had not got through the perimeter gates, you were held
up by a further barrier inside the ground, as I understand
your evidence?   Inside the perimeter gates was a further
barrier which held you up? - A. I don t know, I don t
so. Once you got through the gates there was only the
gates shut after that what led you into the ground.

You went through the perimeter gates with the pressure
of the crowd behind you? - A. Oh yes.

And you said, the note I took of your evidence:   "Beyond
the perimeter gates there was a crush before the concertina
gates was opened"? ~ A. That is right.

That is right? - A. Yes.
What I am suggesting is there were two hold-ups to Y°ur
progress, first of all the perimeter gates and tnen the
crush before the concertina gate was opened? - A. That is
right, yes.
 We know the number of times that the concertina gate was
 opened from other evidence and from what you have told
 us you would have gone through the perimeter gates when
 it was opened just before 3 o'clock, about l-minute-to-3.
 Would that be right? - A. That must be right, yes.




                     Q. You describe your progress —     .
                                           G. RICHARDSON




You described your progress down through the tunnel as
the tunnel was full but you were able to make some
headway, but there was some pushing? - A. There was a
lot of pushing.

There was a lot of pushing.  Who was doing the pushing?
- A. I don't know. The people behind me.   I was doing
it, just the same as everybody else.

So you and everyone else were pushing your way down the
tunnel? - A. Yes.
Because you, as everyone else, were determined to miss
as little of the match as possible? - A. That's right,
yes.

On exiting from the tunnel you carried on down the
centre, as I think you described it, of the terracing
in front of the tunnel? - A. Me went a bit to the
right.

A bit to the right but broadly straight ahead? - A.
Then straight down.

Once again you were pushing and being pushed?

      THE CORONER:    I am a little bit concerned about
 this because I think it is correct to ask him whether
 others were pushing, but if you ask him, and in fact he
 gave the reply before I could give the warning, if you
 say, "Were you pushing?", that is a potentially
 incriminating question which he doesn't have to answer.
 I couldn't stop him because he gave a reply on your
 earlier one, but I think at this stage I ought to
 explain this to him.

      MR. RUSSELL:   Perhaps I can approach the question
 in a different way?

       THE CORONER:   Yes.   Can you see what I am driving
 at?
       MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, of course, I apologise:

 Once you got onto the terrace was there further pushing
 that led you down the terrace? - A. Oh yes.

 As I understand your evidence, you were pushing between
 people down the terrace?  I am sorry, you were     ^
 progressing between people? - A. Yes, and you weren t
 pushing you were just going forward once you got
 through the tunnel.

 You were moving between people? - A. Oh yes.

                                            G. RICHARDSON




Q. Rather than pushing people in front of you? - A. Oh
   yes.
Q. You described a surge that was generated when Beardsley
   hit the crossbar? - A. I assume that, yes.

Q. That is comsonplace, is it, for there to be a surge on
   crowded terraces when there is a moment of excitement,
   for the team whose supporters are on the terraces? - A.
   Yes, I suppose it is.

Q. You have told us it was about a minute after that, or a
   minute or two after that, that you were able to make
   your way back down the tunnel? - A. I don't know
   really, a minute or two.

Q. A minute or two? - A. I don't know really.   I have not
   a clue.

Q. I think the evidence you gave earlier was that the
   pressure eased a few minutes after Beardsley hit the
   crossbar? - A. No, I don't think so.  I think it went
   on for a bit longer than that.

        HR. KING:   My note was a good few minutes.

        THE CORONER:   Yes, that is what I thought
   actually, a good few minutes. I didn't take a note
   because I was cross-examining, but that was ray
   impression as well.  It is difficult because he wasn t
   very clear and you might have misheard him, but I think
   I would agree with Mr. King's note.

        MR. RUSSELL:   Well, there appear to be some
   discrepancies but it matters not for the purposes of my
   question:

Q. When the pressure eased or when the situation eased you
   were able to make your way back up towards the tunnel?
   - A. Yes.

Q. You told us that you were asked by a Policeman to help
   carry out a supporter? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember where you met that Policeman? - A*
   Either just inside the tunnel or just out, just where
   you are going out. Where you come in, it was round
   about there.

Q. So at the terrace end of the tunnel or the concourse
   end? - A. The terrace end.

Q. As far as you know where had the Policeman come from? -
   A. I don't know.
                                                            53

                                               G. RICHARDSON




Q. As far as you can see, would it have been possible for
   the Policeman to have come from the pitch side? - A. I
   doubt it.

Q. So do you think it likely that the Policeman had
   niraself come down the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you help carry out a supporter? - A. Yes.

Q. Thank you very much indeed.

        MR. KING:   Sir, might I just ask that C295 be
   clarified to this extent?

        THE CORONER:     Yes.

         MR. KING:   This witness gave evidence that when
   he casae to the perimeter gates the concertina gate was
   shut, that was his evidence.

        THE CORONER:     That is correct.

        HR. KING:   My learned friend very properly - I
   don't object - put that photograph to him as about the
   time when he entered the perimeter gates.   Sir, the
   point I wish to make is, and indeed in ay bundle it is
   clear, because I have a larger photograph, that that
   photograph was taken at a tisae when that concertina
   gate which is on the right was open.

        THE CORONER:   At 2.54 it would have to be open
   wouldn't it, because we know that from the video
   evidence, I think.

        MR. KING:      Yes, and sir if you look at C294 ....

        MR. RUSSELL:   I wonder if perhaps I didn't make
   myself understood, and I apologise if that's the case.
   The purpose of putting photograph C295 was to
   illustrate the time at which this witness would have
   reached the back of the crowd outside the perimeter
   gates.  He then told us that there was a period during
   which he made his way through -the crowd outside the
   perimeter gates, and the purpose of C295 was to show
   the throng outside the perimeter gates, not what was
   happening inside the perimeter gates.

        THE CORONER:      Yes, that is what I thought you
   meant.

        MR. RUSSELL:   We know from the timetable that
   although the gates were open at 5-minutes-to-3 they
   were then shut again, and this witness's evidence was
                                           G. RICHARDSOS




that he went through at the 14.59 opening, which we
know occurred.

     THE CORONER:    He agreed with you when you put
that to him.  I think that is far as one can go,
because you assumption, and it is reasonable on what he
said, was that his timings were absolutely accurate,
and this is always a difficulty.    We know the gates and
we know the openings, and we know that he said that he
went through when one was opened but if he is five
minutes wrong with the time that he arrived at the back
of the crowd, then it is possible that he went through
at 2.52.  It is very difficult because we are relying
on it as gospel that he says he got there - in fact, he
said he got there between 10-to and 5-to, and it could
have been 12-ininutes-to.   It is very, very difficult:

I take it you didn't look at your watch when you
arrived at the back of the crowd? - A. Ho.

     THE CORONER:    I can see what you are driving at,
Mr. Russell, but in the end one has to allow for
lapses, and the problem is that he also said that he
got onto the terrace and the match at that point was
not in progress, which is almost inconceivable if he
went through at 2.59, and if you take the rest of his
evidence as correct.   I didn't interrupt you because I
thought it was fair, what you were doing, but it
doesn't necessarily mean that you can draw an absolute
conclusion that that was the time he went through.    I
will let Mr. King go ahead, and then I will come back
to you.

     MR. KING:   Sir, all I am anxious to do is that we
have seen that photograph before and it is in some ways
a misleading photograph because we can't see the right-
hand side.  Sir, I wonder if C294 could be put up
because that was taken one minute before C295?

     THE CORONER:   I think Mr. Russell quite properly
explained that he wasn't using it to illustrate what
was happening after the concertina gate, he wanted to
illustrate what was happening in trie far distance.

      MR. KING:  Sir, I make no complaint about my
learned friend at all.  I am just anxious that the
evidence be cleared, of the photograph.  Sir, that is
C294 and one can see the concertina gate to the right
and people going through it, and if you look at my
bundle which is a better photograph of the same
photograph, one can see the concertina gate is actually
open.

                                              G. RICHARDSON




       HR. RUSSELL:   Sir, I have got a copy of the same
  photograph which equally shows the concertina gates
  drawn back.

       MR. KING:   It is unfortunate that the ones we are
  showing on the screen don't, in fact ....

       THE CORONER:   You can actually see it. What has
  happened is that the framing, I think, has taken off
  that little ....

       MR. KING:      Yes, it is quite important, sir.

       THE CORONER:   We will see whether we can improve
  the framing of that because I agree with you, yes, it
  is clearly open.

       MR. KING:   C295 is merely a minute later and we
  know that that gate was open for five minutes, until
  14.57.

       THE CORONER:      Yes.

                   Further by THE CORONER

Q. Mr. Richardson, when you said you got to the back of
   the crowd or throng - it doesn't matter what word - I
   think - what time did you say you got there? - A. What,
   to the ground itself?

Q. Yes, before you got through the outer perimeter gates?
   - A. About 10-to, quarter-to, 10-to.

Q. You have now moved it back another five minutes.  You
   see the problem is that these gates opened at various
   times and what Mr. Russell was trying to find out was
   which of the openings you went through.  If you were
   outside at 5-to-3 then it is impossible for you to have
   gone through until 15.59.  If you were there at
   quarter-to-3 you might have gone through at 14.52? - A.
   Yes.

Q. How certain are you about your timings of arrival
   outside the perimeter gates? - A. I don't really.  It
   is what time we got off the coach, and I think we got
   off the coach about 20-to, quarter-to, then we ran
   down.

Q. So you worked backwards from that? - A. Yes.

        THE CORONER:     Mr. Russell, do you want to have
   another ...?

                                                 G. RICHARDSON




          HR. RUSSELL:   Sir, I don't really think it is
     necessary.  His evidence to you initially was that he
     arrived in Halifax Road at a quarter-to-3 and as I
     understand it he has then built on that time to produce
     the times which he has given to you and the Jury.   I
     don't think he could be any more precise tnan to state
     as the fact that he was in Halifax Road at a quarter-
     to-3, and we know how far Halifax Road is.

          THE CORONER:   Yes, I was just wanting to give you
     an opportunity because^I didn't want you to think that
     I was undermining you, if that is the right word.

          MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, I have no further questions of
     the witness.

          MR. KING:   Sir, I am reminded that the witness
     gave evidence that he saw Ian Rush, the Liverpool
     football player, with his tracksuit on running round on
     the pitch, so that may help us if that was his evidence
     - and I understand it was - as to the timings, because
     that, of course, would be before kick off.

Q.        THE CORONER:   And I think you also said that as
     you were working your way down the terrace you heard a
     whistle? - A. Yes.

Q. Which you took to be the kick off? - A. Yes.

          MR. KING:   It looks as if he arrived on the
     terraces before kick off, sir?

          THE CORONER:   It sounds like that to me anyway:

Q. I just want to ask you one other question, and then we
   have finished.  When you got - back outside now, you
   are coming up and you have hit this crowd - did you
   hear any Police or other announcements whatsoever? - A.
   No.

Q. You heard no loudspeaker announcements at all? - A. Wo.

Q. Did you see a Police landrover outside? - A. No.

Q. Did you see loudspeakers sticking up in the air above
   the crowd? - A. No, I can't remember.

Q.    You can't remember.  Okay, that is all.    Thank you very
     much indeed.  One other tiling, was there   a lot of noise
     outside there? - A. Before I went in?

Q.    In this area which we looked at? - A. Oh, yes.

             ROGER GRAHAM HEWSTONE Sworn

                   Bv THE C O R O N E R :

You are Roger Graham Hewstone? - A. That is correct.

What is your address please? - A.                |,
       L L an c as h ir e .
You are a Probation Officer? - A. I am in fact,       sir,
yes.

You are a Liverpool supporter? - A. Along with my
son.

And have been for some years? - A. A few years.

You decided to come to the match on the 15th April
1989, is that right? - A. We did.

With your son? - A. Yes.

You came by coach on that occasion from Manchester,
is that right? - A. Yes, that was our usual
arrangement.

What time did you actually set off, can you remember
by chance? - A. I think it was 11.45.

For some reason the coach took a route which you
personally would not have chosen? - A. It was
different to the route we had taken the previous year
for the same fixture.  This was the long route
through Glossop and Stockport.

Were you in fact subject to delays and hold-ups? - A.
There was considerable delay as the M56 entered
Stockport.   Traffic was stationary for three-quarters
of an hour at least. We were much delayed in the
process.   We had thought we would miss the start of
the match at that point.

In fact people on the coach were a little bit annoyed
about that, not surprisingly? - A. Yes, we thought
the hold-ups there could not have been any worse than
what we would have encountered on the Pennine
motorway.

Eventually you were approaching Sheffield,    is that
right? - A. Yes.

                                            R. G. HEWSTONE




Q. Were you at ten past stopped by the Police? - A. Yes,
   that was the customary checkpoint just off the
   motorway.

Q. Your coach was stopped? - A. We were stopped, yes.

Q. Just very briefly what happened? Did they come on
   board, so to speak? - A. I think very briefly and
   just went up and down the coach, looked around, and
   off again.  There was no undue delay.

Q. They were satisfied? - A. Yes.

Q. You then proceeded on towards the ground? - A. Yes,
   the road was fairly clearly by that point.

Q. Although you had a terrible journey up to Sheffield,
   once you got here it was not too bad? - A. Yes.

Q. In fact the driver tried to drop passengers off near
   the ground but he was not allowed? ~ A. There were
   lines of Policemen along the main road whatever it is
   along the end of Leppings Lane there preventing
   coaches from disembarking.  We twice tried to stop
   but were not allowed to do so and had to proceed up
   the hill towards the line of other parked coaches.

Q. In fact that is what you did and the coach then
   parked at about what time? - A. I would say about
   2.30. Within a five minute period, 2.30 to 2.35.

Q. When you parked, I am sure you did not count them,
   but how many coaches were there at that point that
   you can recollect? - A. It is difficult to say, sir.
   There were quite a line of them in front and
   obviously there were one or two coming behind us as
   well.  It is difficult to say, 15 or 20 perhaps but I
   wasn't looking.  There always are a substantial
   number of coaches for a fixture like that.

Q. By the time you got there, there were already a
   substantial number of coaches? - A. Yes, quite a few
   coaches.

Q. You had to go at the back, so to speak? - A. Yes,
   that is right.

Q. So you had a longer walk? - A. Yes, longer than would
   have been the case if we had been dropped off, yes.
                                                         60




                                             R. G. HEWSTONE




Q. Were you parked nearer the ground?  I   do not know
   quite what method they used? - A. No,   it was going
   away from the ground up the hill-  It   would have been
   perhaps three quarters of a mile from   the actual
   turnstile area.

Q. You and your son decided to get to the ground as fast
   as you reasonably could? - A. Yes, reasonably so. We
   both decided to basically jog. We both run a little
   bit and so it was quite easy for us to jog loosely
   down towards the ground.

Q. Were you accompanied by others who were doing the
   same? - A. There was nobody else running.  We were
   the only people I think doing that. We were just
   dodging carefully in and out of people.

Q. Were there quite a lot of people going down towards
   the ground at that point? - A. Yes, there was a
   steady stream of people.

Q. You had not noticed where they came from? You do not
   know whether they were emptying out of coaches or
   coming from somewhere else? - A. No, everybody was
   just walking along as a long file of people all the
   way down Leppings Lane.

Q. Did they appear to you to be happy and content? - A.
   It seemed to us at that point a perfectly normal
   crowd approaching the turnstile area.  There was
   nothing remarkable at all about the nature or content
   of the crowd at all.

Q. Had the people who had been anxious on the coach
   because they thought they were going to miss the
   kick-off, when they arrived at 2.30 to 2.35, had
   their altered? Did they think they now had a chance
   to get in or not? Do you know? - A. Yes, I think
   people realised they were going to get into the
   ground having got there at that time.

Q. So they felt slightly relieved because you thought
   they might be even later? - A. Yes, we had thought it
   would have been three o'clock or later.

Q. As you went down jogging and I will use the word
   weaving? - A. Yes, that would describe it I think.
                                                 R. G .   HEWSTONE



Q.   I think you were approached by various people for
     tickets, is that right? - A. Various teenagers were
     coming up to us and asking us for spare tickets.

Q.   You did not have any, of course? - A. No.

Q.   That issomething that happens at big matches? - A.
     It happens at most Liverpool matches, sir, but
     certainly at a fixture of that nature there is always
     a demand for tickets.

Q. How many asked you? - A. I would say at least half a
   dozen.

Q. It took you how long from parking about three
   quarters of a mile you say, jogging along, to the
   ground? - A. Approximately five, six, seven minutes.
   Something of that order, sir.

Q. So you would put your arrival time, depending on what
   time you got into Sheffield, between 2.35 and 2.40,
   something of that order? - A. Yes, it would be within
   a few minutes of that time.

Q. Your son had a stand ticket? - A. He did.

Q. So you split? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it a North Stand ticket? Do you remember by any
   chance which stand it was? - A. It was the upper
   stand.

Q. Pardon? - A. It was the upper stand.

Q. In which turnstile was he supposed to go through? -
   A. As you were looking it from the road it would be
   on your left or central to left.

Q. Did that part of the turnstile area look clear? - A.
   It wasn't clear, sir.  There was a fair number of
   people there but you could see that they were moving
   through the turnstile area without undue difficulty
   in contrast to the other side.




                                /Q.   Tell me about.
                                     R. G. HEWSTONE



Tell me about that, what was the position with_regard to
the other side?   That is the one you were aiming for.
A. Yes, that is the one I had to go through, having the
terrace ticket.
Yours had a 8 on it, is that right? - A. I can't remember
exactly.
How did you know you had to go through those turnstiles?
- A. I think through having looked at the tickets.
Obviously it said which turnstile you had to go through.

Would you put up C.258.   That is a<picture of what I
think are the turnstiles you were aiming for.  would you
agree with that?   Is that right? - A. Yes, that would be
right.
Your son was going to the ones which are on the left of
the picture, sort of fallen off? - A. Yes.

Tell me what you saw when you were approaching that
turnstile? - A. There was a large stationery wedge^ of
fans right up to the front railings there, along tne side
wall, there is a river on the right along there, up to
the bridge and the pavement.
Beyond the perimeter gates.   Can you see those perimeter
gates?   Are you saying they had spilled out into the
area in front of that perimeter gate or were they just
contained within the perimeter gate? - A. No, tney w ^re
contained in the front section as far as I can remember.

What I would call the far section, is that right?    Point
to the enclosure.   That area there you are^talking
about, within the perimeter gate, is that right. - A. 1
am not sure to be honest, sir.    I had thought that
people were being controlled into the second section tnat
was leading into the turnstile area.

That may well be so... - A. The crowd would be this side
of the gate.
That is what I am trying to find out.    It was this side
of the gate? - A. Yes.
You say really it was in the form of a wedge? - A. Yes,
really the side being the length of th^ railing there,
the side of the railing and up and to the pavement area.
I initially stood on the pavement where there were two
police horses.
Tell me, at that point - we'll assume it's 2.40 just for
argument's sake, I am not pinning you to that as absolute
                                           R .   G. HEWSTONE


oospel - h°w raany police horses d i d y o u see at that time?
- A. There were certainly two immediately next to me,
iust on or just off the pavement, by the gutter, and a
few fans were moving in and around the police horses, not
quite knowing where they should stand. ^ The police
horses clearly weren't being effective in any way.         They
seemed to be at a loss to know what to do with the
situation.
The officers you mean? - A. I think so, yes.            They were
just stood at the periphery of the crowd.

In other words, this side of it? - A. Yes.

Off the picture this way? - A. Yes.    I mean, that shot
must have been taken either from the r o a d or from the
position that I was later watching from the bank.

Put 256 up.   That is the same sort of shot, not exactly,
of course, but giving rather more foreground.   Can you
see those cones? - A. Yes, I can see the cones.

Is that any better or doesn't that make any difference as
far as... - A. Oh, yes, there were fans on that side too,
probably up to where the cone markings are.

The fans on this side were a lot further out than on that
picture? - A. I am sorry, could you say that again, sir.

Were the fans which were outside the turnstiles which you
were trying to get in, further out than the cones at this
end of that picture? - A. Yes, they were up to the edge
of the pavement on the right hand side.

Now I will show you 255.   This is an overhead view and
does take in rather more.   I think we will now be able
to locate it more accurately. ^ Can you make it out.
Can you orientate yourself on it? - A. Yes.

On this picture there are some vehicles, of course, on
the road, can you see them? - A. Yes.

Then you can see the bridge? - A. Yes.

Now up to where would you say the fans were which you
were talking about? * A. There looks like a mini- us
there.   Up to the edge of that I would think.

•At what position were you?        Were you just at the front
 of that mini-bus, is that where you are saying, on the
 pavement there? - A. Y e s i n i t i a l l y , because tne crowd
 was stationary at that point.

                                        R. G. HEWSTONE


0. It was at that position that the two police horses were
   near to you? - A. Yes.   There was another police horse
   further across as I recollect, but those were the two
   that were immediately next to me.

0. Looking in, so to speak, you could see that these
   were going right up to the turnstile area, would tnat be
   right, or could you not see that far? _ A. Initially I
   couldn't until, as I say, a little later after being in
   the roadway I climbed up to a bank on the other side or
   the road and was then able to see the turnstile area.

0. Why did you do that?    Why did you decide to move on to
   that banking? - A. I think possibly by chance, sir.   I
   had stood on the pavement for maybe five minutes just
   observing the situation to see if it would resolve
   itself.    It clearly showed no signs of doing so.   I was
   not prepared to put myself in the middle of the crowd
   without having any idea of what was going to happen to
   it, where it was going.    I couldn't see what was
   happening to it, so I saw no point in inconv3niencing
   myself basically.    I just naturally stepped back into
   the middle of the road where there was just a small
   handful of people really, probably similar to myself just
   not quite knowing what to do for the best.    I just
   happened to turn round and saw there was a banking to the
   right of the bridge.   As the bridge is there, the banking
   is to the right hand side of it and tnere is a little row
   of houses.   We were at the edge of this house on some
   banking.
Q. So you retreated backward a little bit and up the
   banking? - A. Yes, and realised I would have an overview
   there.
0. Then you could assess it better. - A. There was just
   sufficient room for me and a couple of...   1^ think
   joined a woman and two of her young sons up tnere.
   There was also an older gentleman who told me h e w a s a
   shareholder from Liverpool and the three of us simply
   watched the situation in front of us then for about ten
   to fifteen minutes.

Q. That would be about five minutes after you joined this
   wedge of people? ~ A. From 2.40 to 2.45, up until about
   2.55.
Q. You said you weren't willing to put yourself into the
   crowd, so to speak.  Was that because the crowd was
   moving or... ~ A. It wasn't moving at all, sir.

Q. Was there pressure in it or not, as far as you could sae?
   If you didn't see it don't say so. _ A. I could not tell
   there was pressure in the crowd.   I have to say that my

            own reaction was governed, certainly to some extent, by
            an experience earlier at Wembley a few years previously
            when there had been an enormous press outside the ground
            at a similar late time.   I had been in tnat and had been
      B     quite frightened by that.   Although that size of crowd
            was much bigger than the one I saw at Hillsborough, it
            was still something that affected my thinking.

          Q. Which year was that? - A. That was tne Merseyside cup
             final, 1986.
          0. 1986?   Was that a final or semi-final? - A. It was a
             final at Wembley.
          0. You say there was a very big crowd there late, even
             bigger than this crowd? - A. Oh, yes, it was
             substantially bigger.   It was hot^and tnere was also a
             considerable wedge of people.  Again it was that wedge
             formation.   There were police horses stuck in that, to
             whom the crowd were appealing for help and the horses
             weren't able to move or to do anything to assist,
             was quite a frightening situation.
      D
          0. Come back to this year.   You climbed up this little
             banking and you stood there? - A. You could walk up it.

          0. Then you observed.    Tell me what you saw andnoticed.
             Just take me through.    You were there for ten or fifteen
             minutes and as well as you can just take me through. - •
             I basically saw no great movement of people beyond that
             which was already established when I had arrived,
             although there was an increasing build-up of those who
             were obviously coming down Leppings Lane and finding a
             similar situation, so the crowd was steadily backing up.^
             I think the first thing I then noticed was the arrival o L
             the police Land Rover and the use by the officer - I
             believe it was a Superintendent, I guessed it was an
             Inspector at the time - and his use of the loud hailer.

          Q. Can you remember some of the text, some of the things
             which were said? - A. One thing I know was s^id is that
             he called very frantically for the mounted Inspector.
             He twice called for that in a very urgent voice, but
             there seemed to be no reaction to tnat.

          0. Did you hear him say anything addressing the crowd at
             all? - A. Yes, he specifically said to the crowd - on
             some occasions he said to the crowd to .ease bac< and that
             had no apparent effect.   He then said to tae crowd that
             an attempt was being made to delay the kick-off.    I
             think he may have said until 3.15, or by a quarter of an
             hour, something to that effect.

         0.   You are pretty sure you heard him say that? - A. I am
              fairly sure I did, yes, or at least about delaying the
              kick-of f.
     B   Q. What you are sure about is that he said something about
            delaying the kick-off, what you aren t quite so sure of
            is whether he mentioned a time, is that right? - A. Yes,
            I can't be sure about that.

         0. You.are certain he said something about delaying the
            kick-off? -    Yes, there was some reference to that.

         0. You also said something about easing back? - A. Yes.

         0. I mean, you can't remember the exact words, and I don t
            blame you, it is eighteen or nineteen months since. - A.
            Just before I went up on the bank he was also - I think
            it was him - trying to give orders to the mounted
            policeman to get people in lines.   There were references
            to lines, "Get them into lines."

         Q. Had he arrived before you got on to the banking or after
     D      you got on to the banking? - A. At about the time I went
            up, as I recall.    I think the Land Rover came along as I
            moved up into that position.

         Q. Where was the Land Rover in relation to this wedge of
            people? - A. Referring to the earlier picture where the
            cones were, it was in a position perhaps in the middle of
            those cones, coming at an angle from Leppings Lane.

         0. Which one was the one with the cones - 256.   Just put...
            - A. Possibly about the third or fourth cone down from
            the house, pointing towards the terrace turnstile area.




                            0. How many yards would you say.




     H
                                   R.G. HEWSTONE



How many yards would you say you were from him when you
were in your slightly elevated position? - A. The width
of the road and then with the angle may be another ten
metres, 20-25 metres perhaps.

He was much closer than that to the crowd. Would that be
fair? - A. Oh yes, he was right up to the edge Oi the crowd.

Would I be right in saying that it had no obvious effect?
- A . No.
Then what happened after that? - A. I think the next thing
I remember seeing was that Officer gesticulating with his
hands, it was that action, towards the terrace gates.

When you say the "terrace gates" you mean those railing
gates or ___    A. I can't remember if it was towards the
railing gates or the larger blue gates but it was definite y
towards that direction.  I actually saw him making those
movements.
Before he made those movements, perhaps I should have asked
you earlier, can you recollect whether those blue railing
gates were open or shut? We call them perimeter gates but
it is neither here nor there what we call them. - A. I thin*
they must have been shut sir but it is a bit difficult now
to distinguish the gates at this point in time.

 So you think they were shut-but you are not entirely sure
 any more.  That would be right? - A. Yes.

 The reason   why I repeat it to you like that is because I
 don't want   you to overstate what you can remember and
 neither do   I want you to understate it.   I want to try to
 be fair to   you? - A. Yes.
 Having made this gesture which you describe as I think
 taking his hands together and separating them.  Is that
 right? - A. Like a scissor action.

 What happened after that? - A. Well the gates opened and
 the crowd poured in.

 Now which gates are we talking about this time? - A. That
 is difficult for me to say now sir because once the gates
 had been opened the crowd were immediately through them.

 Just look at this picture, we will just use this one as an
 example.  You can see the perimeter gates> go to the corner
 that is it those perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

. Now beyond the perimeter gates in the distance is what is
  in fact a gate, we call Gate A, it does not matter. - A.
  Blue doors.
                                           R.G. HEWSTONE



    Q. Now when you say the gates were open, was that one of the
       gates which was opened? - A. The blue door was, yes,
       on the right-hand side initially.

    Q. The     right-hand side was opened first? -    A.    Yes.
B
    Q. Let's have our standard one up, 258, we   will show itto you
       or at least we will show you a bit of it. You have already
       seen this picture.  You can see the van can you? - A. Yes.

    Q. And beyond it there is a big blue concertina gate.          Is that
       the  one you are talking about? — A. Yes.

    Q. Yousaw that open following that signal       so to speak?   - A.
       Yes.

    Q. What did you notice then? - A. Well the crowd had already
       gone obviously through the first set of gates, were going
       through the second set and I do remember seeing people who were
       still at that point queueing at the turnstiles and some
       Officers were tapping them on the shoulder and pointing to
       the open gates.
D   Q. They were actually being directed? — A. In effect, yes.

    Q. Did you either at this time or immediately before this see
       any other, you have mentioned the two horsemen near to you
       who did not seem to be having much success and you have
       mentioned there were one or two others perhaps further in,
       can you remember what they were doing the others, not the
       ones near you? — A. No, I can't  say that I can sir.

    Q.     Let us go  back to   the crowd who are      going through that
          right-hand gate? - A. Yes.

    Q. 4)id you notice whether any other of these big blue gates
       opened? - A. Yes, there was the set on the left-hand side.

    Q.     Is that the one I just showed you a moment ago? - A. I
          think it must be sir unless there was a third set of gates.

    Q. Actually on this one before you move, this is 258 still
       is it?

                MR. JONES:   Yes.
    q   .THE CORONER:         Can you show where Gate B is. Can you
          see   that? Do you remember seeing that gate at all? You
          may not have done, it is not so easy to see that gate?
          - A. No, I don't remember that sir.

     Q.   Put up the other one then.   It is 256. Can you see that
          gate in the distance there? - A. Yes, that was tne other
          gate.

That was the other gate that you saw open? - A. Shortly
after.
So what you are saying is the right-hand one, whicn we
call Gate C, was opened first? - A. Yes.

Then shortly after you saw that one open which we call
Gate A.  Don't worry about .... A. It is that gate.

It makes it easier for us to understand which gates you
are speaking about. - A. Yes.

Did these gates - let's concentrate on Gate A for a moment
- did it stay open for any length of time that you remember?.
- A. No, possibly a minute or two sir.

Could you see beyond it once it was open? - A. Yes, I could
see further in.
What could you see when you were looking in there? - A.
Really not too many people as I recall on that side, on
Gate A side.  I could see Police Officers at the gate as
people were going through it and they were leaning down
to some extent I suspect looking at tickets trying to check
tickets.
But you could not see what they were doing? - A. Oh no.

But you did see there were Police Officers on the far side
of the gate who appeared to be doing something? - A. No,
I could just see the ones at the gate ....

   the gate, I beg your pardon. — A ....... who were as it
seemed to me looking at people's tickets fairly cursorily
as they were going through.

How crowded was that turnstile area at the point in time
when that gate was opened as far as you remember.  Your
son had already of course disappeared quite some time
prior? - A. Oh yes some time, yes.

Because it is a good quarter-of-an-hour really isn't it,
well perhaps ten minutes? - A. Yes.

 How crowded at that point was that turnstile area? — A.
 By Gate A I don't recall it as being so crowded obviously
 as the comparable situation to the right.  Though there
 were some people outside I would not really like to put
 a figure on it.
 You didn't see the gate being shaken or anything like that?
 - A. No, simply opened and then closed I think sir.

 Let's go then to Gate C which is the one where there were
 more people.  Do you recollect having observed it being
 opened. Was it opened fully at the point when you saw
 it being opened or only partially? - A. I would think it
 was probably halfway sir.
                                 R.G. HEWSTONE



Can you recollect for how long it stayed open on that
occasion? - A. My recollection is a minute, may be
slightly longer.
Do you remember how it was shut, what mechanism was used
to shut it? - A. No, I don't remember that sir because
I was considering coming down the bank once I had seen
that people had gone into the ground.

And in your statement you thought it was between 2.45
and 2.50 when you saw that.  Would that be about right?
- A. Yes sir.
So the gate was shut again, right, this concertina gate,
the right one was shut.  You were still on your observation
position at that point? - A. I don't know if it was shut
while I was still up there to be honest sir.

I see.  You tell me what happened.  You saw it opened,
you saw it shut but what happened in between? ~ A. There
was what I would describe as a phalanx of people moving
through the gates fairly speedily, almost rushing, and
at the time I quickly estimated that it must have been at least
a dozen in width and at the time I though several hundred,
possibly even more still had entered at that point in time.
That was my initial impression.

What did you then do? - A. As that effectively emptied the
outside of the ground there I then simply walked down off
the bank and into the turnstile area which was by now all
but deserted and I recall there was three or four uniformed
Officers who were marching some teenage fans away from the
turnstile area obviously out of the ground, clearly had
not got tickets, that is what I took to have happened there.

Had you got into the ground by then or were you still on
the outside? - A. No, I was coming to the turnstile area
and at that point a Policeman approached me and actually
said to me:  "You can't get in here without a ticket" and
then obviously I produced my terrace ticket and he allowed
me through the turnstile.

Can you time that at all.  Do you know what time that
might have been? ~ A. Well at that point I seem to recall
that I heard the roar of the start of the match so it must
have been just coming to 3 o'clock.

 Did you then in fact go in through a turnstile? - A. Yes,
 I did sir.

 You did not look back to see whether the concertina gate
 was open? - A. No, I didn't.

 So you don't know whether it was open? - A. I don't know.
                                  R.G.   HEWSTONE


But your recollection is at that point when you entered
it was fairly clear? - A. Oh yes it was almost deserted.
In fact just before I went in I wanted to use the toilet
there.  In fact I relieved myself against a side wall just
outside the toilet partly because there was virtually
nobody around but more particularly there was a lot of
urine, almost a small lake outside the toilet and one
would have had to have walked through that to get into
the toilet.
I see, so it was the lesser of two evils as far as you
were concerned? — A. It was, and I then proceeded into
the tunnel myself.
Did you know the ground? You had been there before,
had n’t you? - A. I had been there before but not on to
the terrace section sir.

Did you come through Leppings Lane the year before? - A.
Yes, we had.
1 forgot to ask you, perhaps I should h a v e done, what
time did you enter in 1988? - A. Oh, well it was
certainly by 2 o'clock.  We were in the ground by
2 o'clock.
In 1988 you were in one of the stands? - A. We were both
in the stand.
So having gone to the toilet you went down tne tunnel?
- A. Yes.
Did you see any signs directing you where to go? - A. No,
I don't recall any signs and I was not aware until later
that there were actually side entrances, that the terrace
was split into three sections basically.  I was not aware
of that factor.
So did you choose the tunnel because it looked an inviting
opening into the ground? — A. Yes, just that sir.

It wasn't that you were looking around and said:  "Oh
there's a sign I had better go that way" because that
was the only thing you could see which seemed to lead ...
A. At that point sir.
 And you went down the tunnel which was crowded, uncrowded,
 what was it? - A. The tunnel itself was actually completely
 empty at the point of kick-off because I .came up to the
 rear of the crowd that were by the tunnel exit and it
 was packed, stationary and initially I could see no way
 of forcing a way into that and I suppose a certain amount
 of natural apprehension against trying to do that influenced
 my decision to stay where I was. I was there for about five
 minutes.  I remember being able to watch some of the play
                                   R.G. HEWSTONE



by taking advantage of the slope on the tunnel floor so
I could step back a few metres and in the gap between
the ceiling of the tunnel and people's heads I could
see some of the pitch and I remember watching the play
in that period.   In that time there were some fans who
came into the tunnel,    no more than half-a-dozen at most,
who did manage to push their way into the crowd. What
concerned rae more, however, was two or three adults
at least my age who extricated themselves from the back
of the crowd and were recovering themselves next to me
in the tunnel.   Two of them were breathing with quite
some difficulty, one of them was sweating very heavily
and one made a remark about it being worse than Hysel
down there.   I had no idea of course what was happening
down there but simply their state and their remarks
just made me think I    was glad I wasnot down there.   That
is what I thought at    the time.




                   Q. I assume that the

                                                8. G. HEWSTONE




    Q. I assume that the other people near you, who were in
       face ahead of you, could they see these gentlemen as
       well, as you could, or not, because they had to come
B      through them didn't they? Were these people who were
       sweating and .... - A. They had come out of the crowd,
       through the back of the crowd into the tunnel.

    Q. Yes, but are you saying - as I understood you, you said
       you had come to the end of the tunnel? - A. Yes.

    Q. The terrace appeared to be packed with a mass of
       people? - A. Yes.

    Q. That you weren't happy to force your way through? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. But did these three chaps who had come out, had they
       come through this mass the other way or were they right
       at the back of that crowd, because it sounds to me as
       if they must have come frora the terrace? - A. Yes, I
       think they had worked their way from whatever position
D      they had been in on the terrace, backwards and out into
       the tunnel.

    Q. So the people whom they passed in that group must have
       seen them as you did? - A. Yes, they must have seen
       them as they were going past.

    Q. That is all I am asking, yes. When this chap made that
       remark, "It is worse than Heysel" or something like
       that, can you recollect what if anything was happening
       on the pitch? - A. On the pitch itself I can actually
       remember seeing the ball hit the bar at the otner end.

    Q. Was this at that point in time or was it after or
       before? - A. No, it was during those first five
       minutes, because I actually retreated from the tunnel
       before the game was stopped, so   it must have been in
       that first five minutes.

    Q. But you remember the ball hitting the bar? - A. Yes, I
       could see that at the other end of the pitch.

    Q. I think you have said, but I had better just make sure
       that I have remembered it correctly, that when you
       joined this group of people at the end of the tunnel,
       and you were looking, the game was in progress when you
       first got down into the tunnel,   is that right? - A.
       Yes.   I never really joined them right up at the back
       because I couldn't see over, so I had to retreat a few
       yards.

                                            R.   G.   HEHSTONE




Q. Yes, and as far as you are concerned the tunnel,
   throughout this time, for practical purposes remained
   empty? - A. Absolutely.

Q. There were a few people coming down but •••• - A. There
   was one steward who came by.

Q. Did he? - A. He had a yellow top on with steward     on the
   back, or whatever.

Q. What did he do? - A. I don't remember what happened to
   him.  He came past me, he was a squat gentleman, he
   came past me and went to the back of the crowd.   I
   can't recall if he actually went in or whether he then
   went away again, but I do remember him passing me
   because I saw the letters on his back.

Q. Yes, but you have no recollection of further progress?
   - A. No.

Q. You then decided that discretion was the better part of
   valour again and went back out of the tunnel, is that
   right? - A. Yes, I did.

Q. And what did you do then, just as a matter of interest?
   - A. I turned left.

Q. Coming out of the tunnel you turned left? - A. As I was
   coming out of the tunnel, sir, and saw, I think it was
   a hot dog stand or something equivalent, on the left,
   and simply followed my nose round there and then
   realised that one could actually get onto the terraced
   area from the corner flag section, which I hadn't
   previously appreciated.

Q. Did you actually go onto the terracing then? - A. Not
   into it, I stood where best I could, which was right on
   the perimeter where everybody else was.

0. Had the match finished by then? - A. It was just
   finishing as I recall.

Q. The players were going off, you are saying? - A. The
   play had stopped.  As I came to that corner ttie play
   had stopped.

0. The people at the back - I am going back into the
   tunnel now again, because that is in a sense the
   relevant bit, those people who were standing tnere and
   who presumably were looking in the same direction as
   you, did they appear to you to be concerned?  I know
   you couldn't see anybody down further, so I am not
   asking you about those, I am just asking you about the
   people whom you could see? ~ A. Although I was only
                                                            75


                                               S. G. HEWSTONE




     looking at, obviously, their rear, I couldn't detect
     any concern on anyone s part.  Certainly nobody was
     turning around towards each other.  There was no
     communication between the people who were at the back
     and I suppose it is ten or twelve people in the actual
     line that there is at the end of the tunnel.  They were
     just all stationary, looking ahead.

Q. Could you hear any sound at all coming from the
   enclosures immediately in front of you? - A. No,     I
   could hear no sound.

Q. You couldn't hear any cheering or screaming or
   shouting, or what? - A. Only what I would describe as a
   general crowd noise.  Nothing out of the ordinary, I
   would say.

Q. You then stayed in this position which you have
   described at the corner there.  It is really just below
   the Police Control Box? - A. Yes, it was.  I know that
   Box, yes.

Q. For a while and then you went and looked for your son,
   I think? - A. Yes, when it became apparent that the
   match was going to be abandoned I would have been
   amongst the early ones to move away, off the ground,
   and I stood along Leppings Lane perhaps 50 yards, 100
   yards from the turnstile area to look for my son, to
   stay there.

Q.   Yes, and he found you and was  very happy to see you, I
     am sure? - A. Oh yes, he was.   He had no idea,
     obviously, what had happened to me and I think he had
     stayed in the stand until basically it had more or less
     emptied and then simply followed his own way out after
     that, so I saw most of the people filing past me who
     had obviously been in the ground.

Q.   I just want to go back to the beginning really, and
     there were two horses near you, I think you said? - A.
     Yes, there were certainly two horses.

Q.   And tnen there were some more further in.  Can    you
     remember about how many there   might have been? - A. I
     would only say one other to my recollection.     It could
     have been two others.

Q. We have got a plan and we get people to put a cross on
   where they were.  I think what I would like you to do,
   as far as you are able, is to put a cross where you
   were when you were within the tunnel.

           THE COROWER:   Mr. King, what is the nuuber of the
      acetate where the gate is open?
                                               R. G. HEWSTONE




        MR. KING:      C294, sir, and C295.

        THE CORONER:      C294 is the one where the gate is
open.

Let me see where you have put your cross.     (The witness
marked Exhibit C 3 1 2 ) C294 is a pnotograph that - can
you see on the right-hand side, the concertina gate? -
A. Yes.

And you can see a horse there, can't you? - A. Yes.

In fact, that gate is open - we have just chopped a
little bit off with the framing, but there is a gap and
the gate is open and people are streaming through, or
going through, whichever word you wish to use.  Is that
the sort of scene which you were describing when you
said that people were going through the concertina gate
which you observed from your vantage point? - A. I just
got the impression of them being closer together, I
think, than that.  I am reminded now of people climbing
over some of the centre parts.

You remember seeing that as well? - A. Yes.

Photographs are deceptive because it depends where you
happen to be standing, but your vision is that the
crowd if anything was more compact than that? - A. Yes.

Your mind's eye picture.        Thank you.

                Cross-Examined by MR. HALE

Mr. Hews tone, had you anything to drink at all before
the match? - A. No, I had not, sir.

As soon as you got there you could see a situation
which you didn't like, is that right? - A. It was a
situation which I couldn't understand, I couldn't make
sense of, outside the ground.

You had a choice, did you not, of missing a few minutes
of the match or maybe missing longer than that, maybe
missing the match all together, or putting yourself in
that crowd and putting yourself in the sort of
situation which you had experienced before?   Was that a
choice you had? - A. Yes, that was the- choice.

And you had a clear mind and you took the choice which
you have told us about, and I am sure you are very glad
you did. - A. Indeed, sir, but I just couldn't see
where to stand at all.  There was no logic to it.

Q. No.  Could you see any way, if you had joined the back
   of the crowd and pushed your way forward, that that was
   going to help you? - A. No, it didn't seeia as though it
   would serve any purpose at all.

Q. Thank you.

                Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Q. Mr. Hewstone, just help the Jury a little bit more
   about your experience at Wembley at the final in 1936.
   Did you attend on that occasion with a coach load of
   supporters? - A .1 arrived by coach on that occasion,
   yes.

Q. Which team were you supporting? - A. Liverpool.

Q. Was it a Liverpool supporters' coach? - A. Yes,   it was,
   but there were Everton supporters as well.

Q. On the coach? - A. Yes.

Q. At this particular match, that final, were the crowds
   segregated as they were at this match you have been
   talking about here at Hillsborough? - A. To some
   extent, yes.  Basically they were, yes.

Q. They were, so at the place where you had your
   frightening experience, which part of the ground was
   that? - A. It was, I think it is called the North End.
   It is the end that was the last terracing to be
   replaced at Wembley.   It was the remaining terraced
   area.

Q. What, standing ground? - A. Standing ground, yes.

Q. As that allocated to a particular group of supporters?
   - A. It was basically the Liverpool end.   I think we
   knew it to hold about 10,000 at that time.




                   /Q. You have mentioned
                                                R. G. HEWSTONE



Q. You have mentioned the word "wedge"? - A. Yes.

Q. You used that in connection with both the
   Hillsborough experience and the Wembley one? - A.
   Particularly the Wembley one.

Q. Just explain what you mean in your own words? - A. It
   was a situation where there were a number of
   turnstiles in the Wembley situation that were very
   close together at what I would call the front end,
   the pointed end of the wedge, and it was a funnel
   effect basically with the turnstiles at the top and
   side walls enclosing the crowd trying to get in and
   so the more it is backed up the deeper the wedge
   becomes. It was only when I and my son had gone into
   this wedge which was at least a hundred people deep,
   possibly more, we had only gone about ten bodies or
   ten rows in, as it were, and at that point we
   couldn't move at all.  I had difficulty breathing
   myself at that point.

Q. You had? - A. I had difficulty breathing myself at
   that point and it took us some minutes to work our
   way back out of that.

Q. What time was this in relation to the kick-off? - A.
   A similar sort of time.  It was about quarter to
   three because I remember that our coach had been
   delayed through roadworks and one thing and another.
   So we were quite late in getting there ourselves.

Q. What was the cause then of the build-up?

     THE CORONER:   I am going to deal with Mr. McGauley
when we rise this   afternoon.I am prepared for you to ask
what he experienced but I am not prepared to go into the
reason because he cannot answer that.   Besides, if we do
that, we will be exploring every match in the country.

     MR. PAYNE:     Of course.

     THE CORONER:     I have not, of course, said that but I
say it now.

     MR. PAYNE:   May I be permitted to ask this question;
could I ask Mr. Hewstone whether he knows what the cause of
the build-up was?

     THE CORONER:      No, I do not think so   because I do not
think it is going    to advance the purposes   of this Inquest.

It is a very interesting question and I would like to know
the answer myself.  I think I have got to be firm with
myself and restrain my curiosity.

Q.       MR. PAYNE:   On the Hillsborough occasion, Mr.
     Hewstone, I have got a note that you were about to
     say something about people being controlled through
     the outer gates.   Have I got the right note of what
     you were saying and I want you to amplify what you
     were going to say about that? - A. This was when I
     initially arrived?

Q. Yes, when you first arrived? - A. I could see that
   people appeared to be entering the first area through
   a gate, through one part of the front railings
   section if you like.  People seemed to be barely
   going through one gate.

Q. Did it appear to you that the gates were being used
   as a means of controlling the rate of entry of people
   to the turnstiles? - A. Oh yes, quite clearly.

Q. Then when you went down the tunnel you found at the
   end a packed stationary crowd? - A. That part of it
   that I could see which was simply basically the last
   line of people.

Q. In the terrace? - A. Who were covering the tunnel
   exit.

Q. This was at the time of the kick-off, was it? - A.
   Yes, play was in progress whilst I was in the tunnel.

Q. Did you see the game start? - A. No, I didn't see it
   start.  I believe it started as I went through the
   turnstile myself because I heard what I took to be
   the roar of the kick-off.

Q. Your impression was that there was no way of forcing
   your way into the crowd? - A. I can't say that
   because I chose not to try.

Q. No, quite.  That was the evidence that you gave and I
   wanted to explore why you used the word "force".   In
   order for you personally to have entered the crowd
   which you saw at the end of the tunnel, would it have
   been necessary for you to have used force? - A.
   Unquestionably, yes.

Q. Why unquestionably? - A. Because people were so
   packed together at the back.

Q. What do you mean by force? What would you actually
   have had to do? - A. I would have had to use my
   shoulder and I recall those five or six fans who did
   come down the tunnel whilst I was there, they
   virtually did that themselves because they took a
   little bit of a run, a bit of a charge, from the back
   of the crowd and bulldozed their way in. Yes, I
   think that is the description.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. M A N N I N G :

Q. You were later than you wanted to be getting to the
   ground? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you surprised or not at the numbers of people
   who were as late as you in getting to the ground? -
   A. Yes, I was.

Q. Therefore, does it follow you were even more
   surprised that there were, as you stood on your knoll
   at the back, some five minutes or so later still
   seeing large numbers of people coming down Leppings
   Lane ? - A. Yes.

Q. You had, as you told my learned friend, Mr. Hale, you
   made a decision not to force your way forward? - A.
   The decision was almost forced upon me because there
   were a number of people like myself who were circling
   the edge of the wedge and constantly changing their
   position, thinking that they might improve their
   chance of moving forward and people were just not
   having any success. It seemed to matter not where
   you stood.

Q. You heard the Police loudhailer from the Land Rover
   van and the Officer using the words "Ease back"? - A.
   Some such words.  I can't remember the exact words.

Q. The implication from that is that people were
   pressing forward? - A. Yes, I realise that.

Q. Is it something, as you viewed it, you. could clearly
   see? - A. Yes, I could see obviously there was
   pressure.

You had objectively come to the view, as you said,
that there was no purpose in pressing forward? - A.
Yes.
There was a wall at the end of the turnstile? - A.
That is right.

That wall was not going to move? - A. Yes.

All that was going to happen by pressing forward was
that the people between the wall and the back were
going to get pressured still further? - A. It was
obviously going to be very uncomfortable.

             Cross-Examined bv MR. KING :

Mr. Hewstone, could I just explore a bit more with
you the wedge which you have described? You have
described the wedge as it was at Wembley.  Could you
describe the wedge as it was at Leppings Lane end on
the 15th April 1989? Was there a similar situation
of a small number of turnstiles together at the point
of the wedge and the wedge getting wider as it came
backwards? - A. Basically that was going to be the
comparison, yes.  The entry gate in the first set of
railings seemed to be at the point of the wedge or
thereabouts.

Could you turn your head to the model and would
Sergeant Griffiths point to the perimeter gates A to
G? The whole turnstile area is across an arc, do you
see that? - A. Yes.

I have asked Sergeant Griffiths if he would point to
the perimeter gates at Leppings Lane terrace
turnstiles.  Do you see those? - A. Yes.

If the Officer will point to the turnstiles
themselves, do you see how the turnstiles themselves
do not in fact go the whole width of the back of that
area? They stop at a metal railing which divides the
area, do you see? - A. Yes.

Is what you mean by the wedge effect whereby it is
narrow at the top and as you get further back it gets
wider and wider? - A. No, the wedge I refer to is
outside.

                                            R. G. HEWSTONE



Q. Could you describe the wedge outside? - A. It is
   between the road and what would:-be the pavement on
   the edge of the road up to the first entry point.

Q. We have a similar situation outside the perimeter
   gates to what you have described? - A. I wasn't
   really observing what was inside other than seeing
   that there were queues of people at the turnstiles.

Q. The concept you had in your mind? - A. Was the
   outside.

Q. Was the word "wedge? - A. Yes.

Q. The idea of the wedge is that it is wide at the back
   and narrow at the top? - A. Yes.

Q. So that people are being put into an ever-decreasing
   amount of space? - A. Yes.

Q. In that situation which was outside the ground you
   described that the Police horses and the Officers on
   them were not being effective and that they were
   standing at the periphery at a loss what to do? - A.
   Certainly the two horses and Officers that I saw.
   They were stood right next to me.

Q. What do you mean by they were not defective? - A.
   They were completely detached from the crowd and I
   know that some orders were shouted across obviously
   to these Officers about getting people into some sort
   of lines.  I can remember the word "line".  I can't
   remember what else but I can remember that word as
   being part of the command and I think those Officers
   may have moved their horses a little bit and then
   been unable to carry out the command because it was
   clearly impossible at that point.  It had gone beyond
   the point where people could be formed into lines by
   the use of the horses.

Q. Why was that? Was it because so many people were
   there? - A. It seemed that the situation had gone
   beyond that point that the Police were not able to
   control the situation with the force they had there.

Q. Would it be fair to say from your observation that
   there had been a loss of control by that time? - A.
   Oh yes, yes, which I have to say, sir, if I may, was
   all the more surprising because we had been to the
                                                              33

         same fixture the previous year and it was in total
B        contrast.

    Q.    You described observing this wedge outside the
         perimeter gates and then you described how you
         climbed on to a bank.  You then described what you
         observed.  This is after you have arrived and already
         seen this wedge of people.  You say, "I saw no great
         movement of people but an increasing build-up of
         people coming down Leppings Lane and the crowd
         backing up"? - A. Yes, in that direction.

    Q. Is this the picture; you could observe this great
       wedge or mass of people and more and more people were
       joining it coming down from Leppings Lane? - A. They
       were coming to a halt and backing up still further
       alongside the Land Rover that I observed to my left
       had come along.

D   Q. Had you yourself come along Leppings Lane in order to
       reach the turnstile area? - A. Yes.

    Q. As you walked along Leppings Lane were you in a large
       crowd of people? - A. it was substantial but there
       was some room for us to dart in and out.

    Q. You were darting in and out but the other people were
       just walking? - A. Yes, they were just walking.

    Q. As you were darting in and out and the other people
       were walking along Leppings Lane did you observe any
       Police Officers in Leppings Lane before you reached
       the area of the forecourt and the turnstiles? - A.
       None that I can particularly call to mind.

    Q. There was nothing to prevent you reaching the point
       where you saw the wedge? - A. No.

    Q. Were you aware only of one opening of what we call
       the concertina gate, the blue gates? Did it seem to
       you it was just opened on the one occasion from what
       you could observe? - A. Yes.

    Q. Whenever that was, the effect of that opening was to
       empty almost the turnstile area? - A. Yes.

    Q. Clearly the great mass of people who had been in the
       turnstile area, beyond the perimeter gates, all those
       people apparently from your observation had got
       through on that opening of the gate? - A. Yes.

           Cross-Examined bv MR. C A T C H P O L E :

Mr. Hewstone, I want to discuss again the wedge
outside the ground.   Mr. King has been through it and
so has Mr. Payne.   Perhaps you could look at the
bundle of photographs at the front, C.258? - A. Yes.

That is a picture of the Leppings Lane turnstiles as
you were looking at them and you see by the white van
there is a blue railing running along? - A. Yes.

If you look on the plan you can perhaps see that it
creates a slightly narrower entrance at the perimeter
gate.  The people would come down to those
turnstiles? - A. Yes.




                        /Q. Without that barrier
                                       R. G. HEWSTONE



Without that barrier being there the situation that you
have described of a wedge being wide at the back and
coming down to a small point at those turnstiles, would
occur, wouldn't it? - A. Yes.

Perhaps you would look also at C.305.   This is a
photograph taken earlier than the time you arrived and I
think will illustrate the effect.   You see the blue
barrier there? - A. Yes.

There are some turnstiles on the right hand side.  We see
these people standing here.   There is a lot of space on
this side of the barrier? - A. Yes.

There are people standing there and they are being led
into those turnstiles.   They are standing there on the^
other side leading up to the turnstiles.^  Now t h a t i s n t
the situation you saw when you arrived, is it?    This was
taken at 2.30.  Maybe it is the situation you saw. - A.
There was certainly a large number of people waiting in
lines instead the area waiting to go into the turnstiles.

One other thing.    I am   going to take you inside the
ground now.     You said   when you were standing^ m the
tunnel, you came out and   as   you came out of tne tunnel
you turned to your left    and that is when you went round
to the side? - A. Yes.

If you look  at C.264 - it is an enlargement of a
photograph so the definition is not very good.    You see
the refreshment stand? - A. Yes, I remember that.

Did you see the sign there saying "Standing" on that
pillar? - A. I can t remember that.

There may be evidence this was there on t h e d a y , but you
don't remember seeing it?   You can't say either way.
A. No.
You said you saw a steward go into the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Did you hear this gentleman speak at all?       Could you
tell what accent he had? - A. No.

Did he have any distinguishing features? - A. He was a
small, squat, possibly slightly balding person, late-
thirties maybe, mid-thirties.

This was after the match kick-off?    - A. Yes, play was in
pr og re ss.
                                                                    Rh



                                                 R. G. HEWSTONE


    O. From where you were standing - I think you rf3re saying
       you were up on the gradient and you could see over tae
       heads of the people? - A. Yes.
B   Q.   You could see the pitch? - A. Yes.

    0.   Very well? - A. Well, at least^ the second   half of the
         pitch to a certain degree widthwise.

    0. Could you see anything of what was happening in the crowd
       in front of you? - A.'Nothing whatsoever.

    0.   So the only thing which would have been visi b l e to both
         you and anyone else coming down that tunnel would have
         been the backs of the people standing... - A . U p to that
         point, yes, and possibly the second half of the field,
         the pitch.

    0. Do you very often stand on the terraces? - A. Yes, quite
       often.

    0. We have had some evidence - I don't know whetner tnis is
D      your experience, perhaps you can tell us - that where you
       have a terrace with a perimeter fence it is quite common
       for people to want to stand higher up at the back because
       they can then see over the perimeter fence so that when
       you walk down a tunnel or come on to a terrace you often
       get a lot of people standing back, perhaps not as packed,
       but there is often a lot of people there with space
       further forward?   Is that your experience? - A. Yes,
       that's possibly true.

                     Cross-Examined by MRS. M c B RI EN:

    0. Mr. Hewstone, did you know that the large blue door you
       described was in fact an exit route? - A. No, I didn t.

    Q. Were you surprised to see fans being allowed in that way
       and even being re-directed from the turnstile area to
       that area? - A. It was a surprise, yes.

    0. Were the people who went through the gate being checked
       in any way for tickets or alcohol as far as you could
       see? - A. Only at gate A on the left and that wasn t a
       body search in any way.   It was simply the uniformed
       officers looking down towards the area of fans  hands
       which I took to be some sort of ticket examination.    It
       was difficult to say at a distance.

    Q. Do you think the fans were rushing to get in for kick-off
       in the same way that people rush to catch a bus or a
       train when they have got a time limit? - A. There was an
       inevitable anxiety about getting into the start of the
       match, yes.   That would be generally shared.
                                                               87



                                              R. G. HEWSTONE


    O. Quite a natural thing to do for people ahead, wasn t it.
        Would you agree that most people would not give up as
        easily as you had done?     You waited.   You were very ^
        pa.ti.ent but most people would, if they think their train
B     . is going to go or their bus is going to go, carry on
        hurrying, don't they? - A. Yes, except the ones who had
        gone into this wedge earlier from what I could see,
        weren't making headway themselves, so although people
        obviously wanted to get into the ground it was apparent
        they were being frustrated in that effort until the gates
        were opened.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. R U S SEL L:

    Q. I wonder if I could pick up one thing you said just now,
       that people in the wedge weren't getting anywhere? - A.
       As it seemed to me, yes.

    0. Were you able, from your vantage point, to form an
       impression of the density of the crowd outside tne
       perimeter gates? - A. You mean in terms of numbers or...
D   0. No, in terms of what it a tightly p ac ke d_crowd or was it
       a loosely packed crowd, or what? - A. Fairly tightly
       packed.

    Q. You saw other people arrive at the back of the wedge, or
       crowd, outside the perimeter gates after you had arrived
       at that location? - A. Yes, it was building up.

    Q. Did everyone that you saw arrive join the back of the
       wedge or did you see some seeking to make their way
       through the wedge? - A. I don't think I recall anybody
       going through the wedge.   I think it simply got more
       elongated.

    0. From where you were standing would it have taken some
       determination to have pushed a way througa the wedge to
       the front - to the perimeter gates themselves?^- k . That
       would have seemed to me to be an almost impossibility.

    0. So it would have   been almost an impossibility to have
       forced one's way   through to the gates? - A. To nave
       from the back to   the front of the wedge, if somebody nad
       tried to do that   on their own.

    0. If not an impossibility, it would have taken a
       considerable degree of determination? -‘ A. Oh, yes.

            THE CORONER:   Mr. Hewstone, we are very very_
       grateful to you for coming.   Thank you very much indeed.

            We could watch the video but I don't think we will.
       We will stop.  We will start again tomorrow at ten.   I

think on Friday, if it is agreeable to you and unless I
hear dissenting murmurs, we will start at 9.30 and we
will, if appropriate, plough on until half past one,
quarter to two, something of that order and then we wilL
have our lunch break but we won t come back.

             (In the absence of the jury)

     THE CORONER:    Mr. King, before you rise can I j^st
say one thing.    On Friday I think I must have been tired
because you were talking about foresignt and I referred
to the Bateman test and that, of course, is a gross
negligence case.     I knew what it was but for some
reason I think I confused myself, so I hope I didn t
confuse you on that.    I thought I had better just say
that before you tell me I was wrong.

     MR. KING:   I just wanted to add to the submissions
I made on Friday in support of my application that I
should be allowed to ask Mr. McGauley his experience of
fans arriving late at the last moment at tne Leppings
Lane end of this stadium in February 1989 o n the occasion
of the match between Manchester United and Sheffield
Wednesday.
     Sir, I wanted to support it by reference to what^has
happened today.  Sir, I have made a note throughout tne
dav of the line of questioning to the supporters who have
given evidence on behalf of - and I only give^ this as an
example - the South Yorkshire Police - and otners have
followed the same line.   That is to say, to a s k t h e
supporters what their experience was of fans arriving
late at a game.   Indeed, those questions weren t simply
in relation to this ground, which is all I wish to elicit
evidence about.   They were general questions about the
experience of those who had knowledge and experience^of
football matches and that they were questions which ,or
the most part elicited answers that the particular
witness had not had experience before the 15th of April,
1989, of fans arriving in such large numbers.     lnat is
evidence, of course, which the jury has heard.

     Sir, in those circumstances I would submit that all
the more reason is there that -a witness, Mr. McGauley,
who has experience not of any ground but of this
particular ground, not of any particular end of tne
ground but the Leppings Lane end, should be allowed to
give evidence which is on exactly the same topic as those
other supporters, of his personal experience of a game
with a large number of supporters attending, of a large
number of supporters arriving late and what Happened and
how they were coped with and the presence of the police
on that occasion and the Leppings Lane turnstiles, how
they coped on that occasion.
                                                             89



                                            R. G. HEWSTONE


         Sir, in my submission it was directly relevant when
    I submitted it to you on Friday. _ I say it is all the
    more relevant now and, indeed, fair play demands that if
    those supporters who have given evidence already can
B   asked the questions they have and the answers they nave
    given recorded, that I should be entitled to ask the
    question I seek in relation to Mr. McGauley.

         Sir, that is all I wish to say in support of the
    application.
         MR. CATCHPOLE:   Sir, I rise, I hope, briefly.   The
    evidence that other supporters have given as to whetner
    they were surprised or not has little or no relevance to
    the decision this jury has to come to.

         Assume that Mr. King is right that a different game,
    involving different policing and different arrangements
    has some relevance to this particular Inquest, then 1 ^
    can only be right that that evidence has to be viewed in
    the context of all the other people who were arriving
    there who have some input, of all the people who, unlike
D   this particular witness, were actually on the terraces it
    it is going to be suggested that people being hauled UP
    into the West Stand is indicative of crushing.   He can t
    sav that.   His evidence on that score could be extreme y
    prejudicial and you, sir, would have to find someone from
    the terraces, with respect, who could say whether there
    was crushing.
         Equally, outside, the reasons and reactions of the
    police, of the turnstiles, or whatever else, may nave
    wholly different reasons.

      THE CORONER: Hr. King, you will of course have been
aware that on Friday my natural instinct was against you,


a little time to think about it and I have                              the questions
that to a limited extent I t m n k it is p p
which you wish to ask of Mr. McGauley.
         t think that I would, and indeed if you may remember




     t-hat- ovpnl-. as I think Mr. Catchpole has quite rightly
 s S i r w o u I f h i v f to open up the whole of that match because

 ^ " ^ p ^ S d V t i s l e n ?o6Sim aSd S S . 2 S ^ S t    well
 l^k him the questions myself and you can fill in the lacunae
 that I leave as to what happened when he M®n Jhf ° " " ^ e ” 'e .
 what time he got down there; description of the crowd size,
 whJt he s a w of the policing; what he saw within the ground.

       I think perhaps I was so if                Sis1 letter
 sav the suggestion because we were referri g
 to the ’Star’ which of course goes a good way further.
 : mii t-e entitled to have opinions and he is more than
 entitled to voice them to the ’Star’ but I think not
 this inquest because I think whichever way you ^         ^
 he is not an expert. An expert is in a slightly different
  situation.      I do accept that a n .experJhc!Jv? ^ n a is a matter
  nninion       Whether that opinion is worth anything is a matter
  for the*jury to decide in the end but a lay witness, and
  a m s u r l you will agree with me on this, I hope you will
              he can tel? us what he saw, what he heard for that
matter. What use it will be, whether “ be, whether in the                    -
end it takes the matter forward as car as the          “
concerned or not we will have to see at the end o * t h e
proceedings.  I take it you are content with that.

      MR. KING:  Yes sir.  I am more than content with that.
I was not in fact going to ask any questions as to why.

      THE CORONER:  I did not think you were but may be
I read into it more than you had in mind.

      MR. KING:  Sir, if it is of assistance what * w°u ^
instruct those behind me to do is to supply you with a copy
of the statement which we have dealing with the matters
so that you have that in advance and it may help you
in directing your questions.
       THE CORONER:     That would be very kind of you, thank
you.
       I think with regard to the other issue which also
aroaB with t W s witnesl it is e x t r a o r d i n a r y because I assumed
he would be a fairly short witness and we ran into a j.ew
problems and that was the question of t                a  k   i  n  g   *
I think on reflection you are right on that as well about
the oroperty in the witness.     I think I was just very n
Dlussed because I thought that you had intervened, if 1 can
put it like that, between me telling
if that was right as I said to you on Friday it did not
sound or seem right.
       I accept the point that you make and I also entirely
 accept that you had made prior arrangements and I don t
 think anything other than everything was done properly
 as It X S S S be and perhaps the people instructing you will
 hear that as well.                    -
       MR. KING:      Sir, I am very grateful for that observation.

       MR. PAYNE:   Sir, since we understand the evidence is
 to deal with what happened on this other occasion and from
      mt - Kina has said in part relation to uhe policing
 on that'other occasion, perhaps he would be kind
 supply me with a copy of the statement as well before the
 witness gives evidence.
       THE CORONER:  It is up to Mr. King but if he is willing
 to do it I am not going to stop him of course.

       MR. KING:  Sir, in the time honoured fashion I will
 consider my position.
       MR CATCHPOLE:   Sir, one thing that does very seriously
 concern^me is the prospect, and the little that Mr. King
                                                                     92




    read out of this particular witness giving evidence of what
    he saw from the Spion Kop inside the ground.

          Now in the absence of the jury I can quite easily say
    that it is quite common practice for people to be hauled up
B   into the stand whether from the terraces, at other matches,
    and this witness may well be giving evidence from which
    preiudicial implications could be drawn that there was
    crushing occurring on those terraces at that match, on which
    I understand there is no evidence.

          Sir, I wonder whether I can invite you to limit the
    scope to what occurred outside which I can see the force
    of what Mr. King says goes to the relevance of the turnstiles. .

              THE CORONER:      I think, with respect, this particular
    witness, and we have no jury here so I can say this, I
    consider this witness to be a double edged sword if you don t
    mind me putting it like that because on the one hand he .vill
    give presumably evidence that there was a crowd outside at
    a d i f f e r e n t natch: that there was a late entry.  He will give
    evidence of people being hauled up and no doubt he will be
    able to give evidence that nobody died on that occasion, or
D   at least he won't be able to say that but he may be able to
    say that he did not see anybody being resuscitated on the
    pitch.
           Now what the jury make of that or indeed what I make
     of it when I sum up is a matter which will happen at the
     summing up. None of you can address the jury on issues of
     fact and so I think your fears of prejudice may in fact be
     unfounded.  In fact Mr. King perhaps ought to iear the
     prejudice more than you, but I am not judging it, I am not
     saying which way it will go, it is a peripheral bit of
     information which hopefully when I come to try to piece it
     altogether may or may not even feature because the jury w 1*1
     have heard it. We don't know what exercises their mind when
     they are in the jury room and in that sense I have no control,
     I don't want to have any control over them, but I am inclined
     to the view if we allow him to say what he saw outside
     then he should also say what he saw inside, but, and this is
     the big but, no he does not draw any conclusions from it ana
     nor do the lawyers but the jury will assess it with everything
     else you see.
           Does that help you in any way? Mr. King, did you want
     to come back at all on that? I think that is inevitable,
     isn't it, from what I have said?

            MR KING:  I am entirely content with that.  Could I
     just remind you, sir, that I had only just started my questions
     with Mr. McGauley and I would still want to develop somewhat
     those matters which are clearly relevant as to the drink and
     so on.

         I was not happy with, so does that clarify that                                or y

                 I mean what we are not going to do is .  now Produce

         Hillsborough where various things happened but if we a

         some information which has a bearing, be it slig -
                                                              94




that is a point of view, on the objective of this Inquest -
which is to establish who ran where and how 95 people
came by their deaths, I think is the wording of the Act,
then we will hear it but we won't go hunting for a lot
of other people unless I do the hunting.

      I am, if you like, looking around because I am
interested in various aspects but these are more experts
whom I am looking at rather than non-experts or witnesses
as to fact.  Does it help you at all Mrs. McBrien?

      MRS. M c B R I E N : I just find it irrelevant to go
off on that tangent.        I still feel that really.  That
is just my own opinion.

      THE CORONER:  Fair enough, but I think I have thought
about it and you are not alone in that point of view and
you may even be right but that is the decision which I
have taken.  I think you will find it will be extremely
difficult if I ruled the other way for us to hear evidence
from some of the witnesses whom we have got because it
would be so difficult to challenge them as to their
credibility and so I thought on balance within the limits
which I have set.




                   I think Mr. Payne
I think Hr. Payne had experienced what I had in mind,
and if you remember this witness was talking about the
wedge at Wembley.  Well, I let him go on to describe
the wedge, but as soon as Mr. Payne said why I think I
stopped him, and I think that is right and it falls
within the criteria which I have set.  What I am
concerned about is that we retain this Inquest within
manageable proportions.

     MRS. McBRIEN:    I just thought maybe we were |oing
to give too rauch time to this aspect, when it wasn t
quite keeping to the point.

     THE CORONER:    No we won't be giving too aiuch time
to it, I assure you.   That was the other thing which
concerned me on Friday, that we would be here for three
years, I think I said.   Well I have no intention of
being here for three years, and I don't think you have
any intention of being here fore tnree years.

      These are peripherals, maybe important peripherals
but they are peripherals and we will give them as much
time as we need, but certainly not an undue amount of
time.   I hope I will succeed in achieving that.

     MRS. McBRIEN:    Thank you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   That actually brings me - Mrs.
McBrien has led me very neatly to the point that I was
going to make.  Over the weekend, for light reading and
relaxation I was reading through the transcripts, and
there is a lot of repetition in them, not quite in the
way in which Hr. Maxwell described them, that people
down the line might possibly repeating the questions of
the people up the line, but in fact there is a lot of
repetition of, I will use the term examination-in-chief
- whether it is the right term or not, I don't know -
but my examination of the witnesses.

     This I understand to a certain extent because you
are wanting to reinforce points which the witness has
made, and which you may feel are important either from
your client's point of view, or very important frosi the
Jury's point of view, but it is exceedingly time
consuming and certainly wnen I was looking tnrough
them, when I come to do ray summing-up it is highly
unlikely that I am going to repeat, just because it has
been put in cross-examination, something which has
already been dealt with perfectly clearly and
adequately in examination-in-chief.

      I am not denying that on occasions doing that
 actually clarifies or gets information out which I
 missed because I had not formulated Kiy question
sufficiently pointedly, or which the witness blurts
out, or which the witness suddenly remembers and says
"Oh, yes", and such and such.   So cutting down on
cross-examination there is a possibility that one might
lose something, I don't deny that, but what I would
like to ask you, because I would much prefer that it
came from you rather than I kept on saying hang on, is
to think very carefully about questions.

      I know, or I have been reminded, in a criminal
case if something is said by a witness if you don't put
your point of view you are deemed, so to speak to have
admitted it, but that doesn't really apply, I think, in
an inquest.   You aren't in that situation so if "A"
witness has said this and you have challenged it,^and
witness "B" and says exactly the same and you don't
agree with it, it doesn't necessarily mean that you
have got to go over the whole thing again in order to
make quite clear that you don't accept that point of
view.

     So that is one.  Secondly, if it is merely a
matter of repeating what perhaps in a slightly more
forceful way has already been elicited from the
witness, try and resist the temptation to do so.   Of
course, if it is something completely different,(Or
even if when you have listened to it you think, "My
goodness me, I wonder whether we ought not just to
explore a little bit further down this line,^because I
think there is more to it than meets the eye", that is
fair enough as well, but if you could try and cut down
the length of cross-examinations I think it would save
us a considerable amount of time.

     I say no more, because I am sure you don't want to
prolong the proceedings any longer than I do, and let's
see how we get on.  It is quite difficult but I think
we have got to co-operate in this because there are so
many of us, aren't there, and it is a matter of making
sure that the investigation or the inquisition is
properly done, thoroughly done, we will still stick by
that, but done as efficiently and as proficiently as we
possibly can, in the interests of all of us, not least
the Jury who have got to listen to it as well and try
and take it in.

      Is there anything else?   Yes, Mr. Hanning?

     H R . MAHNIMG: Sir, you had a private word with
the Jury just before they left.  It was private enough
for me not to have heard what it was.  I heard
something about starting at 9.30 on Friday and then
breaking for lunch and that would be it.  Can we be let
in on the secret.
     THE CORONER:    I ara sorry, I didn't mean it to be
a private word.   I know I was speaking to them but I
had hoped that it would be heard.    What I said - it is
actually your idea I think - what I said to them was
that subject to hearing any saurnnirs of dissent we would
start on Friday at 9.30, go through to half-past-1,
quarter-to-2 or thereabouts, and then we would have our
notional lunch break but we would not come back in the
afternoon.  So for practical purposes, half-past-1,
quarter-to-2 we finish on Friday which gives all of us
at least a bit of the afternoon for other things,
whatever they might be.    I am sorry you didn't hear.
It wasn't intended as a private word.    Does that sound
all right?  No murmurs of dissent, good.

     Thank you,   ladies and gentlemen.   We will meet at
10 tomorrow.

            following morning at 10 a.nT)

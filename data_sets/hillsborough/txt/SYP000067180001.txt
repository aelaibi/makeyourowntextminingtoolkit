                 I am a married man living at the above address with my family.

                 I would describe myself as an ardent Liverpool Football. Club

                 ^supporter.      I have attended matches for about ten years and for the

                 last five years        I have been employed in the capacity of Steward at the

                 ANFIELD GROUND of Liverpool Football Club.

                 I am not a regular traveller to away games/and prior to Saturday 15th

                 April   1989 (150489)      I had never attended/an away game                   in the capacity

                 of travelling steward.             I did attend t p e       Cup Semi-Final match in 1988

                 at Sheffield Wednesday Football Grouped, Hillsborough,                     Sheffield,

                 between Nottingham Forest and Liveopool                  but only in the capacity of

                 supporter.       I was stood on that o/casion to the North Stand side of

                 the Leppings Ln terraces.

                 On Saturday 15th April            1989    (150489)    I was to attend the Hi 11s bo rough

Ground in Sheffield in my capacity as steward to assist the local

stewards    in covering the Cup Semi-final          game between L > « r p o o l        and

Nottingham Forest.        This had been organised b^.                           of Liver poo 3.

Football Club w ho we were supposed to meet outside the Leppings Ln

Ground prior to the match.

I received no instructions on my intended role at the ground as we

were to be briefed at the ground.              I was not given any emergency

procedure    instructions as      I was not in fact used as a steward,                  but as

a steward at Anfield I would summarise the duties of stewards                          in

emergency is to assist orderly evacuation from incidents.

I travelled in my own car to Sheffield.              I gave a lift to a fellow
                             AI k M l f c            X *   N 'jO b S g ?
st e war d’s son,   namely Ian BURKE,       and one/of his f ri en ds .         They were

attending the game as supporters buty l            could not say whether or not

they had tickets.

On the way to the ground                             'oy of two
                                I travelled in a convoy     tu  cars.                   The
                                                           r v (0 I2 .1 -
other    car was being driven by Ian's father,                                  There were

three other occupants of his         car,
                                                                y
On the way to the ground,        we stopped at a count r y y p u b          at about    12.45pm

(1245)    for half an hour or so.           I cannot remeirfber the name of the               pub

nor the road I was on but         I would say it was about ten miles outside

of Sheffield.       There were a few other fans who           I assumed were

Liverpool    fans in the pub,      they were having a meal           in the restaurant

in the back.

After the short stop,       we carried on and parked about three miles                      from

the ground.     The place we parked was off           a main r o a d . I       thi nk it was

the car park to an Iceland Supermarket.

We made our way on foot to the ground by               way of Leppings Ln.          There

were a alot of Liverpool        fans about,      some lying      on the side of         the

road,    some making their way towards the ground.

I saw no drinking and no disorder.              There were    plenty of police around
                                                                                 PAGE          3
                                                                                 S 1 144

but I saw none giving directions.                On the way to the ground we must

have been asked five or six times by different               people if we had spare

tickets.                                     /
                              y
We must have reached the Leppipgs Ln entrance at about                1.5Qpm    (1350).

There was quite a number of fQps about the entrance,                they were queuing

orderly and the queues were moving quite smoothly through the

turnstiles.

As I neared the entrance           I saw                and some other stewards.           1

went over and joined them by a gate to the left of the turnstiles

adjacent to a shop (Marked A)/.

We waited about outside the gates for about ten minutes until we had

all arrived then producing our s te wa rd ’s cards we were allowed through

a concertina gate by a / ocal steward and into the ground a r e a .

We were led by that staward along the back of the West Stand where the

tunnel to the terraces V s          and to a group of stewards at the bottom of

the steps leading to the seating            in the West Stand.

There were about four stewards at the bottom of the stairs.                    We showed

the local stewards          our Stewards Cards and were      led upstairs   into the

seat i n g .     The stewards who had showed ourselves up seemed to speak to

a senior steward already           in the seating #rea.      They returned and said

we would not be needed.

Together Vj/ith                      I wenjr down the stairs to the rear of the

West Stand.         We walked around/the stand to the terracing nearest the

South Stand.            It was at this point we met up with Ian BURKE and his

friend who were also           in the terracing.

We sat at the back of the terracing            (Pen /f) at the South Stand side
                                                            IM-Sf
 e would have got to this           position /at ^ b o u t £ . 2 5 pm (1425). The area

we were        in was   in no way crowded att£r we would have had a good view of

the pitch.

Whilst we were at this           point one Liverpool     fan came up to roe and told

     me to cup my hands.        I realised he wanted to get into the West Stand

     seating and looking up there was son)® spectators above                     leaning down.
V,   I took these to be his friends,             sp /'gave   him a bunk up thinking there

     was no harm in it.        I rememberI

     fans   climbing up from the rnorj^ central areas                (Pen 3 & 4 ).     I would
                                           /
     describe the lad I gave a l^ft to as a white male,                    aged 20-25 yrs, 6',

     heavy build.      He wore a bltie tracksuit bottoms and trainers.                    I could

     not describe him fu r t h e r .
                                 /
     About 2.30pm, together with                    , I went along the back of the

     terracing to see if we       could get any closer behind the goal.                   As we

     got closer towards the centre of the terracing                    the crowd got

     noticeably tighter packed, although7 I would not say they were crushed.,
                                         /
       I got about three foot inside p h e central terracing area by walking

     through an open gate on the dij/ider fence                   (Marked C)   (gate   in divider
                                   /
     between pens 3 & 2).        /

     It was quite obvious to me/that the terrace                    (Pen 3) was full and the

     view we had was not as g/od as where we had been.                     The gate that we

     passed through was not/blocked with people but you had to be

     deliberate   in your movements.            I do not know if there was a steward or

     police officer on the gate but there were neither                    in the vicinity of

     my actual viewing      point.

     In view of the number of fans in that area of the terracing we

     returned to our original        viewing      point      (marked B on ground map Ex.No.

     Marked       |1   ).

     I remained at my viewing        point until the game hjtfd started and recall

     seeing nothing more of note.              There was     in my opinion room enough for

     at least another       100 people at the side oj r the terraces where                I was.

     The game kicked off and the first              I knew of a problem was when the

     ,ganie was stopped by a policeman runr/ng on the pitch to the r ef er ee .

     I had seen a couple of people             c 1 iiyfcing over the perimeter fence from
                                                                             page:
                                                                             S I 144

the central areas to get o nto the pitch area but I was not aware of

what the problem was that had stopped the game.             Looking about    I saw

people screaming and shouting          from the seating area to fans below in

the central terracing to get back and ease off.

At this point, approximately 3.15pm          (1515)         started to panic

because his son,     Ian, was not with us.       We could not see much of

what was going on from where we were but it was evident there was a

problem in the central terracing.           Ian's friend who was still with

us, said that was where         Ian had gone with another friend he had met

inside the ground.

Looking for    Ian we all went around the edge of the stand to the

rear of the West Stand.         As   I got around the back of the stand I

saw a number of fans standing and wandering about quite obviously in

distressed state.       I was   looking for Ian, so I could not

describe any persons      in detail,    nor could I say if I saw any

emergency services      persons.

As I have    passed by the tunnel area,       I saw up to six bodies    lying a

few yards off from the tunnel.          I originally thought that they were

out of breath but as      I got closer     I realised they were dead.       Two

or three had coats over their heads and the faces of the others

were a pur pie colour.      I could not describe them further,        except to

say they were all white males.          I could only say that two of the ones

 that were not    covered up wore jeans.

Real is ing what was go i ng on I myse If be came u p ^ t   and started to

almost    panic at the thought of Ia n .      I carn/ed on looking at the rear

 of the stand for about five to ten minuses.           At this time    I rejoined

         near the back of the tu nn e1.     fare had not found Ian,   so the two

of us went to go down the t u n n e l . / A s we got to the entrance

to the tunn e1 there were about tm r e e     or four policemen blocking

the way.     I recal1           say i/g he wanted to go through to look

                                                                                     S1144

      for his son who was missing and the police refusing.                  It was about

      this   point   Ian shouted from behind i y f .    We rejoined him, all of us
V     upset, and moved off out the groymd through the concertina gate on

      the river side of the ground entrance.           We returned to the car

      stopping to use telephones       in a couple of houses on the way down

      Leppings Ln.      I would estimate we reached the         car at about 3.40pm

      (1540) and having established that the occupants of both cars had

      returned we set off back to Liverpool.

      Prior to the distaster,       I could not say anything more of the

      general   picture because     I was   intent on watching the game and had a

      very limited view of the central terraces.           As    I realised the

      disaster had occurred I was       intent on finding       Ian,    so could not say

      much else about what went on around me.

ui    On the day of the mat</h,      I was wearing     light blue trousers and a white
                               i-
      goat                                     Underneath the coat I wore a blue

      shirt wi th                           the collar.    I would describe myself as

      a white male, aged                       proportionate build,         dark medium

      length hair and dark:\n
                            moustache.

     ,\l would add that when the game was stopped I heard no clear                public

      address announcements.        I could hear the P.A.       system was being used

      but I could not hear what was being said.

      I would be prepared to attend the enquiry if required.

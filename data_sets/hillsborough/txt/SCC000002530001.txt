                             Dear Mr Hammond

                             RE:      HILLSBOROUGH TRANSCRIPTS

                             I refer to your letter dated 13th September, 1991 and apologise for the
                             delay in replying to you. I have been gathering together the relevant
                             information relating to the provision of transcripts.

                             The issue of the cost of transcripts has obviously been the subject of
                             previous correspondence. I enclose a copy of a letter dated 4th
                             February, 1991 which was sent to the Hillsborough Steering Committee
                             which sets out the position.

                             I understand that the relevant regulations provide that a fee of 80p per
                             photographic sheet shall be payable and that the special arrangements to
                             provide further copies of the transcript at the reduced rate were only
                             made on the basis that legal representatives of individuals requesting
                             the reduced rate copies had already purchased a copy at the statutory
                             rate.

                             Everyone was aware of the costs involved and these special arrangements
                             were made to assist those individuals who wanted their own copy of the
                             transcript in addition to the one being provided to the families’
                             solicitor.

                             In the circumstances, within the limitations of the regulations and
                             having regard to the points that have been raised, I believe the Council
                             has done everything possible to assist with the cost of transcripts.

                             If you have not already done so, have you considered making application
                             for these costs from the charitable trust?

                             I regret I cannot be of further assistance.

                             Yours sincerely

For the Attention of Miss E M Steel


Dear Miss Steel

Thank you for your letter dated 21 January 1991. Dr Popper has, as you say,
let me have copies of your exchange of correspondence of 4 and 17 January
1991.

The-present position, so far as I am aware', is that the costs of the Inquest
including the transcript service, falls to Sheffield City Council. The
transcript service alone, excluding photo-copying costs, amounts to about
£900.00 per day.

As you will know, the Coroner’s Records (Fees for Copies) Rules 1982 as
amended by the Coroner’s Records (Fees for Copies) (Amendment) Rules 1990,
provides that the fee payable to the Coroner or other persons for furnishing
photo-copy shall be 80 pence for each photographic sheet.

At present three firms of Solicitors have requested transcript copies which
are available on the following day.

In November last year, the families concerned asked if they could purchase
copies of the transcript. Bearing in mind many of the factors you have set
out in your letter, the Coroner agreed that in the special circumstances, if
the legal representatives of the individuals requesting copies of the
transcript had already purchased a copy at the full rate of 80 pence a sheet
a copy of the full transcript for the week could be obtained on a "next week
basis at a much reduced rate of £50.00 (£10.00 for each day), such a charge
being comparable to general photocopying charges.




                                  734018 - Mr Webster
In the circumstances, therefore, I believe that we have done everything
possible to assist within the limitations of the regulations and having regard
to the relevant issues. If there is any way I can be of further assistance,
please let me know.

Yours sincerely




City Solicitor and

                               RE:     COST OF HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER TRANSCRIPTS

                               The Coroner, Dr Popper, has recently written with regard to your recent
                               telephone conversation with him on the above matter.

                               I am currently looking into the issue of whether the Authority is able
                               waive the sum in question ie £5,000 and will contact you again when I
                               have all the information to hand.

          Town Hall,

o         Dear Mrs. Gordon,

          I have had a telephone call from Mr. Hammond of the Hillsborough Steering
          Group. Apparently the cost of the transcripts has not yet been fully repaid
          to the solicitors and it seems as if there are some difficulties with
          recovering all the money from the various families.


          He told me that it looks as if he and Mr. Hicks will have to foot a
          substantial proportion of the expenses and inquired whether the Council would
          be prepared to waive £5,000 of the charge. I think that they want to keep
          these transcripts amongst their archives.

           This is obviously is a matter for you to decide, and I am giving you Mr.
           Hammond’s address so that you can deal directly with him.

                                                       Mr. P. Hammond,

        Dear Mrs. Gordon,

        I have had a telephone call from Mr. Hammond of the Hillsborough Steering
        Group. Apparently the cost of the transcripts has not yet been fully repaid
        to the solicitors and it seems as if there are some difficulties with
        recovering all the money from the various families.


        He told me that it looks as if he and Mr. Hicks will have to foot a
        substantial proportion of-the expenses and inquired whether the Council would
        be prepared to waive £5,000 of the charge. I think that they want to keep
        these transcripts amongst their archives.

         This is obviously is a matter for you to decide, and I am giving you Mr.
         Hammond’s address so that you can deal directly with him.

                   Safety of Sports Grounds
                   Hillsborough Disaster - Coroner's Inquest
                   Coroner *s Summing Up__________ __________

                   I refer to the attached copy extract of the Coroner’s Summing Up to the
                   Hillsborough Inquest. Thank you, for providing me with this information.

                   It seems to me that the Coroner raises the following points

                   1»    There should be sufficient emergency egress from the direction that
                         spectators are generally facing, i.e. forward egress to the pitch.

                   2.    There should be some means of drawing together the findings of
                         consultative documents on matters affecting public safety. Dr. Popper
                         seems to highlight work undertaken by Dr. Muir into the Manchester Air
                         Disaster. As you know, I have already begun to draw together reports
                         relating to other sporting disasters. I intend to compile a library of
                          such publications which will be available to the Council and its
                         advisers. -For your information, most of the publications when found can
                         usually be obtained on loan and therefore copied.

                   3.    Safety Certificates should be reviewed.

                   4-.   Is it possible to physically control spectators prior to reaching the
                         control mechanism of a turnstile?

                   5.    Dr. Popper recommends a National Licensing Authority. It seems to me
                         that once the National Football Licensing Authority is up and running, it
                         is likely that the Government will transfer the licensing function for
                         sports grounds to this National Organisation. Offers of alternative
                         employment would be welcomed. ^

                   As you rightly thought, much of what Dr. Popper raises has already been
                   attended to. Principally, forward means of egress. By removing pitch
                   perimeter fences forward egress has been drastically improved. There are
                   however two areas within the two football grounds where there is no forward
                   means of egress.

                   1.    Sheffield Wednesday - North West Terrace Upper, in view of the restricted
                         capacity for this terrace, 1400 people, and the fact that people can
                         egress through the West Stand, I am not overly concerned about this
                         area. When the area is redeveloped, forward means of egress will be
                         incorporated.

                   2.    Sheffield United Football Club, Bramall Lane Stand - I have in fact
                         recently written to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners about this Stand and I
                         anticipate that proposals will be forthcoming, allowing for forward means
                         of egress. With luck this issue could be resolved for the coming
                         football season.
Safety Certificates have been reviewed and continue to be reviewed.

The question of controlling people prior to reaching turnstiles is difficult,
given the constraint that most football grounds have limited availability of
land. You will also appreciate that additional physical constraints prior to
reaching the turnstiles could in fact become hazardous. I will however look
into this matter.

Given Dr* Popper’s concerns about additional controls prior to reaching
turnstiles what view do you feel he would take of the Main Stand of the
Sheffield International Stadium?

I hope this information is of assistance. Do you wish me to report to the
Licensing Panel about the points raised by Dr. Popper? Unless I hear from you
to the contrary, I will assume that you do not wish me to report to the Panel.

     I have already reminded you, and given you the Jury s
findings so I do not propose to repeat them.

      Now I explained to you, ladies and gentlemen, that you
were not allowed to add any riders to your verdict.
Indeed, I am not allowed to do that either, but under          ,.
Rule 43, if I think there is any matter which I should refer
to someone for their consideration then I am entitled to do
that.    What I propose to do is that I do think there are
one or two matters which I think could usefully be thought
about by various bodies.        Indeed, they may already have
thought about them.    I make no recommendations with regard
to them because most of these are matters of expertise as
opposed to mere commonsense and there may be problems which
I am not expert enough to be able to deal with.        However, I
feel there are one or two matters which I do want to draw to
certain persons' attention so they can apply their mind to
them.    Whilst I would not wish to add riders or, indeed,
make recommendations, I just propose to outline the main
topics which have occurred to me as I have been sitting
listening, together w i t h y o u , to evidence which we have
heard.
     The first matter that I think concerns me is the
problem which I think was illustrated by the fact that if
you have people looking in one direction particularly
intently to watch an event, as indeed one would get at a
football match or, indeed, at other m a j o r events, it may
prove very difficult to turn them round, if I can use that
term, so that they use escape routes which are at the back
or at the sides.     That is the first thing.

     The second thing is that I know, because we made
inquiries, that a lot of work has been done in connection
with aircraft disasters, particularly arising out of the
Manchester air disaster, on people escaping from aeroplanes
in stress situations and what happens with regard to gates
and when they move forward and so on.   A great deal of work
has been done by Dr. Hannah Muir and others at their
research establishment.

     I think it would be beneficial if one could bring
together information from different sources which may have
applications in other fields and so I intend to write to the
appropriate authorities, for example, the Fire Service and,
indeed, Dr. Muir and see whether or not there isn t some
scope whereby information can be pooled and perhaps
improvements made with regard to future safety.
     The second thing that concerns me is the Safety
Certificate.  I am, of course, aware that there is a new
one in force, and we have not been concerned with that,
but one of the factors which we all became aware of was
not only that there were problems on the terraces but that
there.were problems within the turnstile areas, and it
seems to me that some additional thought maybe is required
to see whether there is not some way of more effectively
controlling ingress, because at the moment, of course,
there is no system of counting, as far as I understand,
into the turnstile area, so one is in fact left with
exactly the same position as one was before, namely that
you have to estimate the numbers within that area by eye.

     Whether that is a situation which can be overcome or
not I do not know, but I do intend to write both to the
Local Authority, as the enforcing authority, and indeed
also to the Club, to ask them to apply their minds to that
part of the Ground. We have tended to think of simply the
terraces and the pens but I think one has to go a little
further and think about the area without.  There may be no
solution, I don't know, but I feel that it is a matter
which I would like to think I had drawn to somebody's
attention.

     With regard to the Safety Certificate, I am of course
aware that Lord Justice Taylor spent a great deal of time,
in fact much more time, with regard to recommendations
than I have done, an<3 he did make recommendations with
regard to inspectorates, but it seems to me, and 1 intend
to write to the Home Secretary on this, that with a matter
such as safety in sports grounds it might perhaps be worth
looking at not simply an inspectorate but possibly an
homogenous, national, licensing, appraisal, inspecting
organisation or service, because at the moment, of course,
the Safety Certificates are issued by local authorities,
there are many of them, and each one of them has a
relatively small number of sports grounds.   However hard
the people within the authorities may try and however
competent, their experience will be limited and I would
like some thought to be given to whether it would not be
better in the interests of safety if a body of expertise
could be built up which (a) applies more uniform
standards, and (b) would be.-in a much better position to
assess risk and so on at any particular stadium, so my
intention is to write to the Home Secretary and ask him to
consider that.

     In addition such, a body, would have - and this is a
further point which I wish to: draw to his attention - or
maybe some o t h e r body, the" facility for ensuring that
there is both proper training and the establishment of
continuity of information from one person to anot,her, in
order to try and ensure that practice which is good and
sound is passed on and continues to be applied and be.
developed, but even if such a body was not set up, of
course, within each organisation that may be involved in
staging major events where loads of people come together
great effort should, I am sure, be put into both training
and the need for continuity of some sort or another.

     There is another aspect which I want to write on - it
all happens to be the Home Secretary because it happens to
be his department, including the first point.  One has to
ask oneself the question as to whether or not the
involvement of the Police in the activities within the
Stadium is a proper use of both their training, expertise
and abilities, and I would like to suggest to the Home
Secretary that this is something which needs, in my view,
addressing as a matter of relative urgency, to make some
decisions as to who, in fact, on the safety side should
have (a) the ultimate authority, (b) the expertise and (c)
the responsibility.

     It is a matter of considerable regret to me to say
that whilst we were sitting during these Inquests, and
without me making any effort to keep abreast of events, I
read in the paper of one football disaster in South
Africa, where about 40 people died as a result of crush
injuries.  There were at least two other non football
situations that I remember, one was abroad where numbers
of people were injured and killed, and although in the
event nobody was seriously hurt, just last Saturday in the
town in which I live there was a crushing incident at a
football match.  So although it would be nice for me to
say we have had all this inquiry, we have discussed it and
everything else, it will never happen again, unless there
is considerable, continuous vigilance and perhaps even a
change of attitude with regard to matches, I fear it will
happen again and it will be, of course.     well, you know
how awful it has been once but to have it again would be
just that much worse.  How you solve it - the only safe
stadium, in my view, is an empty one.   As soon as you
bring a substantial number of people together you run
risks, and whether it is possible to have terraces where
people stand without risk I have doubts.   So I intend
again to draw these thoughts to the Home Secretary and see
what, if anything, he can or wishes to do.

     Finally, and I am cheating a little bit because this
is not actually a safety matter, I do intend to write to
the Home Secretary and ask him to seriously apply his mind
to the inter-relationship between coroners' inquests and
public inquiries in major disasters of this type, because
I think somebody has got to grasp the nettle and sort out
the situation, which I do not think is entirely
satisfactory.                         ■"        ■■■-

                           Dear Dr. Popper,

                           Please find enclosed letters and stamped envelopes for the Jurors
                           of the Hillsborough Inquest.

                           At the end of the Hillsborough Inquest you spoke to the Jury about
                           the effects of seeing and hearing painful details about the disaster.
                           You suggested to them that should they find it necessary they could
                           approach their G.P. or speak to a Social Worker. I was very pleased
                           that you gave details of how to make contact with Mr. Webber at this
                           Department in Open Court at the end of the Inquest.

                           It is important that Jury members have contact numbers of confidential
                           help should they wish to use them now or in the future. This is
                           because it is recognised that it can take time for reaction to evehts
                           to emerge. Also, as the ending of the Inquest was particularly     *
                           distressing to those present in Court, the Jury may not have noted
                           the information you gave out regarding help available to them.

                            I would be very grateful if you would read the enclosed letter &nd
                            send it on to members of the Jury so that they have the information
 o                          you gave in Court in writing should they need to refer to it in the
                            future.

                            If there are any difficulties concerning this request will you please
                            contact David Webber, Senior Principal Social Worker.

                            Thank you in anticipation for your help with this matter.

                            Yours sincerely,

                          Dear Juror,

  o                       I have asked Dr. Popper to send you this letter following his remarks at
                          the end of the Hillsborough Stadium Inquest.

                          As a member of the Hillsborough Inquest Jury over the last year you’often
                          saw and heard painful details about the disaster. There may have been
                          occasions when you felt distressed by what you heard.

                          If any of these experiences have remained with you or they are affecting
                          your personal life you may want to discuss this in confidence with
                          someone. As Dr. Popper said in his closing remarks, you can do this
                          either by contacting your G.P. or you may wish to talk to a Social Worker.
                          If you would like to talk to a Social Worker now or in the future
                          please write or telephone me on 734856 or 734855. If you write, please
                          mark the envelope "Private and Confidential". Depending on your wishes
                          I will put you in touch with the Social Worker from the Department or
                          another agency who were involved at the time and following on the disaster.

                          I can assure you that any contact you make with myself and with anyone
                          subsequently will be completely confidential.
 o                        Yours sincerely,

For the Attention of Miss E M Steel


Dear Hiss Steel

Thank you for your letter dated 21 January 1991. Dr Popper has, as you say,
let me have copies of your exchange of correspondence of 4 and 17 January
1991.

The-present position, so far as I am aware', is that the costs of the Inquest,
including the transcript service, falls to Sheffield City Council. The
transcript service alone, excluding photo-copying costs, amounts to about
£900.00 per day.

As you will know, the Coroner’s Records (Fees for Copies) Rules 1982 as
amended by the Coroner’s Records (Fees for Copies) (Amendment) Rules 1990,
provides that the fee payable to the Coroner or other persons for furnishing a
photo-copy shall be 80 pence for each photographic sheet.

At present three firms of Solicitors have requested transcript copies which
are available on the following day.

In November last year, the families concerned asked if they could purchase
copies of the transcript. Bearing in mind many of the factors you have set
out in your letter, the Coroner agreed that in the special circumstances, if
the legal representatives of the individuals requesting copies of the
transcript had already purchased a copy at the full rate of 80 pence a sheet,
a copy of the full transcript for the week could be obtained on a "next week”
basis at a much reduced rate of £50.00 (£10.00 for each day), such a charge
being comparable to general photocopying charges.




                                  734018 - Mr Webster
In the circumstances, therefore, I believe that we have done everything
possible to assist within the limitations of the regulations and having regard
to the relevant issues. If there is any way I can be of further assistance,
please let me know.

Yours sincerely




City Solicitor and
Head of Administration

    Dear Mr Webster,

    I understand from Dr Popper that he has copied to yoiJ our exchange of correspondence
    of the 4th and 17th instant with regard to the cost of the daily transcripts.

    I do not know whether there is anyway in which the burden of this cost can be

?    modified as the circumstances are of course very different from the more usual



    Enquest which lasts at most a matter of a week or so and in most cases is completed
     ithin a single day.


    The second factor which is different in this case is the number of people who
    are represented and therefore the number of copies of the transcripts which are
    supplied.

    Bearing that in mind if there is a way in which legitimately the cost of each
    individual transcript to the parties concerned can be reduced so that the City
    Council still recoupes its expenditure but that this is shared amongst the
    participants that will of course be very much appreciated.

    I look forward to hearing from you.

    Yours sincerely,

                                                                     'ION        LEGAL

                        Possible Disciplinary Proceedings

You will be aware that after the Hillsborough Disaster there have been a
number of investigations into "what went wrong" and "who was to blame".  In
particular Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry, the DPP investigation, the civil
proceedings for compensation and finally the Inquest which is still ongoing.

The DPP have decided not to take criminal proceedings against the local
authority or any individual officer.   The local authority has not been
pursued through the Courts by the police or any other party for a contribution
to the damages paid to the injured or bereaved.  (The Council may have to
contribute £10,000 to the insurers legal fees under the insurance policy.)

Lord Justice Taylor’s Report contained criticisms of the local authority, some
of which were accepted, some of which would still be questioned, but all the
recommendations in the Report have been followed as advised by the Home
Office.

Counsel’s view is that it is extremely unlikely that any individual could be
found culpable in any criminal proceedings.

In August, 1989 it was considered appropriate to ask David Green to carry out
an internal investigation into the Disaster to determine whether any officer
should be the subject of disciplinary proceedings.   Discussions took place as
to the remit of such an inquiry etc.   However, by January 1990 the position
of the local authority regarding the Disaster was much clearer and you decided
that there was no need for the internal investigation to go ahead. In
addition, given the time that has elapsed there would have to be exceptional
circumstances to commence any disciplinary inquiry at this stage.

In the circumstances, it would be helpful for the individuals concerned -
David Bownes, Chief Licensing Officer and Arthur Butler, Building Surveyor -
to clarify their position regarding possible disciplinary action.

I have therefore drafted a letter to the individuals concerned for your
consideration.

I have consulted with Rod Jones, Ken Blount and Keith Thrustle who agree with
the proposed action and given that both David and Arthur are due to give
evidence to the Inquest on 23rd January, 1991, it would be desirable for them
to have the letter prior to that date.

Leading Counsel, who has been involved throughout, has also advised that such
a letter is appropriate, justifiable and in his view necessary prior to such

                      Possible Disciplinary Proceedings

I write to clarify the position regarding the possibility of disciplinary
proceedings against you in connection with your Safety of Sports Ground duties
and the Hillsborough Disaster on 15th April, 1989.

I have decided that, on the basis of the information available to me at this
point in time and having regard to the following matters

       1.   the decision by the DPP not to institute criminal proceedings
            against the Council or any individual officer

       2.   the fact that Sheffield City Council has not been ordered by the
            Court to contribute to the compensation payments made through
            civil proceedings

       3.   the advice of Counsel acting on behalf of Sheffield City Council’s
            insurers

that there are no grounds for taking disciplinary action against you.

I know that you remain under considerable pressure regarding this issue, in
particular because of the continuing requirements to give evidence to the
Inquest, but I trust that this decision will go some way in helping you to
cope with that pressure.

Yours sincerely

            CONFIDENTIAL
            INTERNAL INQUIRY INTO STAFF RESPONSIBILITY ASPECTS
            OF THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
            I trust that you are aware that shortly before you took up
            your appointment it was agreed with the Leader that I should
            chair an internal inquiry into staff responsibility aspects of
            the Hillsborough tragedy following publication of the original
            Taylor Report. The objective would be to determine whether
            there are any grounds or reasons for taking disciplinary
            action against any of the staff concerned with the application
            of the 'Safety in Sports Grounds' legislation.
            It is now necessary to get this underway, having deferred
            action for a while pending the final report of Lord Justice
            Taylor and the separate Police investigations which have been
            taking place concerning possible criminal negligence.
            Over the last couple of months or so I have had discussions
            with Mark Webster but, understandably and quite properly, he
            feels the need to take 'an arm's length' approach since his
            own Department has the Licensing role. I drew up some draft
            terms of reference and these have been commented upon by Mark
            and following some further conversations I have had with Keith
            Thrustle of Personnel, I have amended these and a copy of my
            latest draft is attached. I would welcome final comments on
            these from all addressees by a week today - Wednesday 7
            February - and also on the draft programme overleaf.
            My purpose in writing to you now is to suggest that you should
            shortly formally tell people - eg the Management Team and the
            Trade Unions - what is proposed and why and how it will happen
            and my role in it. That needs to come from you, I think,
            rather than me or Mark or the Chief Personnel Officer.
            Keith   Thrustle   feels that the Trade Unions should be
            'consulted' about the terms of reference and asked for their
            views but that it should be consultation and not negotiation.
            Once all that has been done then people at the sharp end need
            to be informed about the procedures and timing and so on and
            that may well best be done either by me as Chairman or by
            Personnel, and I am in touch with Keith about that. There are
            also some people who have left the Authority who ideally I
            will need to approach but if they are not disposed to
            contribute/participate then I am advised there is nothing we
            can do.
            A time now needs to be set for the commencement of the inquiry
            so that I can clear my diary and others that may be called can
             repare also.       -                    CV J                f iv —

Allowing time for the consultations on the terms of reference
(say a fortnight) and an opportunity for you to set the thing
in motion, I would suggest I aim for the week commencing
Monday 19 March and to achieve that the following targets
will need to be met:
ACTION                                       TARGET DATE
Draft Terms of Reference Agreed for
Consultation with Trade Unions:               7 February
Meeting with Chief Executive to
discuss/agree advisory note to
Chief Officers and Trade Unions:       by     9 February
Report to Management Team (or
Chief Officers concerned notified):          13 February
Trade Unions advised and given
Draft Terms of Reference and
details of proposed procedures etc:          16 February
Staff likely to be called advised
of proposed Inquiry, consultations,
timetable and likely commencement
date:                                        19 February
Consultation with Trade Unions:              23 February
                                       to     2 March
Final Terms of Reference and
procedures completed and sent out
to all concerned:                             5 March
Inquiry commences:                           19 March
Inquiry completed by (ideally):              23 March
Outcome and recommendations to
Chief Executive:                              6 April
The present intention is that Tim Hoskins from Administration
and Legal and Keith Thrustle will act as my advisors.    Once
you have had the chance to digest this could I suggest we try
and meet quickly ie by 9 February, and agree what goes out,
when and to who.      I am drafting up with Keith a possible
letter and will let you have this by Monday 5 February.
It might be helpful if Keith and Tim participate at that time
and I T T ' w i l l , of course, continue to liaise with Mark as
necessary but I think it is important that his neutrality is
maintained.




Enclosed:

1)   My original Draft Terms of Reference dated 21.12.1989.
2)   Mark Webster's reply dated 11.1.1990.
3)   My revised Draft Terms of Reference.
       REVISED DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE CONCERNING
   INTERNAL INQUIRY INTO STAFF RESPONSIBILITY ASPECTS
               OF THE HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

  To inquire into what were the duties and responsibilities
  of the City Council in meeting and fulfilling the relevant
  legislation concerning Safety in Sports Grounds and in
  particular that of Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough
  from 1979 up to and including the time of the Hillsborough
  tragedy in 1989.
  To inquire into how those duties and responsibilities were
  translated into organisational and operational intent
  within the City Council both at Officer and Committee
  level,   identifying   the    duties,    responsibilities,
  relationships and accountability of all such staff and the
  associated reporting procedures.
  To inquire into the associated performance and action of
  the staff involved and particularly determine whether
  each such member of staff properly and conscientiously
  fulfilled    their   duties    and   responsibilities and
  demonstrated the degree     of    application,   care and
  initiative that could rightly be expected of them and if
  not in what ways did they fail and for what reasons.
  To inquire into the wider context in which the above work
  was carried out, what were the overall resources available
  and the importance attached and allocated to Safety in
  Sports Grounds matters.     Further, to determine how all
  that compared with other      Authorities   and   National
  perceptions as to the degree of resources which should be
  committed to such work.
  To inquire into the ways in which the City Council and
  its staff interfaced with other Statutory bodies and
  parties involved in the Advisory Group at Sheffield
  Wednesday and the roles and responsibilities of each.
  To determine specifically whether disciplinary action is
  warranted against any member of staff and if so on what
  grounds and to report accordingly to the Chief Executive.

  To draw to the Chief Executive's       attention any other
  matters which seem pertinent.

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

INTERNAL INQUIRY INTO STAFF RESPONSIBILITY ASPECTS OF THE HILLSBOROUGH
TRAGEDY

Pursuant to your communication o f the 21 December, and to our b r ie f
discussion a t Management Team, I o f f e r the following comments upon
the suggested d r a f t term s:-


1)   Clearly any Inquiry w ill have to include a l l s t a f f from the
     various Council Departments involved in the process in question
     some of whom have already l e f t the Council's employ fo r one
     reason o r another.

2)   Regard will have to be had I would suggest to other Influences
     upon the work th a t was c a rrie d out and the decisions th a t were
     taken, including, but not lim ited t o , the other s ta tu to ry bodies
     who form p a rt of the Advisory Group, fo r example the Police
     and the Fire Brigade.

     I would suggest th a t i t w ill be necessary to look a t an O fficer
     decision or action in l i g h t o f what facts/sugg estion s were coming
     from such sources.

3)   I would suggest th a t I t may well be necesary fo r you to look
      back a t the position in the period 1979 to 1986 to some extent
      because the City Council In h erited an e x is tin g s itu a tio n in
      which the Building Surveyor's s t a f f had previously been Involved
      as advisers to the group then run by the County Council.
4)   I would also suggest th a t any Inquiry o f t h i s nature would have
      to look a t the sa fe ty o f sp o rts grounds workload In context
      1e in r e la tio n to o th er pressures and workloads upon Departments
      and p a r tic u la r O ffic e rs, and also the general, local and national
      perception as to the degree o f f a c i l i t i e s which should be
      committed to such work.

5)   I think i t 1s worthwhile c la r if y in g a t t h i s stage whether you
      intend to look a t a l l the work done 1n re la tio n to Sheffield
      Wednesday o r merely to concentrate on the Lepplngs Lane end
      of the ground.

6}   As previously discussed between ourselves, the timing of t h i s
     Inv estigation must be c a r e f u lly considered 1n r e la tio n to the
     Council's po sition on the c i v i l proceedings upon which, as I
     am sure you are aware various announcements have recen tly been
     made and others may well be expected s h o rtly and also the criminal
     in v e s tig a tio n .
7)   I believe I t 1s necessary, fo r a v a rie ty of reasons, not l e a s t
     from a natural ju s tic e point of view, but also from an In d u strial
     re la tio n s viewpoint, t h a t a l l s t a f f who may be affected by t h i s
     Inquiry be warned and t h a t the Trade Unions representing a ll
     such s t a f f become involved, as although they are Involved in
     some cases I am not aware th a t they, have picked up a l l such
     matters and these comments r e l a te to a ll Council departments.

With regard to the l a s t comment I notice th a t you have picked th is
up in the f in a l paragraph on the f i r s t page of your communication,
and I accept th a t i t is impossible to properly inform people u n til
an agreement has been reached on the terms of reference but I am
ju s t anxious to ensure th a t 1n l ig h t of my comment in paragraph 1,
th a t we do not miss out anybody who subsequently to be approached.
In terms of process 1t might be best fo r us to have a discussion
once you have fin a lis e d the terms of reference in lig h t of my comments
with say Keith T hrustle, to decide how best to introduce th is Into
the Council's procedures.

                  PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL
                  INTERNAL INQUIRY INTO         STAFF         RESPONSIBILITY                         ASPECTS   OF   THE
                  HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY
                  Further to our recent conversations I set                                             out below my
                  suggested draft terms concerning my Inquiry into                                      staff aspects
                  of the Hillsborough Tragedy. I would welcome                                          your comments
                  and confirmation that Tim Hoskins will act as my                                      adviser.
                  1.   To inquire into the performance andaction of those City
                        Council staff who were in       any way involved in or
                        responsible for the giving of advice or issuing of
                        licences   in   respect of "Safety in Sports Grounds
                        Legislation" and Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in
                        particular, from the time that the City Council began to
                        prepare for the transfer and inheritance        of   such
                        responsibilities up to    the  time   of the Hillsborough
                        Tragedy on 15 April 1989.
                  2.   To inquire specifically into the duties, responsibilities
                       and accountability of all such staff and the associated
                       reporting procedures.
                  3.   To determine whether each suchmember of     staff properly
                        and    conscientiously   fulfilled   their    duties  and
                        responsibilities   and   demonstrated   the    degree  of
                        application and initiative that could rightly be expected
                        of them, and if not, in what ways did they fail and for
                        what reasons.
I )
                  4.   To determine specifically whether disciplinary action is
                       warranted against any member of staff and if so on what
                        grounds
                  I think it would be helpful if when these terms of reference
                  are made known and available to the staff and/or the Trade
                  Unions, then at the same time it should be made clear what the
                  procedures will be for interviewing staff and recording the
                  information and comments arising and whether such records will
                  be made available to any subsequent disciplinary hearing
                  should that prove necessary. Likewise advice on staff's right
                  to be represented and the right of the Council to pursue such
                  inquiries.   Those matters seem to me to be more the province
                  of Personnel than me and I would be glad if you would take
                  this up with them so that there is no misunderstanding. I
                  want the Inquiries to run         well with   people's   ready
                  participation and am therefore concerned to ensure that
                  everyone agrees the ground rules to start with.
Finally, I would like to set some time aside for this Inquiry
in my diary and would suggest a week early in February say,
that commencing Monday 5 February. Could you,.check that Tim
Hoskin's could be free at that time and if so give some
thought, to who might be involved so that they can also be
advised early in January and asked to keep that time free.

                STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL




                HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - POSSIBLE DISCIPLINARY PROCEEDINGS

                In light of the findings of the Taylor Report (copy enclosed) it is
                necessary for consideration to be given as to whether or not Council
                Officers, either within this Department or the other departments who
                supply information to and form part of the Officer Working Group which
                advises Members on the safety of sportsgrounds should be the subject
                of disciplinary proceedings as a result of the circumstances which
                appertained on that unfortunate day.

                Whilst I have given some thought to this topic I have not taken it
                very far in light of first of all the need to deal with the Inquiry
                and not to pre-judge its conclusions and now of course there is the
                second Inquiry on potential criminal liability basis by the Director
                of Public Prosecutions.   However, it seems to me that notwithstanding
                these factors there ought to be general consideration given as to
                whether or not there are any prima facie basis for the commencement
                of disciplinary procedure against any officers of the Authority.

                In light of the close involvement of the Department for which I am
                now responsible in the process I think it is important that someone
                else takes a hard, objective look at the activities to date in order
                to. come to at least a preliminary view as to whether or not such
                proceedings may be warranted and I would therefore be grateful if
                you would consider carrying out this task.      No doubt when you have
                had an opportunity to consider this matter you will wish to discuss
                this communication with me and if you agree to undertake the matter
                to discuss how it is best dealt with under the circumstances.
                                                                          \
                I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

  Dear Hiss Steele
  REs DAILY TRANSCRIPTS
    Thank you for your letter of 4th January. You will I am sure be aware
    ot tne contents of the Coroner’s Records (fees) for copies Rules
    1982 as amended by the Coroner's Records (fees) for copies amendment
    Rules 1990 (SI 1990) No.140 and you will be able to satisfy
, * y w r w U with regard to the provisions.
  Whilst I note what you say with regard to the cost of the transcripts*
  I am sure you will appreciate that the actual expense incurred
  in obtaining the dally transcripts 1s very much higher than
  that.
  You will also be aware that the fees 1n this particular Instance
  are not coming to me but going to the City Council« who of course
  have the burden of paying the shorthand-wrIters and other expenses
  Involved with the production. It 1s my view apart from the
  terms of the Rules that it would be difficult to justify agreeing
  your request.
  I am sanding a copy of your letter, together with my reply to
  them, and of course there 1s no reason why you should not correspond
  directly with Mr Webster, Head of the Admin and Legal Department
  of Sheffield City Council 1f you so wish.
   Yours sincerely

  Dear Dr. Popper,
  RE?    DAXLY TRANSCRIPTS

 • I do not Snow whether you do infact have anydiscretion as to the
   charges currently being made for the provision of daily transcripts -
   at 8Op per sheet - or indeed if you Have whether it would be possible
   to::;#xerc±se. it in favour of our clients.
   As you will appreciate the families whom we represent are of course
   funding their representation privately and have no backing from
   Insurers or any other source.
   Tke daily transcripts are extremely helpful to the legal
   representatives and at tin* end of the day will be a useful record for
   the families themselves. They have asked us to let them have a note
   of interim costs to the date the Inquests were adjourned before
* Christmas and the figures for transcripts docome to a fairly
  -considerable-snm...        - _*• — -— r- •              ........ . - ^
   Whereas they have Imown all along-that this would be a substantial
   item it is clearly going to be more substantial than originally
   thought because of the length of time the Inquests will take, clearly
   extending beyond everyone’s "best guess" at the start of proceedings,
   I can put forward no direct comparison as far as the charge is
   concerned (the transcripts were supplied free of charge, certainly to
   tlie injured and bereaved representatives, at the Public Inquiry).
   The figures allowed for photocopying on taxation of bills- in civil
   natters are 13p per sheet in the County Court and in the Sigh Court,




                                                                     X
where photocopying is not normally allowed as a disbursement in the
particular circumstances where it is the figures allowed are between
Sp and lOp per page dependent upon the number of pages (these figures
are supposed to be the equivalent of commercial rates)*
Whereas we would certainly not expect a charge as low as those
figures if it is possible to adjust the rate currently being charged
that would of course be very much appreciated.
_I._hppe that you^will forgive me for writing- to vou_orLJr.h.
                                                             is-%>oi*yfev   -
All good wishes.

Dear Mr WEBSTER,


HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUEST TRANSCRIPT OF PROGKBDTHGS


Thank you for your letter of 30th November, concerning the Transcripts of the


I have discussed your proposals with the Coroner, and also know that you had a
telephone conversation with him on Tuesday morning, 4th December, 1990.

I write to confirm that the Coroner realises that the fees payable are collected
and retained by Sheffield City Council and he fully accepts that procedure.

The Coroner agrees with your proposal regarding the fee for a photocopy on a
’next day basis’ remaining at 80p a sheet.

In respect of your second proposal, the Coroner would not object to this if the
Legal Representatives of the individuals requesting copies of the Transcripts had
already purchased a copy at the full rate of 80p a sheet.

If you have any requests for copies on the ’next week basis’ and need
confirmation of the validity of the person applying, my Officer at Furnival House
will assist on any question of limitation on who should receive a copy.

Yours sincerely,




J.M. JONES
Deputy Chief Constable

Dear Mr Jones

Hillsborough Disaster Inquest Transcript of Proceedings

Thank you for your letter dated 23 November and I apologise for the delay in
replying to you.

As you say, the cost of the transcript service amounts to about £900 per day,
excluding photocopying costs and all these costs are borne by Sheffield City
Council.

At present, three firms of solicitors have requested transcript copies which
are available on the following day, at a charge of 80 pence per sheet. As I
understand The Coroner’s Records (Fees for Copies) Rules 1982 as amended by
The Coroner’s Records (Fees for Copies)(Amendment) Rules 1990, provide that
the fee payable to the Coroner or other persons for furnishing a photocopy
shall be 80 pence for each photographic sheet. The Coroner hasagreed that
the charges can be collected and retained by Sheffield City Council and
although, as you say, a not insignificant amount is likely to be collected
during these lengthy proceedings, those charges will be set off against the
cost of the transcript service.

The Council too have been approached by individuals requesting a copy of the
transcript and I presume the Coroner has been approached by the same people.

I have given some thought to this matter and would put forward the following
proposal for the Coroner’s consideration, if he is minded to accede to the
request for further copies to be reproduced from one or more of the copies
supplied by Sheffield City Council.

1.    That the fee for a photocopy of a transcript on a ’next day basis’
      remains at 80p per sheet.




                                  Mr Webster   734018
                                              2




       2.    That a second service is offered, in addition.

             A copy of the full transcript for the week, obtained on a ’next week
             basis’ at a charge of £50 (£10 for each day). Such a charge would be
             comparable with general photocopying charges.

       Obviously, in putting forward this proposal I am trying to balance the need to
       mitigate the overall costs of the Inquest itself with the desire of a number
       of people to have a transcript of their own.

       I am also mindful of the limitation on who is able to receive a copy.

       If I can be of further assistance or should you wish to discuss the matter,
       please do not hesitate to contact me.

       Fours sincerely

Dear Sir,

 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUESTS
 TRANSCRIPTS OF PROCEEDINGS

You are aware that, with your approval, the Coroner has employed J L Harpham
Limited to supply transcripts of the daily Inquests proceedings at the Town
Hall. The cost of this transcript service amounts to about £900 per day,
excluding photocopy costs and is borne by Sheffield City Council.

 Each day photocopies are produced by Mr B CREASEY for distribution as follows:-

Her Majesty’s Coroner                                       2   copies
West Midlands Police                                        4   copies
Shorthand Writer                                            1   copy
Davies Arnold Cooper'                                       1   copy (at a charge)
Silverman « Livermore                                       i   copy (at a charge)
Hammond Suddard                                             1   copy (at a charge)

 TOTAL                                                     10 COPIES

Where requests are made by solicitors for transcript copies, a charge of 80 pence
per photocopied sheet is made. In accordance with the Coroner’s Rules the
Coroner is entitled, if he wishes, to keep the proceeds from the sale and supply
of such transcript copies. However, as you know, in this instance, the Coroner
has decided that the charges levied for the supply of copies can be collected and
retained by Sheffield City Council. Given that transcripts are amounting to
something in the order of 100 pages per day, you will have realised that a not
insignificant amount is likely to be collected during these lengthy proceedings.

 At present, as indicated earlier, only three firms of solicitors are purchasing
 transcript copies.                 However, I am aware that a number of persons have requested
 copies but had not realised that they would be costing something in the order of
 £80 per day."

                                                                  Sheffield
     PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT
As a consequence of the requests and the costs involved, an approach has been
made to the Coroner for his permission for further photocopies to be reproduced
from one or more of the copies supplied at a cost through the good offices of
Sheffield City Council.

You will appreciate if the Coroner accedes to the request to further photocopy
supplied transcripts no further revenue will fall to the City Council and indeed
it is possible that the existing proceeds could reduce.

Before the Coroner makes his decision on this matter it would be helpful if you
could give me your view. Given the immediacy of the problem I would appreciate a
written response as soon as possible.



Yours faithfully,

 3    Confirm who is going to be here regularly and arrange for name plates to
      be prepared. Write to let know Mr. Maxwell our representative.

 4    Venue - Council Chamber.
      Whether stay there will depend on numbers.
      Papers will be stored in safe.

 5    The Inquest times will be as follows

      10.00 am - 12.45 pm
      1.45 pm - 4.00 pm

 6    No smoking.

 7    Points of law should either be dealt with there and then and exclude
      jury or raise at 4.00 pm when jury leaves.

 8    Scope - dealt with who, when and where - more extensively than usual
            - how is what we are concentrating on in resumed inquests
            - applies to all 95 people
            - take evidence together as one matter
            - different circumstances in different areas, eg Pen 3/4

     9   This is an Inquest - not a Public Inquiry
                            - do not expect to repeat everything Lord Justice
                               Taylor has done - but there will be some
                               duplication

    10   In contrast to the Inquiry witnesses have a right not to answer
          incriminating questions.

         Witnesses have privileges - Coroner will make sure they have.

    11   Coroner’s   Inquiry has limited objectives and will try to stick to those.

    12   Trying to take bulk of evidence verbally.
         Witnesses may be excused if ill, etc.

    13   Take view cut-off point - arrival of first ambulance on pitch.

         Will look at - Events of day generally.
                      - Outside - inward.
                      - May need to look at previous events, eg traffic
                          conditions.

    14   Anticipate calling evidence from supporters and relatives.    If relative
          doesn’t want to give evidence - will be sympathetic.

         Local residents
         Shop Keepers
         Other independents, eg media
         Club and employees - turnstile operators
                            - stewards
         Police             - some police officers and 1 other person had
                              statement taken under PACE - that statement read.
                              Will hear what is in these statements - as
                              recorded.

         Will not circulate list of witnesses in advance.

    15   Inquisitorial not adversarial.
          Not circulating statements in advance.
          If able - put on notice witnesses for next 1/2/3 days.

    16   Will almost certainly allow witnesses to refresh their memories from
         what was said. Would not expect them to have statements in witness box.

    17   Lord Justice Taylor’s report - not intended to admit report as part of
          evidence.
                     - would cause more problems.
                     - do not intend to use transcripts ofevidence of LJT
                       Inquiry.
                     - will permit to use if relevant
                     - if witness refuses to answer question will notpermit
                       representative to put to the witness what has been said in
                       transcript

                  - going to refer to LJT report - common sense - where do we
                    draw the line
                  - may sometimes use transcript

18   Documents/Exhibits -

     (a) inquest
     (b) jury
     (c) and may want to restrict documents put in as exhibits, eg Green
         Guide - refer to particular section.

19   Submission:-

     Factual matters need rectifying - Coroner if matters put and feel
     justified as legitimate then will consider sympathetically. May not be
     appropriate or relevant.

20   Submission -representative of bereaved- want to extend ambit to   4.00
     pm from 3.15 pm - inquest into nature of medical attentiongiven to
      those in crushing. Absence of adequate medical personnel and equipment
     caused or caused earlier death. Are relevant to how. Attention paid to
      them before they died.

     Coroner:-

           thought about this, not persuaded yet would want to do that.

21   Perhaps there should be a formal meeting   of inquest proper to put legal
     points before the jury is brought in.

22   Submission - representative of bereaved - Not to circulate in advance
     names of witnesses. May want Coroner to call other people. Coroner:-
      asked all solicitors he was aware of to list all of the people they
     wanted to call for him to consider.

     May still ask for someone to be called.
     Will reconsider.

23   Submission

           Lord Justice Taylor’s report should be put before jury or certain
           parts of it.

           Could agree core facts as set out in certain numbered paragraphs
           subject to anyone’s right to object.

           Coroner:- if possible - to agree certain paragraphs - no objection
           to that.

28   Submission - putting part of Taylor report worse than whole.

29   Submission - can we have list of all representatives.

30   Coroner - Undertakings risky.     May require whatever undertakings.

31   Would look at video in full and may use subsequently to deal with
     particular points.

32   Not using reports except if can agree. Transcripts will be used - but
     preserve witnesses right to refuse to answer. Trying to establish
     truth.

     Will have to have a meeting to deal with legal points.

     Will not recall witnesses unless absolutely necessary.

33   Chief Constable - documents submitted - Vol 3 to be dipped into.

     Can we agree 3 bundles can dip into. Like original core bundle.

     inquest.

34   Transcripts - intention to provide next day transcripts

                     DRAFT OF PROPOSED SUMMARY OF AGREED FACTS


The present road network from Liverpool to Sheffield, has a motorway road
system around Manchester, which now provides a complete bypass to the south of
the City which was incomplete on 15 April 1989. At that time the M63 finished
at Portwood roundabout, to the east of Stockport at the junction with the
A560. The final part of the M63 providing the last link to the M67 at Denton
was not opened until 28 April 1989.

The recommended route published in the Liverpool Programme advised supporters
to follow the M62 east out of Liverpool, north of Manchester, across the
Pennines to Junction 42 of the Ml. It was then suggested that they travel
south on the Ml, leaving at Junction 35 for Sheffield. Supporters who followed
that route did not report any great delays.

It is clear that many Liverpool supporters chose to follow the M62 or M56 east
of Liverpool, then joining the M63 to the west or south of Manchester. This
motorway terminated to the east of Stockport and supporters were then required
to follow the A56Q to Mottram in Longdendale, where they could join the A57
over Snake Pass to Sheffield. Supporters who chose this route were the ones,
subjected to long delays. However, some of the accuracy of this evidence has
to be viewed in the context that many people are confused as to their correct
location when they were delayed and also, they were frustrated by the hold-ups
and may have understandably felt the period of the delay to be longer than it
actually was.

M62, WEST OF JUNCTION 15 EASTBQUND CARRIAGEWAY

At 1106 hours a damage only road traffic accident occurred between a motor
cycle and a saloon car. The motorway, which at this point has four lanes, was
reduced by two lanes for only about 15 minutes. No reports of serious delays.

M62 JUNCTION 15 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

Between 0830    and 1345 hours, the three lane motorway at this point was reduced
by one lane,    due to a third lane closure for essential central barrier
renovation.     During the closure, traffic was flowing slowly through the road
works and was   only delayed for a maximum of 10 minutes.

M62 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 21 & 22 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

Contraflow, two lanes in each direction.    Long term work relating to widening
scheme. No serious delays reported.

M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 2 & 3 EASTBOUND CARRIAGEWAY

The three lane motorway at this point was reduced by one lane to direct traffic
into a suitable configuration for approaching contraflow.

M63 BETWEEN JUNCTIONS 3 & 6 BOTH CARRIAGEWAYS

Contraflow, two lanes in eachdirection. Long term work relating to widening
scheme. Long delays reported by supporters and coach drivers.

M63 END OF MOTORWAY PORTWOOD ROUNDABOUT

At that time the motorway terminated at a roundabout, at the junction with the
A560. Heavy congestion reported due to volume of traffic. This delay varies
between a 1/2 hour and 1 hour 10 minutes between 1215 and 1325 hours.
M67 END OF MOTORWAY HOTTRAM IN LONGENDALE

This is a traffic bottleneck caused purely by the combination of a heavy volume
of traffic and the road layout. At this location the motor-way terminated into
a single lane carriageway, close to a crossroads controlled by traffic lights
in a small village centre. The A560, which carried traffic from the M63, joins
the H67 at a rounabout at the terminus of the motorway,just   prior to this
point and this further contributes to the bottleneck.

As far as can be ascertained some 102 coaches containingLiverpool   supporters
travelled to Sheffield on 15 April 1S89.

To evaluate the number of supporter who travelled to the ground in mini buses
and using their private vehicles is difficult, but all available parking within
a radius of approximately 1 1/2 miles from the ground was utilised.

Clearly the greater number of supporters travelled to the ground in this manner
and although traffic volume was heavy on all approach routes, traffic delays
were not a significant factor in the late arrival of fans.

A Map showing various routes from Liverpool to Sheffield and identifying
trouble spots is produced.

RAIL TRANSPORT                ‘

Two British Rail Stations were used for the transport of supporters, the
Midland and Wadsley Bridge. The former was used for both Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest supporters and the latter for Liverpool supporters only. One
special train and three service trains from Liverpool conveyed a total of 825
supporters, 430 to Wadsley Bridge, with service trains from other areas
bringing this to a total of 1,337.

LICENSED PREMISES
Premises selling alcohol in and around the Sheffield area were identified and
sub-divided into full On Licences, that is public houses, and Off licences,
which includes shops and supermarkets. The general opening hours for licensed
premises on this date were for public houses 11 am to 11 pm and off licences 8
am to 11 pm.

193 Public houses were visited in an attempt to identify those frequented by
Liverpool supporters on Saturday, 15 april 1989. These can be graded as
follows;-
10 Public   Houses remained closed on this date.
72 Public   Houses were frequentedby local persons only.
37 Public   Houses reported having less than 20 Liverpool supporters.
51 Public   Houses reported having in excess of 20 Liverpool supporters.
23 Public   Houses reported having in excess of 100 Liverpool supporters.
Seventy-four off licenses were identified as open. These were also visited and
enquiries show that, some of thoses closer to the ground were particularly busy
prior to the kick off. It is not possible to quantify this further.

           POLICE ARRANGEMENTS

           A comparison of the South Yorkshire Police orders for the Cup Semi Finals 1988
           and 1989 has been made.

           This reveals that the 1989 order was basically a repetition of the 1988 order,
           although there was a reduction in manpower in some areas.' Details are as
           follows

The Chief Inspector in charge of Sub Section 2A and an Inspector in charge of
Serials 16, 17, 18 and 19 postfed to the front of Leppings Lane turnstiles
performed the same duties in 1988 and 1989.

An Inspector in charge of Serials 14 and 15, comprising 2 Sergeants and 20
Constables, was posted to the concourse area behind the West Stand, one serial
to the North and one South in Phase 1 (before kick off). There were no
officers specifically posted to the central tunnel during this phase. In Phase
2 (after kick off) Serials 14 and 17 should have taken up a position in the
central tunnel but it appears they were overtaken by events.

Initially there were 5 mounted officers posted to Leppings Lane area. At 1415
hours approximately this was increased by the arrival of a further 8 mounted
officers who had escorted Liverpool fans from Wadsley Bridge Railway Station.
These can be sub-divided into 4 from South Yorkshire Police and 8 from
Merseyside Police and 1 from the Nottinghamshire Constabulary, Between 1440
and 1452 hours this was supplemented by an additional 8 mounted officers, 3
South Yorkshire Police, 3 Merseyside and 2 Nottinghamshire Constabulary, making
a total of 21 in all.                                        ,

              15 lottery ticket sellers and 77 additional catering staff.

              Each section of the Football Ground ha9 stewards allocated. In the area of
              Leppings Lane there were 37 stewards covering the West Stand,- 23 Turnstile

Dear Sirs,

                        Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

 Arising out of the meeting on 30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal
 Centre I have been thinking about the point which was made by some of
 the representatives that it would be a lot easier for you to suggest
.possible witnesses as to facts if you were aware of the names of the
 witnesses whom I was thinking about.

As you know I was inclined not to disclose these but to let you come
up with names which I would then consider. However in the light of
your representations on this point I do see that my decision makes
life very difficult for you and may unneccesarily increase work for
you without any real advantage.

The selection of suitable witnesses is not an easy task and I am still
working on it but I have decided subject to terms and conditions of
this letter to modify my view and to release to you at this stage
a reasonably comprehensive list of possible witnesses as to facts.

This list is released on the following terms and conditions.

1. The list must be treated as provisional. Inclusion of a name
does not mean that I have definitively decided to call a particular
person.

3. Conversely I retain the right to select others not on the list.

4. It must be clearly understood that we are dealing with a coronal
enquiry and that this is of an inquistorial and not adversarial
nature. It follows that the decision of who to call is matter entirely
for me and that the circulation of names does not in any way alter
my powers in this regard nor is it intended to give you rights or
powers which you would otherwise not have.

 5. If upon examination of the list there are persons who you are
 particular keen that I should call please specify these so that
 I can consider your wishes (without prejudice to my rights) in any
 reassessment of the list.
6 . If upon perusal of the list you feel that there is some one or more
persons who should be included as a possible witness as to facts
please let me know as soon as possible.

7 . 1 reserve the right to make amendments or modifications to the
terms and conditions set out.

I hope that my decision will be of help to you. Please note that the
list is in alphabetical order and not in the order in which witnesses
will be considered or called.

Whilst writing to you there are a few additional matters I might as
well deal with.

A. If you have not already done so please let me have the name of
Counsel or solicitor who is likely to be representing your firm.

B. As proposed and agreed I enclose a list of the names of the
various firms who were present at the meeting on 30th Oct. 1990
showing their references, telephone and fax numbers which I hope are
correct and hopefully will be of assistance to you.

C. Please let me ,
                 ■know your wishes regarding transcripts of the
resumed inquests comencing on 19th Nov.1990. The current charge is 80p
per page. Cheques should be made payable to Sheffield City Council.

D. For your assistance I enclose a copy of the transcript of the
meeting on 30th October.

                         Hillsborough Inquest : For Information
      o
                         Dear Councillor,

                         I am writing to inform you that consequent upon the decision to hold
                         the Hillsborough Inquest in the Town Hall the user of the allocated
                         rooms has been agreed with the Coroner as follows.

                         1.   The Council Chamber is to be used as the Court Room with the
                              Gallery being used by the press. The Council Chamber will be
                              available for scheduled Council Meetings on 3t.10.90, 28.11.90,
                              9.1.91.                                                                                               If

                         2.   The Ante-Room is to be used as the Jury Room.

                              In this connection, in view of the necessity to keep the
                              isolated, it is proposed that the male Councillor's toilets
                              adjoining this room be made unisex for the duration of the
                              inquest and be available only to the Jury. The toilets att the
                              entrance to the Library will continue to be available to
                              Councillors and hopefully they will prove to be adequate.
                              Alternative means of storage provision for Councillors unable to
                              use their lockers by this proposal is being investigated and I
                              hope to be able to come back to those affected Councillors
                              shortly with further information.

                         3.   Committee Room 4 is to be used by the Coroner as his office,
                              retiring room and document storage centre.

                         4.   The Mandela Room will have facilities provided to enable the
                              Court proceedings to be observed and is to be used by those
                              members of the general public who are unable to find seats in the
                              main Court Room. The press will operate from a cordoned off area
                              of this room.

                              The Reception Room is to be used by the families attending                           the
                              Inquest, partly as a rest area and partly as a place where                           they
                              may hold discussions with their advisers. To this end the                            room
                              will be informally and loosely divided by means of screens                           into a
                              number of enclosures to facilitate the above.

    Please address all                                                                                                 L10ABE

6   .   A number of other small offices will also be made available for
        stenographers, coroner’s support staff and the police.

It has been agreed with the Coroner that the Council Chamber will be
available for the monthly Council meetings during the currency of the
Inquest.

It is anticipated that the Inquest will commence on Friday 16th
November and will continue, with an adjournment over Christmas, into
the New Year. It will of course be necessary for the facilities being
provided to be erected or otherwise put in place and tested prior to
the Court sitting and to this end Council and other business in the
rooms mentioned above will cease with effect from Monday 12th
November.

I shall write to you again should there be any substantial departures
from the above proposals prior to and during the Inquest itself.

Please do not hesitate to contact Mr. Smedley on extension 4557 if
there is any aspect of the above which you feel requires further
clarification.

lours faithfully,

 Dear Sir

                               Hillsborough Inquests

 I am actively considering the names of the people who I may wish to
 attend to give evidence at the resumed Inquests which are scheduled to
 commence on the 19th November 1990 and to continue thereafter until
 about 20th December 1990. If the hearings are not completed by then
 there will be a break for Christmas and New Year and I am planning to
 resume on about 7th January 1991.

 It is my normal practice not to issue subpoenas or summonses to
 witness who I wish to attend at Inquests as I find that most, people
 are perfectly willing to come to Inquests by invitation.

 You will appreciate that with Inquests of the size and     complexity
 associated with the Hillsborough Disaster it is very important that
 the attendance of witnesses should go as smoothly as it is possible to
 arrange. I therefore would like to have your confirmation that if I
 were to request you to attend as a witness you will in     factdoso
 without a subpoena or summons being served upon you.

 When replying, would you please also let me have certain other
 information which I have set out on the attached pro-forma. Please
 return this immediately to my coroner's officer (listing) in the
 envelope provided.

 If you have any questions regarding this matter please contact my
 coroner’s officer (listing):

    Det. Sgt. M.J. Tredgold, c/o West Midland Police,
    Hillsborough Inquiry, Nechells Police Station, Birmingham B7 5DA.

 His telephone number is 021 359 3820. Please do not phone him unless
 it is really absolutely necessary.

 You will of course be contacted again with further details if< your
 attendance is going to be required.


 Youy# faj/hfully.

                        THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST


At about 9.50 a.m. on Friday 19th October, P.C. Brown of West Midlands
Police (021 359 3820) spoke to me about giving evidence after the
Hillsborough Inquest.

He indicated that I was one of 325 witnesses which the Coroner had given
preliminary indication that he may wish to call.  There is apparently no
clear idea of whether or not I will be called or when that event may
occur.  The inquest is commencing on 19th November and will break for
Christmas on 20th December, starting again on 7th January if there is
cause.

P.C. Brown will send a preliminary notification letter to me care of the
department confirming the information he had already given.

I indicated to P.C. Brown that I was not happy about giving evidence.

The Department may like to give consideration to this issue; specifically
it might wish to consider a substitute witness to give evidence on behalf
of the Council.

 21 Power of coroner to s u m m o n medical witnesses and to direct
 performance of post-mortem examination
     (1) Where it appears to the coroner that the deceased was attended at his death or
 during his last illness by any legally qualified medical practitioner, the coroner may
sffliHinon such practitioner as a witness ; but if it appears to the coroner that the deceased
 person was not attended at his death or during his last illness by any legally qualified
 medical practitioner, the coroner may summon any legally qualified medical practitioner
 who is at the time in actual practice in or near the place where the death happened, and
 any such medical witness as is summoned in pursuance of this section, may be asked to
 give evidence as to how, in his opinion, the deceased came to his death.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUESTS

I attended the Inquest on the morning of the 19th April, 1990 to establish
whether or not regular attendance was necessary.

The form of the Inquest is as follows

1.      The Coroner ascertains whether or not the parents or family are there.

       The Coroner then gives brief details of the original Inquest information
       and the alcohol level found in the blood.

2.      The Pathologist is then called to give the cause of death and brief
       evidence.

3.      The Reporting Officer, generally an officer from West Midlands Police,
       is then called to go through the summary prepared by West Midlands
       Police which basically consists of the movement of the deceased
       throughout the day and what sort of ticket theyhad and the nature of
       that ticket, ie torn or whole.

4.      The Reporting Officer from West Midlands Police then gave evidence as to
       the visual information available, ie when and where individualshad been
       identified on video or photographic evidence.


NB     After each Inquest the Court   rises for a short break of five minutes.

       It is anticipated that theywill complete 8 Inquests per day in this
       abbreviated format.

Note   In the circumstances, there seems little point in attending all the
        Inquests as the information available is generally personal information
        relating to the deceased, the nature of the death and the movements of
        the deceased on entering the ground and being removed to the temporary
       mortuary.

      a)   Mr. Frazer (solicitor), representing the Hillsborough Solicitors
            Group Steering Committee.   This St^|^n^Con^ni^:ee represents
            firms which have been instructed by the^ injured or bereaved.   The
            Committee comprises six solicitors and represents upwards of 50
            firms.

      b)   Shaun Smith (Counsel) representing Dr. Alex Forrest (Pathologist)
            Blood Tests.

      c)   Mr. Callahan (Solicitor) Dibb Lupton Broomhead - representing
            Trent Regional Health Authority and the South Yorkshire
            Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

      d)   Mr. Gregory (Keeble Hawson’s) representing Sheffield City Council.

      e)   S. K. Chamberlain representing Eastwood and Partners.

      f)   (Unable to hear name) Counsel (Ross and James) representing the
            Police Federation of England and Wales.

      g)   Paul Isaacs (Counsel) representing Chief Superintendent
            Duckenfield.

      h)   B. Northcliffe representing Chief Constable, South Yorkshire
            Police.

      i)   S. Catchpole and Mr. Jackson representing Sheffield Wednesday
            Football Club.
The Coroner asked if legal representatives were not to attend for the
full hearing would they inform him when they were not to be present.

The Coroner then detailed the arrangement to swear in eight officers of
South Yorkshire Police who will present case summaries - the eight
officers were sworn in together.

The Coroner then pointed out that when the Pathologist comes to give
evidence again all will be sworn in together.

The Coroner then addressed the Hearing and in particular the Jury.   He
gave a background to the function of the Coroner’s Court and pointed out
that it was a Court of record.

He pointed out that the objectives of the Coroner’s Court are detailed
in the Coroner’s Act 1988 and the Coroner’s Rules 1984.   In particular
he made reference to Rule 36.

36 (1) The Coroner’s Court is there to find out who died; how; when;
where did death occur; and deal with the particulars required by the
Registration Act.

36 (2) The Coroner then pointed out that neither the Coroner or Jury may
express any opinion on any other matter.

The Coroner pointed out that the question of "how" would not be dealt
with at this time.   He gave the reason that the DPP investigation is
still ongoing and nothing that would be detrimental to the DPP Inquiry
should be considered at this time.

a)   The Coroner then pointed out that no South Yorkshire Police
      Officers were to be called.   Evidence was to be summarised and
      will be presented by eight officers (police officers).   The
      Coroner pointed out that these officers were not at the Stadium on
      the day but they were simply recounting the evidence before the
      Court.

b)   Post mortem evidence will be given.

c)   Registration particulars will be dealt with.

d)   Visual evidence - this will be by use of plans and notphotos     or
      videos.   The reason for this was the vast amount of photographic
      and video evidence available.    The Coroner felt that it would
      serve no purpose for the Jury to try to consider all this
      evidence.    He had therefore taken the decision to use plans - he
      pointed out that when a plan was used a copy ofthe plan would be
      bound into the transcripts.

e)   The Coroner then pointed out that today and tomorrow the Hearing
      would take place in the Memorial Hall and on Friday and for the
      rest of the Hearing the proceedings would take place at the Medico
      Legal Centre.   He again pointed out that it was not his intention
      to call police, stewards, club officials etc.

11.   The Hearing Schedule.

      Proposals to start at 9.30 a.m. and take 8 inquests per day.   Lunch
      would be at 1.00 p.m. to 2.00 p.m. and the Hearing should finish daily
      between 4.30 and 5.00 p.m.   The Hearing in total should take
      approximately 14 days, but the Coroner pointed out that he would in no
      way rush evidence and if further time was required, then so be it.

12.   Outline of what happened.

      1.    The Coroner then made references to various gates, these were
            shown to the jurors on a plan which was pinned to the wall.

            i)     Outer perimeter gates.
            ii)    Second gates (turnstiles).
            iii)   Gate C.
            iv)    Internal perimeter gates.
            v)     Fences on terracing and fence gates.
            vi)    The Coroner pointed out the difference between terracing and
                   stands and also pointed to the dividing fences on the
                   terracing which split the terracing into pens.

      2.    The Coroner pointed out that Gate C had been opened at three
            relevant times on the day:

            a)     14.48 opened to let someone out, at this time a small amount
                   of people entered through that gate;

            b)     14.52 opened for five minutes approximately (closed 14.57) a
                   large amount of people entered through the gate at this
                   time;

            c)     14.59 (kick-off took place at 14.49:30);

            d)     15.03 (this time will be referred to in theevidence   and it
                   is when Peter Beardsley hit the bar);

            e)     15.05:36 game stopped;

            f)     St. John’s Ambulance on the field;   I'S'lf?.

            g)     The Coroner pointed out       where the gymnasium was located
                    in the Stadium as this had been used as the temporary
                   mortuary.

13.   The Coroner then asked the legal representatives if they had any
      queries.

      a)    Mr. Frazer (the Hillsborough Solicitors’ Steering Committee) asked
            about the video camera which was filming proceedings and also
            asked about the post mortem reports, would a pathologist be
            present.
                                     - 4 -



           The Coroner pointed out that a film record was being made of the
           proceedings.   This was for internal use but also the proceedings
           were being filmed and passed through to a press area.    This was
           happening simply because of the lack of space.

            The Coroner pointed out that a pathologist would be present but he
            intended to extract from their reports the cause of death and
            their justification.   Mr. Frazer pointed out that during the
            proceedings he may like to ask questions about the Pathologist’s
            report.   The Coroner raised no objection to this.

14.   A further question was asked about the circulation of case summaries,
      but it was pointed out to the Coroner that not all the legal
      representatives would be present for each day of the Hearing and it
      would be greatly advantageous to have a case summary so that they could
      attend on appropriate days.   The Coroner pointed out that this could be
      attended to with a degree of co-operation with the legal
      representatives.

      The Hearing was adjourned at approximately 12.30 p.m. for a five minute
      recess.

Q. Than the safe c a p a c i t y of the terrace? - A. That's
   correct, sir.

0.    Mow go on, I i n t e r r u p t e d you.    Wnat about league
     matches? - A. I a p p r e c i a t e you     don't mean it to be, sir,
     but it is a very wid e ranging sort of a question.               If a
     club from the s o u t h - w e s t peninsular, P l y m o u t h or
     Portsmouth, or from that area, was attending at a league
     n ight match, it is q uite possible that they would bring
     50, 100, 200 supporters.               The tactic to be adopted w i t h
     that is that we would not give them access to all the
     pens at the Leppings Lana end.

0.   Why not? - A. B e c a u s e they are easier to cont r o l on
     grou nds of public o rder and safety in that parti c u l a r
     location.

Q, T h a t is the point I w ould like you to help the jury
   about.      What is the p u r p o s e of having these separate
   pens across this terrace?            What is the purpose of it in
   the first place? - A. I didn't c o n s t r u c t them and I
   wasn't involved in the design of them, but presumably it
   is to ensure the saf e t y of the spectators.

0.   In what respect, safety?          - A.   In that it      is   to stop
     lateral movement.

Q. Lateral movement?    W h a t is wrong w i t h that? - A. You
   will have to addr ess that q u e stion to an expert on
   football ground construction.

0.    On the occasion when league matches were                  b e i n g played and
     people were being d i r e c t e d to p a r t i c u l a r    pens, were they
     d i v i d e d up into c a t e g o r i e s in any way b e t w e e n the
     d i fferent pens? - A. C a t e g o r i e s . . . ? •

Q. Of supporter? - A. N o r m a l l y the tickets that would be
   sold at that end if they were for away supporters, they
   w ould be e xclusively for away s upporters if it was a
   ticket match.     If it was a league m a t c h then it would be
   segregated for the v i s i t i n g or away fans to use.

0. What do you mean s egregated?      Explain what it means. -
   A. Well, the away fans w o u l d not be p e r m i t t e d access to
   those areas of the ground w here the home fans were.

Q. How does that w o r k then w i t h the d i f f e r e n t sections of
   that terrace, the d i f f e r e n t pens in that terrace? -       A. In
   relation to that terrace that w o u l d p resumably be...

0.   I am sorry, don't presume.          You are very experienced
     as you told the jury, about g o i n g to these football
     matches, what actu ally was don e in the segregation? - A.
     If you give me a set of c i r c u m s t a n c e s of how many fans
                                                                            65




                                                               R. W. G R E A S E R


         are a nticipated to arrive, from where, at what sort of
         match, I will be specific, but if we are talking in the
         gener a l i t y of league matches, league matches range at
B        H i l l s b o r o u g h from, as at the moment, the average gate
         m ust be 23,000 people.             There are some league matches
         that will attract c l o s e to the capacity.          There hav e
         been some crowds of perhaps 15,000.

    Q. H o w are the pens used for tbe segregation, that is all I
       want to know? - A. T h e y would be used e xclusively for
       visiting fans.            If the number of fans could be
       acc o m m o d a t e d in one pen they would be directed to that
       pen.

    0. On e last separate topic.          The expre s s i o n "full", when a
       pen is full, has c o m e into your evidence and I w ould like
       to ask you a q u e s t i o n about that.     You said at one point
       you would go to a side stand and look at the pens to
       judge if they were full? - A. I might have said               that.   I
       would certainly go          to the West Stand and look down on the
       fans.
D
    (). That is what you said, I beg your pardon.           Now wiiat I
        want to know is this:      what was your means of judging how
        it was full? - A. Tiiere are no c o u n t i n g mechanisms, as
        you will appreciate, into each pen.           It is dif f i c u l t to
        describe, it is an intangible.          It is experience of when
        the ground is at a c a p a c i t y of 50,000/52,000, then that
        is the number of fans that occupy that pen.

    Q.   Some witnesses hav e g i v e n evidence, e xperienced football
         supporters, that they were in the central pens at about
         three o'clock, that is, before the d i s a s t e r occurred, or
         while it was in fact occurring, and they thought the
         s it u a t i o n was normal?   - A. At that time I could not
         observe the p e n s .        I was outside the g r o u n d . So it may
         or may not have been normal, sir.

    0.   Are you saying that this judgment of when a pen is full
         depends just entirely on the visual i mpression of trie
         person who is a c t ually looking at -the pen, the impression
         it makes on him? - A. Yes.      T h e r e are no mechanical
         counting devices so it has got to be on visual evidence,
         bv
          j lookingo at it.

    0. T hat will depend to a certain extent on who it is that is
       looking at it at any p a r t i c u l a r time, I suppose? What
       might look full to one person would not look full to
       another? - A. I can't say I have known this situation,
       but if - particularly if I was an Ins p e c t o r responsible
       for the Leppings Lane terraces - if I had radioed a
       m e s s a g e to the cont rol room and said, "This pen is full,*1
       t h e n . ..
                                                                 R.   W.   C REASER



0. T hat would be a m a t t e r of your impression if you happe n
   to be the Inspector at that time? - A. That's right.           If
   I could continue.

0. Well, I only want you to help the jury about the mean i n g
   of the word "full", w h a tever it is.    The last question I
   want to ask you is about     stewards on terraces.    You have
   told the jury there were      no stewards posted on the
   terraces.   Were there any policeman posted on that
   Leppings Lane terrace? - A. No, sir.

Q. Why was it there were neither stewards nor policemen?
   What is the reason for that? - A. Because that was the
   instruction I was given, sir.

Q.   But from your e x p e r i e n c e you can help the court about
     this.   Why is it that in fact nobody is put on the
     terrace? - A. Because, and I don't want to o v e r - e m p h a s i s e
     this, but there are certain elements of people who watch
     football matches, and I would stress they are in very
     much a minority, but there are certain people who are
     antagonistic towards police officers.            If, for example,
     there was a sole police officer on the terrace he could
     be surrounded by perh aps a g roup of twenty of these
     people and subject to physical assault.

     deal with, but there are others.          We have indeed heard -
     you weren t here, Chief Inspector - from witnesses,
     including one in the West Stand nearby who actually said
     he wanted to get into the centre stand.           It was so
     friendly, there was such an atmosphere in there that he
     wished he could have got into it.          Does that accord with
     your knowledge of fans' desires? - A. The f a n s ' desires
     on this occasion or in general?

0.   In general. - A. I think I have said there is a
     pref erence - it is not exclusive - but there is a
     preference of many football supporters to have a view
     behind the goals.

O.   If we took an ex t r e m e l y cautious view, and if it were
     w i t h i n your power and you decided to close off the
     central pens when they were, say, 80% full, is there a
     possibility that o t h e r fans in other pens might think
     they would likely get in there?               I know it is all
     hypothetical, but we have had a lot of h y p o t hetical
     questions.        What would you expect fans around to do if
     tney could see there was room s till in the cent r a l pens?
     - A . Y e s , it is a hypo t h e t i c a l ques tion.  They may speak

MEETING WITH COUNSEL

Hr. Maxwell Q.C., E. Bashforth, A. Butler, D. Bownes, C. Essam, A. Watt.


Counsel held discussions with regard to Council witnesses giving evidence on
behalf of the Council at the Hillsborough Inquest.

He discussed the present submissions on behalf of the police officers to
exclude police officers from giving oral evidence at the Inquest because of
the risk to the police officers of incriminating themselves during the
course of giving evidence.  In the circumstances it was considered whether
the Council officers could make use of the same argument.

Mr. Maxwell was concerned with the advantages of giving evidence at this
stage as compared to the advantages of seeking exemption.

In the first place he considered whether it was legitimate to make out a
case on the same lines as those representing the police officers that there
was a risk to the Council witnesses of incrimination. He therefore looked
at the risk of potential criminal charges against either or both officers
and the Council.

The risk of anyone preferring the charge was neither high or moderate in his
opinion.  It was in his view eery unlikely but he could not guarantee that
it would not happen.

The reasons for it being unlikely he believed was the basic lack of criminal
blameworthiness on the part of the Council or its officers.

He considered the charge of corporate manslaughter.

There must be a breach of duty of care so as to cause an obvious and serious
risk.

1.   Duty of care must owed - this is not disputed.

2. It must be obvious. - There must be an       obvious and serious riskthatthe
removal of barrier 144 would cause the death/grievious bodily harm of 95
people in the crowd.

Reasonably foreseeable -

The prosecution is likely to fall from the legal point of view on the
evidence to show that there was an obvious risk. Mr. Maxwell went on to say
that that must be right in fact as well as law.  Therefore it would be
rather more difficult to argue a case for exemption because the witnesses
are unlikely   tobe criminally charged.

There has to   be a case for showing that a witness may incriminatehimself
for criminal proceedings not simply internal proceedings.    This is
insufficient.

The risks ofseeking an exemption.

1. That peoplewill look for blame where    itprobably   does notexist      i.e. it
would attract attention.

2.   It may not be possible to argue the case.
If however, the exemption is granted to the police and not to other
witnesses then it puts a higher profile on those putting themselves up to
give evidence and consequently there is a risk.

Mr. Maxwell conceded that Council officers rights may at this^goint not
coincide and independent legal advice may be necessary this/fee judged in
better light once the verdict by the Coroner has been given so far as the
police are concerned.

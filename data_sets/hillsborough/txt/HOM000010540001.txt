POLICE DEPARTMENT EVIDENCE TO THE TAYLOR INQUIRY

1. Thank you for your note of 17 May asking for my comments on
police powers in respect of ticket touts.

2. As the general point, your draft seems to imply that club
officials have similar powers to those of the police in arresting
touts, whereas of course they may only eject them from grounds.
The police may arrest people without a warrant for      obstruction
(Section 25 (3)(d)(v)   of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act
1984) or to prevent a breach of the peace (I think      that thereis
a common law power of arrest here, but the general      arrest
conditions contained in Section 25 (3) of PACE give them a
specific power of arrest when there are reasonable grounds to
believe that it is^necessar^to prevent the suspect from causing
or suffering physical injury or loss of or damage to property).
They may also stop and search people upon reasonable suspicion of
their having stolen property or forged tickets and if necessary
they may arrest them, also without warrant.    Stop and search
powers are contained in Section 1 of PACE and Section 24 provides
a power of arrest without warrant for offences for which an adult
may be sentenced to 5 years or more imprisonment, which of course
covers offences under the Theft Act.

                  will say as follows


1.   I was b o m on the 22nd October 1951.



2.   Ijoined Symas in July 1986, where I started on Dedicated

     Day Transport, based at Doncaster.   This was partime work
                                               f
     and involved me working 30 hours per week. When I was made
     up to an ambulance man, I was transferred to Thorne for a

     short period,      although I was then transferred back to
     Doncaster.



3.   My   training has involved taking a two week induction course

     at     Rotherham, and then when I became, an ambulance man I

     attended an up date course covering oxygen therapy and

     general ambulance aid.    I have no paramedic training.       I was
     on duty on Saturday 15th April 1989, when my shift was 09.00

     hours to 1730 hours.     My call sign for the day was Delta

     801.     Prior to becoming involved with the Hillsborough

     incident,    my day had been       fairly routine.    I was     at

     Doncaster station when I became aware of the incident at

     approximately 1510/1515 hours.      Leading Ambulance man I
     answered a call from control, and                then requested

     both day crews to proceed directly to Hillsborough for a
     major incident.



4.   My colleague      for the day was                    , who is a
     qualified ambulance man.                  initially drove      the
vehicle whilst I was attendant.         I radioed control and
informed them that we were mobile, using channel 4 from our

location.     I was advised by control to go to the Leppings

Lane end of the Hillsborough ground, and they confirmed that

there had been major       incident.     Whist   travelling to

Hillsborough the vehicle radio was left on at all times

which enabled us to hear all information that was being

passed out by control to fellow crews.               nor myself

knew the location of Leppings Lane, but as we approached

Northern General hospital,    we did see another ambulance

vehicle with a police escort in front.        We presumed that
they were travelling to Leppings Lane, and           ^ therefore
followed that vehicle.



As we were driving down Herries Road south from Northern
General     hospital,   I recall   seeing   large   numbers   of

supporters     coming out of the ground      in the opposite

direction to ourselves.    A large number of these supporters

appeared to be in shock and were very dazed.             had to

slow down our vehicle to gain access through the crowds.       I

believe the ambulance we had followed pulled up just inside

the perimeter of the ground and we pulled up immediately

behind.   A police officer then came over to our vehicle, and

pointed out to            and I that a number of casualties

were laid up against a fence, which I believed to be marked

on the attached plan with a red line.    It was very difficult
to see these casualties at first because of the huge number
of people milling about.



            and I got out of our ambulance,     and Immediately

opened up the rear doors and took out one cot.        We followed

a police officer to the first casualty who was laid down
complaining of pains in the chest.      This casualty appeared

to have crush injuries.     I helped load the casualty onto the

cot and back onto the ambulance.     There appeared to be a lot

of confusion because a number of fatalities were mixed up

with injured supporters.             and I took off the second

cot   and    proceeded   over   to another   casualty who was

complaining that he could not feel anything from below his

waist.      I helped load this casualty on to the cot and then
back into the ambulance.                 carried out a quick
examination of this casualty.



I then became driver whilst            got into the back of the
ambulance with the two casualties.     I followed an ambulance

in front around the football ground and onto Penistone Road,

and then turned right onto Herries           Road   south.   The

ambulance which I followed had a police escort.        I arrived
at Northern General within a few minutes and drove straight

to the casualty department.        I jumped out of the drivers

seat and helped             off load one of the casualties,

whereupon a hospital consultant informed                and I to

take the casualties straight to ward 60 which we did.        When
we arrived back at the ambulance, the second casualty on
board had already been taken off into casualty, and one of

the hospital porters returned the cot.



We then radioed control to inform them that we were clear

from Northern General hospital, and were requested to return

immediately to Hillsborough.     I drove to the Leppings Lane

end, and when I arrived, I contacted control again.    We were
then re directed to the gymnasium within the ground, and I

drove to that location via the perimeter road inside the

ground,    then onto Penistone Road, where there appeared to
not be as many crowds as before.



When I drove on to Penistone Road I was stopped by one of my

fellow officers who told me to park as close as possible to

a police vehicle, which was a little further along Penistone

Road.     However, before we had moved on, a police sergeant
then told me to reverse into the ground.       I informed the

police sergeant that he should speak with my fellow officer,

which he did, and then my officer confirmed that I should

reverse into the ground.     I believe I entered the point at

point A marked on the attached plan.            and I got out
of the ambulance and opened up the rear doors.     As we were
taking the first cot out of the vehicle, Mr David Jones

approached us and told us to take one cot each.       I took a

cot and followed an ambulance man,       who I believe was a
paramedic, into the gymnasium and up to a patient with a

suspected ruptured spleen.    This patient was on an I.V. was
       loaded on to the cot, and with the help of the paramedic,

       the casualty was loaded into the back of our ambulance.         At
       this stage            had not arrived back at the ambulance.
       The casualty that I had helped load into the ambulance was
       accompanied by his brother,      who was actually holding the

       I.V.   drip,   and the brother got     into     the   back of the
       ambulance with the casualty.                then arrived back with
       another casualty who was on an I.V. drip, and I helped load

       this casualty into the vehicle.                   remained in the

       back of the ambulance whilst I drove the vehicle immediately
       out of the ground, on to Penistone Road, and was directed
       onto Herries Road south.    I had a police escort which took

       me   straight up to the casualty department at Northern

       General hospital.    When we arrived, hospital porters were
       already waiting with trollies,       and both casualties were
       immediately transferred on to the trollies and then taken

       into casualty with medical teams in assistance.


10 .            an I re-equipped our vehicle with cots and blankets,

       and radioed control to inform them that we were clear at

       Northern General.      Control requested us to standby at

       Northern General    hospital,    and   so    I just   pulled our

       ambulance a few yards away from the casualty entrance.          I
       would say we waited at this point for approximately half an

       hour, at which point in time control requested us to proceed

       to the Royal Hallamshire hospital in order to transfer some

       patients to King Edward VII hospital in Sheffield.         When I



                                      46b
     arrived at the R.H.H. I drove on to B road, where I joined a
     queue of ambulances in front.            then went to see the

     officer in charge, Margaret Woolley.    When         came back

     he told me that we were to collect two stretcher patients

     from ward F2 for transfer to Kind Edward VII hospital.

             and I took one cot each down to ward F2, spoke to the

     sister in charge who identified the patients,        and then
     loaded the patients onto the cots and then back onto our

     ambulance.    I drove straight to the King Edward VII hospital

     whilst Mr Ayre remained in the back of the vehicle with the

     casualties.     When I arrived at the hospital, I was advised

     by the hospital porter of which ward to take the casualties

     to.     After off loading the patients and transferring both
     into the appropriate ward, we radioed control to advise them

     that we were clear.     We were requested to return to base,

     and so            then drove the ambulance back to Doncaster,
     and arrived back at approximately 1925 hours,            and I
     cleared up the vehicle, packed away our equipment and signed

     off duty at approximately 1930 hours.

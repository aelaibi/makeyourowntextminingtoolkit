             I am             , I live at                                  Sheffield.
                          /
             On a part-time basis I am employed by Sheffield Wednesday Football

             Club as a gateman/steward          in the S Stajpm of the stadium.

             I have been employed by Sheffield Wednesday in this capacity for

             approximately seven years          during all first team games.

             During that period I have          become very familiar wijt,h the layout    of the

             stadium,     in particular the S Stand.

             It is Sheffield W e d n e s d a y ’s club policy to o^ovide training for all

             stewards and other employees;          I am fullyyaware of all    club safety

             procedures and refresh ourselves ory rejjflilar intervals, as regards

             evacuation, First Aid.

             On Saturday 15 April        1989 (150489)    I was working at Sheffield
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S1896

         press enclosures    in the S Stand ofy/the stadium .     I arrived at the

         stadium on Saturday at about      11/00 am   (1100) and receivei

          instructions as to my duties^/throughout the game from Mr,

         my supervisor.

          I was posted to gata« F, G, H .     My regular posting,       I was not given

         a radio but throughout the afternoon was regularly seen by
                                                                        y
         my Supervisor.

         From about 11.30 am (1130)      I remained at Gates       G, H.       From that

          position in the stadium I did not have a ^ a ^ w     of the       Leppings Ln

         turnstile entrance     into the ground.

 ^        I would say that prior to      kick-off the S Stand was being occupied by

         Liverpool   supporters as if it were a normal game.        I did not witness

         any alcohol being brought into the ground or consumed in the ground

         and there were no crowd problems.         All the supporters entered the

          ground   in a normal orderly fashion.

         At about g.50 pm (1450)     I entered the stadium and togk up my post in

          the S Stand terrace,    approximately 30 feet to tl-y'right of thePolice

jf. flJiSL control box; from that position I       had a verjf good view of the      Uj

         Stand;    I could see the whole   length of the W Stand.

         The build up to kick-off was normal as far as I cowrl'd tell,            but at

         approxi mately.3.05 pm (1505)     I looked across trfJwards enclosures 3 and

         4 (M Stand) .    At that time, although it ajy^eared f u l l , in my opinion

         there was still    room for a few more f^ls;     the people     already inside

      ( M ^ a p p e a r e d to be watching the game quite comfortably but I could

         see more people entering from the Leppings Ln entrance/tunnel.               Then

         all of a sudden, what I can only describe as a mass of people,

         entering and pushing into the crowd already in enclosures 3 and 4.                  I

          could see people being pushed forward towards

         fence.    People at this time were shouting a
                                                                          PAGE     3
                                                                          S 1896

see a lot of people trying to raise their arms.          I couldn't see the

tunnel entrance now,     it was blocked by a mass of bodies.

Also at this time I saw people trying to climb ov

and bodily being pulled up^into the top half seating section of the

W Stand.

I then saw a large number of Police Officers         rush onto the pitch

towards the enclosures,     in particular where the problems were

occurring, who were joined by St. Johns and other stewards.

I continued to watch;     I heard shouts of “Assist",     "Casualties".     I

made my way down onto the pitch.         It must have been between 3.15

(1515) and 3.30 pm (1530).        I saw a large number of fans being brought

out from the enclosures,       people   climbing over, Police Officers,

other fans helping trapped people out.         The whole of the 10 yard box

was full of people.      I saw bodies on the ground,     people who appeared

unconscious and also bodies with their faces covered.          The whole scene

was horrific.

I assisted people from the pitch into^rfearby ambulances;        they were all

Liverpool   fans,   people who I do jyTC know by name and can only describe

as of mixed generations.           *
I then went to an exit gate adjacent

ensured that it was kept open for us

I remained there for the duration of th§/^emergency,        occasionally

returning to the pitch to direct Am%

stadium at about 6.00 pm (1800).

During the incident I did not witness any of the deaths or physically

assist any of the Liverpool fans from out vy enclosures         1 to 7.      I can

only say that t h e ,Police,   together with jffie other Emergency

Services,   performed their duties profe/sionally and did whatever w a s v

possible.

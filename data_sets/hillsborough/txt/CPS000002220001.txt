                                      DRAFT

Dear Ms Adlington

Thank you for your letter of 1 December 1998 addressed to Miss Sharpling which has
been passed to me for reply. I hope you have received my letter of 1 December 1998.

As mentioned in that letter, I regret the delay in finalising the CPS decision. You will
appreciate that the Crown Prosecution Service has received a lot of material from you
and we have to consider in detail representations from you as well as those from
solicitors for the defendants. The material and representations were received at
various points during the period since the defendants ask that we take over the
conduct of the proceedings. It is true that five months have passed since the request
to take over was made but I should point out that we received some representations as
recently as 9 October 1998 and these had to be considered. I can say, however, that a
decision is imminent. Much of the time has been taken in preparing a detailed
internal report which is currently being considered by senior colleagues. As
mentioned in my letter of 1 December 1998 I anticipate that a decision will be made
and promulgated on or before 18 December 1998.

I note your point regarding the use of Section 23 of the Prosecution of Offences Act
1985. There are cases where the complexity and size of the case is such that the
review process can take a period of months. Bearing in mind that the test we apply in
deciding whether to take over and discontinue a private prosecution is different from
that set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, it was important that a thorough re­
review took place. It was always likely that this tragic and difficult case would take
rather longer than most.

You mention issues of alleged unfairness, the passage of time and the alleged
concealment of relevant evidence. I note what you say and I can assure you that the
CPS decision making process is very much focused on the tests set out by Mr.
Croston in his letter of 27 July 1998.
I do fully understand that many people will be affected by the CPS decision and I
regret the time it is taking to finalise that decision. I can assure you, however, that the
time is being taken to ensure that this decision is the right one. We are not concerned
with defending or distinguishing the early decision not to prosecute and in this regard
I refer again to the letter of 27 July 1998 which sets out the tests we are applying. In
that letter, Mr. Croston also acknowledges that there is a distinction between the test
we are currently applying and the Code for Crown Prosecutors.

I am aware of the date the matter is listed before the court and I am conscious of the
responsibilities of the parties to the court. For this reason, I wrote to the solicitors for
the defendants and also to the court in similar terms to my letter to you of 1 December
 1998. As the Crown Prosecution Service is not currently a party to the proceedings
before the Leeds Magistrates Court, I am unable to do anything other than to give you
an indication of when the CPS decision can be expected.. It is a matter for you and
the defence solicitors as to what representations you make to the court about the
conduct of the case on 7 December 1998.

I apologise for the delay but would like to further assure you that we are doing all we
can to finalise the CPS decision. So far as the decision is concerned, the date of 18
December 1998 has been notified to the court, the parties to the proceedings and also
to all those currently involved in the decision making process.

I hope this letter is helpful.


Yours sincerely,



Christopher H. Enzor
Branch Crown Prosecutor

    London EC4M 7EX

     1“ December 1998

    Dear Miss Sharpling,


    I w n te to confirm the contents o f my telephone call to you o f Friday 27th Novem ber and to
    express the concerns o f the HFSG about the delays in the process o f review by the Crown
    Prosecution Service.

    la^cedw hen a decision might be expected, and you w ere unable to give me a date in view o f the
    complexity ofthe case. There can be no doubt that the case has a complex history, and the HFSG
    has put in detailed representations about ft, but I do wish to question w hether h is appropriate that
    me review process upon which the Crown Prosecution Service has embarked should be extended
    fiirther. Itw aso n j and 2 July that solicitors for the defendants first approached the CPS and
    asked that the case be discontinued. Five months have passed and no decision has been made, and
    none, it appears, is imminent. Two months have passed since our last representations.

    The decision under section 23 o f the Prosecution o f Offences A ct 19S5 as to w hether to
    discontinue is surely one that is intended to ease the burdens on courts, weed out hopeless cases
    and those w ith poor prospects o f conviction, and, where appropriate, to stop cases on public
    m terest factors o f a kind which can be identified am ply. The draughtsman o f the section could
    not have contem plated a review o f the papers lasting five months o r more.

   Y ou know that our prim ary position is that m atters such as alleged unfairness, the causes and
   ettects o t th e passage o f time, and the alleged concealment o f relevant evidence are primarily
   aibjecte which should be dealt with by evidence and submissions in court on an abuse o f process
   application. If there is doubt about these matters in the minds o f theC PS, surely the proper course
   is to leave them to be determined by the courts.

   Y ou will appreciate that a large number o f families are affected by your decision, and wish to
   Know what is going on The impression grow s w ith the increasing and frustrating delay that the
   CPS may be m ore concerned to defend or distinguish its original decision not to prosecute than
   simply to apply its normal criteria.

      Furtherm ore, the case is listed before the Leeds M agistrates Court again next M onday, 7th
      December, and we are conscious that we have responsibilities tow ards that court. Undoubtedly
      the stipendiary magistrate will wish to have information about the progress o f the review so that
      he may know whether to set time aside, and if so how much, for the purposes o f committal. W e
      shall have to take decisions this w eek as to w hether to invite th e court to commence the
      com mittal proceedings regardless o f the review. It is not obvious that the court should await a
      possible decision to discontinue, which could be taken at any stage in the proceedings, rather than
      stait com mittal proceedings in the ordinary course o f events.

      I should be grateful therefore if you could w rite to us so that w e receive a reply before the end
      o f this week, and provide m ore definite information for our own and th e court’s purposes.



      Y ours sincerely,



      Ann Adlington
      Solicitor

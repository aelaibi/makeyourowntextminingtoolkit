            Correspondence Relating To Specific Matches


         further to our discussion, I confirm that I think we
need to evolve a system whereby we can trace back any complaints
or general correspondence we receive relating to specific
football matches.

               type of correspondence could be dealt with by
               myself/ Glen Airton or people in his Department,
              3 or yourself/    I suggest therefore that your
Department be che central store for this correspondence and that
it be kept in Match/Date order so that it is fairly easy to trace
if we receive a communication from somebody referring to specific
.matches.
J
          I regret having to add to your file storing but I think
,ve both agree that it is important that we have a reliable system
of tracing back correspondence relating to specific matches so
chat we can be sure, when asked the question, whether or not we
•have had correspondence relating to a specific match.

         It may be that we will come up with a better system but
in cha short term perhaps we can institute the above,

 Dated                    190589                                                                              Signed




               I am a Police        Inspector with the So ut h Yor kshire Police                  presently

               sta tioned at Ma i n Street Police Station,                   Rotherham.

               On Saturday,        9 April,     1988    (090488)     I was    engaged together wit h my

               unit at the FA Cup Semi-Final                 between N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC and

               Liverpool     FC at H i l l s b o r o u g h football    ground,    Sheffield.

               We were     posit io ned      before    the mat ch at    the junction of Leppings Lane

               and Pen is ton e Road North,            our   primary function being to ma intain

               public order at that            location.

               It did transpire         that    there were      no   public order       problems and our

               unit was     for the most of the time directing                  supporters      to the       corret

               ends   of the ground.           I did not erect any           barriers   or cause to be

               erect ed at the       ju nc ti on of Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North,

               with a view tu filtering               the Liverpool     supporters      through and

               checking to ensure            that they were       in possession-of        t i c k e t s r f o r ;the;

               match.

               The Liverpool        supporters at that           location were allowe d to move freely

               along Le ppings Lane           towards the ground.

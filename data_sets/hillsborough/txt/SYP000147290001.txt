        The    kick-off        could       possibly have       been delayed      considering    the

        fact     that       the organisers          obviously    realised that an excessive

        amount        of alcohol        was    being      consumed   in the   pubs outside     the

        ground-             People    were     d e li be ra te ly arr iving without       tickets

        and    intent on getting               in by any means.          This    is typical

        behaviour           of Liverpool         fans,    from my experience as a groundstaf

        member        for    the    past    15 yrs.

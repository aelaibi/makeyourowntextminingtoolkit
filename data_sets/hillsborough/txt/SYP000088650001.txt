were     p ushed up a g a in st          the s ec ur it y fence and that officers were                               on

the top of the f; i nce                attempting        to pull       fans     from the       crush.           At   this

1.1 became         obvious       that    persons were           injured and           I went     to a

s t e w ar d on the           pitch    to find some        stretchers,           to be informed

that any s tretchers were                     in use.      I then       returned to the area

behind      the        goal an d at      this    time     I saw that a gate to the                    left

of the goal was                now opeiV.        I went    to this        gate       to assist       in

pulling          people       from thm       crush.      Due    to the        gate    being v e r y

                   went     d i re c t l y    behind        the goal.           By this    time a large          number       of

                   Liverpool          fans had jumped onto                  the    playing surface.              These       fans were

              dead and        injured.     These       press men were       not helping      in the    incident

              and were        getting    in the wy of the          rescuers.      This    caused the

             Liverpool         fans   to become        irrate.     I was   then told to go to the h a l f ­

              way    line on the        p i t ch and    form a cordon across          it with other      officers,

              w h ic h   I did until      the terraces were           cleared.

             A fter      the terraces were         cleared       I went w i t h other members         of my serial

              to Penistone Rd to s uperv ise N o t t i n g h a m Forest              fans getting       on buses

             which       conveyed them to the            railway station.

              I later        returned to W o o d se at s Police S t a t i o n and termi na te d duty at

             6.45pm       (1845).

             Wh il st    dealing wit h the         incident       I did not see any fans att ac ki ng

             P olice     or any other        service,      but the Liverpool         fans were very upset at

              the actions        of the     press.       A number     of Liverpool       fans who were       on the

              pitch did attempt           to go down the          pitch to the N o t t i n g h a m   fans,   but

              these were        prevented     from doing so and            returned to the Liverpool

              end.

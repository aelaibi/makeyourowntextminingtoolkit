to try ana use the telephone the woman who was inside the office refuses- access

and said 'you cannot cane in to which I pleaded, * will you please let me in

and she said 'iJQfc.

 adjacent house <iX3r              jji the owner allowed me to use the telephone.
I then returned to the ground where I iret toy brother as prior arranged

m e r e l y a small          part     of the jigsaw.

In very siniplistic                 terras,      the    body       of the      evidence        to date          has    thrown

up two very            general        questions         w h i c h the        police w i t n e s s e s will            be

ex p e c t e d    to answers

1.     Did we        d p ;e v e r y t h i n g we     could to        prevent         the    s i t u a t i o n arising

       outside L e p p i n g s         Lane      turnstiles,           that      did arise         between

       S. 30      <1430)       and 2 . 3 3 p m     < 1433) ?

2.     Did we        react as         quic k l y as we            could      Co the p ro b l e m s       that

       o c c urred      in the        central        pens     s h o r t l y -before kick           off?

We must always               remember         tnat     it    is easy,         in h i n d s i g h t , .to suggest

trial:, we       could have         done more,          or done        things more           quickly           but GIVEN

 d i s a s t e r but, rather, to d i s c o v e r some of the m u l t i p l i c i t y of
 c a uses and m a k e r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s to try to prevent s o m e t h i n g similar
 h a p p e n i n g again.       W h i l s t the oa k p a n e l l e d C h a m b e r and the formal
 line of q u e s t i o n i n g f r o m b a r r i s t e r s gives the a p p e a r a n c e of Crown
 C o u r t j t h e t e n o r of the p r o c e e d i n g s is ver y different.           T here is no
 oath; w i t n e s s e s sit d o w n to give t heir evidence, future w i t n e s s e s
 can si t - i n the C h a m b e r w h i l s t others are g i v i n g evidence; h e a r s a y
 ev i d e n c e a n d o p i n i o n are p e r f e c t l y admissible.

     I n q u i r y is h e a r i n g e v i d e n c e f r o m w i t n e s s e s in c e r t a i n
 categories.        The 'batting order' is as follows:

         Liverpool        supporters

         Local     r e s i d e n t s / s h o p keep e r s

You s h o u l d be a w a r e that the e v i d e n c e to dat e has been almost
e x c l u s i v e l y f rom L i v e r p o o l supporters, some of w h o m have lost
r e l a t i v e s in the di s a s t e r .          It is u n d e r s t a n d a b l e t h e r e f o r e that a
less than c o m p r e h e n s i v e p i c t u r e of events has e m e r g e d in the media.
The n e w s p a p e r s and- t e l e v i s i o n h ave r e p o r t e d i n d i v i d u a l and
s om e t i m e s s e n s a t i o n a l a c c o u n t s , w h i c h do not r e p r e s e n t the whole
e v i d e n c e that has been given, not to m e n t i o n that w h i c h has yet to
be adduced.            Do not be d i s h e a r t e n e d by the r e p o r t s w h i c h are
emerging, t h ey are m e r e l y a small part of the jigsaw.

In v e r y s i m p l i s t i c t e r m s , the b ody of the e v i d e n c e to d ate has
t h r o w n up two v e r y g e n e r a l q u e s t i o n s w h i c h the p o l i c e w i t n e s s e s
will be e x p e c t e d to answer:
        (1)   Did we do e v e r y t h i n g we c o u l d to prev e n t the
              s i t u a t i o n a r i s i n g o u t s i d e Leppings Lane t u r n ­
              stiles, that did ar ise b e t w e e n 2.30 and 2.55pm?

        (2)   Did we r eact as q u i c k l y as we c o u l d to the p r o b ­
              lems that o c c u r r e d in the c e n t r a l pens s h o r t l y
              be f o r e k i c k off?

We m u s t    al ways r e m e m b e r that it is easy, in hindsight, to suggest
that we       c o u l d have don e more, or done things m ore q u i c k l y but G I V E N
A L L THE     C I R C U M S T A N C E S A T T H A T TIME c o u l d we have done more, or
d one it      more quickly?

D u r i n g the last t h r e e weeks e v i d e n c e has been gathered, on behalf
of the C hief Const a b l e , f r o m m e m b e r s of the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e
an d f r o m m e m b e r s of the S p e c i a l C o n s t a b u l a r y - m a n y of you will
h ave a l r e a d y p r o v i d e d statements.          This e v i d e n c e has been d i s t i l l e d
and a re p o r t p r e p a r e d for C o u n s e l r e p r e s e n t i n g the S o u t h Yor k s h i r e
P o l i c e at the Inquiry.             The process of c o l l a t i n g all the e v i dence
has n e c e s s a r i l y been b risk and some i n d i v i d u a l s m a y have h a r b o u r e d
some u n c e r t a i n t i e s a b o u t the p u r p o s e of the inter n a l enquiry, and
m a y n o w feel a li t t l e u n i n f o r m e d about its p r o gress - h e n c e this
update.

The r e p o r t that is w i t h C o u n s e l for the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e Police,
Mr. W i l l i a m W o o d w a r d Q C , pai nts the o v e r a l l p i c t u r e of our p o l i c i n g
the m a t c h at H i l l s b o r o u g h on 15 April 1989.                It c o n tains an o v e r ­
v i e w of the Force; a d e s c r i p t i o n of the Stadium; a r e v i e w of all
the l e g i s l a t i o n c o n c e r n i n g the p o l i c i n g of football; d e t a i l s of
the p l a n n i n g of this p a r t i c u l a r m a t c h an d m a t c h e s in general; an
e x a m i n a t i o n of the q u a l i t y of c o m m u n i c a t i o n s that e x i s t e d on the
da y and, finally; a s u m m a r y of the events that occurred, d rawn
fro m officers' statem e n t s .               It is this pict u r e that we hope to
pres e n t w h e n given the o p p o r t u n i t y to put our case to the Inquiry.

P o l i c e e v i d e n c e wil l be c a l l e d fro m W e d n e s d a y 24 M a y 1989, b e g i n n i n g
w i t h those senior o f f i c e r s r e s p o n s i b l e for p l a n n i n g and c o n t r o l l i n g
the p o l i c i n g oper a t i o n .    Followirig on f r o m that, i n d i v i d u a l officers
w i l l be c a l l e d to give t heir acco u n t of a p a r t i c u l a r part of the
events in w h i c h the y w e r e involved.              Over 1,100 o f f i c e r s p e r f o r m e d
d u t y at H i l l s b o r o u g h ,"it s h o u l d be obvious that o nly a r e l a t i v e
few of that num b e r w i l l be c a l l e d to give e v i d e n c e to the Inquiry.
If you are c a l l e d it does not i mply that you have a n y t h i n g to answer
for and, co nver s e l y , if y o u are not c a l l e d it does not m e a n that
you r effort s are u n r e c o g n i s e d .

S o l i c i t o r s for the Inquiry (who are sort of clerks to the court)
are r e s p o n s i b l e for s i f t i n g t h r o u g h all the e v i d e n c e and c h o o s i n g
t hose w h o m i g h t h ave      s o mething to add to the facts a l r e a d y h e a r d
by the Inquiry.            It is a n t i c i p a t e d that s o m e t h i n g in the o rder
of 50-75 po l i c e o f f i c e r s wil l be c a l l e d so, clearly, not everyone
w il l have the o p p o r t u n i t y to tell his or her story.
At the c o n c l u s i o n of the Inquiry, however, Coun s e l for the S o u t h
Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e can call a d d i t i o n a l w i t n e s s e s if we feel that
the w h o l e s t o r y has not been p r e s e n t e d or that the Inquiry has
been m i s l e d in any way.

A t t a c h e d to this re p o r t is a list of o f f i c e r s who,            for one reason
or another, m a y be p e o p l e that the Inquiry w o u l d w i s h to h e a r from.
That        is not to say that t h e y wil l be called, we sim p l y do not
know, but t h e i r p a r t i c u l a r e v i d e n c e was c o n s i d e r e d us e f u l in p r e p a r i n g
the re p o r t for our Counsel.

Eac h of these o f f i c e r s is e n c o u r a g e d and welcome, to see the p r o ­
gress of the i n t e r n a l e v i d e n c e g a t h e r i n g to date and to get a
f l a v o u r of the P u b l i c Inquiry.

At 9.00 a m each m o r n i n g M o n d a y to Friday 22 - 26 Ma y 1989, there
wil l be a v i d e o shown at the Lect u r e Theatre, First Floor, Force
H e a d q u a r t e r s . The v i d e o is a c o m p i l a t i o n of n u m erous films t aken
by the BBC, the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e P o l i c e and S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y
Football Club.                It lasts for a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 hours and is the
'official' v i d e o of the Inquiry.                         (There are many, m a n y hours of
v i d e o f i l m a v a i l a b l e f r o m d i f f e r e n t sources but this two hours
is thou g h t to r e p r e s e n t the m o s t rele v a n t ) .         A m e m b e r of the internal
e v i d e n c e g a t h e r i n g t e a m wil l be on h a n d to ans w e r any que s t i o n s
yo u might have about the Inquiry, the e v i d e n c e to date or about
any o ther concerns.                  After v i e w i n g the v i d e o t h e r e will als o be
an o p p o r t u n i t y to v i s i t the Town Hall to see the Inquiry in session.

If any o f f i c e r s are s u b s e q u e n t l y ca l l e d w h o do not a p p e a r on the
list attached, t hen t h e y wil l be p r o v i d e d w i t h s i m i l a r o p p o r t u n i t i e s
p r i o r to a t t e n d i n g the Inquiry.        At the m o m e n t we are g i v e n less
than 24 hours notice of the c a l l i n g of witn e s s e s , so o f f i c e r s should
be p r e p a r e d to a t t e n d the Inquiry at that kin d of notice.

Would Divisional /Departmental Commanders please cause an individual
copy of this report to be handed to each of the named officers
by Monday 22 May 1989,and arrange for the bulletin to be brought
to the notice of other members off the force, who were involved at
Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989,at the earliest opportunity.

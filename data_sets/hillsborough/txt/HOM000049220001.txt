I am writing to confirm the details o f your private meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith,
which we discussed over the phone today.

This will be at 11 a.m. on Friday 31 October, at this address. As I said, we are in the main
Home Office building, which is just opposite St Jamesâ€™s Park underground station. Please
ask at reception when you arrive and I will arrange for somebody to bring you up.

You may wish to be accompanied by other people, including your legal representatives.
That is o f course perfectly acceptable, but it would help if you could let me know in advance.

We have arranged for a stenographer to take a verbatim record of your discussion with the
Judge.

We look forward to seeing you next week.

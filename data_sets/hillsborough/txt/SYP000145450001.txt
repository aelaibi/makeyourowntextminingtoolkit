                   QS9.    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE POLICE

                           OFFICERS AT THE           TIME OF THE DISASTER?



                           My only critism is that             1 couldn’t see the reason for the

                           line of Policeman facing the crowd of the North Stand when

                           such incidents were happening on tne pitch.                          S oiti© at least
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                D 1368

                could have been used to help.     The cordon only created tension

                with people trying to get onto the ground to help,,        it created

                verbal flack.    The Police seemed slow in appreciating what

                had happened but when £ got onto the pitch I saw individual

                officers assisting   the injured as were other   people.



     Q30.       HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO HAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OF THE

                MATCH STEWARDS AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



                None

:D
     Q31   ,,   HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF ANY OTHER

                PERSON IN AUTHORITY AT THE TIME OF THE DISASTER?



                Only that it seemed an awful    longtime for an ambulance

                to get to the injured.



     Q32.       WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY THREATS OR VIOLENCE?



                No
I
                DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL ACT

                BY ANY PERSON?




                HAVE YOU SEEN PRESENT A T , OR HAD EXPERIENCE OF ANY OTHER

                F OOTBALL TRAGEDY?   <BRIEFLY EXPLAIN >



                No
                                                                              PAGE     8

    Q35.     IF YOU ATTENDED LAST YEARS SIMILAR MATCH WAS THERE ANYTHING

             SIGN IF ICAiMTLY DIFFERENT WHICH YOU THINK IS A CONTRIBUTORY FACTOR

             TO THIS DISASTER?     (BRIEFLY EXPLAIN)



             There appeared less traffic     last year but apart from that tilings

             appeared much the same «



    <336.    HAVE YOU ANY COMMENT TO MAKE ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF FANS IN THE

             STANDING AREA TO THE FRONT OF THE WEST STAND?

f
             Only in retrospect    I d i d n ’t notice at the time the room at the

             end of the terraces,,



    Q37,     DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS ON THE WAY THIS DISASTER WAS CONTROLLED

             FOLLOWING THE RECOGNITION OF THE INCIDENT HAPPENING?



             Only what I have already said is that the Police and Club

             Authorities seemed slow to react to what was happening.         Also

             no information was    passed out to inform people what was

             happening a no. the first message put over asked people to

             clear the pitch which obviously was       inaccurate and unhelpful,,



    Q38.    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL

            TO THIS JUDICAL   INQUIRY?



            No other that it seems     logical that some filter system should have

            been used to prevent     persons without tickets getting to the

            ground.   A better filter system is needed at big matches,,       A

            system of monitoring     is needed to assess the state of the crowd
                                                                                                          D 1368

                   so that a decision to delay tne game could d s mads to prevent

                   probi eiiis .

                   It seemed that the Police and authorities seemed inexperienced

                   in crowd control and communication between the parties may

                   have   orevented some or all of the problems.

                                                         ;:uh April, 1909


Dear Superintendent Marshall,
My nniw in]                      T. nm from Liverpool. What X wnnt to say in thnt t
tKfink you for savin* acmeU v e a at Hillsborough. I l>«J i«v« If you had not
opened that Rate I do not boliovo there would have boon 9rS people dead, but t
thin*' t-h^r* would hnvo boon PM o r 306 p e o p l e dend.

1 have a nephew in hospital in Intenalve Care. Hia name is
0y opunln/; thono /'aton, what the mod in do not realise, ia that you mode art
narape r o u te . Who*. haa gafc too coma out of thta la that wo have  tso if*np
thin madness now together. How wo do It is we call for an amnostyoff'aU arms
 in the world b s a tribute to Liverpool’ football Club, Ho hunan bain» inrthe
world rshould bo anked to pny the price aa they are asking you to pfcy. The
 price in far too hiflh, By making you redundant or demoted will not tfrinfc bock
'the dead or got the injured better. The lesson that haa to be learned is1that
wo do not believe that the Sheffield Police aald or wrote thoae lias In those
 rshithouse pspara no that la all they arm fit for;
The only thing that cannot be replaced by time, money or effort, ia human
hetiv^rs, Obviously, you are in criala yours*,] f aa T have been. I have not n
lot of
with this problem* I want you to put me on your Christmas card H a t. Vfe have
not to utko t        t      o       atop the violence. One way wo do it ia when
ire report 1t               vwre flfthtin# at AY.field1'hht tho men ware a h a M nr;
hands with each other, drinking with each other and Joking with each other.
As we are both aware, youths think it la manly to i’iRht at football matches,
T.like to think that venture T nm making to you will prove what beinR n m n in
nil about.
The only *weapons' X have come up with from Liverpool are aome photographs of
rr/rolf, family and friendn.  Photo No. 1 In the picture in rty friend who nndly
died 3 years ago, hia son, hia daughter In law and hi* wife. Pictur® Number 2
- that la me taken in 1973                                                Photo
Flo. n‘ In iay father,.

O o i m bacit to tho mcKlin, one of the Ilea waa that an unnamed policeman an id the
h u r t f u l things that, tho nut t o r preaa reported. My answer in that there ia no
auch thing as an unnamed policeman; They all’' have namest Tom, Dick or whatever.
There is only one man 1 know with no name and he is called Clint Eaatwood*
 fn Liverpool T want, the people from Khaffield to Unowt.hat. the people from
 Liverpool do not believe it. I would Ilka you to look at your feelings like a
 puncturo. On Saturday, whatever date it was, as you can see I am la,crisis
•myself and cannot remember. Yon are the puncture. Whatever date if in now J.
 wnnt you to know thnt you look on me aa a puncture repair kit. 'I'hlaVis only a
 start of « friendnhlp atarting now aa from 10 minutes a w .
 vOnrs, nr, a mate,

 P.fl.   7!ie disaster was only nn accident.   With hindsight, t would know n horse
         \r\n going to win 0 race nt 3,00 p.m. nt Aintree.   55o there la no way you
         knew what would happen.    Because your name is not Doris the medium.

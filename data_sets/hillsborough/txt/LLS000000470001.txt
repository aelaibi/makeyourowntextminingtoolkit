2    I was also at the office of Norman Jones of Fanshaw,Porter & Hazlehurst on

21st April 1989 when Malcolm Horrocks gave his statement with regards to the

circumstances of the Hillsborough Disaster on 15th April 1989. With regards to

the circumstances leading up to our going into the ground I agree with what has

already been said and therefore I will not repeat his statement.



3. I had not gone to the match the previous year so therefore I wasn t able to

compare the scene or what it was like with this years semi-final. When we arrived

at the ground, you have to go through a perimeter gate before getting to the

turnstiles, when we arrived having got a bus into town, it was just chaos, there

was no organisation at all in respect of the crowds, there just seemed to be

thousands of people milling around. Nicola Karen Stewart is my girlfriend and

1 had her ticket, obviously I was more concerned than anything else to stay with

her to make sure that she was alright and to give our tickets in together. Having

tone through the outer perimeter gate we then made our way to the turnstiles,

you were just having to move with the crowd to try and jockey forward to get

 towards the turnstiles, it was just a mass of bodies, all I saw were two mounted

 Policemen, one was getting very hariated, 1 don't know whether they had radios

 with them but ] didn't see them. Ke had been waiting for about twenty minutes

 when we got through the turnstile, Nicola was getting rather squashed and it

 was very worrying the conditions. It was worse outside as your whole body was

 moving from side to side and you were trying to shuffle along. There was no attempt

 made to have an orderly queue or control of the crowd, I just got the impression

    that the Police had given up completely in trying to control the crowd, people

 were climbing up onto the wall to try and get out of the crowd, not to get in
but just to get away from the crush, eventually we got through the turnstiles

and I handed both tickets in, the man at the turnstile didn't hand the other

counterfoil back to stop any hastle, we got through   and then obviously waited

for everybody else to get through from our group, we witnessed one lad who was

being asked to pay for his programme as it looked as if he had gone off without

paying for it, a Policeman and a Policewoman was there. Then we saw the gate

opened and a flood of supporters came through the concertina gate, and I just

said to Nicola to get out of the way because it looked as if they kicked the

door in, a then saw a bobby's helmet and saw the door being closed again, Mac

went through as well and he went to the toilet so we eventually whilst Mac was

in the toilet the gate was opened again and another surge of fans came through,

maybe a hundred or so were let in on the second occasion, maybe a couple of hundred

got through. Once we went down the tunnel it had all cleared and we headed into

the crowd, it was probably about ten to or five to three, the teams hadn't gone

onto the pitch at this point, David said make your way over to the right, that

is in the centre terracing, behind the goal at the Lepping Lane End, as he said

it looked alright over there so we started to make our way down to this point

behind the goal. We seemed to lose Mac, Arthur was being pushed to the left and

we managed to get him back, we went down to the front, almost without touching

the ground, we got under the bar and made our way almost to the front, when we

got there, there were people screaming and shouting then, you could feel the

pressure in the ground of the people around you as soon as you got into the crowd.

Then the pressure just got gradually worse, initially you had    little bit of

room around you, the people were screaming and shouting but the Police at the

front were oblivious as to what was going on, the people were shouting for help,

they were being asked to be got out as they couldn't breath, one Policeman did

have a radio to his mouth but he wasn't speaking into it, the Policeman just

looked but he didn't do anything. Eventually when things got really bad and we

thought that we weren't going to get out of this, eventually they did open up

the gate at the front and a couple of supporters got out and then they closed

the gate shut and one Policeman leant on it to close it, one supporter got over

the fence and in fact vas fighting with the Policeman and three other Policeman

jumped on him. People were screaming for help but they didn't seem to be taking
  n»^notice,^t.J:his,-±irne{;i:vjr...\'as,0.K . andD.;-■       could_Sce. ^ -j

Nicola was distressed and her face was going red, the three lads who were next

to us were clearly gone, they were deep purple and their mouths were opened.

They were shouting to the Police there’s people dying here, we can't breath,

we are getting crushed, there were people climbing and standing over our heads

to get out and it was as though the Police were trying to throw them back in

again to keep them from getting onto the pitch, the pressure got worse and worse

and I thought that Nicola had gone because she had gone a very deep red and her

eyes seemed to be glazed and popping out of her head, I remember David shouted

to me is Arthur alright, he looked alright he had his pinkish white colour but

's if he was asleep, I couldn't speak, my mouth was going but I had no air to

be able to speak, I felt like being sick, but I had to gulp to keep it down and

I remember Nicola saying, I'm going to be sick, I don't know how I was able to

talk to her but obviously I must have got the message through that she had to

hold it back, at times I was mouthing the words because I just simply couldn't

get any words out because I was under so much pressure. I just got the impression

of the build up of pressure getting worse and worse and worse, rather than there

being a big push at the end, the pressure was such I have never ever experienced

this bad before. I have never been so scared in my life, it is the most frightening

experience I have ever been through. Our David went through a panic stage, I

went through a panic stage before I calmed down but I actually thought that I

was going to die. I was feeling extremely hot and I could feel myself passing

out as I was crushed, I just kept my head up and was gulping for air just like

a goldfish. I can't say how long this was going on for, but I suppose it must

have been fifteen, twenty minutes or even longer, as the pressure eased, so Arthur

was dropping, as the pressure eased so I fell back, there were people under me

who had dropped and there were people behind me who had dropped onto me. I was

lying on somebody or somebodies but I never went onto the ground, I was virtually

sitting on people, I couldn't get out because my left leg was trapped, I could

move my right leg but I couldn't move my left leg, I remember grabbing at Nicola’s

jumpsuit to try and pull her out, and then a Policeman pulled at me but my leg

was hurting and I was screaming and I said to them, get the people off that were

on me first of all. I would imagine the people that were around me were dead,

they were so still, there was a lot of bodies around me, they were dead on top

    lad and a Policeman dragged me out, I tried to stand up but I fell over. The                                                                       \

    Policeman put me onto his shoulder and I was then, passed over the railings into

    the right hand side section of the Lepping Lane Terracing, I was then carried
                c
    out onto the pitch and I was left. Eventually I managed to get up to find Nicola,

    I can't remember seeing David or him shouting at me to get out, having found Nicola

    I then tried to find the others. We eventually got round to the gymnasium where

    we saw Mac and he came over and told us about Arthur having died. I also went                                                                                             I

    time to recover, I was very upset and in a daze.

  1. I am divorced and live at the above address with my mother                                                                                        As

 2. This statement is made in connection with the Hillsborough disaster on 15 April 1989

     when I sustained injuries whilst m        the ground.     We had gone to water, the semi final

     of the'F.A. Cup for the 88/89 season between Liverpool and Nottingham. Forest.



 3. I had travelled by van to Sheffield with Arthur Horrocks now deceased                               David Golding,

     Keith Golding, Nicola Stewart and                       We had obtained our ti                  ;ets through

     people we knew at the Liverpool Football Club apart from               we all r.eld tickets

     for the Lepping Lane end at Hillsborough,               had a ticket for the siind we actually

     went through the same entrance but           went up the stairs to the- sUr.c.                                  The Lepping

     Lane end was designated for the Liverpool fans.



4. I have been to exactly the same match during the 87/88 season as Liv =r:.ool where again

    playing Nottingham Forest-in the semi final of the F.A. Cup.           Again                       .-.-ere at the

    Lepping Lane end, this end is segregated into 3 ends and we were in                                    Ttiddle section

    last year that is in 19SS as well as this year.



5. We left Bootle between S.45am and 9.00am we gave ourselves plenty :f                                             to get up

    to the game the plan was that we would find somewhere to stop on tr.f                                      up to have

    something to eat and we came across the Pheasant and had lunch there                                  s is a public

    house which is a pub restaurant situated in Orsleybridge that is i;v                                      miles outside

    Sheffield after we had lunch we then went on to the ground, we le:: *                                  .an nearby

    and caught a bus into town the previous year when we had gone up l . '                                         wo had been

    marched to the ground by the police and didn’t want to go throuch                   ■                 -.iin this
We arrived at the ground at about I .i.u/2.ibpm.      as we arrive       — ^.ng down the

str^pt w S a ^ ^ ^ r y ,,,,large    of peopled I:commented scarstically that we had timed' - -■

our arrival well. I presume that the fans that were coming down had all got off the

train together as they were in such large numbers.        So far as the scene outside the

ground was concerned there were no queues, no lines it was utter chaos. Because of

the number of policemen about there was no control of the crowd to keep them m             an

orderly manner there were no stewards outside there or inside the ground.          When we

arrived the crowds were massing outside the turnstiles the layout at Hillsborougn
                                                                     i




is that there is a perimiter railings the gate was opened and people were going through

and there were masses of crowds both outside and inside the perimiter gate.



The difference between last year and this year was last year there was a policeman

every 10 yards from the station and the lines to go through the turnstiles were orderly

and controlled, this year it was noticeable there were nowhere near the number of

policemen at the Lepping Lane end.         My feeling was that the police appeared to be

more interested in protecting property than ensuring the safety of the fans.           We

just went" with the flow of people through the perimiter gate and we were having problem;

in keeping together as a group.         I would think there would be at least 1000 people

outside the perimiter when we arrived we worked our way through the perimiter gate

we headed straight ahead towards the turnstiles we were going through the gates marked

B it was probably at least 20 minutes half an hour before we eventually got through

 the turnstiles.        I shouted out to open the gate because I could see people were being

 squashed by the crowds outside they were trying to get a woman and her child through

 the turnstiles it is always women and children first there was a policeman on a horse

 he was on the edge of the turnstiles but if he had done anything he probably would

 have killed people by tramping over them, by the time we reached the turnstiles we

 could all feel a terrific amount of pressure from the huge crowds that were behind

 us trying to get in, by this time therefore the situation was well out of control.

 When you went forward if you couldn't get through the turnstile and you were pushed

 to one side you would be jammed against the wall or the gate and there would be no

 hope for these people unless the gate was opened as there was tremendous pressure

 from the crowds.         Once I got through the turnstile I was just glad to get in I obviousls

 had been pummelled and squashed in the crowd but I am used to this.           I didn't actually
ys>:£'i4v5k*~~

          get through from our party and then we went through the tunnell to take our place

           in the ground.     When we actually arrived-at the ground there were a lot of people

           already there I saw a gap on the right this is part of the centre section as the Leppir

          Lane end is actually split into 3 sections I walked down the terracing I ended up

          down at the front but on the right by the railings to the next section at this stage

           I was separated from the rest of the group.    We probably arrived at about 2.50 int

           the ground it was before the teams came out onto the pitch as I was standing there

          so I felt an increase in pressure of people pressing around me initially I didn't

           think very much of it and I thought that they would settle down and would all be

          comfortable.      The pressure built up slowly and slowly and then there was suddenly

          extra pressure just like the final turn on a screw it was so bad that I couldn't actual

          move my hands were jammed down my sides I couldn't even pull them out I was still

          holding my ticket in my hand and this was crunched up as I couldn't even let go of

          the ticket.    A little lad in front of me who was aged 9 or 10 started screaming

          obviously he had never__experienced this sort of pressure that we were all going througl

          at the time and I said to him "your alright still breathing stay on your feet'1



 8. There were no policeman inside the standing area there were none in the crowd at all

          and there were no stewards either I was screaming at a policeman who was behind the

          fencing in the ground itself for him to do something as the little boy couldn't take

          anymore the team had come on the pitch by this time and I think it may be they had

         already kicked off the policeman just shrugged and looked didn't speak to me but walkec

          on some boys who were standing on the railing which run the width of the Lepping Lane

         end which divides the section that we were in off from the right hand section

         managed to pull the boy out he was saying help me help me get me out and then he went

         quiet I am not sure but I thought he died and then the lads dragged me out although

          I did say to help others as I did see they were hurt I spread myself out on the entry

          terraces and had a smoke I was out of breath and wanted to calm myself down I

         obviously didn't know what happened to the rest of the group I was with.       It didn't

         go through my mind that I was going to be crushed to death as I have experienced being

         crushed before I was however feeling numb and shocked I was probably in the crowd

         for about 20 minutes before I was pulled out I wasn't terrified because I have been
   through similar experiences before but fortunately the crowd has always eased off

   so that everybody has had sufficient room to stand.



9. When I saw   the crowdpushing back I just saw them carrying people out. There was a

   wall at the front and then 6/7 people in   front obviously I was keeping away from the

   wall as I didn't want to be squashed against it I was using everything to try and

   keep my balance and to give myself some room. People around me were screaming they

   were hysterical I can honestly say I have never heard the screams and noise that were

   going on around me that afternoon.   I automatically assumed if you were standing they

   were alright however when the crowd did push back as I was sitting on the terracing

   after I had been pulled out I saw my brother Arthur being passed over me

   in other words he came over the side railings as I had I saw somebody at his head,

   somebody at his feet and he was being taken on to the pitch and I followed. I obviousl\

   didn't know at the time that he died I just wondered what was up with him in a nutshell

   just dont expect people to die.    One of the policeman started pounding his chest and

   one of the St Johns Ambulance girls gave him the kiss of life and I just laid down

   on my hands and knees screaming at him the policeman said I am sorry I can do no more

   for him and that was it his face was grey and lifeless I asked could I use the phone

   and I was taken round to a first aid centre where the gymnasium was and that is where

   I met Nicola Karen Stewart and Keith Golding.    I asked them both were they alr-Lgh..

   they were both distressed and crying I sat them down and told them about Arthur and

   told them I was going to phone home.    I went out then to look for a phone when I came

   back Nicola and Keith had gone so the police took me to the police station I waited

    there all night I gave the police a statement so far as the rest of the group was

   concerned    because Iwasn't sure whether they were lost in other words it was a lost

    and found   statementeventually we all ::.et up again at the Boys Club which is next

    to the police station I had to wait to identify Arthur's body and the rest of the

    group were eventually taken home.   After I had identified Arthur's body I eventually

    got home at about 4.00am/4.30am on the Sunday morning.

2. I have sat in on the meetingwith Mr    Norman Jones solicitor of Fanshaw Porter &

   Hazlehurst and Malcolm Horrocks when he gave his statement surrounding the circum­

   stances of the disaster at Hillsborough Sheffield on 15 April 89 and I agree with

   the contents.    This statement therefore will deal primarily with what happened at

   the ground and    what happened to me during the course of the        time I was actually in

   the ground and    thereafter.



3. As stated by Malcolm Horrocks we had gone up to Sheffield to see the Liverpool

  Nottingham Forest semi final on 15 April 1989 and when we arrived at the ground havin.

  gone by bus this is the first away game I have ever been to I watch Liverpool playing

  at home but have never been to an away game previously.          When I saw the crowds init­

  ially I wasn't frightened but when we had gone through the outer perimiter and were

  trying to get through the turnstiles then I did start to become frightened. We were

  probably waiting for about 15/20 minutes outside the turnstile to get into the ground

  it was just chaos outside there was no control, queue or line of people I just saw

  two policemen on horseback I couldn’t remember seeing any other policemen about.

  When 1 have been to Liverpool although there have been large crowds there I have

  always found there has been a lot more police to supervise the queueing and keep the

  crowds under control.     I was bruised and shaken by the time I go through the turnstile

  Keith and David were trying to keep me with them because obviously the crowd was push:

  around to try and get through and Keith had my ticket.          I7e eventually got through

  the turnstile one of the supporters put his hands out to let us get through in other

  words he forced the crowd back to allow us to get into the turnstile I heard people

  shouting to open up the gates to let people through without g o in g through the turnsti]

  but nothing had happend 1 dont think 1 was thinking, about that at the time all 1 was
                                                                   didn't want to lose him becai

  the turnstile *we didn’t see any stewards about the boys went to the toilet and then

  when they came back we made our way-down the tunnel they had already opened up the

  gates twice by this time to allow the crowds through.                                      A surger of people came through

  I am talking about the concertina gates which had been pulled open.                                       Hundreds of fans

  came through arid went down the tunnel Keith went to get a programme and then we walked

  down the tunnel by this time the big surge of people who had been let in had gone

  Keith saw the policeman closing the gate again afterwards.                                      Once we reached the terracin

  we started to walk down as we were making our way down through the croud I remember

  thinking to myself I hope it is not going to be like this the whole of the game

 because it was very crowded then.                                       We made our way down the terracing towards the

  front there was just one row of people in front of us and then there was a fence.

 We had almost arrived at the point were we were going to stand before the teams came

  out onto the pitch that would have been about 2.50pm it was when we were standing

  still we started to feel the pressure from the crowd behind building up Keith and

  David were both saying to me dont worry it will ease off in a minute but it didn’t

  the pressure built up, you always get a last minute surge before the kick off and

  then the pressure eases off and then you can stand comfortably, however that didn’t

 happen here the pressure just continued then there was one almighty surge I cant be

 quite sure whether this was brought before or after the game started you couldn't

  see anything of the game or see what was happening it might have been after the game

 had started as I understand that Peter Beardsley hit the cross bar a feu minutes after

 3 o'clock.               I couldn't move at all my hands were pinned to my side I seemed to be

  swaying with the crowd my feet were pinned to one position on the ground I was screaming

 and all around me people were screaming as well because the pressure around was so

 unbearable-I was gasping for air but there was nothing there I wasn't able to expand

 my lungs because of the pressure we were all suffering from the people around I could

  feel myself passing out I actually thought that was it and I was going to blank out

 and Keith and David and Arthur were saying keep your head up dont give up I actually

  felt at this point that I was going to die I had never experienced this sort of pressure

 before the              experience is themost frightening experience I have ever been through

  in my life             the 3 boys behind me were gone they were dead my nose was pressed against

 one of the              boys who was dead I could see that he was dead I managed to get one gasp

 of air and              I was shouting atthe boy to wake up there were 3 of them all together
they were only about 16/17 in other words in tlieir teens.     We shouted to the police

                                               'heip^rcmr'the'^                           • ■

at first I cant understand why they didn't do anything they should have realised

something was happening I would have done if I had been in their situation.        Eventually

they opened up the gat at the front and let some people out but then closed it again

we had a glimmer of hope because we were quite close to the gate and I thought we

would be able to escape out of there but even as they were taking the fans out the

pressure didn't ease off at all and the crowd didn’t seem to appreciate what was going

on the pressure just continued all around us.     David- had hold of my shoulders to keep

some of the pressure off me and they kept    talking to me.   Arthur Horrocks was just

behind me the last thing I remember him saying to me was keep your head up keep breathin

and then he said to Keith I cant breathe I know I almost went I wanted to be sick

but Keith told me not to be and I tried to hold back. I remember the pressure easing

and I could get some breath into me all the people who were around me who were still

alive were saying you will be okay the were reassuring me and said I would be out

in a minute I dont know how I survived as there were a lot of people around me had

died.   The crush barrier which was behind us actually bent under the pressure. _ A.,

coloured lad came up and helped me out but my legs were trapped by the bodies all

around me.    I was carried up the side of the railings and passed over to a policeman

on the other side of the railings into the right hand section of the Lepping Lane

end.    I was then carried down and put onto the grass. 3/4 policemen were massaging

me to try and get my blood to circulate I felt dazed and      felt as if I wanted to black

out I just wanted to go to sleep I was gaspingfor air all the time.      I tried    to get

up and I dropped to theground again and     one of the supporters came up and helped

me up    I wanted to look   formy boyfriend Keith but in fact he was coming towards me

at this point.    There was a message over the tannoy to clear the pitch that was the

very first message over     thetannoy since all the trouble started we noticed fans were

ripping down the advertising hordings I understand they were used as temporary stretcher

we were both in a daze and shocked I couldn't feel anything I was totally numb we

made our way out to the first aid area we sat down and Malcolm came in and we met

up with him and    it was then that he told us that Arthur had died.    We tried to comfort

another lad whowas in a trance he was verydistressed and sobbing        we were moved away

and we sat down   on pile of sand presumably left by the builders.      Malcolm was actually

told to move on   bya motorbike policeman I was examined by a St John's Ambulance girl

and she suspected I had broken ribs and they examined Keith's foot as he was in pain.
     We then went in a police mini bus to .the Hallamshire Hospital and I went into the '     ?
                                                                                              fc .

     by the doctor that I had broken some ribs he said 2 or 3.   They just had too many

     people there so they couldn't send me for X-rays they said there was no treatment

     for it they dont bind you up and I was given painkillers i.e. Bupaphen.   I was also

     covered in a rash but that was due to the pressure and I had a black right eye.   They

     asked me to stay for a couple of hours to allow the effects of the shock to wear off.

     A call was then put through to my home and the family came up to collect us.

2.       I wish to be included in a claim arising c^ut of the Sheffield Hillsborough Disaster

     which took place on Saturday 15th April 1^39 at the Liverpool -v- Nottingham

         Forest football match.                 This game was the Isemi final of the 1988/89 F.A. Cup.



3.       I travelled by van to Sheffield with Arthur Horrocks now deceased a claim is
                                                                      i

         being pursued separately for him by his wife Susan.                     Arthur s brother Malcolm

         Horrocks aged 45, my own brother Keith Golding aged 26 his girlfriend Nicola

         Stewart aged 21 and also a mate of mine from work namely)___________| My brother

         Keith was driving his Company van.                      We all had tickets to get into the football

         ground.                  I          |had a ticket to go into the stand and the rest of us had

          tickets to go into the ground at the Lepping Lane end, this was the end designated

          for Liverpool fans.



 4. We actually left Bootle at 9.00am to get up to the match because we had anticipated

           there would be a lot of traffic and hold ups we had been to this ground before:

           Arthur didn't corae with us last year but at the same time last year again was

            the Liverpool -v- Nottingham Forest semi final for the 87/88 L'.A. Cup tournament.

           Last year in fact we had gone on the football special train to Sheffield and

            had arrived at the ground at 1.00pm and the ground was empty then.



 5.' We actually arrived at 2.25pm at the ground we had called into the Pheasant that

             is a pub in a little village outside Hillsborough, this is a pub restaurant and

             we had all sat down and had a rneal for our lunch and then we went on to the ground
   iv'hen     i       ih c -r e w e r e 1.1'.:.   .,       ^L-jupJ.e L iy j.n ,, . . . ,      ^ Lhe few turn:-.;,

   that were available for us to get into when we got in there there was no form

   of queing at all it was just simply a free for all of thousands of people massing

   around trying to get through the turnstiles.                     There was no form of que whatsoever.

   I have been to many games where there has been huges crowds but there has always

   been a proper orderly queue and you have moved forward to go into the ground

   with the police supervising and monitoring the queues to keep everybody in order.

   On this occasion there was no such control or arrangements I saw just 2 or 3

   policemen about when I was there but nobody was making any attempt for formulate

   a queue.
                                                       r


                                                       i
  \                                         |

7 .v~We therefore just joined in the crowd and tried to move forward towards the

   turnstiles to get into the ground all of us managed to get through the turnstiles
                                                       i


   and we handed our tickets in.
                                                       i

                                           I
8. When we finally got through to the turnstile I did have a word with the man on
                                           I
   the turnstile as I was obviously very concerned at the way in which the crowds
                                                       i



   were having to be kept waiting he was taking a long time to scrutinise all the

   tickets as people were going through.               I can only assume he was checking for

   forgery the net result was that there were still thousands of people outside

 w h e n I got through the turnstile.             When I said to him why dont you F                       well

   do something about the people outside he replied by saying "what can I do about

   it" he mentioned the police and said it’s up to the police.                             So far as I was

   concerned there was no control or attempt by the police to keep the crowd in

   an orderly line.



9. Last year so far as I am told when you went to the ground you go through an outer

   perimiter gate and you had to produce your ticket to the police before going

   into the gate where you produce your ticket when you go through the turnstile

   so you are therefore filtering through and joining the queue this year because

   of the build up of people I suspect that they abandoned that idea completely

   as in .fact we simply walked through that perimiter gate as the gates were wide

   open and the area in front of the turnstile was just full of people.                              I think

   immediately in front of the turnstile the area would probably hold about 1000.

Thank you for your letter of 10 September to the Home Secretary asking for
a meeting to discuss the scope for financial assistance in respect of Hillsborough
related costs.

I would be pleased to meet you, the Chief Constable and members of the Police
Authority. Could I ask that your office to get in touch with my Assistant Private
Secretary, Desmond Daniels (0171 2 7 3 2838), to arrange a date.

I am grateful for your offer of a more detailed paper. It would be useful if your
Clerk and Treasurer could send it to Jim Bradley in the Police Resources Unit
here in the first instance.

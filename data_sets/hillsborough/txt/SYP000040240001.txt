 COMPLAINT AGAINST POLICE - EDWARD SPEARRITT

 In the absence of Mr Wright I am forwarding a copy of a letter received
 from the above named in which he makes an allegation against a member
 of this Force.

 I should be obliged if you would undertake the investigation on our behalf
 and would inform you that I have asked Mr E N Taylor of the Police
 Complaints Authority to supervise the investigation.

 A copy of the letter was faxed to Detective Superintendent Beechey on
 23 September 1989 to avoid any delay in receipt of correspondence and
 consequent delay in the service of a Notice under Regulation 7•

 I enclose a copy of my letters to Mr Taylor and to the complainant Mr
 Spearritt.

 Yours sincerely

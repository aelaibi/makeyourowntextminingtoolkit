           Semi        Final       between          Nottingham             Forest             FC    and    Liverpool             FC     to    be

            played          at    the    S.W.F.C.          ground          Hillsborough,

           The        dog    section          was    split          into       2 main          groups          i.e.    14       vans    each       with     2

           dogs        and       handlers       on       the    FI,       F2    and       D2       areas       of   and     approaching             the

           ground           and    5    vans    each       containing                2    dogs       and       handlers          working

           Sheffield              City       Centre.

           Briefing              for    dog    handlers             took       place          at    Niagara         Club        House    at    9.15       am

           and        each       was    given       his/her          area       of       duty       and    a    copy       of    the    main       area

           of    deployment              for    all       other          handlers.                 This    ensures          that       everybody

           knows           exactly       what       his    job       is    and       where          everybody          else       is    located.            I

           was        in    overall          charge       of    the       dog    handlers              and      responsible             to    Chief

           Superintendent                    Duckenfield,

           With        PC    2943       Fiddle       (West          Yorkshire)                and    PC    720      Sockett           (South

           Yorkshire)              (later       2955       DowdafTj^S^uth                      Yorkshire)             my    main       area    of

            patrol          was    from       Halifax          Road,       Wadsley             Bridge,          Penistone             Road    North,

           Leppings              Lane    and    surrounding                area.              This     area         included          patrols       of

           the        Fox    Hill       and    Parsons          Cross          Estates.

           From        the       time    of    the       early       arrival             of    supporters             it w a s        evident       that
many    had       possession                of    alcoholic             drink         which          they     were      carrying            around

with    them       in       single,          four          and    six     packs.               This     was     as     early      as       10.30         am

The    area       of    patrol             was    generally             being         'occupied*              by     Liverpool

supporters             although             there          were    some         Nottingham               supporters          as       well.

The    mood       of    the       supporters                was    generally               good        and    there        were       no

reports       of       any       form       of    trouble          for       some         considerable               time.        During

our    patrols          we       escorted          mini          buses       from         the       outlying         areas       to

respective             parking             areas.           At    no    time         did       I see      any      alcoholic           drink

in a n y     coach          or    mini       bus       nor       did    I hear            of    any     such       incident           over        t he

radio.

Most    of    the       supporters                were       making          for      public           houses,         shops      and

supermarkets                where          they    congregated                  in    very          large     numbers        buying,

drinking          and       taking          away       a    great       deal         of    alcoholic            drinks.           As       t he

morning       and       early          afternoon             passed          it w a s          obvious        that     many       were

becoming          the       worse          for    drink          although            not       in a      nasty       sort    of       way.

We    stopped          one       group       of    Liverpool              supporters                 going      down       Penistone

Road    North          to    the       rear       of       the    Spion         Kop       and       spoke     to     others       who       were,

what    can       only       be       described             as    larking            about.            Many     were       what       I would

describe          as    "stupidly                under       the       influence               of    drink'.           There      was       no

hostility          but       some          were    very          resentful            of       the     allocation           of    tickets.

In    the    mini       vans          which       we       stopped        and        escorted           we    found        that       there

was    at    least          one       of    the    occupants              who        lived          in S h e f f i e l d    and       that

they    had a r r a n g e d            to    meet          other       groups         at       various        public        houses          as

far    out    as       Stocksbridge, Chapeltown                                 and       Ecclesfield.

During       the       early          afternoon,             very       large         crowds           were     gathering             at

public       houses          on       the    Foxhill             and    Parsons            Cross        and     Herries          areas.

Visits       to    these          places          revealed             that      supporters               were       queuing          to    ge t

in.     'The       Fox*          on    Foxhill             Road,       ’T h e    M a g n e t ',        Southey         Green      Road,

all    had    very          large          attendances             with         people          filling         ca r    parks         and

roadside          spaces        -    all          drinking.

It    was       clear    that        the          majority                were       purchasing                   drink    after          arrival.

Radio       messages          indicated                    similar             happenings                in       other    areas.              Many        of

those       arriving          by     coach             and       private             car       were       making          straight             for       the

public          houses       and     other             premises                where          intoxicants                could       be    bought.

An    incident          of    theft           from          a    shop          in    Foxhill             Road       was     reported            and        the

offenders          were       traced              to            'The      Fox*           public       h o u s e by        the o f fi c e r s .            A

transit          (police)           van       was            deployed               to        the    ' W h i t e H o r s e * to           deal      with a

minor       incident.               Concern                was       expressed                about       the       large       numbers             at     the

’F i v e    A r c h e s ’ public              house             and       the       Fox       Public          House.

About       1.45       pm w e       parked             in a          lay-by          in H e r r i e s             Road    opposite             the       bus

station.           It    was        at       that          time       that          we    stopped             Liverpool          supporters

going       towards          the     Spion             Kop.           I recall                making          a    comment       that          it    was

too    quiet       and       that        it w a s           going          to       be    a    last       minute          rush.           We    made          a

tour       of   Leppings            Lane,          Middlewood                   Road,          Parkside             Road       and    Penistone

Road       North.        The        crowds             were          increasing                in    numbers             all    around          the

ground.           I have        never             seen          so    many          people          walking          about       carrying                cans

of    beer/lager.               We       made          a    tour          of    the       Southey             Green       Road,       Herries

Road       areas       and    during              that          time       was       requested                by Supt.          Chapman             ’F ’

Division          to    deploy           a    further                dog       van       on    Herries              Road.       This       I did.

The    problem          was     with          the               Nottingham                S u p p o r t e r s , not        Liverpool.                    This

extra       patrol       was        deployed                about          2    to       2.15       pm    (it       could       have       been

earlier).

About       1.55       pm w e       had       provided                part          of    the       escort          for    Liverpool

supporters             arriving              at    Wadsley                Rail       Station.                 There       were       about          350       on

the    train.           The     escort             was          done       without             incident             to    Leppings             Lane

turnstiles.              We     then          went          onto          Halifax             Road       and       assisted          with        coaches

arriving          for    parking.

Shortly          after       2.30        pm we             made       a    tour          of    Penistone             Road       North,           Herries

           to    Herries             Road    South,          monitoring             the       arrival          of    Nottingham

           supporters                from    the    Herries             Road       area.        It       was    shortly             after       this

           that       the    first          radio       messages             began       to    be    made       regarding             the       crowds

    /'/’   in Leppings                Lane    and       the    problems             they       were       having          getting           supporters

           into       the    ground.              Many       radio       messages             were       being       passed          to     and         from

           the    ground             control       ro o m .

           I heard          somebody          request          the       start          of    the    match          be    delayed.              I heard             a

           reply       to    the       effect       that       " I t ’s t o o           late    ~    one       team       is    on    the       pitch"

           i heard          somebody          say       words       to       the    effect          that       people          were       being

           crushed          in L e p p i n g s      Lane       and       then       somebody             I believe             it    was       Sgt.

           Goddard          in       ground       control          say:       "Open          Gate    A"    "Open          Gate       A ".       This          was

           NOT    "Open          a    gate."        He       repeated             this       instruction             several          times.

           We    drove       round          the    block       and       entered             Leppings          Lane       from       Penistone

           Road       North.           Crowds       were       fairly             heavy       for    the       first       S00       yards          or    so

           but    when       we       got    into       view       of    the       tunstile          area       I    could          see     what         I can

           only       describe          as    a    seething             mass       of    people          stretching             out       of    sight

           towards          Catch       Bar       Lane.        The       road       was       absolutely             solid          from       Shenstone

           Road       upward.           From       my    position             in    the       dog    van       (multi          cage       Dodge)          I

           could       see       over       the    heads       of       the       people.           There       was       no    orderly             queuing

           as    in    previous             years       and    I could             see       that    the       crowd       was       simply

           pressing          forward          towards          the       turnstile             area.           I saw       people           climbing

           over       the    walls          near    to       the    turnstiles                and    main       gates          although             I    could

           not    see       ’A ’ g a t e .         I saw       a mounted                officer          and    his       horse       pushed             to

           one    side       and       I thought             that       he    was       going       to    go    over       the       wall       into          the

           river.

           I heard          somebody          on    the       radio          say    that       if    the       gates       were       not       opened

           there       was       going       to    be    a    disaster.                 I believe          that          Supt.       Marshall             said

           this       and    further          messages             to    the       effect       that       somebody             would          be       killed

           if    the    gates          were       not    opened          to       relieve       the       pressure.

           It    was    at       this       time    that       I saw          a    large       number          of    Liverpool              supporters

emerge    from          Vere       Road          into    Leppings             Lane.        This       road          is    barriered             off

and    only    residents                   are    allowed          in.        These       supporters                must    have          been

let    through          the    barriers             at       Vere       Road,       Penistone             Road       North       by       the

police    officers             on          these    barriers.                 Knowing          the    problems             of    the       past

I got    out    of       the       van       and    went          into       Vere    Road       where          I saw       other

officers       dragging                supporters             out       of    passageways             between             the    houses.

The    numbers          in    the          road must          have          been    in    excess          of       100.     Many

residents       were          out          and    I saw,          as    I went       down       the       road,          that    t he

passageways             had    been          used       as    toilets.              I spent          several             minutes          trying

to    pacify    residents                   without          much       success.           I went             to    the    bottom          of

Vere    Road    where          Police             Officers             were    still       letting             Liverpool             fans

through       the       barriers             and    pu t      a    stop       to    it    in    no    uncertain             terms.

During    this          time       the       radio       messages             were       constantly                being    passed

between       Supt.          Marshall             and    other          officers          on    the       gate       and    ground

control.        It       was       about          this       time       that       the    transmissions                   began       to

break    up    and       become             uninte11igable.                    I    passed       this          information                to

ground    control.                 I       returned          to L e p p i n g s      Lane       and       saw       that    the       crowd

had    diminished             considerably.                       I heard          somebody          on       the    radio       shouting

"Stop    them       -    Stop          them"        The       message          was       very    garbled             and    almost

unreadable.

I heard       somebody             ~       obviously          in       the    ground-          pass       a    message          that

people    were          being          -    or    had    been          crushed       and       something             about       "bodies"

or    "body".

I went    into          Leppings             Lane       to    give          instructions             to       Dog    Handlers

there.        I have          no       idea      what        time       it    was.        I then          went       back       to    my       dog

van.     The    radio          had          ceased       to       operate          and    1 had       no       information                as    to

what    had    happened                or    was    happening.                 I then          heard          somebody          on    t he

radio    again          but    I cannot             remember                what    was    said       or       who       said    what.

There    were       several                hundred       supporters                milling       about             Leppings          Lane.           At

this    time    very          little             seemed       to       be    coming       over       the       radio       and       as    I had

got    Leppings          Lane          and       surrounding             roads       well       patrolled             with       dog

handlers          I decided                to    go    for    my    refreshment                at    Niagara          Club       House.

Many    other          officers                were    doing       likewise.              We    were       about       to       enter

Niagara       Road       when          I heard          over       the    radio          what       was    happening             at    the

ground.           I went          straight             into    the       club       and    got       all    the       dog       handlers

who    were       in    for       their          meals       out    onto       their       original          patrol             areas.        I

returned          with       PC       Dowdall,          PC    Fiddle       to       Leppings          Lane.           I saw

thousands          of    supporters                   leaving       the    ground.              I got       out       of    the       van    and

went    to    speak          to       an       officer       but    was    instantly                hemmed       in    by       Liverpool

supporters             who    were             shouting       abuse.           I made          my    way    through             the

supporters             and    was          then       approached          by    a    Doctor          who    asked          me    to    take

him    into       the    ground.                 I escorted          him       through          'A*       Gate    and       via       the

lower    North          Stand          level          took    him    to    the       gymnasium.              The       hositility             of

the    Liverpool             supporters                 was    indescribable.                       I was    threatened,

verbally          abused          and          spat    upon.

On    entering          the       gymnasium             with       the    doctor          I was       horrified             to       see    very

many    dead       bodies.                 I    left    the    gymnasium             and       as    I did       I saw          three

young    men       carrying                what       looked       like    a    girl,          she    appeared             to    be    dead.

I went       to    assist             and       was    told:       "Don't       touch          her    you    murdering                bastard."

They    carried          her/him                into    the    gymnasium.

I then       went       down          the       ramp    onto       the    ground          and       saw    that       many       dog

handlers          had    been          deployed          across          the    pitch          together          with       a    cordon       of

foot    officers.                 I    realised          the       possibility             of       a major       public             order

situation          so    I went                round    every       dog    handler             to    make    sure          he    knew

where    his       partner             was       in    case    they       had       to    leave       the    ground             quickly.

I then went             out       onto          Penistone          Road    North          where       I saw       PC       3336       Gibbin

who    had    been       left          to       look    after       the    dog       vans.           She    was       looking          after

two    young       children                in a       car.     They       were       doctors          children.                 PC    Gibbin

was    obviously             very          shaken.           She    looked          terrible.              She    told          me    she    had

been    threatened                by       a    crowd    of    Liverpool             supporters.                 We    were          joined

PC    Gibbin         took       me       in    her    van       round          the      block         to    Leppings              Lane.           On

arrival         we    were       confronted                by       Liverpool             supporters                 who       were       extremely

hostile         and       threatening.                    I sent          PC    Gibbin           back       to       Penistone             Road

North       and      I walked             down       Leppings             Lane.           The     hostility                of     the

Liverpool            supporters                was    immense.                 Very       many        were       very          much       the     worse

for    drink.             I was          shoved       and       pushed,             threatened              with          violence             and

sp^upon.                  I had          to    ignore          them,       even        those          who       came       right          up    to     me

to    spit      in m y      face.              They       stank       of       boose.            I helped             to       get    two       fire

engines         and       some       ambulances                through          the       mob,        there          is    no     other         word

for    them.          I saw          a    youth       standing             on       top    of     a    police             ca r.       I went

towards         him       and    was          immediately             surrounded                 by L i v e r p o o l           fans.           I told

him    to    get      down       as       what       he    was       doing          w o u l d n ’t m a k e           things          any

better.             Threats          to       kill    me       were       made.           I am        certain             that       had       I tried

to    arrest         that       youth          I would          have       been        seriously                assaulted.

I went       along         Leppings             Lane       and       put       dog     handlers             in       groups          of    4 and        6

for    safety         and       told          them    that          they       must       no t    rear          to    the       action          of     the

fans    unless            they       were       absolutely                forced.            I did          this          with       every

officer         I    came       across          whether             dog    handler           or       not.           I will          say       this,

that    under         the       most          hostile,          abusive             and    threatening                    crowd       I have

ever    seen         in E 9      1/2          years       of    service,             the     officers                on    Leppings             Lane,

whether         foot       officers,             traffic             officers,             mounted              officers             or    do g

handlers,            were       magnificent                in       their       conduct           and       by       such       conduct

prevented            what       I believe             was       a    major          public        order          situation                arising.

To    say    I was         frightened                is    putting             it    mildly.               I was          in    genuine           fear

of    being         seriously             assaulted             if    not       killed           such       was       the       hatred          being

displayed.

I have       it      on    my    conscience                that       I did          not     stay          in    the       ground          to     help.

I believe            that       at       that    time          there       was       enough           help       in       the     ground          and

             say    that       initially        the      mood    was    good       but       with      an     underlying         resentment

             which       surfaced        and    became         evil    as    the       day    progressed.

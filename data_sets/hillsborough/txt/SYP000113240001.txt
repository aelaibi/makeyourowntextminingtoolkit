                At 8 . 3 0 a.m.            (0830)         on S a t u r d a y ,      15th A p r i l ,        1989,       (130489),           I

                commenced           d u t y at W o o d s e a t s         Police        Station         in o r d e r       to a t t e n d        the

                semi-final           between Liverpool                       F.C.     and N ottingham              Forest        F.C.       to    take

                place       at H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l         Ground.

                At a p p r o x i m a t e l y        1 0 . 0 0 a.m.       that       day,      I was       present         during          a briefing

                conducted           by C h i e f       Superintendent                 Du c k e n f ield,      given        to a       l a rge
A
d               contingent           of     officers             on the N o r t h S t a n d          of     the    ground.            I

                considered           the       briefing           to    be    concise         and    * to    the    point'         - the

                overall        message           in t e r m s      of    our     Policing           tactics        wa s    to    be       firm    but

                fair.         There       w as      an air        of    good     humour        and     everybody           seemed          to    be

                looking        forward           to    the       game    going        ahead without               any     problems.

                The     gates       to    the       ground        were       opened      to    the     p u b l i c at m i d d a y          and    the

                •Pew fans          who    entered           the     ground       at    this     time        were A e r y        good       humoured.

                My    duties,        under          the     leadership           of    Inspector            (f erial       11),       were       to

                mai ntai n o r d e r           on     the      upper     1e^ ^ o j f _ t ^ g ^ j ^ r j U 2 _ S t a g T ^ 3 m d     to      pay

                particular           attention              to    the    betting         booth and           cafeterias            where

                trouble        had       occurred           last, year .

                As    the     kick       off     time       neared       I remember            commenting           that        the N o t t i n g h a m

                Forest        end w a s        full       of     spectators           whilst        the L e p p i n g s     Lane          e n d was

                sparse        in    comparison.
At a p p r o x i m a t e l y                       m>    several          supporters            were       informing             me    in

passing         that        problems             were    occurring           outside           the    Leppings            Lane

tur ns t i 1 e y w i th o v e r c r o w d i n g / p u s h i n g ,               I recall            one    or    two      people

rushingxpast                me    with       obvious          minor       leg    injuries,            as       they     were       limping.

I wa^experiencing                       dif f i c u l t y      i                     n                     s                          dur ing

ttart      period         but     I could          h ea r     officers          outside         the       Leppings          Lane       end

discussing               the     crowd       situation             but    there       was      no    sign       of a n y      panic,

they       seemed         to     be    in    control          of    the    situation.

As    3    p.m.      (1500)           neared,       large          numbers       of L i v e r p o o l        supporters               were

still       entering             the    g round and            coming         into       the N o r t h S t a n d .            The

situation            outside           at    the    time       was       obviously          getting          worse.           The      radio

communications                   between          the    officers          outside          and      the       control        r o o m was

dominating               the t r a n s m i s s i o n s .           The    attitude          o f the        crowd        had also

changed,            l a rge      numbers          were       obviously          drunk       and      were       shouting

obscenities               at     the P o l i c e        in    relation          largely         to    the       situation

outside         the       turnstiles,              they were             complaining            of    the       pushing          and

stating         we w e r e n ’t d o i n g           anything             about     it.         In turn,          I had        to      speak

to s e v e r a l         supporters              about       their       language         and       general          c o n d uc t ,

although            I accepted              by    now    th a t     there       was a       p ro b l e m .       It wa s         not

practicable               to     turn any          of    these        supporters            away      due       to    the     large

numbers         of       drunks        coming       in.        I couldn't             have      ejected          them       through

the       turnstiles             anyway.             People were             coming         into      the N o r t h S t a n d w i t h

tickets         for       other        parts         of      the g r o u n d a n d       on one       occasion            I allowed

access         to    the       North Stand              of    one     p e r s o n wh o      had a ticket                for      the

Leppings            Lane       end.         I felt       at    this       time     that        we w e r e       short       of

officers            at    the     rear       of    the       North Stand           but      clea r ly ,         the     problems

were       outside          Leppings             Lane    and any          deployment            of    officers            would        be

there       and      not       the N o r t h St a nd .

Also      at    this        t i me     a very       l a rge         n u m b e r of L i v e r p o o l       supporters            were

reproached about                      urinating          at    the       rear    of      the    North Stand               n ea r      to    the

Leppings         Lane       turnstiles.                A    l a rge    ’s t r e a m *       of    urine       was    evident             on

t he   concourse.             We      were       then       directed            to    the    pitch area             in    response

to a     pitch        i n v a s i o n at     the L i v e r p o o l          end.

Myself     and Police              Constable               Brophy      attempted             to     get      to    that

particular            area    by g o i n g        from       the      top       of    the N o r t h S t a n d         through            the

aisles     and        onto     the     pitch.              However,         it w a s        c l ear     that       the    mood          of

the    supporters            was      an aggressive                curie a n d        there       is no       doubt       in m y m i n d

that    ha d we        gone     t ha t      way,       figWTLng            would       h a ve     broken          out.        Only

minutes        earl i e r ^ h e ^ ^ y ^ ^ ^




I went     with Police                Constable             Brophy         to    the a r e a        outside         the       gymnasium

where     we     were       held      back.           It    certainly            a p p e a r e d at         this    time          to    be a

pith     invasion,           several          f an s       could      be    seen       on the          pitch       in f r o n t         of

the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t         end a n d        gesticulating                  aggressively              in t h e i r

direction.

I was     then        deployed with               other        officers              in f r o n t      of    the N o r t h         Stand

to     prevent        the    invasion            spreading.

It b e c a m e    c l ear      tooth f r o m          some     injured           persons          passing          me and          cr owd

reaction         to    events         at    the       Leppintjs L a n e              end    that       it w a s     not       a    pitch

invasion         in t ha t      sense.            I c o u l d n ’t u n d e r s t a n d w h y                the    officers             at

the L e p p i n g s      Lane      end w ere           stood watching                  an    event          involving             injury

to     persons        and    not      helping          t h e m e n mass .               I assumed            that     it m u s t         h a ve

been an        invasion         of     the       pitch and            t h at     the       injuries          sustained             were       as

as a     result        of    fans      fighting             one    another.                Certainly,             there       were       no

transmissions               informing            us    of w h a t      was       actually           occurring.                    The

tannoy     system           c o u l d be h e a r d          but    again,            it was       to    calm       the f a n s          down,

but    nothing         was     heard        to    tell       people         in the          crowd       of    the     injuries

occurring.             I feel         sure       that       h a d we       been       told       simply       to    ’help*             the

c r o w d we w o u l d       h av e    done       en mass.

Having      realised           that        i n j ury,       serious         i n j u r y was         occurring            to       fans,       I

                               t h a t some    supporters             ha d   been    killed.        I attended            to    one        person with

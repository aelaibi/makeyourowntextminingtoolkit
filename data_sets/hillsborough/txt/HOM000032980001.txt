.^^KaSpOhdsng to a report in (today's Daily Mirror, about the Hillsboroug f tragedy, Assistant
    Chief Constable !an Dain^s said:

    "Reports about this particular video tape continue to add confu sion to an already
    complex-set of circumstances. The Chief Constable has always said that any new
    evidence surrounding the) disaster wifi be examined in detail Therels no new evidence
   in the article published in jh e Daiiy Mirror today

   'The tape in question - from a dosed circuit television camera s owing the disaster
   unfold on the toppings t_ane terraces - has never been ‘missing and it was made
   available in full to both t+ord Justice Taylor's inquiry and to the a roner's inquest, its
   existence has never been in doubt

   “The camera which took tjie pictures was indeed in working order, otherwise there would
   have been no tape to subpit as evidence

   <!What Officers have pmvifcusly explained is that the iive transmissior of the pictures tnto
   the police control point atjth© time was of poor quality. This meant lat they had to rely
   oh tile viewfromthe poikje control room window and on information from officers on the
   ground. It has always b^en assumed that the interference on their screen was caused
   by television equipment toeing used to transmit live coverage of th< FA cup semi-final,
   which*w ?9es not a factor w)^en the equipment was tested earlier in the 3ay.

   -As has been explained t^efore, the confusion over ‘missing' tapes ieems to arise from
   the fact that two bther t^pes recorded at the ground on the day      the disaster were
   stolen overnight from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's recordi ig suite in a locked
   room in'the stadium One would have shown a disused area of t ie complex and the
   other would have shown turnstiles. Neither tape would have bien relevant to the
   tragedy and the rtiotive fbjr the theft has never been established,

   "We understand that enquiries are being conducted by the Crown ’rosecution Service
   but have not yet been concluded.”

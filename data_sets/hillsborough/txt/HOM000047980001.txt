     Dear Sir,

     RE:    THE HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY
                                                                                            V
     Further to the Director’s letter of 30 July 1997,1 enclose two schedules showing the material
     held by the CPS.

     As the Director indicated, the material falls into two distinct parts, the material relevant to
     the 1990 decision not to prosecute and that relevant to the recent 1997 decision not to
     prosecute.

     The schedules are comprehensive and list all the material held at the CPS or viewed by the
     CPS. All the material we hold is currently at United House in York. Rather than reproduce
     in our own schedules all the lists contained in the West Midlands Police Report, I have
     attached a copy of the master index of witnesses and documents as an appendix to the
     schedule of pre August 1990 material.

     You will no doubt wish to discuss access to the material. There is one further item which
     is not covered on the 1990 schedule, about which the Chief Crown Prosecutor will be writing
     to you separately.

     I look forward to hearing from you.

     Yours sincerely

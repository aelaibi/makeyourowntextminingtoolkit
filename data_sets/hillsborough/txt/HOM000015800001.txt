«
    Dear Mr Whalley,


    Further to various telephone conversations yesterday I confirm
    that Professor Alan Usher's evidence has now been removed from
    Liverpool Law Society Library.

    From the time each transcript became available we have held at the
    Liverpool Law Library full copies of all transcripts of evidence
    at the Inquiry, the written submissions of Counsel - once these
    ceased to be embargoed on the 14th July - and those statements
    which were served after the conclusion of oral evidence and once
    no objection was taken, as we understood it incorporated into the
    evidence on the 14th July.   These latter documents included the
    evidence of Professor Usher which on the face of it (with the
    exception of the boy, Lee Nichol who was the last to die) did not
    identify any individual by name.

    We provided the transcripts at the Library primarily and
    originally as a service to Solicitor members of the Group but I
    understand that this service has infact been appreciated and
    helpful to the clients themselves.

    At an early stage a number of the injured and bereaved made it
    clear that they were very upset and distressed by some of the
    Press Reports of evidence given at the Tribunal - this occurred in
    the early stages of the Police evidence - and we encouraged them
    to come to the Library and read for themselves the full text of
    the evidence which had been given and the examination of witnesses
    rather than to rely on the Press Reports.

    Clients who identified themselves to our Administrative Secretary
    (who has a List of all Solicitors and clients of the Group) and
    their Solicitors were given access to the transcripts and I
    understand found them helpful.

    We are extremely concerned that distress should have been caused
    by the inclusion of Dr. Usher's evidence amongst the documents at
    the Library and I confirm that that evidence was removed last
    night and that we have been able to trace the five copies made
    which have been handed over and destroyed.
I would be glad if you would accept my apologies on my own behalf
and on behalf of the Steering Committee for any distress trouble
or inconvenience which has been caused.

I am writing in similar terms to Treasury Solicitors, H M Coroner
and West Midlands Police.

All good wishes.

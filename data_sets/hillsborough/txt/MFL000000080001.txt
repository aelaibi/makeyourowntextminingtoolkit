Dear S ix
            Appalled at the statement and thinking of ? Inspector
              Sii.    who said:
 our policing was the same as we learnt from experi/nce over the

years    (free paraphrase)        and same as regarding opening that
gate    to relieve pressure on the outside     "


  If he thought this out he would see that if th-^s was the
practice the fans would know it and increasingly congregate and
crush at this gate and no doubt be let in      ;;and ohis occurred last
Sat and of coarse the tragedy happened,      letting a stream into
an already swollen river the dam burst.      I was crassly stupid

and should never be allowed to 'appen again.       Also thank God it 'is

now recognised that crash barriers KILL.

  Dear Mrs

-*     It was indeed kind of you to send £5 out of the
  pitiful amount the state gives you under Mrs Thatcher.
  I will see that it gets to the fund.

       We were at the Cathedral last Sunday night with
  people from Liverpool, Sheffield,and Nottingham,both
  important and unimportant, and including a group of
Chinese from Anshan, the twin city of Sheffield, and as
  we sat there, my wife and I mentioned the £5 you had
  sent, to each other.



                                  Kindest regards,
                                Yours sincerely,

   Sheffield.                                   1st May 1989


   Dear Simon Rawlins,

       -      Thank you for your letter of the 23rd April
   1989.

          The first point is that David Blunkett is M.P. for
* -A the area where the Hillsborough Stadium is, and you have
   * sent him a copy of the letter you have written to me.

        The points you raise it seems to me are quite relevant,
   and I have no doubt that you will get them to the enquiry
   yourself, by whatever means are available.

        I could not really comment to any degree on the second
   part of your letter regarding your personal position.  It is
   a strange story, and surely you must have had your union look
   into it at the time.  It is of course, 11 years ago, and would,
   I think, be difficult to re-open.




                                           Yours sincerely,




                                              Martin Flannery.M.P.

                    FOR PUBLICATION

Dear Sir,

     I should like to comment on Mr. Flannery’s letter (17 August)
concerning the interim report on the tragic events at Hillsborough
Football Ground on 15 April last.

     I do not know whether the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire was
wise in tendering his resignation. Neither do I know whether the South
Yorkshire Police Authority was wise in not accepting the resignation
of Mr. Wright. It would appear that Mr Flannery knows the answers to
these questions. Yet, he asked the South Yorkshire Police Authority:
"Will they tell us who was responsible? The facts have to be faced."

     I should have thought that little intelligence is needed to
realise that the ultimate responsibility lies with the crowd which
tried to push its way into the stadium. That is the fact which he
should know and will have to face. Everything follows from this.

     I presume that his letter was an exercise in public relations in
his capacity as MP for Sheffield Hillsborough, rather than in an
assessment of the facts.

     Yours faithfully,

Hillsborough Disaster - Coroner's Inquest

From my experience with the Kings Cross fire, I thought I might warn you
of problems which can arise from Coroners' Inquests into deaths in a
disaster.

You may recall that the Coroner's Inquest into the sinking of the Herald
of Free Enterprise took place after the publication of the Report of the
Inquiry into the sinking. So the information from the Inquiry was
available at the Inquest. This was probably a contributory factor to
the jury's decision (against the advice of the Coroner) to find a
verdict of unlawful killing. That verdict is still being considered by
the Director of Public Prosecutions. As far as I am aware, the
survivors and the bereaved found the 'Herald' Inquest satisfactory.

This was not the case with the Kings Cross Inquest. At Kings Cross the
Inquest was held after the     Fennell Inquiry had completed taking
evidence, but before the report was published.   Indeed, the press were
told that publication of the Fennell Report was being held back so it
would not interfere with the Inquest. The survivors and bereaved were
most upset by the Kings Cross Inquest.   Initially, London Transport
refused to pay the legal costs of relatives, but later relented. The
Lord Chief Justice told the Coroner to rule that a verdict of unlawful
killing was not acceptable because it could only be based on the acts of
an individual and not corporate negligence, The Coroner's summing up
contained errors of fact and his decision to write to London Transport
that such a fire should never happen again was difficult to reconcile
with the verdict of 'accidental death'. There was also confusion about
the identity of the bodies. The relatives were very angry and upset -
one of them described the Inquest as "a farce about a tragedy"!




                                  - 1   -
Clearly, what happened at Hillsborough was not on all fours with what
happened at Kings Cross, but there are lessons to be learned.  It seems
to me that the Inquiry and the Inquest should at best -

     (a)   find out the facts,-

     (b)   satisfy the relatives that things have been properly
           looked into;

     (c)   treat the whole affair with dignity;

     (d)   help in the cathartic process of easing the minds of
           the relatives.

I personally don't think that these objectives can be achieved unless
the Inquiry and the publication of its Report precedes the substantive
part of the Inquest. The initial Inquest hearing to cover identifica­
tion of the victims is rightly now going ahead, but the main part should
follow publication of the Taylor Report.

I hope you find this note helpful.

Yours sincerely,

Dear

I am writing to bring to your attention the existence of the Hillsborough Task .Team
which has been established by Family and Community Services to support Sheffield
people who may still be suffering from the impact of the Hillsborough Disaster.

As you may be aware, experiience at other disasters informs us that people,even those
with minimal involvements in the actual event,may experience a variety of
difficulties for some considerable time afterwards.Our aim is to inform the community
as a whole about the possible implications and to provide appropriate help and
support now for individuals and groups who have been affected in order to protect
potential long-term psychological problems in the future.

Our team of four social workers and a psychologist with administrative support,can
provide individual counselling and group work,but we are also involved in co­
ordinating and liasing with voluntary counselling agencies as well as with Social
Services from other cities.

I enclose our poster and leaflets in the hope that this information will assist you
in your surgery work and general contact with the public.Please do not hesitate to
contact us if you require further information.

Yours Sincerely



Paul Walton
Task Team Leader

Dear Mr Flannery,
I fully support your statement in the press that the Hillsborough disaster
 should never have happened at all!.
In my view if enough Mounted Police had been deployed in the areas where they
 were needed, thenxthe whole build up of the crowd could have been stopped
before it had even started!, Let's face it Sir, the Police do have personal
radio's and we are led to believevery modern equipment to deal with crowd
coh±rol of this nature. 1 am told on the 'Phone from Sheffield that the Press^
acted like vultures in many cases,as was the Case in front of Mr. Colin1
Moynihan! . This was no time for a sensational story, it was a time for actiom
indeed many lives could have been saved but for as I understand it a lot;of
bungling. IfShe Police believed that the situation was getting dangerous then
they had it in their hands th control the crowd outside the ground, leave
the gates closed and then contain the situation with Mounted Police.
 Accidents DO happen in the best regulated circles, but this was complete and1
utter inefficiency to say the least!
Whoever gave this order should be given their marching orders.
 I was at the Requim Mass for those who died at Hillsborough, nearly 40,000
people attended, we must never ever let this happen again with this terrible
loss ofllife8                   ___________________

Dear Mr        ^

     Thank you for your very kind letter of 16/4/89,and
its very sensible contents.

     I do hope that when the enquiry publishes its
findings they will have dealt in a proper manner with
the points you raise, and as you say in your final
sentence, we must never ever let this happen again.*



                               Kindest regards,
                             Yours sincerely,

Dear

     Thank you for your letter of the 17th April regarding
the Hillsborough Disaster.

     I am sure many people share your grave disquiet about
the policeforce enquiring into its own conduct,but we shall
have to wait for the result of the enquiry before we ,
apportion blame in this terrible situation.




                               Best wishes,
                            Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr

     Thank you for your kind letter of the 17th April
regarding the dreadful disaster at the Hillsborough
Football Ground.

     Acutally, the ground from the last boundary re-organisation
is one hundred yards approximately outside the Hillsborough
Constituency, and one hundred yards inside the Brightside
Constituency of David Blunkett, but even the people of Sheffield
are not quite aware of this, and I get all the correspondence
and phone calls because people believe the ground is still in
the Hillsborough Constituency.

     We shall have to wait for the result of the enquiry,but I
want the enquiry to be totally independent of the police, as I
have never believed that any organisation enquiring into its own
conduct can possibly deliver other than biased conclusions
favourable to itself.

     We must not however, jump the gun and start publicly heaping
blame on people without any proof other than hearsay,by unknown
Police Officers, as the Tory M.P. Mr Patnick, and the Police
Federation Secretary , Mr Paul Middup did.


                                   Best wishes,

                            Yours sincerely,

Dear David,

The Hillsborough Disaster______

     Enclosed is a letter from a Mr          bf Stockton on Tees who
was present at the football match on the 15th April with three members of
his family.

      It gives many details that I have not heard before, and I have written
t o tell him that you are the M.P. for the area where the football ground is,
and that I am letting you have the letter.




                                               Best wishes,

Dear Sir
                         THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
The day was Saturday 15th April, 1989, F.A. Cup Semi Final Day.        I
had never been to a Semi Final before. I set off with three members
of my family, one was my thirteen year old son.       He thought we were
going to have a great day.     Two of us were Forrest Fans and two were
Liverpool Fans.    Two would come back happy and two would be a little
bit dissappointed.   That was far fromthe truth.

What we encountered we had no idea.    We set off in plenty of time for
Sheffield arriving at 12.30p.m. the match did not start until 3.00p.m.
We had a bite to eat after we had parked about 15 minutes from the
ground.   As we walked towards the ground we were pestered by supporters
asking if we had any spare tickets.      I would not dream of going to
a football match which was all ticket if I did not have a ticket.

We approached the ground, there was a barrier across one side with
Police patrolling.    We asked the Police which was our entrance, they
pointed about 10 yards beyond but because the barrier was up they would
not let us through, we had to walk all the way round.    Never mind the
exercise will do us good.

We got into the ground and took our seats, it was a magnificent stadium.
The crowd was beginning to build up, our seats were in the South Stand
near the Leppings Lane end, just in line with the by line.          To our
left, high up, was a Police Observation Post.         Three Officers were
situated with short wave radios and TV monitors.    The camaras positioned
around the ground and outside the ground.        All the time monitoring
the crowd behaviour.    At the Leppings Lane end, this section was split
into four in the standing area.      The centre two sections were quite
full at 2.30p.m. with the end two sections very sparse of spectators.
At 2.50p.m. we observed that there was quite a lot of swaying in those
two centre sections but the outer two were filling up very very slowly
indeed.    The game started with all spectators oblivious to what was
happening.    After a short time we noticed one or two Police running
along the touch line to the goal at the Leppins Lane end. It was obvious
that they thought that there was trouble as spectators were trying
to get out onto the pitch.      The Police at first appeared to try to
deter   them from doing this but then the spectators          swung quite
dramatically and started to climb up into the main stand and the
spectators there were trying to pull them free.      They were also trying
to climb over the divisional partitions into the outer two sections.
By this time, in between watching the match and observing the Leppings
Lane end the situation became out of hand and eventually the Police
started to help the spectators over the barrier which was quite high
and difficult to get over.   At this point nobody knew what was happening
or the scale of the problem behind the barriers.     The spectators helped
each other over the barrier onto the pitch and eventually there must
have been about 500 spectators who were on the cinder track behind
the pitch and there was so many in fact they started to go onto the
pitch but tried to keep close to the by line.      At this point in time
a Senior Officer raced across the field trying to catch the eye of
the Referee.    Play was still going on but obviously it was at the far
end of the pitch.    The referee turned and saw the Police Officer, went
towards him, made conversation and the referee, decided to take the
players off the field.    Once the players were off the field, at least
a hundred Police Officers came into the ground from the far side, from
the Spoin Kop. Totally unaware of what was going on they thought clearly,
that there was going to be a riot so they formed a barrier the full
width of the field along the centre line. Still the fans were coming
over the barrier, by    this time they had managed to break free one of
the gates.    The spectators started bringing numerous casualties out
onto the green turf and laying them out.     Some of them immediately sat
up, others laid motionless on the ground.

At this point in time it must be noted that it was only the Liverpool
supporters who were actually carrying the spectators and helping them
to get    free from the pressure on the Terrace.      The casualties were
laid onthe floor and the spectators started on a      number of casualties
to try    to resuscitate them, obviously they were    unconscious.    There
were two young girls near the corner flag, they tried to revive them
for a long long time and eventually they put a coat over their heads.
There was one boy who   was as old as my youngest son ; 10, he was brought
right near the touch line, there was a young Police Cadet and a Lady
Police Officer assisting with mouth to mouth resuscitation.      They tried
for about ten minutes without any success.       Spectators in the stand
where I was, and in the terrace below watched helplessly. A big spectator
ran over, said something to the Police Officers and they moved out
of the way, he obviously must have been a First Aider or a Doctor or
somebody    with Medical knowledge.    He tried frantically for another
five minutes or it seemed that long to me, eventually all the people
crowding round let out a great cheer, he had started to breathe.        All
in the grand stand and in the terraces below started to cheer and applaud,
our jubilance was short lived, within a minute the big fellow was down,
mouth to mouth resuscitation again, the little boy had stopped breathing.
He eventually started breathing again, they turned him into the recovery
position, four spectators around this boy ran for a stretcher.         They
tried to pull away a notice board around the perimeter.        Four Police
Officers went across, and at first it looked as if they were trying
to hinder, but after a few words they started to assist and pulled
this notice board away, it was then taken over to the boy, he was put
on and was transported right across to the far side.        While this was
going on an ambulance had turned up behind the goal. A number of bodies
were put inside.     It was still not clear at this point in time what
the casualty situation was but it was obvious that there was a number
of fatalities.    Spectators in the front row of the West Stand, started
to dismantle all the notice boards which were beneath them, hand them
down carefully and eventually they found their way onto the pitch.
They were taken to each casualty and then transferred right across
the ground to waiting ambulances that could not really get into the
ground for the situation.

Whilst this was going on the hundred or so Police Officers still on
the centre line, still waiting for trouble, still waiting for a riot,
at this point a number of Nottingham Forrest fans climbed over the
fence at the Spoint Kop and started to dismantle the sign boards behind
their goal and carry them to where they were needed.     They then joined
with the Liverpool fans in conveying the bodies across to the far side.
There were only a few Police Officers helping to carry the stretcher
bound casualties across and help them in reviving the injured spectators.
The control by the Police during this operation was absolutely negative.
No one seemed to be in charge at all, and it was the Liverpool fans
who took the     initiative   in dealing with the emergency situation.
Eventually a full half of the playing area was covered with distraught
Liverpool fans.    The Manager of Liverpool Football Club, Kenny Dalglish
came to the public address       system, appealed for  calm, there was no
need, they were completely calm, he asked them to move off the field,
those who were not in need of medical attention,        they moved to the
side waiting for further instructions.     It is true there were a couple
of incidents, one involving a News Reporter tryingto take photographs
of dead bodies.      Distraught and angry fans seized him.      The Police
protected him and separated him by escorting him away.        They should
have taken his camara away, I would have.

Another incident involving some of the fans near the players tunnel,
they congregated round the BBC Camara as you could see from the News
Report, they were not causing problems.   They were voicing their opinion
at the lack of control, why did it happen, who's fault     was it, why was
it not averted?    After a very long time when most of      the bodies had
been taken across to the waiting amulances and the terraces were nearly
empty it became evident of the horror of the incident.       Steel barriers
capable of withstanding 50 tons pressure were flattened, it was only
then that the injuries became apparent.       As the fans left the ground
the Police in the centre began to disperse slowly.        Behind the goal
all the personal belongings, shoes, boots, coats, scarves were gathered
in one big heap.   We left the ground at about 4.30p.m. passing spectators
in silence.  The Police outside the ground tried to make their prescence
felt by stopping cars, asking them where they were going, stopping
groups of people, single people, asking them where they were going.
 Still they were looking for trouble.       There was no trouble, people
were too upset by the situation to think about causing trouble.          It
was not until I got back to the car and switched the radio on that
I heard the horrific number of fatalities, 74.        That must have been
everybody who was carried across the full length of the field.           As
the reasons for this disaster unfold,       the responsibility of crowd
observation and crowd control lies fairly and squarely with the Police.
 As they were situated in that control tower using the close circuit
monitors and using radios for giving instructions, it was obvious that
opening a gate and letting fans in would result in them getting into
the ground and seeing the game as quickly as possible.     With the centre
two sections of the Leppings Lane end being overfull it would have
been an easy instruction to deploy some of the Police Officers to the
tunnels leading into those two sections and directing the fans into
the end two sections.     Outside the ground at that particular end the
crowd was building up, two Police Horses appeared to be doing very
little to try to relieve the pressure.    I believe those Police Officers
failed in their duty to ensure the safety of those fans in that situation
outside the Leppings Lane end.        I also feel that the observation
controller, overriding and overseeing every action and activity around
the ground failed to recognise the problem in the centre two sections,
and deal with it accordingly by averting fans into the end two sections.
The horrific irony is that we had a situation that the Police had no
idea how to control.      They are just clearly trained in controlling
riot and violence and they were totally unable to control human tragedy.
By being First Aid Trained, they would have been able to make some
contribution to the situation.  Very few did.

Because this gate was opened, many who did not have tickets, gained
entry and contributed to the problem unintentionally.  I have been
to many football matches in my life and by being all ticket it is far
quicker to gain entry into the ground than it is being paying cash.
We now look at the consequences of having Membership cards. In a situation
like the 15th April, 1989 entry to the ground would have been much
slower causing terrific build up outside.      It is easy to say that by
being a member and having a membership card you must try to get to
the ground a little bit earlier.      We did because we travelled a long
way.   Not everybody thinks the same way as we do.      People get delayed
in traffic which contributes to late arrivals.      If this game had been
by Membership Card the same situation could have happened, spectators
outside without Membership cars, waiting to get in, the pressure builds
up, the gates are opened to relieve what is anticipated as a dangerous
situation and fans who have had their cards taken away from them gain
entry and cause great problems.

The Government must realise the tragedy caused at Hillsborough on Saturday
15th april, 1989 is due to interference by Government, Local Authority
and Police, in trying to restrict members of the public as spectators
from moving freely and safely around our grounds.        If the divisional
fences and the perimeter fences were not present today this tragedy
would never have arisen, as the spectators would have merely moved
to one side to avert the pressure. Penning in of spectators is a serious
breach of the Health and Safety at Work Act as far as Safe Access and
Safe Egress is concerned, in an emergency evacuation situation. Football
clubs must be left to manage their own business without interference
from outside bodies unless they request specialist advice and assistence.
It will be interesting to see how the Officer in charge of survelance
and deployment of his force will allay the blame for this tragedy.
95 passionate fans do not know the cause.  Thousands do.

Dear Lord Taylor,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

     I know that the Public Enquiry will be considering a
wide range of issues, but I wanted to emphasise the need for
the Emergency Planning arrangements to be considered carefully.

     Of course, emergency planning will not prevent disasters
occurring, but thorough emergency planning can do two things.
Firstly, it can ensure that the scale of any disaster is reduced
by examining the consequences of disasters, and then implementing
designs, controls, etc., in advance of any disaster.  Secondly, it
can reduce the number and severity of casualties, when a disaster
does occur.

     In view of the above I hope that the Enquiry will look
carefully at what emergency planning was done in advance of the
disaster, what possible disasters were foreseeable, and foreseen,
and what steps were taken by way of design,etc., to reduce the scale
of a disaster.

       I am also especially concerned about these specific points:

1.    When was the stadium's Emergency Plan last updated?

2.    When was it last practised?

3.    On the day of the disaster, when was it put into effect?

4.    When was t h e ;City's Civil Emergency Plan put into effect?

5,i   When was the Health Authority made aware of the scale of
      the disaster?



                                                   con ’t
6.   How did the stadium's Emergency Plan operate in practice?

7.   What further guidance on Emergency Planning is required
     in the light of this disaster?




                                  Yours   s i n c e r el y ,

  Dear Martin

  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

  Thank you for your letter of 24th April 1989 and the copy
  of the attached letter from Seb Schmoller.  Perhaps the best
  course of action would be to write to the Public Enquiry
  Office detailing the issues that Seb has raised and asking
  that they are addressed by the Enquiry.

  On the issue of the application of Section 3 of the Health &
  Safety at Work Act 1974 I think the best approach would be
  to write to Norman Fowler whose department has responsibility
  for enforcing this Section of the Act.

  I attach a couple of draft letters which you may find
  appropriate to send.  I hope this is helpful.




  Yours sincerely,

Dear


HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

We are of course all very disturbed about the Hillsborough
Disaster and the tragic loss of life. A number of other
sports grounds still have the fixed barriers of the kind
against which people were crushed to death although many
have now decided to remove them. Are you issuing any
instructions to Factory Inspectors of the Health & Safety
Executive on what advice they should give to owners of
football stadia on what they should do bearing in mind
their responsibilities under Section 3 of the Health & Safety
at Work Act? It seems to me that we shouldn't await the
outcome of the enquiry before deciding that fixed barriers
of this type which cage in supporters are a danger and should
be removed.




Yours sincerely,




MARTIN FLANNERY, M.P.

Dear Martin,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Blanche said you sight weleone some suggestions as to lines of enquiry in relation to Saturday's tragedy. The questions
below are informed by the knowledge of Civil Emergency Planning I gained while seconded to the GLC as an Esergency
Planning Officer in 1985.

It appears that the stain thrust of consent on the Disaster is concentrating onhow the stand case      to be overcrowded.

I think it is isportant to keep two issues in view.

Firstly, how stands with fixed front cage-type barriers have been allowed to be built, and secondly, why the handling af
the disaster appeared to be so cack-handed once it had occured.

In relation to point 1, it is ay view that any stand with fixed barriers to stop fans getting onto the pitch is in clear
breach of Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act, which, as you know, requires controllers of premises to
aaintain the® in such a way as not to put at risk persons who are not employees, i.e members of the public. It follows
therefore that whoever the enforcing authority is for the Health and Safety atWork Actin football grounds - either the
HSE or the local authority, ought previously to have spotted fixed barriers asa breachof HASAWA 33, and also that the
enforcing authority could now start issuing Improvement or Prohibition Notices to the owners of stands, requiring thei
to get the barriers sorted out. This need not wait till the outcome of a public enquiry. If barriers are required for
crowd control purposes, they should be like fire-doors i.e. capable of being released in an eaergency. There are clear
previous examples which ought to have drawn attention to the problem: Bradford is obvious, but so are everts like the
Manchester Woolworths Fire.

In relation to point 2, here are some specific questions:                                                                   ,
                                                                                                                            1
1.       When did the referee stop the game? When was the Stadium1s emergency plan put into effect? When was the City’s
        Civil Emergency Plan put into effect? When was the Health Authority made aware that there was a full-scale
        emergency. What were the time lags between each stage, and why were they so long? [There are some assumptions
        built in here about both the existence and activation of emergency plans. The key point is to get a detailed
        chronology of events after the game was stopped, with an emphasis on who was in command when, with what
        resources, and what coaioand-structure.]

2.       When was the stadium’s emergency plan last revised? When was it last discussed with the emergency services or
        the SV Fire and Civil Defence Authority?

3.      Froa the time the game was stopped what was the name and functional responsibility and seniority Ei.e. were they
        stadium staff, or emergency service personnel?] of the person in control of the emergency? Where were they
        located? What was their means of liaison with the main emergency services?
4.     Who suasoned the Fire and Ambulance Services, with what message Ci.e, how seriously was the emergency being
       portrayed?], and when. [It appears as if the St Johns Ambulance service were doing the business for far too
        long before the SY Ambulance Service arrived; also that there were relatively few Fireservice personnel in
        evidence in the early stages.]

5.     What was the time profile of the build up of mesical and first aid facilities?

6.     Where in the stand were police officers located, and what was their means of communication, and with whom? What
        were they advising their seniors about the scale of the problem, and when; and what response nere the senior
        officers giving?

7.     What use was made (and when) of the stadium public address, and at whose behest.

I have no doubt that all the above are issues which will be addressed by the public enquiry. Previous experience tells
lie that it is worth getting such questions "in” early, if only to ensure that the public enquiry is steered at such
questions as well as ones relating to the causes of the tragedy itself.



All the best.

Dear David   Drew,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

    Thank you for your letter regarding the above.

     I share your general viewpoint, and we shall now have to wait
for the outcome of the enquiry after the stupidity of Patnick's
outburst,for which I condemned him in Parliament on two occasions,
but could never find him during that week in Parliament, and nothing I
said appeared in the local press,although I spoke to the Star also.


                                          Best wishes,
                                     Yours sincerely,

   Dear Mrs. Thatcher

   Re: Hi 11sborough Pi saster

   Expressions of syrpathy in your reported comments, and those
   of your acolytes, on the evening of the above, are conspicuous
   by th e ir absence.

   Had not your Government insisted in fencing fans in, th is almost
   most certainly would not have happened. Before you s ta rt c ritic isin g
   the F.A. and the Police you may wish to refle ct that the buck stops
   with you.

   I suppose we will have the usual enquiry chaired by an eminent lavyer
   at great expense. However, i f you wish a comnon-sense verdict on the
   day's events you might be better employed asking John Smith,
   Peter Robinson, and some of those fans you saw on television. Any
   fool can te ll you that th is sort of problem will happen again until
   we have all seated stadia with a moat rather than a fence.       There is
   not any doubt th a t the in terest in soccer in South Yorkshire and
   Lancashire merits a large national stadium in the region for matches
   of th is type.

                                                                    /Perhaps

could be used to provide interest free loans for th is purpose and then
maybe me and my children will not yet again be looking at such scenes
on television.

Dear Minister,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER.

     We are of course, all very disturbed about the
Hillsborough Disaster, and the tragic loss of life.

      A number of other sports grounds still have the
fixed barriers of the kind against which people were
crushed to death,although many have now decided to remove
them.

     Are you issuing any instructions to Factory Inspectors
of the Health and Safety Executive on what advice they should
give to owners of football stadia, on what they should do,
bearing in mind their responsibilities under Section 3 of the
Health and Safety at Work Act?

    It seems to me that we shouldn't await the outcome of the
enquiry before deciding that fixed barriers of this type,which
cage in supporters, are a danger and should be removed.




                                             Yours sincerely,




                                         Martin Flannery.M .P .

                                                          8 August 1989




Dear Colleague,

Hillsborough Disaster and Safety at Football Grounds

I attach a copy of the recommendations made by Lord Justice Taylor in
his interim report on the Hillsborough disaster. The Home Secretary and
the Secretary of State for Scotland have urged all league clubs, local
authorities and police forces to implement the Report's recommendations
as far as is possible.

Welcoming the Report, Labour's Shadow Sports Minister Dennis Howell made
the following points:

       1.   Because of the extra police needed inside grounds to
            implement the Report, the Government must consider
            reducing police costs especially to smaller clubs.

       2.   The Government and the football authorities must
            acknowledge the Report's welcome recognition that foot­
            ball supporters' organisations have a constructive
            role to play.

       3.   The Government should give further thought to the
            measures needed to abolish perimeter fences such as
            dry moats, spring gates, etc.

Lord Taylor's final report is expected towards the end of the year. It
remains Labour's view that any changes in the law covering safety at
football grounds (including the Football Spectators' Bill) should not
proceed   until the final report has been published and consideredin
detail by all concerned. Once again, the Labour Party willoffer the
Government a positive and constructive partnership to ensure that both
the interim and final report by Lord Justice Taylor are effectively
followed up.




                                       -1-
Details of Labour's objections to the Football Spectators' Bill were set
out in Briefing Note 85 (further copies are available from my office).
Since that note was issued official police figures for league matches in
England and Wales show that last season (1988/89) there were 6,185
arrests - 2,825 inside grounds and 3,360 outside. The rate of arrests
per 100,000 spectators fell to 33 compared with 34 in 1987/88 and the
high of 40 in 1984/85.

Please note that the figure of 17,000 arrests at race meetings in 1988
given in Briefing Note 85, though taken from Hansard, has since been
corrected to 1,700»

I hope this information will prove useful as the football season gets
under way.

Yours sincerely,
                               CHAPTER 24 - TH E RECOM M ENDATIONS

  315. The recommendations which follow are the m inim um necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and other
information I have received. They complement the recommendations which M r Justice Popplewell set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

  316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
started forthwith and completed as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
★     1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
    should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

    A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
    another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

★    2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
    Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
        in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

    (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure”, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
        margin.

★     3. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★     4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
    responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
    other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
    variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★     5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
    area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
    sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
    period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
    or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
    below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates
       6. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
    duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
    crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
    demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
    different crowd densities.

★     7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
     different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.



                                                         57
★    8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

★     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either himself or via an officer close at hand.

★     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★      11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

★      12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority's rules.

        17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    o f appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters’ club. The Advisory Group’s terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club
★      18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.


                                                         58
★     19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
    as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
    turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
    accordingly.

★     20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
    reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
    operators for this purpose.

      21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
    concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★     22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
    reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
    and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
    area.

★     23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
    the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
    should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★    24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
    by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
    admitting spectators to the ground.

      25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
    entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
★    26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
    should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
    concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

★     27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
    officers on duty there should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any
    is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

★    28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
    any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
    sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

★    29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
    Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

       30.     There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
    monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
    at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
    in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
      31.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
    received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
    priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
    used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
    sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                        59
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
★      35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

★     36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

★     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

★     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
★     39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained-within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement of any Safety Certificate.

★     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.

★     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

     NEWS RELEASE
August 4, 1989.                                           01-273 4610
                  HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
                         INTERIM REPORT PUBLISHED

The Interim Report of the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry
under Lord Justice Taylor is published today. The Judge makes
extensive findings as to the cause of the disaster and in his
recommendations proposes 43 instant measures capable of being
implemented forthwith and, where possible, before the start of the
next football season.
Brief Summary of Causes
Lord Justice Taylor finds that:-

"The immediate cause of the gross overcrowding and hence the
disaster was the failure, when gate C was opened, to cut off
access to the central pens which were already overfull.
They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities had
been laid down, no attempt was made to control entry to
individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual
monitoring of crowd density.

When the influx from gate C entered pen 3, the layout of the
barriers there afforded less protection than it should and a
barrier collapsed. Again, the lack of vigilant monitoring caused a
sluggish reaction and response when the crush occurred. The small
size and number of gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So,
in the initial stages, did lack of leadership.
The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the
turnstiles. That occurred because, as both Club and police should
have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the
large numbers demanded of it unless they arrived steadily over a
lengthy period. The Operational Order and police tactics on the
day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival of
large numbers should that occur in a short period. That it might
so occur was forseeable and it did. The presence of an unruly
minority who had drunk too much aggravated the problem. So did the
Club's confused and inadequate signs and ticketing."
Interim Recommendations
The interim recommendations are designed to prevent overcrowding
and crushing on terraces in the short term and to improve safety
procedures. But Lord Justice Taylor says that they do not and
cannot meet all the problems or address all the issues of post-
Hi 11sborough footbal1.
The Judge s a y s : -

"Wider issues such as membership schemes, identity cards, all-
seater stadia, super stadia and long term recommendations fall to
be considered in my Final Report. So do a number of other specific
matters such as a comprehensive review of the Green Guide*, the
problem of excessive pre-match drinking, fans without tickets and
ticket touts."
* Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.
Lord Justice Taylor      says that further evidence and study will be
required before he       can make recommendations on these matters.
Accordingly,    he      says,   the main thrust of      the interim
recommendations, as     a holding exercise,
"is to reduce numbers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and
to achieve a proper balance in crowd control between prevention
of disorder and maintenance of safety."
The Judge has made no recommendations about taking down perimeter
fences. But he says that gates in them to the pitch should be kept
open whilst the terraces are occupied. He does, however, stress
that "it will, of course, be necessary to have a police presence
sufficient to prevent pitch invasion for improper reasons through
the open gates."

The Judge finds that in the assessment of figures for capacity,
the criteria in the Green Guide were not applied with sufficient
rigour at Hillsborough. Since this may also have been the case
elsewhere, he recommends that they should     be reassessed with
proper and realistic allowance for all the factors concerned. On
top of that, he proposes a further reduction of 15 per cent on
terraces as an interim measure to improve the safety margin.
The scope of the interim recommendations       covers the maximum
capacities for terraces, filling and monitoring terraces, fences
and gates, crush barriers, Safety Certificates, the duties of
football clubs, police planning, communications, the co-ordination
of emergency services, and first aid, medical facilities and
ambulances.

The interim recommendations are set out in full in Chapter 24 of
the report.
Part Two of the Inquiry

Lord Justice Taylor and his Assessors will now be starting work on
Part Two of the Inquiry. This will be directed to making final and
long term recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports
grounds. The Judge will be considering the large body of written
evidence submitted to him which he may want to supplement in some
instances with further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction
with his Assessors. He will also need to make a number of visits
and inspections. He has indicated that he expects to prepare his
final report and recommendations at about the turn of the year.
Note to Editors
Following the disaster at Hillsborough stadium on April 15, when
95 people were killed, Lord Justice Taylor was appointed by the
Home Secretary:-
"To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football
ground on April 15 1989 and to make recommendations about the
needs of crowd control and safety at sports events."
Lord Justice Taylor was assisted by two Assessors: Mr Brian
Johnson QPM, Chief Constable of Lancashire, and Professor Leonard
Maunder OBE, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University
of Newcastle upon Tyne. The secretary of the Inquiry was Mr Robert
Whalley from the Home Office. The investigation of the disaster
and the gathering of evidence was carried out by the West Midlands
Police under their Chief Constable Mr Geoffrey Dear, who appointed
Assistant Chief Constable Mervyn Jones to take full time charge of
the investigation. Counsel for the Inquiry were led by Mr Andrew
Collins QC. Technical tests and studies were carried out at the
Health and Safety Executive's Research and Laboratory Services
Division in Sheffield.
The hearing began on May 15 in Sheffield Town Hall, and continued
for 31 days concluding on June 29. 174 witnesses gave oral
evidence. Transcripts of the evidence came to over 3,800 pages,
and some one and a half million words in all. Lord Justice Taylor
also received some 1550 letters.
                CHAPTER 24 - THE RECOMMENDATIONS

315. The recommendations which follow are the minimum necessary
to ensure that existing football grounds can for the present be
safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at
Sheffield and other information I have received. They complement
the recommendations which Mr Justice Popplewell set out after his
inquiry at Bradford.

316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the
1989/90 season starts. The rest should be started forthwith and
completed as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces

1.    Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which
are self-contained, the Safety Certificate should specify the
maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or
area.

A pen or area is to be deemed "self-contained" notwithstanding
that it has a gate or gates affording access to another pen. or
area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

2.   Each   figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in
accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide ("the Green Guide
figure") subject to the following qualifications:-

     (a)   in arriving at "the Green Guide figure", proper and
           realistic allowance must be made £or all factors which
           should reduce the permissible density in accordance
           with the range of maximum figures specified in
           paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

     (b)   after assessing "the Green Guide figure", a deduction
           of 15% should be made to improve the safety margin.
                                  1
3.    Arrangements should be made:-

      (a)   to limit the number of spectators entering each self-
            contained pen or area to the maximum capacity figure
            assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above
            either electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing
            arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

      (b)   to close off further access to such pen or area when
            its maximum capacity is about to be reached.



Filling and Monitoring Terraces

4.   There should be a written agreement between the club and the
police setting out their respective responsibilities for crowd
safety and control and in particular for the filling of each
self-contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of
spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding.    Any
variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match
should be agreed in writing in advance.

5.   At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for
each self-contained pen or other terraced area, a steward (if the
club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police
are monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions
in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
period the area is occupied by spectators.        Whoever is so
appointed should be in addition to any other steward or police
presence.   He should have ready access to the police officer
authorised under Recommendation 9 below, and by radio to the
control room.

Fences and Gates

6.    All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to
the   terraced areas and especially those with duties under
                                  2
Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with
regard to the recognition of crowd densities, to the recognition
of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics.       Training should
include demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to
enable stewards and officers to recognise different crowd
densities.

7.   All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from
the rest of the fence and marked "Emergency Exit".

8.   Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch
should be kept fully open during the period when spectators are
on the terrace.

9.   There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence
(or group of gates if they are close together) a police officer
authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a
gate to relieve overcrowding.     The officer so authorised in
respect of each gate should be identified for each match and
known to be so by all stewards and police officers in that
vicinity.   He should be able to make radio contact with the
control room either himself or via an officer close at hand.

10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided
by the club at each ground where there are perimeter fences to
permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers
of spectators if necessary.    Agreement should be reached as to
whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards.   Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so.
Whether to use it should be a decision of a nominated senior
police officer at the ground.

Crush Barriers

11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately
for signs of corrosion.   Any barrier found to be affected by a
significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.
                                3
12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should
be reviewed immediately to ensure that it complies with the
criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide.  If it does
not, the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen
or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above,
should reflect the fact.

Safety Certificates

13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety
Certificate by the responsible local authority, which should
consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued,
the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the
building authority.   Such a review should include an inspection
of the stadium.     Its object should be to ensure that the
operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to
add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter
of urgency following the findings and recommendations in this
report.

14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports
stadium designated under the 1975 Act for which no Safety
Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to
remedy the situation.

15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local
authority at least once annually and each Certificate should
require to be renewed annually.

16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for
issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing, amending and renewing
Safety Certificates.    Such review should require that there
exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and
decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local
authority's rules.
                                4
                                                                    fl




17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions,
it should set up an Advisory Group consisting of appropriate
members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the
fire and ambulance services, of the building authority, of the
club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Advisory Group's
terms of reference should encompass all matters concerned with
crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman
from the local authority, and an effective procedure.        Its
resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to
produce regular written reports for consideration by the local
authority.

Duties of each Football Club

18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of
flow measured. Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to
ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting
spectators at the rate anticipated.

19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and
the turnstiles serving it should be such as to ensure that all
the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can
pass through the turnstiles within one hour.   If that cannot be
done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
accordingly.

20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of
the area served by them is about to be reached and arrangements
should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with
turnstile operators for this purpose.

21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to
enable crowd densities outside the ground, within concourse areas
and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and
throughout a match.

                                5
22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the
ground should be comprehensively reviewed.        It should, in
relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye­
catching, simple and clear and should be designed to ensure the
rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing area.

23. Information on tickets      should be unambiguous,    simple and
clear and should correlate       absolutely with the      information
provided in respect of each     match both outside and     inside the
ground.    Retained ticket      stubs should contain      information
necessary to guide spectators   once inside the ground.

24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in
position by a particular time should be reviewed by clubs in
conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with
the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.

25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters club
as to the provision of pre-match entertainment aimed at
attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

Police Planning

26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there
is one designated stadium or more should nominate a chief officer
to liaise with the management of each football club and local
authority concerned in respect of the safety and control of
crowds.

27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
and the pre-match briefing of all officers on duty there should
alert such officers to the importance of preventing any
overcrowding and, if any is detected, of taking appropriate steps
to remedy it.

28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium
should enable the police to cope with any foreseeable pattern in
the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It
                                  6
should provide for sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment
of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion
of the officer in command at the ground. Crowd safety should be
the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

30. There should be available in the police control room the
results of all closed circuit television monitoring outside and
inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical
counting of numbers at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any
area of the ground.     Officers in the control room should be
skilled in the interpretation and use of these data.

Communications

31. There should be sufficient operators in the police control
room to enable all radio transmissions to be received, evaluated
and answered.    The radio system should be such as to give
operators in the control room priority over, and the capacity to
override, others using the same channel.     Additional channels
should be used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the
airwaves.   Consideration should be given to sound-proofing the
control room against excessive crowd noise.

32. To complement radio communications, there should be a
completely separate system of land lines with telephone links
between the control room and key points at the ground.

33. Within the control room, there should be a public address
system to communicate with individual areas outside and inside
the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground.
Important announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to
catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in
the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on
every programme sold for every match.

34.   Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising
                                 7
boards to address the crowd. Consideration should also be given
to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to
indicate to the control room the existence of certain emergencies
or requirements.

Co-ordination of Emergency Services

35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain
through senior nominated officers regular liaison concerning
crowd safety at each stadium.

36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should
ensure that the fire service and ambulance service are given full
details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the
number of spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and
exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning
the control or movement of the crowd.     Such details should be
readily available in the control rooms of each of the emergency
services.

37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium
of emergency vehicles from all three services should be reviewed.
They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and
accessibility within the ground itself.

38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should
be briefed as to the contingency plans for the arrival of
emergency services and should be informed when such services are
called as to where and why they are required.

First Aid. Medical Facilities and Ambulances

39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one
trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The club should have
the responsibility for securing such attendance.

40.   There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms.
The   number of such rooms and the equipment to be maintained
                                 8
within then should be specified by the local authority after
taking professional medical advice and should be made a
requirement of any Safety Certificate.

41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present
at each match and available to deal with any medical exigency at
the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first
aid. He should be present at the ground at least an hour before
kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of
the match.    His whereabouts should be known to those in the
police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate
ambulance authority should be in attendance at all matches with
an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches
where larger crowds are expected should be specified by the local
authority after consultation with the ambulance service and
should be made a requirement of the Safety Certificate.

                      HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

                 STATEMENT BY THE HOME SECRETARY


Commenting today on the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's
report, the Home Secretary, the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd CBE MP said:-
ii
  I am grateful to Lord Justice Taylor and his team for completing
the first part of his inquiry in time to produce an interim report
before the start of the football season.

"■^t is an excellent report which pulls no punches about the causes
of the disaster.

"The Government welcomes the thoroughness of the report and its
recommendations. They include a number of matters which should be
dealt with without delay pending the longer-term findings of the
inquiry which will be published in the final report.

"A Home Office circular* is to be sent out immediately to local
authorities, the police, football clubs and others concerned with
the organisation of football matches, urging them to take action
on the report's recommendations so as to put as many of them into
effect as possible before the beginning of the season. Similar
steps are being taken by the Secretary of State for Scotland.

"I am satisfied that the interim report has not identified any
major shortcomings in the law on safety in sports grounds, though
clearly the Government will look at the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act and the Home Office and Scottish Office guide to safety at
sports grounds ( The Green Guide) in the light of the inquiry.

"Most of the problems which contributed to the disaster at
Hillsborough had been recognised in the past. The report reveals
serious shortcomings in applying those lessons on the part of the
police, of the club and of the local authority responsible for
the safety certificate.

"The report reveals clearly that there are major deficiencies in
the layout and organisation of the Hillsborough ground which
should have been recognised and corrected."




* A copy of the circular is attached.
The South Yorkshire Police


"It will be for the Chief Constable in the first instance to
consider  the conduct   of   individual officers and the South
Yorkshire Police collectively in the light of the inquiry and the
investigation carried out by the West Midlands Police. I shall
look to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire initially for a
report on the action he proposes to take."


Supervision of Safety Certificates

"Powers recently proposed by the Government in the Football
Spectators Bill will permit the setting up of a new authority
with powers to supervise the way in which local authorities carry
out their responsibilities for the safety of sports grounds if in
due course this is considered necessary in the light of Lord
Justice Taylor's final report.

"The tragedy would not have occurred if lessons learnt in the
past had been properly applied. It is for everyone concerned to
ensure they are applied in the future."

        into the tragic events at Hillsborough football ground Sheffield
        on 15 April has now been published. A copy of the Report is
        attached.  Further copies are available from HMSO bookshops.

        2.   The purpose of this circular is to inform recipients of the
        contents of the Report and to urge them to take required action
        without delay in order to implement, as necessary, the Inquiry's
        recommendations to improve safety arrangements at sports grounds.

        Government response

        3.   The Home Secretary has welcomed the thoroughness of the
        Report and its recommendations which he believes should be dealt
        with without delay pending the longer term findings of the
        Inquiry which will be published in its Final Report.
E.R.



       Scope of the rennimnendations

       4.   Although the scope of recommendations is wide they are aimed
       primarily at football league grounds and the international
       stadiums used for soccer and rugby where there are liable to be
       large, densely packed crowds on terraces.  Recipients should
       nonetheless consider their application to other designated sports
       grounds and sports grounds at which large crowds are in
       attendance.

       5.   The 43 recommendations are in paragraph 316.  They are in
       two categories:  the 28 asterisked are those requiring
       implementation before the start of the new football season or
       immediately thereafter; the remaining 15 are those which,
       although requiring immediate action are likely to take longer to
       put into effect.  The Home Secretary nevertheless urges
       recipients to take urgent action on both categories so as to pat
       into effect as many of the recommendations as possible before the
       start of the season.

       The guide to safety at sports grounds

       6.   It is anticipated that the Guide will be amended to reflect
       the Inquiry's findings in due course after consultation with
       appropriate bodies.  Any changes will take account of the Final
       Report's recommendations.  If there is any doubt as to the
       nature of crush barrier testing described in Annex C of the Guide
       advice can be obtained from the Home Office 01-217 5352.

       The Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

       7.   Consideration is also being given to any necessary
       enforcement of the Report's recommendations by means of a
       Statutory Instrument under section 15A of the Safety of Sports
       Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) requiring safety certificates to
       include mandatory terms and conditions.  Consultation as required
       under section 18 of the 1975 Act will first be carried out before
       any such Order is made.

       Football clubs

       8.   A copy of this circular together with the Report has been
       sent to all 92 football league clubs and the international
       stadiums in the expectation that they will co-operate fully.
       Should co-operation not be forthcoming local authorities are
       reminded of their powers under s.10 of the 1975 Act for use if
       there is judged to be a serious risk to spectators in any part of
       the ground.

       Resource implications

       9.   Whilst acknowledging that local authorities will need to
       examine current priorities in order to action the Inquiry's
E.R



      recommendations, it is not envisaged that there should be
      significant long-term resource implications for them.  The cost
      of any additional policing and/or provision of ambulance
      services at football grounds is expected to be met by the clubs
      or ground operators themselves.

      Other

      10. Any enquiries about this circular except barrier testing
      (see paragraph 6 above) should be addressed to Mr A Brown
      (01-273 2765).

      11.     Copies also go to those bodies on the attached list.

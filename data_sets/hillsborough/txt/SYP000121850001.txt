SUMMARY OF SECTIONS



PERSPECTIVE OF THE GROUND COMMANDER



The   typical     match     commander        has    many    and various

command responsibilities other than football.




He will    rely on the          experience of command                  and    on

the    experience          of      advisors.         He         will      not/

generally,        be   specifically          trained        in       policing

football     as    such,     and    will     have        only    a     partial

knowledge of safety issues.



He will regard the prevention of hooliganism inside

and       outside         the       ground          as      his          major

responsibility.         He      will    rely       principally          on    an

existing     regime       which     will     have        been    tried       and

tested.



He will     rely on the         Safety       Certificate         as     having

determined the ground and its structure as safe for

containing the crowd within its capacities.




Commanders      will   usually,        but   not always,             accept    a

general responsibility to 'manage' the crowd.

           CROWD BEHAVIOUR




           Impact of Hooliganism



    11.6   The   Police      only    attend       football     matches       in

           large     numbers       with    complexlogistical          plans

           because     of    the     history      of and     potential for

           disorder.




    11.7   Police responsibility for crowd management                       and

           safety     ensues       from    their       prominent     role    in

           policing         disorder.        Criticism         of      police

           "pre-occupation"          with      hooliganism          fails    to

           take account of why the police are there.




    11.8   Fundamental        to     the     police        strategy         for

           controlling        disorder       is    the     separation        of

           opposing     supporters         and     the    containment        of

           rival     factions       within       the    ground.       (By and

           large     football       crowds    know       the   grounds they

           attend    and do not need too much direction for

           their convenience.)

            The behaviour of supporters at Leppinos Lan^



    11.9    The    conduct of the crowd at Leppings Lane was

            exceptional,          unaccountable        and    unpredictable.

            Culpable late arrival of the crowd was coupled

            with       an    irresponsible      intent       to    breach        the

            turnstiles.




    11.10   The     crush         at     the   turnstile          was     neither

            inevitable            nor      merely      the        outcome         of

            misbehaviour by a small rrinority.




    11.11   The    intense         and     sustained    pressure          of     the

            crowd           was        sufficient      to     overwhelm            a

            considerable police effort to restore order.




    11.12   It    is    a general proposition that whatever the

            queueing         strategy       adopted,     order          cannot    be

            achieved without some level of co-operation.




    11.13   Massive          crowd       misbehaviour        can         only     be

            controlled by drastic p:lice                    action       which    in

            this    case would           have endangered the crowd and

            was not a reasonable optitn.

          ground     and    allows          the   inference that if those

          numbers     are       not    exceeded         crushing       should      not
          occur.




11.15     The    police     role       in    the certifi   •
                                             tee certification process

          is advisory and             generally has            been    restricted

         to making observations about the configuration

         and construction of grounds only in so far                                as

         those     arrangements         affect      their       strategies         of

         containment.           The police role            in     the       Officer

         Working      Party           regarding          the     Hillsborough

         Safety     Certificate             was    no      different          from

        police      involvement             in    other        parts    of        the
        country.




        Calculations about            capacities and the strength

     and        safety     of     structures            were     not     issues

     attended to by the police.




17   Capacities are fixed for discrete parts of the

     ground and "crowd distribution" relates to
I
                                       -154-



            their    containment       within       these     areas.      There

            have never been police plans                 or operations       to

            achieve even distribution within such discrete

            areas    which,    anyway,       would       be   impossible      to

            implement.        There has       always      been an inherent

            assumption    that        the     crowd      would    "naturally

            distribute"       itself within         a given area if the

            capacity was not exceeded.




    11.18   Safety     committees        have       worked       within      the

            constraint    that        football        grounds     are     often

            badly    located     and    poorly        configured.         Their

            plans    based      on     experience         have    sought      to

            compensate         for          the       inadequacies           and

            inefficiences of grounds.




    11.19   "Away    crowds"    often       have     a   knowledge      of   the

            ground, "home supporters" always do.                    There is

            a good deal of           co-operation generally between

            police, stewards and the crowd.




    11.20   Semi-finals are unique because both crowds are

            "away crowds"       although          in this case many must

            have known the ground and its limitations.
                                            -155-



11.21   Police      planning          is     based      on       the     presumption

        that     the      crowd       will       be    fairly          knowledgeable

        a si reasonably co-operative.




11.22   An    all      ticket        fixture          allows       the      inference

        that there         should be             no overcrowding,              only     a

        capacity           crowd.            Provided             there        is      no

        widespread         forgery          of    tickets          and      people     do

        not      get       in        without           tickets.              Turnstile

        policing          is    in     part       to        prevent         capacities

        being subverted in these ways.




11.23   The Safety Certificate                    fixes          crowd limits for

        different sections of                    the ground            at capacity,

        herce police plans do not entail strategies to

        prevent        overcrowding              within          ground      sections.

        As part of their general role in managing the

        crcvd       the        police        would          be     observant          and

        naturally         would       attend          to overcrowding           if     it

        was spotted.




11.24   Recognising            that     police         planning             takes     for

        grafted the            inadequacies            of    football grounds,

        there       was         nothing           so        outlandish              about

        Hillsborough that might have                             caused a typical

        police      commander          to    have       sought         to    have     the

        mat:h prevented.
SAFETY CERTIFICATE FOR HILLSBOROUGH



11.25   The     police       view     in    April       1981      after    the

        difficulties         of the      1981     semi-final       was    that

        radial fencing to sub-divide the Leppings Lane

        End     terraces       would       help    to     distribute        the

        crowd    and     they    recommended that such fencing

        be    extended back         to     the    turnstiles.          Concern

        about     the        capacity,       the       need      for     safety

        expansion       room and the         need for any              separate

        sections       to be    served by their own entrances

        were    all    issues       discussed      at     this    time.     The

        Police     having       expressed          a    view,      the     more

        detailed consideration               of    safety properly          lay

        between       South     Yorkshire         County      Council,      the

        Fire Service, the Club and its engineers.




11.26   The failure to amend the Safety Certificate in

        1981    and    1985 was absolutely crucial and this

        was a matter which fell                  to the      responsibility

        primarily       of    the    Club    and       its    engineers     and

        secondly of the Certifying Authority.




11.27   It is clear and unmistakable from the Guide to

        the Safety at Sports Ground that the

             infrastructure of             the ground        is    safe,       viable

             and    meets   the     standards        laid dovm,          lies with

             the management who must                act on the           advice    of

             qualified engineers.




     11.28   The    alterations       in 1981 and 1985                 allowed    for

             the possibility that an                 influx       of    spectators

             opting     for    the         tunnel     route        to    the     West

             terraces       could     cause         serious        overcrowding.

             This major flaw was not noticed as such by any

             of the parties involved.




     11.29   Turnstiles       act     as     a    drip      feed       and    police

             arrangements             are           based          upon          this

             consideration.           If    a gate       is opened       and      the

             crowd    surge     in,        the safety       valve       system     is

             removed.




     11.30   Sign    posting      directing         the     crowd        from     the

             turnstiles at Leppings Lane was extremely poor

             and made the option of the central                         tunnel    the

             most likely.

     11.32        The     turnstile         configuration           at        Leppings           Lane

               was          inadequate         with      a     single           bank        of        23

               turnstiles           feeding          almost    half           the    capacity.

              However,          there       was      no evidence and nothing so

              Obvious         which       would      allow     the       Police        to        take

            experience        cf this ground at capacity - there

            had     been      crly     three       such     matches     in     the

            previous nice years.



            PLANNING



    11.34   All    the     evidence was           that the     1988 plan had

            worked; deficiencies raised at the debrief had

            been       addressed,           and     it     would     have     been

            illogical net to have used it again.




    11.35   The    rules      cf the competition entailed that                   a

            mere       17 woriing days            (less,    given that there

            needed       to   be     time    to    print     the     orders    and

            brief       people)      were     available        for    planning,

            which represented a major constraint.




    11.36   In my      judgenent the plan was               no different        to

            the    sort of plan drawn by other police forces

            for other similar events.




    11.37   It    is   not desirable          to include       in a     plan   of

            this sort cc-prehensive instructions as to the

            role of each officer deployed or                       action plans

            in the event of possible contingencies such as

            late arrival z f fans.
11.3 8        The plan takes for granted that briefings will

             deal with many issues which were not stated,                                       I

             would judge this to be normal.




11.39        Whilst communications were overloaded and less

             than        perfect,        technical            constraints             meant

             there       were     few       options.             I     believe        there

             should have been a 'Command channel'                             for Chief

         Inspectors             and     above        and     I would          fault    the

         plan for not providing one,                          (or an alternative

         system)          but    I recognise            lack of         space    in the

         control box was a major limitation.




1.40     In general             terms    the         only    other      criticism           I

        would        make       of      the      plan       is   that        there    was

        probably           an    insufficient               number      of     officers

        held        in    reserve.          I    should       add      that    this    is

        not untypical.

t              have       applied       in    similar games           elsewhere.                 It

               was        always             recognised            that              separate

               disciplined          queues          could     not        be     maintained

               given      the    geography.           The     presence              of    large

               numbers      of people at the turnstiles is not of

               itself a cause for alarm.




     11.42     From 2.40 p.m.           until the opening of                    the gates

               the       situation        became       critical               and        police

^             resources          were          overwhelmed.                   Given         the

              circumstances             and         resources            available               I

              believe      the     police         deployed       in      the    only       way

              that was reasonable.                  I discount any notion of

              secondary         plans        to     contain        the        crowd       some

              distance       further          back.         (A     secondary              line

              would have split police resources and may have

              achieved      nothing;          a    secondary plan              could not

             be devised quickly;                  late arrival of supporters

             is     of    itself     no      cause     to     either          delay        the

             kick-off or take secondary action.)




    11.43    From this point on, mounted officers were                                    the

             only    effective          police       response         and        in       the

             circumstances          I     believe           they      deployed             as

             sensibly and as well as was possible.

 1.44      In    the circumstances             the     request         to open        the

           gates     was     proper           and     the       only      reasonable

           course available.




LI.45      Up     until     the     time        things          became      critical

           events    at     Leppings          Lane     were      not such as           to

           have    caused     the    commander             to     take    emergency

           action.         From     2.40       p.m.        onwards        there   was

           little that could be done that was not done.

1 1 .4 6   The     presumption        that           the    ground        had     been

           properly        engineered            to        safely        accommodate

           given     crowd    densities              allowed       the     inference

           that the crowd would distribute itself on the

           terracing         providing                nothing            unforeseen

           occurred.        The     presumption             of     officers       that

           the    crowd would        "find           its    own     level"      was     a

           direct extension of this argument and would be

           consistent with what applied elsewhere.



-1.47      The    alterations        in       1981     and        1985    seriously

           underlined the logic upon which the capacities

           had been determined.                 Responsibility for these

           design faults did not lie with the Police.

          to the kick-off.            it is       conceivable             that    they

          might       have      done,            however, it              must      be

          emphasised         that     it      is        very difficult              to

          recognise        overcrowding          in     a    crowd        of     fifty

          thousand      where    there      is     so       much     exhuberance

          and excitment.         This      is particuarly so without

         experience of watching capacity crowds.                               It is

         the        case     that     no     one            else,         including

         experienced         commentators             like        John     Motson,

         recognised the problem either.




.49      As     the        difficulties in             Leppings                  Lane

         intensified,        police     attention            in     the    control

         room was at the same time drawn to troublesome

         events on the Spion Kop and to a generality of

         responsibilities for the entire operation.



      TBE VIEW FROM THE CONTROL ROOM



50    In the event           Chief    Superintendent DUCKENFIELD

      and      Superintendent         MURRAY       had       little        option

      but      to     accede     requests         from        to     Inspector

      HAND-DAVIS and Superintendent MARSHALL in view
of their urgency.            Firstly           they deployed what

resources        they       could     from     2.40        p.m.      onwards

and secondly         they    authorised              the       opening        of

the gates when it became pressing.




The most    critical          question         is    whether               there

was negligence,          once having decided                     the gates

should     be     opened,        in     failing           to    take        some

steps     to prevent         pens       3    and     4,        which        were

already              over-crowded,                 being              further

overcrowded.           There are a number of key issues:




11.51.1     The        overcrowding            in pens          3     and     4,

                although         evident        after          the     event,

                had not been noticed                  up        until       this

                time.       This was          because          they worked

                on    the    principle          that       overcrowding

                should not occur               if    capacities             were

                not     exceeded            (which    is        the        whole

                basis       of   the        Safety        Certificate),

                because       they      were       monitoring              other

                problems              and            because                 the

                overcrowding was not obvious                          to     the

             untrained           eye.         I do        not see fault

          purpose        in        being         there was           to

          respond             sensibly                 in           any
                         -167-



          circumstances                and     they       should       have

          heard        the     order         to     open     the       gate

          over the radio.



11.51.4   It has to          be    acknowledged            that once

          the gates          were       opened        a possibility

          existed       that       the whole           area of          the

          West           Terrace                  might           become

          overcrowded             as     the      opportunity           now

          existed        for       people         without        tickets

          to     get     in.           To      this       extent        the

          police       dilemma          was       enlarged        and    on

          the face of it no                    direct      action was

          taken        concerning            it.       However,         the

          Health and Safety Executive                         analysis

          suggests that the total crowd within

          West Terraces did not in fact exceed

          the capacity.




11.51.5   It     is      understandable                    that        the

          over-crowding                in    pens     3    and     4    had

          not been recognised and that neither

          Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD nor

          Superintendent                MURRAY        were       able    to

          directly recollect the layout behind
the West Terraces so as to recognise

the     danger       of     the       incoming          crowd

making for the             tunnel      with       all    that

followed.         Nonetheless,             because        the

decision        was        a        crucial        one,      a

greater     level         of       thought    as    to    the

consequences              should       have        applied

than     seems       to    have       been    the       case.

The     very     best      of       commanders          would

have     addressed             this    question          with

more      tenacity.                 That      said         the

background        information              available        to

the     officers          was      that,     in     general

terms,     there          was       room     within        the

West Terracing for a good many more

spectators.




My     final     conclusion           would        be     that

had      the         ground           been         properly

engineered            the           consequence            of

opening        the        gates       would        in     all

probability          not       have   been profound.

There    was     no       uncontrollable             surge,

the    crowd      took         a    second    breath       on

entering the ground.             There was more

or    less    room    for    them    within       the

area    for       which   they    had    tickets.

The    problem      became   acute      and     fatal

because      of    design    flaws      which     had

not previously been exposed - design

failings      which       constituted     evident

breaches of the Green Guide.

           FINAL CONCLUSION



    12.1   The South Yorkshire Police on the basis of the

           evidence available to me planned                                 the policing

           of    this    fixture        in accordance with prevailing

           standards          in   1.-39.        Events          at    Leppings              Lane

           precipitated            a situation              they could not have

           foreseen       and      in    the      event          they       deployed           as

           well    as    circurr stances               allowed.             The    decision

           to open the gates became inevitable and was                                           a

           consequence of culpable crowd misbehaviour and

           not of any failure in policing.



    12.2   The    overcrowding              in       pens    3        and     4    occurred

           because       of    fundamental             design flaws                resulting

           from     ground         alterations              in        1981        and        1985.

           Responsibility            in     this          area    rested          primarily

           with    the    Club and           its       engineers.             Whilst           the

           police       were       rembers           of     the       Officer           Workimg

           Party        their           role         was         marginal               as      to

           engineering              ratters               and         restricted                to

           commenting on now physical structures affected

           their        strategies              in        containing              disorderly

           crowds.
                                            -   171-




    12.3   Because       of    the    comprehensive nature of police

           strategies to contain hooliganism,                              police have

           assumed a general responsibility to manage the

           crowd.        This function has to be                        understood       in

           the      context          that        the           Safety      Certificate

           provides           reasonable              tolerance            for        crowd

           density within            specified parts                 of the ground.

           This     means           that        if         capacities        are        not

           breached,          overcrowding             should        not    occur       and

           this     is    the    pivot          on    which       all     else    turns.

           There     has        never       been           a     police     policy       of

           distributing              crowds           on        terraces         or      of

           monitoring crowds with the                           specific    intention

           of     estimating         density.               Police      attention        to

           overcrowding             therefore          primarily           relates       to

           the control of turnstiles.




    12.4   The decision to open the gates was                               inevitable

           and     taken       in    difficult                 circumstances.           The

           sequence of events which ensued                           and which          now

           seems     so       inevitable              was        nothing      like       so

           obvious to those in police                           control.      They had

           not           recognised                  the          pressures             and

           contradictions            that       the    radial        fences       on    the

           West     Terracing           were          creating.            They        were




}
j
 evidently              unable        to     recall        in     detail            the

 configuration behind the West Terraces.                                        It is

 understandable                that        they     did     not       make          the

 connection             which     would       have        caused          them       to

 have secured the tunnel entrance.




Whilst            the     most        experienced           and           best       of

commanders              may have       sought        for    more          detailed

 information             before            taking     such        a        crucial

decision,                 on          the           evidence,                   Chief

Superintendent                 DUCKENFIELD          and    Superintendent

MURRAY        took        the        decision        believing             it       was

inevitable              but     presumably           in    the        knowledge

that overall,             there was room              for the             incoming

crowd.            Any     fault       on     their       part     has          to    be

considered against their lack of experience in

handling                capacity             crowds             which               was

unavoidable;             the     fact       that     policing             football

in     all    its        complexity          was     a     small          part      of

their    overall           responsibilities                and       that       they

were         in     a         crisis         situation           with           poor

communications.                 In    my     judgement          it        is    only

with    hindsight              that    their        failure          to    secure

the    tunnel           constitutes          negligence.              Whatever

the    degree       of fault falling to the police,                                 it
I                                       -   173-




~          is my    opinion the decision                 to open     the gates

           was    catastrophic because              of     serious      flaws    in

           the    design. of     the        ground      and not because          of

           police failure to manage the crowd.




    12.6   I believe this         rather obvious             truth has      been

           obscured      because       in    the       dramatic    moments       of

           tragedy art their aftermath the police profile

           was    inevitably      heightened.              The   immediacy       of

           police     ccrjiand     to       the     incident       itself       has

           focused       attention          on      decisions        compressed

           within    a frenetic time               frame    and whilst          they

           stand    to be       examined,          standing      back    in time

           from    the incident,            cooler     deliberation       allows

           the     interpretation            that       other     factors        and

           principally the structure of the ground itself

           had     set    the     stage          for     eventual       disaster

           whatever hind was at the helm.

GEN/2
 Following discussions with the Fire Service Officer it was aareed
 that the fire service would attend by the quickest possible
 routes direct to the immediate scene of any fire and as such
 no rendezvous points or pre-arranged routes could be determined.

 The main points raised, in relation to the fire service, were
 that it was imperative that the Police Control give t h e ’exact
 location of any fire or incident and as much detail as possible
 given.  No senior fire officer is on duty at the match.

To assist the fire and    ambulance services in any major disaster,
two Police Tango units    will be specifically detailed to assist,
one with the ambulance    service and the other with the fire service
The exact details will    be written into the serial order for the

 1.        MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 1 August 1985, which had been previously
circulated, were accepted as a true and accurate record.

 2.        MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

      a.   Closed Circuit Television - SUFC

Mr Smith raised a point concerning the installation of closed circuit
television saying that this had still not been provided at Sheffield United
Football ground and questioned why, in view of the suggestion that such
equipment was of vital importance.

The Chairman replied that there were legal reasons as to why the police
could not agree to being involved in the maintenance of such equipment at
the present time.

Item discharged.

 3.        CONDUCT OF PLAYERS AND OFFICIALS

Chief Superintendent Herbert stated that his senior officer regularly in
attendance at Doncaster Rovers football ground had drawn attention to his
need to speak to players and, on occasion officials, concerning bad language
used by them within the hearing of spectators in the ground.

The Chairman added that this was not the sort of conduct expected of them
and pointed out that a legal remedy was available if all else failed.
                                   - 2 -


The representatives of the football clubs agreed that this practice was
frowned upon and that it was a matter with which they could deal internally.

Item discharged.

 4.       SUPPLY OF ALCOHOL

Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), Mr Jackson, spoke on the police
powers which now exist and the policy of the Chief Constable in respect of
bars at football grounds.  It was pointed out that several of the Clubs had
now been granted licences for bars which were not accessible to the public.
It was his view that the police would not object to any further application
of this type.

Mr Darnill voiced some concern at the fact that they had previously been
lead to believe that this was so and then discovered that police objections
had been lodged resulting in extra legal costs.

Mr Dooley supported Mr Darnill but it was agreed generally that the policy
had now been established that such applications would not be objected to and
the Clubs were happy with this.  Surrounding police forces had adopted a
similar attitude.

The Chairman made comment on the fact that in the previous season arrests
had been fewer which was welcomed. Hewas unable to say whether this was
due to the new legislation but it was, at least, a good sign.

Mr Dooley thought that everyone appeared to have been made more aware of
their responsibilities in all aspects of crowd control.

Mr Chester said that one result of the legislation was that spectators were
arriving much later at the ground leading to a flood of entrants just before
kick-off.  This was the view of all the Clubs.

Chief Superintendent Meadows said that he had been pleased to see a
reduction in alcohol related incidents on motorways and other main roads
since the introduction of the new legislation.

Mr Jackson summed up and asked that no change be made to the current policy
and that it be monitored over the forthcoming season.

Item discharged.

 5.       POLICE SERVICES 1986/87 SEASON

The Chairman said that in the very near future he would be contacting
officials of all the Clubs on this subject but at this stage he invited
comment from the meeting on (a) the services provided by the police, and (b)
the amount the Clubs pay.

It was generally felt by the Club representatives that as the previous
charges had been discussed between them and the former South Yorkshire
County Council, it would be appropriate now to seek a similar meeting with
the new South Yorkshire Police Authority.

The Chairman said that steps were being taken to draw up a legal contract
between the Authority and the Clubs and in future services would be provided
on the basis of such a contract. Until this procedure had been completed he
assured the meeting that services would be provided as before. He stressed
that the Chief Constable had only limited resources to police the County
with and part of the High Court Judgment in the case of Sheffield United -v-
South Yorkshire County Council had been that if football clubs arranged a
fixture which drew those resources to it, from where they would normally be
used, then the Clubs must bear some share of the cost.  Basically, two
different things were involved.  One was the supply of police officers in
sufficient numbers to prevent trouble and this was a question of the Chief
Constable's professional judgment.  The second was the number of officers
that each Club was charged for and the applicable rate.  That amount was a
decision for the Police Authority to arrive at.

Mr Jones was anxious that the criteria laid down for police attendance
numbers was suitably scaled down for small crowds.  He was assured that the
formula provided for this.

Assistant Chief Constable (Operations), Mr Jackson, stated that he was a
member of a national working party and that if the Clubs had any strongly
felt views he would be happy to express them in that forum.

The general feeling was that small crowds resulted in police costs being
disproportionately great.  It was, however, felt that with understanding on
both sides there should be no difficulty.

Item discharged.

 6.       EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND STEWARDING

Superintendent Stuart said that he was the police officer responsible for
the operation of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act.  He saw that the Clubs
had a responsibility as well as the police.

It would be helpful if careful consideration could be given to the
appointment of a Chief Steward who could receive pre-season briefing from
the police and in turn brief the stewards prior to each match.

Mr Stuart had produced a booklet outlining police policy and with the
authority of the Chairman he distributed copies to representatives of all
the Clubs. Mr Stuart made the point that selection of stewards of the right
type and attitude was important. He also stressed that any correspondence
from the Clubs concerning the Safety of Sports Grounds Act should be
forwarded to the Chief Constable for the attention of Superintendent Stuart.

Item discharged.




There being no further business the Chairman thanked those present for their
attendance and the meeting closed at 12.30 pm.

He continued by saying that hopefully Membership Card Scheme "would promote
family areas within the ground, thus requiring less policing.   The system was a
government initiative in conjunction with the Football Association and it will
be monitored, assessed and developed accordingly.  Any comments regarding the
scheme should be forwarded to Superintendent Stuart, Operations for collation
during the season.

Exclusion Orders

The Chairman introduced this item and explained fully the system involving
Exclusion Orders and the taking of photographs.

A lengthy discussion took place regarding photographs, equipment and
installation of the same resulting in the Chairman saying that officers should
be instructed in the use of camera equipment provided. This would reducefailure
rate in film exposures.   Inspector Eggleston said that he would provide the best
equipment available within the budget, being mindful of certain failure rates
involving prisoner photography.

The Chairman asked the members views on where the Exclusion Order Index should
be kept for easy access by our officers and other forces.

Acting Detective Chief Superintendent Addis explained the full system of
Exclusion Orders and a lengthy discussion took place on the recording and
retention of the Orders.

The discussion was concluded by the Chairman saying that advice would be sought
from Superintendent Hale (Communications and Computers Department) regarding the
possibility of entering Exclusion Orders on the BODS FILE for easy accessability
and an order outlining procedures would be produced.

South Yorkshire 'Police Standing Instructions on Football

The Chairman introduced this item and said that the Orders would require some
amendments in relation to Exclusion Orders and Membership Schemes, and a new
Force Standing Order in relation to Exclusion Orders.

The order was discussed and it was accepted there was no    need for further
change.

Football Club.

MINUTES OF THE PREVIOUS MEETING

The minutes of the meeting held on 6 August 1986 which had been previously
circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record.

MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

a     Close Circuit Television

      The Chairman invited comment from the members as to the success or
      otherwise of Close.Circuit Television over the last season.

      Chief Superintendent Lodge said that the equipment at Barnsley had proved a
      success and a number of excellent arrests had resulted from it.

      He continued by saying the equipment had also proved invaluable for
      intelligence gathering.

      A short discussion took place and it was generally agreed that the
      installation of Close Circuit Televisions at football grounds within South
      Yorkshire had been a success.

      Item discharged.

b     Conduct of Players and Officials

      Mr Jackson referred to item 3 on the previous minutes and said that in
      general the conduct of players and officials was good and every
      encouragement should be given for this to continue.
       Members of the meeting agreed with the comments made by the Chairman.

        Item discharged,

c       Supply of Alcohol

        Club representatives queried the need for control of sale of alcohol in the
        grounds and said that it created a tendency to drink outside the ground and
        supporters arrived not too long before the match started.

        Mr Jackson said there was plenty of evidence by way of practical experience
        and research that alcohol was a motivating factor in the commission of
        offences and a causation of hooliganism.  He said that prior to the
        legislation he had policed a first division ground and the fans arrived not
        long before the game started having been drinking elsewhere.  He said it
        was the topping up of alcohol inside the ground that could cause problems.

        He had noticed a tendency, however, for problems to develop away from the
        grounds and that he was a member of the National Working Party who would be
        considering all such matters to try in co-operation with clubs and everyone
        else with a vested interested, to resolve the issues.  In the meantime,
        clubs and the police should continue their efforts to fight hooliganism and
        make their views known as certainly had been done so in the past.

EMERGENCY EVACUATION AND STEWARDING

The Chairman referred to documentation previously circulated outlining n°te;> of
guidance for Stewaraing and Emergency Evacuation Procedures.  He stressed the
need to ensure that there was appropriate briefing by the clubs and the
appointment of fit and responsible persons.  For our part, we would assist and
    give advice.

    It was agreed by everyone that we should continue to ensure that public safety
    was.paramount and that the high standard of awareness would continue.

    Item discharged


    EXCLUSION ORDERS

    The Chairman circulated guidance and said that from 1 August 1987 persons
    arrested at football grounds having committed certain types of offences wou      e
    subject to Exclusion Orders.

    Mr Jackson briefly outlined the procedure to obtain Exclusion Orders and its
    effect on police and football clubs.
ALL TICKET MATCHES - FANS ARRIVING AT MATCHES WITHOUT TICKETS

Chief Superintendent Lodge said that their first match of the season was Leeds
United v Barnsley and although it was an all ticket match a substantial amount
of supporters would attend without tickets.

He continued by saying that this could create policing problems and there had
been suggestions that supporters could be allowed entry to the ground but this
would defeat the object of all ticket matches.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead said that this created two police operations one
inside the ground and another outside and by allowing persons into the ground
without tickets, would lose the credibility of all ticket matches and cause
general problems for others.

Mr Broomhead continued by saying that it was general policy to publish in the
local press and the programmes that persons attending without tickets would be
turned away.

Mr Jackson agreed with the general view of the members that persons without
tickets should not be allowed entry or otherwise we-would never stop non-ticket
holders coming thus aggravating future policing operations.



MEMBERSHIP SCHEMES

The Chairman said that this was a government initiative aimed at lessening
 hooliganism at grounds.

 He noted that clubs in South Yorkshire had not gone for a scheme which included
 photographs and said it was generally felt that photographs should have been
 included on the cards.

 Mr Spinks, Secretary of Barnsley Football Club said that to date, they had not
 agreed on a Membership Scheme as the Football League Working Party had rejected
 their Scheme on a technicality and proposed an amended Scheme.

 He continued by saying that the amended scheme was unacceptable in relation to
 the segregation of members and non members and therefore was rejected by the
 club.

 Mr Spinks said that they intended resubmitting proposals back to the Football
 League Working Party and welcomed any comment the police wished to make and
 indeed invited officers to attend the ground to facilitate those actions.

 The Chairman said that Barnsley Football Club should try and resolve the
 situation with the Football League Working Party and as it was their
 responsibility to consider them and monitor them, but there was no doubt the
 police would be asked to comment to assist the future evaluations.
                                     - 4 -



Representatives from Barnsley Football Club said they would rather have no
scheme than accept proposals that were not constructive and workable.  The
Chairman said that future developments and evaluations would hopefully determine
the use of such schemes.

Item deferred.

POLICE ROOM AT OAKWELL GROUND - UP DATE

Chief Superintendent Lodge said that the new police control room at Oakwell
Football Ground would be an asset to all concerned.

He thanked the representatives of Barnsley Football Club for their help and said
that the new control room would assist in better policing especially inside the
ground, ie: camera sightings, personnel address system and possible evacuation
procedures.

The Chairman agreed and thanked everyone concerned.

Item discharged.

POLICING ARRANGEMENTS 1987/88

The Chairman said that in addition to comments made earlier under Policing
Arrangements 1986/87, we should continue to work together and any problems
encountered by football clubs within the area should be discussed with the
appropriate commander.

Mr Jackson said that football is a national sport to be enjoyed   byfamilies   and
we should strive to stamp out hooliganism in whatever form.

Item discharged.

There being no further business the meeting closed at 12.25 pm.
                    MINUTES OF THE MID SEASON FOOTBALL CONFERENCE
                  HELD AT 10.30 AM ON TUESDAY 12 JANUARY 1988

Nesbit.

Minutes of the last meeting (17 June 1987)

The minutes of the meeting held on 17 June 1987, which had been previously
circulated were accepted as a true and accurate record of that meeting.

Matters arising from the Minutes

There were no matters arising from the previous minutes - 17 June 1987.

Coach Operators/Traffic Commissioners Guidelines

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said that as a result of a
meeting with the Transport Manager of a local coach company (Ridings Travel) it
was apparent that some of the Traffic Commissioners Guidelines were not being
adhered to by Coach Operators   throughout-the country. In particular, rule 4
'coaches attending designated   events must not stop at any premises where '
intoxicating liquor is available'.

Mr Stuart continued by saying   that this guideline wasdifficult to implement as
most motorway service areas sold intoxicating liquor and bona fide supporters
who wanted to stop at such premises for ordinary refreshments were being
penalised.

He continued by saying that Ridings Travel were to lose approximately £50,000
per annum in revenue if they adhered to the guidelines as regular customers were
hiring coaches from other companies that stopped at motorway service areas
irrespective of the rule outlined.

The Chairman outlined in full the Traffic Commissioners Guidelines and the
procedure to be adopted through Mr Phillips, ACC at Greater Manchester,
Secretary to the ACP0 Sub Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events of
breaches to those Guidelines.
Superintendent Stuart said that to date only 16 breaches had been reported to Mr
Phillips this season and in percentage terms this figure appeared low taking
into account the number of supporters coaches that travel nationally each
weekend.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that it was slightly unfair on normal supporters
when executive coaches were offering to travellers, champagne breakfasts and
other similar packages in order to attract custom.  He continued by saying that
uniformity should be sought in implementing the Guidelines nationally.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that one solution may be to 'stockpile' coaches
at such locations like Tankersley and question drivers as to their schedule
stops and then escort them in a convoy of ten to the appropriate ground.

The Chairman said that the use of intelligence across forces, good planning and
appropriate deployments were important features in preventing disorder and each
match should be treated on its merits.

A short discussion took place on the Guidelines resulting in theChairman saying
that he had written to Hr Phillips about Rule 4 with a view to
it being discussed at a national level - the important thing was that we should
use all methods available that contribute to a reduction in public order.

Chief Superintendent Broomhead said that coach parking facilities were now
becoming a problem at Bramall Lane and asked if other members had similar
problems and should we as a Force be asking certain clubs to provide parking
facilities.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that wherever
possible encouragement should be given for clubs to provide appropriate parking
places.

Item discharged.

Football Intelligence

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and said that a number of Divisional
Intelligence Officers and Football Liaison Officers were contacting other Forces
directly.  This was outside the system presently being operated and frequently
created duplicity of information by the force Football Intelligence Officer, PC
Rosevear.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that he accepted information received from PC
Rosevear was correct, however, it was not always up to date and his Divisional
Intelligence Officer was in touch with the visiting teams and even the
appropriate sub division up to the kick off and beyond, thus gaining direct and
immediate information.

Chief Superintendent Mole continued by saying that it was frequently the case
for more relevant intelligence to be gathered within the last few hours to kick
off than any other period.
Chief Superintendent Kerold said that PC Rosevear was the Force Football
Intelligence Officer and he should be the person to liaise with other forces
throughout the week to avoid duplicity and after Friday evening for the other
appropriate personnel to continue in respect of fixtures in their divisions.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that it was
equally important for relevant intelligence to be gathered and disseminated up
to and including the'football fixture, than days prior to it and a balance
should be struck between those concerned.

Item discharged.

Use of CCTV at Football Stadia - Force Standing Order

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson said that this item had been raised at Chief
Superintendents Conference and certain valid points had been raised which
differed from the draft guidelines issued by the National Working Party.

In particular, viewing of CCTV, the preparation of pocket books by officers
involved in incidents recorded on tape and collusion by those officers when
preparing their pocket books.

It was generally thought that when officers had made an arrest or been involved
in an incident,   they should be allowed to view a    tape recording of that arrest
or incident and   converse prior to preparing their pocket books, these being
contrary to the Guidelines.

A short discussion took place resulting in the Chairman saying that these facts
were to be raised at the National Working party.

He continued by     saying that it had been approved    at Policy Review Committee for
tape retention     to be 12 months from recording or    corresponding fixture.

Superintendent Stuart said that a number of other forces had also expressed
their concern over the viewing of closed circuit television and the question of
collusion prior to the preparation of pocket books.

He continued by referring to problems encountered by police and comments made by
a High Court Judge when they allowed numerous viewings of a video tape to take
place after an incident at Luton Football Ground and did not keep proper
records.

Mr Stuart said that the reasoning behind using closed circuit television is to
establish the truth and create another way of presenting evidence of fact before
a court.

He continued by saying that it was thought nationally that collusion between
officers should take place during viewing the tape and advice would be
circulated to all forces in due course from MrGhandi, Deputy Director Public
Prosecutions.
The Chairman said it was essential to keep an accurate record of all viewings,
including place viewed, time, day, date, persons present and other relevant
information coming to light during the viewing, in particular, identification of
persons in the video.

A short discussion took place on this item resulting in the Chairman saying that
we should await the directive from Mr Ghandi and write the recommendations into
a draft order in due course for discussion at Policy Review Committee.

Superintendent Swann asked for advice on the purchasing of tapes and who should
provide the funding for the equipment.

The Chairman said that the purchase should be made centrally and in bulk. Chief
Superintendent Herold agreed to make arrangements for the purchase on behalf
divsions.

Item discharged.

Exclusion Orders

The Chairman introduced this item and asked members if any problems had occurred
with exclusion orders and the system adopted.

Mr Jackson continued by referring to the apparent delay in circulation of
exclusion orders by Magistrates Courts and that ACC Watson was to raise the
issue during his liaison with Magistrates Clerks with a view to speeding up the
process.

Detective Chief Superintendent Addis said that in some instances, exclusion
orders had been received as late as one week after issue, however, the telex was
being received on the day of issue.

Mr Addis said that to date, 13 exclusion orders had been made and details
forwarded to the relevant forces.

Mr Addis continued by saying that only 2 minor problems had occurred, namely
that an exclusion order had been received with a black and white photograph
instead of colour and that on 3 occasions orders had been received without
photographs, however, in general the system was working well and all members
agreed.

Mr Addis concluded by informing members that in the near future all photography
would be in colour.

Item discharged.

Spotters

The Chairman introduced this item and asked members if any problems had occurred
with the use of 'spotters'.
Superintendent Swann said that B Division had 2 full time spotters who travelled
in uniform to away fixtures.  He continued by saying that the officers provided
a deterrent, as away fans recognised them and knew that the possibility of being
identified existed.  The spotters also provided intelligence for local and home
forces on persons of interest attending away fixtures.

A short discussion took place and all members agreed that the system was working
well. The Chairman concluded by saying that the British Transport Police were
also very helpful by providing travelling spotters and intelligence.

Chief Superintendent Mole made reference to an.incident whereby one particular
force refused to provide spotters due to financial constraints and concluded by
saying that if it was to be a national scheme, all forces should participate.

The Chairman said that he would liaise with Mr Phillips on this matter.

Item discharged.

Membership Schemes

The Chairman introduced this item and asked for members views on the present
schemes.

A short discussion took place on Membership Schemes and all members (with the
exception of B Division) agreed that they were working.

Superintendent Swann said that Barnsley Football Club had not agreed with the
Football Association on a suitable scheme.

He continued by saying that Barnsley Football Ground had not initially been
designed with total segregation in mind and a membership scheme would at present
create problems in policing fixtures, however, the police and Barnsley Football
Club did agree in principle to some form of scheme being adopted.

The Chairman concluded by saying that the situation should be monitored closely
with a view to being in a position to give a police view on the subject.

Levels of Policing

The Chairman introduced this item and asked members views on current policing
levels and if the balance was right.

Superintendent Stuart made reference to the Dog Section and their attendance at
football matches.  He said that some divisions only wanted the provision of dogs
in duty time and not overtime or leave, due to financial constraints.

Mr Stuart continued by saying that it was not always possible to supply dogs in
duty time and a balance had to be struck.   In future, when dogs were being
supplied the commander will be given the option of having the full quota of dogs
offered or only those working in duty time.
                                     - 6 -



The Chairman said that it was important for commanders to identify their needs
according to the fixture, and deploy resources accordingly as members of the dog
section may be required elsewhere.

He continued by saying that the balance of handlers/dogs on overtime or leave
should be spread evenly across the force.

Community Policing at Football Matches

Mr Jackson referred to Community Policing at football matches and said that
Chief Superintendent Mole had introduced a system of using the same officer at
the same point within the ground at each fixture.

Chief Superintendent Mole said that it was similar to community policing in the
fact that the same officers was positioned in the same area of the crowd each
time.  This enabled the officer and certain supporters to become known to each
other and become a community type constable.

Mr Mole continued by saying that the system was working well and fewer resources
were now needed on the perimeter.  The officers had become known to the rowdy
element and were quick to identify contentious areas.  They also provided an
ideal intelligence gathering resource.

Chief Superintendent Mole then referred to resources and parking facilities at
Niagara Sports Ground.  He said that a problem had evolved with officers/people
visiting Hillsborough.  These people were using the parking facilities at
Niagara and therefore caused congestion resulting in emergency vehicles being
unable to move freely within the complex.

Mr Mole asked members to convey the message to officers with a view to finding
other parking facilities or to be more sensible in their mode of parking.

A short discussion took place resulting in all members agreeing that it was a
problem especially when match days at- Hillsborough coincided with other
functions at Niagara.

Item discharged.

There being no further business, the meeting closed at 11.50 am.

PLAYER BEHAVIOUR ON THE FIELD OF PLAY

This item was introduced by Mr Jackson the papers having previously been
circulated.

Ho      that following the well publicised case in Scotland,the aspect of police
intervention into incidents occurring on the field of play has been subject o
discussion at National level and the paper shows the recommended guidelines.

Following a discussion on the content of the paper the Chairman stressed that
the guidelines were still awaiting approval and are not for implementation at
this stage.

Item discharged.

CCTV/PHOTOGRAPHY - STRATEGY TO COMBAT HOOLIGANISM

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item outlining a proposed strategy to
combat hooliganism.

He said the suggested strategy based on the use of closed circuit television
 should comprise of the following:-

 Intelligence officer
 Designated arrest teams
 Post match analysis
 Follow up enquiry teams

 He said the Divisional Intelligence Officer and Underwater Search Unit Officers
 could act as the evidence gathering teams which has the added advantage of n°c
 making further demands on divisional personnel.  Also the Underwater Search Unit
 are normally committed to football in duty time on match aays.

 Concerning the designated arrest team, Mr Stuart suggested that the Crime and
 Vandal Units could fill this role supported by detective officers.
 He said the post match analysis could be achieved by the Divisional Intelligence
 O f f i c e s and the Underwater Search Unit viewing the video tapes after the match
 to identify and target offenders.

 Finally the follow up enquiry team where necessary could comprise of the Crime
 and Vandal Unit, Underwater Search personnel and divisional. CID vher
 appropriate.

 Mr Stuart informed the meeting that negotiations were s t i l l taking place
 regarding additional closed circuit television equipment, also for the
 allocation of a portable video camera.

 He said the quality of the recordings produced by the..^P°rtab^
 excellent and in contrast to the static camera inside the p o u n d s its use
 greater flexibility when covering sections of the crowd both in and outside the
  ground.
A short video film taken by a portable unit was shown to the members to show its
value when considering the matter of identification/evidence.

After a lengthy discussion on the various aspects of the strategy plan and the
use of a portable video camera, members agreed that the use of a video camera
should be implemented.

Superintendent Simpson said that officers were available as part of the usual
match day staff who had attended the Greater Manchester Police course of CCTV
operators when part of their training related to still photography. He
requested a camera for use by those officers therefore negating any further need
for a Scenes of Crime Officer.

Concerning this strategy plan Mr Jackson asked the members to sumit their views
through Superintendent Stuart within 1A days.

LOCKS ON PERIMETER FENCES

Chief Superintendent Mole introduced this item for the information of members
because other clubs were contemplating using the same locks in their perimeter
fencing as those used at Hillsborough.

He said problems have     been experienced with the retaining spring working loose
on the lock, allowing     the spectators access to the field of play.
Superintendent Murray     explained the defect and warned against using this type of
lock until the design     has been modified.

 Item discharged.

 REPORTS OF 1ST, 2ND, 3RD AND ATH DIVISION FOOTBALL SEMINARS

 Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and summarised the various matters
-raised at the mid season conference.

 a    Covert Operations

      Superintendent Stuart said that the recent well publicised court cases
      involving this type of policing indicate the problems that can arise when
      the officers are not sufficiently trained. As an alternative solution he
      suggested that an officer     should be used as a 'passive observer'. He would
      accompany the problem groups, observe and listen to what is being said and
      report back, thereafter, having no further involvement.

      Mr Jackson said that community policing on match days should be strongly
      considered whereby a number of officers are allocated the same area of the
      ground on each match day in order to identify the trouble makers,   it is
      important that these officers target and establish the identity of any
      hooligan element in their areas. He said so far we did not see the need in
      our Force to run a covert      operation and if therewas a needhis authority
      should be sought. Any advice regarding recent operations would be
      disseminated to Divisional Commanders.
                                                  - A -



               Personal Radios

               Mr Stuart said that it has been established that organised grouns         ^
               the police personal radio as a source of information for their actiSit?
               simply by standing near to an officer and listening.  To combat this t h ^
               use of earphones should be encouraged.

          c   Cameras

               For the information of the members Mr Stuart informed them that recent
               intelligence shows that some of the organised groups are making use of a
               camera to record their actions at football matches in order to boast about
               them afterwards to their friends. On one occasion to date this type of
               evidence has been found and provided the basis of a successful prosecution.

          d   Offensive Veapons

               Mr Stuart informed the meeting that supporters are known to be taping
               Stanley knife blades to their body or concealing them in turn ups of
               groundsS ^   ^    °rder t0 escape detection when searched upon entering the


      e       Football Supporters Association

              He said that representations had been made by the associations concerning
              the retention time of away supporters at the end of the game. They accent
              that there is a need for this policy but are showing some concern for the
              bona fide supporters who travel by private transport and are left in a
              vulnerable position when making their way back to the car, which is often
              parked some distance away.  They argue that by the time thev are released
              from the ground, the majority of police resources have already been
              dispersed.                                                     J
r    f        Prevention of Alcohol Act
    ...


              Mr Stuart informed the meeting that Barnsley had recently submitted papers
               or prosecution concerning the use of a transit van by away supporters and
              carrying alcohol. .

              After representations to CPS and the other associated conferences it has
              been decided that a prosecution would fail on the grounds that the vehicle
              is not adapted for the carriage of passengers.

    g         Membership Schemes

              Mr Jackson said that this matter was being examined at National level and
              research was being carried out and he would report on any developments.

              A general discussion took place on the systems pertaining in our Force and
              it was agreed that we would consider any recommendations in due course.
h   Exclusion Orders

    Superintendent Stuart informed the meeting that complaints had been
    received concerning the duration of the orders which are generally about
    three months which on occasions has been imposed at the end of the season
    and therefore expired before the start of   the new season.

    It was suggested that 12 months should be   the standard period.

    Chief Superintendent Owen said that there  had been a recent casewhere CPS
    had failed to proceed with a case because   the offender had already been
    sentenced to 9 months imprisonment relating to a separate incident and
    therefore the opportunity to impose an exclusion on him had been lost.

    Mr Jackson asked that details concerning this matter be passed to Mr Addis
    and they could be raised at the CPS/Police Working Party in the first
    instance and if we felt there was a need to take it further it could be
    discussed at the Magistrates Courts Working Party meeting. He expressed
    that we MUST have factual information that required addressing.

I   Play Offs

    Mr Stuart said that representations had been made to the football league
    concerning the lack of consultation with the police and the requirement of
    policing football matches at very short notice. As yet the Football League
    have not responded.

J   Closed Circuit Television

     Superintendent.Stuart outlined the findings of the survey by Sandridge on
     the equipment already used in the grounds.  Mr Jackson expressed the
     importance of informing him of any alterations suggested so that he could
     give the best advice available to support divisional commanders in their
     operational needs.

     Item discharged.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Fixtures 1988/89

Following the recent release of the fixtures for the forthcoming season Mr
Jackson asked the members if they presented any problems.

Chief Superintendent Mole said the Boxing Day fixture at Hillsbrough when
Newcastle are the visitors could present a problem therefore, he had asked for a
12 o'clock kick off. This was agreed.
                                     - 6 -



Mr Jackson requested that members examine the fixtures closely so that any
alterations of times could be discussed at an early stage with clubs. He
expressed the importance of feeding intelligence to Force Intelligence Unit and
measurements against that to determine resources required.  It was important for
us to ensure that we did not over or under police. This could only be achieved
by gathering all the information and intelligence together so that our
deployment was as accurate as possible.

Mr Jackson said the pre-season meeting with the Clubs was scheduled for 20 July
1988 and any items to be raised should be forwarded to Superintendent Stuart by
10 July 1988.

Item discharged.

Evacuation Procedure/Contingency Plans

Mr Jackson emphasised the need to test our contingency plans and requested that
Stewards and police officers be briefed concerning them and particularly
evacuation procedures at each pre-match briefing.

Item discharged.

3     MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES


3.1   All Ticket Matches

The Chairman promoted a discussion between members concerning the experiences
over the previous season by the Clubs and Police, when matches had been
designated "all ticket". During the discussion it was agreed that on such
occasions no severe crowd problems had taken place, however, the Clubs did
stress that they had proven to be financially detrimental to them because
many casual supporters who had decided to attend on match day were not able
to purchase tickets, therefore reducing the number of persons passing through
the turnstiles. At the conclusion of the discussion it was agreed to
continue with the existing arrangements for the forthcoming season.


3.2   Membership Schemes

Assistant Chief Constable Jackson said the whole aspect of membership schemes
was presently subject of re-examination by the Government and no doubt we
would be made aware of piroposals in the near future.

 A long discussion then took place concerning the individual schemes presently
'in operation in this area.  It was 'the opinion-of the Clubs representatives
 that they had done little to assist in reducing the problem with the
 hooligan element attending matches.

A discussion then- took place regarding the well publicised trouble^
caused by English supporters at the recent European Championships in Germany,
and it was agreed that the popular press exacerbate the situation by
'hyping u p 1 the situation at every given opportunity.

A paper giving details of charges was circulated. Assistant Chief Constable
Mr Watson stated the terms and conditions in the contract would continue
as in previous years. He explained the increases were in line with the
annual increase in pay. The difference in rates was between matches held on
Bank "Holidays as opposed to normal Saturday and mid-week fixtures.  The
charges were accepted by all the Clubs and Mr Watson said he would forward
new contracts for signature as soon as possible.

MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

There were no matters arising from the previous minutes on 27 June 1988.




CLOSED CIRCUIT TELEVISION -
Visits to Stadium by Football Trust Technical Committee

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item stating the ACPO Working

Party on the use of closed circuit television at football grounds has

completed its final report and will be published in the near future.
„e said .hat a final draft Standing Order has been completed on the use

of closed circuit TV but because it -             reference to the Wording Party

Report it will not be introduced until the report has been published.




He then referred to the survey of the existing closed circuit television

 equipment in the South Yorkshire Football League grounds which was

                                 „ k v Mr Ford of the Police Research
 carried out in November last year, by
                            r,   u a* <?flndridee. a member of the
 Scientific and Development Branch

 Technical C o ^ i t t e e assisting the Football Trust regarding the survey

 and installation of closed circuit television equipment at Football


 Stadia.



  Mr Stuart said that the systems    w e r e   examined in detail by Mr Ford and

  faults were identified on all of the- particularly the Sheffield Clubs

  and Rotherham, Barnsley in the main was quite good.          He added that

  Divisional representatives were present during the individual surveys

  who notified the Clubs of the faults requesting that they in turn notify

   the installer with instructions       to remedy the.. Also as   a point   of

   interest it was established on       the        visit tothe Barnsley      ground that

   they did not have a ■maintenance contract' and as they are required to

   meet maintenance costs the division has adopted a policy whereby the

   Club is notified of any faults
                                         a
                                         i-vio n n b are responsible for calling
                                       and the Club are

   out the engineers and paying the account.          If the Club fails to maintain

   a satisfactory closed circuit television syste. they do not fulfil their

   obligation in accordance with Football League instructions and

    objections could be made against matches taking place.
He concluded by saying that generally the systems are no better or worse

than most other grounds in the country.


Mr Stuart informed the meeting that the Football Trust has now

undertaken to purchase two full sets of tripod mounted/portable video

equipment at a cost of £ 30 ,000.00 and this will be operated by the

underwater search unit as previously arranged.    He said the equipment

will be 'delivered in the very near future.




Mr Stuart then referred to the use of closed circuit TV night matches.

He said that he had recently visited Ibrox, Scotland, where the whole

of the stadium, including stands etc. was fully lit before, during and

after the match and therefore the equipment could operate at its

maximum efficiency.   He said that he had asked the Club Secretaries to

raise this matter with their respective Boards.


Item Discharged




END OF SEASON PLAY-OFFS

The Chairman introduced this item stating that because of the problems

encountered with the end of season play offs in previous years the

Secretary of the ACP0 General Purposes Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at

Sporting Events has again written to the Football League regarding the

scheduling of matches at very short notice, which in turn causes

problems in raising the necessary Police resources.
He said that the Football Joint Management Committee had not given

a full undertaking to consult with the respective Police Forces before

finalising arrangements for matches.    However, they have been advised

that if matches are arranged without sufficient notice and with little

regard for Police resources it is open for Chief Constables to consider

whether the requirements of the Safety at Sports Grounds Act have been

satisfied.   If the provision of the required police resources cannot be

attained then the League would have to make alternative arrangements.




Item Discharged




USE OF CLOSED CIRCUIT T.V

Superintendent Stuart introduced this item and referred to the paper

previously circulated relating to the arrests following the

Barnsley v Bolton Wanderers match held on the 9 January 1988, which

highlights the benefits gained from the use of video equipment.


He said that during the game eleven Bolton supporters were arrested and

after viewing the video tape additional evidence was gathered against

them, also, as a result of viewing the tape a further six were arrested

in Bolton.   Of those seventeen only one individual pleaded 'not guilty'

but the case was subsequently proved.    At the conclusion of the cases

advice was sought from the Crown Prosecution Service about the system

adopted for presenting the video evidence and an assurance was given

that none of the evidence presented was challenged by any of the

defence solicitors.
                                   -   5   -




Mr Stuart said that one area of concern        was the length of   time that it

took   forall the defendants to be dealt with, because the         last case was

not dealt with until the 22 December 1988, nearly 12 months after the

incident.   He said that it had been suggested by the officer in charge

of the case that a joint charge of affray could have possibly ensured a

speedier conclusion to the case.




After discussion it was agreed that a joint charge of affray would often

prove to be a retrograde step when aiming for a faster conclusion to

cases, although each case must always be judged on its own merits and

the evidence available and the individuals charged accordingly.




Mr Stuart continued by saying that the lessons learnt as a result of the

 Barnsley incident were

 1.          The use of the camera and recording facilities at the

             ground must be to the highest calibre possible in order

             that the evidence produced to the Court is of          the best

             quality possible.

 2.          Equipment of the highest quality must be available to

              view the tapes if it is to be considered as useful in

              evidence.

 3.          The reviewing and use of the video tape (or its working

              copy) to provide sufficient evidence against those already

              arrested and those to be retospectively arrested is both

              time consuming and difficult.
                                 -   6   -




           Officers must be deployed solely to this duty in the

            initial stages if it's thought that the video tape will be

            produced later in evidence.




With regard to the third point it is intended that the Underwater Search

Unit have been suitably trained and will be responsible for reviewing

tapes.



Superintendent Simpson said that it was worthy of note that after the

game people had criticized the police action, but when the video was

viewed it showed that they had acted in a very professional manner.

With regards to the video tape he said that if sound was included it

would greatly enhance its evidential value.   Mr Stuart informed the

meeting that the new portable equipment also records sound.




Chief Superintendent Owen stated that the portable equipment had

already proved that it is a good deterent as on the occasion of the

Chelsea match when there was a great deal of jostling and pushing in

 the crowd but when the equipment was brought into place all the

 disoraerliness ceased.

RAISING OF MANPOWER AT FOOTBALL MATCHES

Chief Superintendent Nesbit stated that he had received criticism from

a Sergeant who regularly works       'football duty' regarding the

inconsistency of men on normal duty time and those on overtime.           He

said that a match at Barnsley had been cited when officers had attended

from E Division in duty time to find many Barnsley officers on overtime

and when he has attended Sheffield matches again Barnsley officers were

on overtime.        Mr Nesbit said that he raised this as a point for

discussion.

The Chairman said that this issue has already been raised by the

Federation and as a result a Working Party has been formed to examine

the whole issue of raising manpower at football matches and invited

Superintendent Simpson, as a member of the Working Party to update

members.

Superintendent Simpson said the problem has arose purely because some

officers feel that when compared to others working a football duty they

are losing out in monetory terms.            He said general order 22/1987 sets

out clearly the method of raising manpower, after assessing the number

of officers required, the Divisional Commander will calculate the number

of officers which can'be raised within his division, having regard to

minimum manning levels and the criteria is laid down in the following

order:

               1.      Assess the number of officers to be paid for

                       by the Club on overtime.

               2.      From duty personnel

               3.      By shift deviation
              5.   Voluntary. overtime on a working day

             6.
                      :IS6g
                   Voluntary overtime on a rest day.




 Mr Simpson said t h a t i o n        follow this criteria and then the

 balance of manpower needed is requested from other Divisions.     He said

 that compared to last'year, they had been successful in raising more
                      •f,
 manpower within Division,'/therefore requests to other Divisions for

 manpower has been reduced.'




 Regarding manpower received from other Divisions, he said that if the

 criteria laid down issrfollbwed it should produce some men in duty f*me
                      -y      rr*“-
 ana some in overtime,;T>ut in practice all are attending in overtime and

                                  -



 The Chairman said that; after minimum manning levels and other

 commitments have been;-taken into consideration then Divisional

-Commanders must supplyrihe resources required.

                      .:V~-

 Chief Superintendent Hole said that invariably, following the criteria

 the only pool of manpower readily available are the Community

Constables, which means effectively that nearly every Saturday they are

working football duty!jrbut-
                           .'they do have other commitments connected with

their respective areas and.often those commitments means that they will

incur overtime if they'.work a football match.
The Chairman asked the views of Divisional Commanders on the use of

Community Constables for football duty and it was agreed that they are

convenient pool of manpower aailable on a regular basis.     However,

Mr Mole added that Community Constables do have many commitments in

their respective areas and these should always be considered prior to

deputing that officer to 'football duty'.




The Chairman thanked members for their comments and said the important

point that has arisen as a result of the discussion is that Divisional

Commanders should examine closely the status of the manpower they

supply to other Divisions for football matches, in accordance with the

Standing Order and hopefully this will create some consistency

throughout the force.




The aspect of charges to the football clubs for the manpower used was

discussed and it was felt that clubs were not being charged sufficient

for the amount of resources they incur.     The Chairman stated that he

would pass on their views to Assistant Chief Constable Management

Services, Mr Watson, for his attention.

ANY OTHER BUSINESS

Football Watch



The Chairman informed members that details concerning 'Football Watch'

had been recently received from the West Midlands Police and invited

Chief Inspector Price to outline the detils of the Scheme to the

meeting.




Chief Inspector Price stated that early in December the details of

Football Watch were circulated to all Divisional Commanders.      He said

the scheme is a pro-active relatively low cost initiative to reduce

public disorder, to set positive and consistent standards of policing

and positive and consistent standards of crowd behaviour.     He said that

the West Midlands Police have told all their fans through leaflets,
posters, tannoy messages and through the programmes which they buy at

the ground, what will not and what will be acccepted.




They are told that obscene chanting, obscene gestures, racist remarks,

racist chants, missile throwing, threatening behaviour and criminal

activity will not be allowed.


It is a combination of persuasion, education and control and through the

persuasion education to get information from genuine supporters, from

the Supporters Club as to who are involved in the gangs, as to who are

involved in organising racist chanting etc.




Mr Price said that at Bramall Lane just before Christmas, a tannoy

message was put out at half time, stating that they would not accept

this kind of behaviour and it was warmly applauded by the great majority

in the ground.   This then raised interest from Radio Hallam, Radio

Sheffield and the local press.   He said that concern had been shown

about racist chanting and requests had been made to the Chief Constable

to do something about it.   This may be one initiative to try and satisfy

them.   From a Community Liaison point of view they would be very

interested in line with a new policy of offering whatever support they

can give to the here and now problems of the community policing.

Community Constables can go into schools and youth clubs with players

and put the message across, what will and what will not be accepted.

He said it would obviously lead to more arrests and ejections, at least

in the short term, but perhaps this is necessary as part of the overall

re-education and control to show them that they cannot get away with it.
    said that at the moment West Midlands have only asked Club

 Secretaries in South Yorkshire to put appeals in the programmes so that

 when they go to Walsall, West Brom, Wolverhampton, Birmingham, Aston

 Villa or Coventry, our supporters know they will be arrested if they

 carry out any of this action.



 After discussion the Chairman said that it is a new initiative which

 should be developed by each of the Commanders with football grounds

 within their Divisions and in order to ensure some uniformity and

 consistency with the schemes operated, Headquarters Community Liaison

 should provide administrative support, including posters etc. subject to

 finance availability.



 Superintendent Stuart suggested that the publicity to launch Football

Watch could be linked to the introduction of the tripod video equipment.

                   HILLSBOROUGH F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL - POLICING COSTS


The Police Act 1964, Section 15, provides fo r the a v a i la b il it y of Special
Police Services to any person w ithin a police force area, subject to payment
to the Police A uthority of charges on such scales as may be determined by the
A u th o rity.

Special services are t r a d it io n a l ly provided, at the request of fo o tb a ll
clubs, fo r a ll League fo o tb a ll matches and, fo r Football League matches in
South Yorkshire the p o lic in g charges are based on a scale which relates a
given number of police o ffic e rs to varying levels of crowd attendance.
Copies of the current charges per o f f ic e r and the scale of officer/crow d
attendance are attached fo r information and these c r i t e r i a fo r determining
special service charges are agreed annually in South Yorkshire in discussion
between the Clubs and the Police A uthority and incorporated in a contractual
document.

The agreed        charges fo r normal Football League matches r e f le c t th a t element of
the Police        attendance at the ground fo r deployment wholly w ithin the stadium.
The t o t a l      police attendance to aVI aspects of the fo o tb a ll match is
in e v ita b ly    much greater than the number of o ffic e rs whose services are
charged to        the Club.

FA CUP SEMI-FINALS

The p o licin g demands of a FA Cup-Semi-Final are fa r greater than the normal
League game.       A capacity crowd, with a l l - t i c k e t attendance by two "away"
clubs and associated problems lead to the deployment of between 800 and 1000
o ffic e rs and those o ffic e rs deployed solely to the in te rn a l p o licin g of the
stadium fa r exceed the normal League game. The p o licy fo r those matches is
to base special service charges on the actual number of o ffic e rs deployed
inside the stadium.

With regard to the 1988 Semi-Final the t o t a l additional p o lic in g costs fo r
th e e v e n t were      £79, 600.   Those are the costs of overtime d ir e c t ly
a ttrib u ta b le to the game and additional to the Police A uthority budget. The
charges met by the F.A. through S heffield Wednesday F.C. amounted to £39,800
and th is represented the cost, at the Special Services rates, of o ffic e rs
deployed w ithin the stadium.

The p o licin g of the 1989 event and associated costs was so d is to rte d by the
protracted events of the day and the additional police manpower called to
assist at the Stadium th a t an accurate assessment of the t o ta l costs, had the
game p ro g re s s e d n o r m a lly , is not at t h is time    possible.     However,
acknowledging th a t the to ta l manpower deployment was s im ila r to 1988, and the
number of o ffic e rs p o licin g the in te rn a ls of the Stadium was id e n tica l to
1988, i t can be estimated with reasonable a c c u r a c y th a t normal   costs and
charges fo r the 1989 game would be as fo llo w s:

Total additional cost to the Police A uthority
Special Services charges to the F.A.


(For information only, the additional overtime costs to date in respect of
a l l deployment of South Yorkshire o ffic e rs to the events of the day and
subsequent enquiries is £194,200).

FIN/FEP
  7/19/1988
Evacuation of Sports Stadia



At a meeting in 1988 with the Fire and Ambulance Service agreement was

made as to what actions would be taken.        A copy of this in the form of

a report by Inspector Sewell is attached.                                        (No ( )




1.   Following the Popplewell Report in 1986 updated plans of the ground         (N o ^   )

     were made.   Aerial photographs were also available at Hillsborough.




2.   Updated plans of the surrounding area were made at the time.




3.   Police Briefing - This was carried out in a standard fashion prior

     to each match at Hillsborough by a senior officer, usually the

     Superintendent in charge or in a major match the Chief Superintendent.

     A second briefing was held for the inspectors and sergeants when a

     detailed information was passed of the individual duties.       Maps were

     included in all Operation Orders.




4.   Briefing of Stewards - Stewards were briefed prior to matches and a

     major briefing exercise was carried out at the commencement of each

     season.




5.   Dedicated Officers at Dedicated Points - This was the practice at

     Hillsborough in particular on the perimeter track where FI officers

     had the same location for each match.      Because of the nature of the

     operation it was not possible to have identical officers throughout

     the season at other locations but the practice was for the same Sub

     Division to have the same area of the ground for each match and because




                                    -    1 -
t




         of the continuity of Sub Divisions the officers working the different

         areas very quickly became familiar with them.




    6.   Details of Deployment - Duties etc of Stewards - This was done prior

         to each season and is included in the Stewards' Instructions.              (No   )




    7.   Location and function of control points and police rooms etc -

         The main police control overlooks the ground between the West and South

         Stands, the police room being under the North Stand and the clubs

          separate control being within the South Stand.    All were linked by

          telephone and radios, both police and club.    As far as the police radio

         control was concerned this could be duplicated by means of the repeat

          system on the police Landrover used at all matches.    Pre- arranged

         messages were included in the police Operation Order and the club's

          instructions to stewards to alert both police and stewards as to

          emergency.   This was the same message used at all football grounds

         within South Yorkshire in order that police officers working at all

          the grounds would be familiar with it.




    10. Response to Emergency -




         (a)   Police officers with radios would notify an emergency.




         (b)   Stewards would notify either senior stewards who had radios or

               police officer.   The pre-arranged message would be given over the

               public address system.




                                           -   2   -
      (c)    Police officers and stewards would go to their allocated              (No

             location and take action as directed by either the radio

             or public address system.




      (d)    Communications with the referee -       Prior to each match the

             senior officer in the control spoke to the referee and made

             arrangements with him to be contacted by the inspector working

             in the players' tunnel in the event of an emergency.




      (e)    Communications with spectators would be by public address system.




11.    Evacuation Procedures -




       (a)    These were identified by means of the letter/number      allocated

              to each gate, both internal and external and access points to

              the stands.




       (b)    It would be the function of control to decide upon inaccessibility




       (c)    All gates were manned throughout the game either by police in

STATEMENT OF                        Andrew SANDERSON

DATE OF BIRTH              \
OCCUPATION OF WITNESS               Communications Assistant

ADDRESS & TELEPHONE NUMBER          South Yorkshire Police
                                    Snig Hill
                                    Sheffield




My day began in Headquarters at 0800 hours.       From there we trans­

ported some radio equipment to Hillsborough, this being spare equip­

ment to be left in the Police Control Room.       On completion of taking

this equipment into the control room, I attended the briefing.

On completion of the briefing I remained in the area of the gym­

nasium, where the issue of the radios was being conducted.        My

responsibility on the day was to make myself available in case of

communication problems.        I was in possession of a radio with an

ear receiver for the whole duration of the day.




At around 1400 hours I began to hear the radio breaking up.       At

first I assumed it to be interference but when it continued inter­

mittently I made my way over to the control room accompanied by

Chief Inspector Beal.     This being around 1420 hours to 1430 hours.




On arrival at the police control room I first changed the 'tulip'

microphone for a 'hand phone/first m i c ' taken from the spare W15U

Base Station.   The fault continued, so during a 'stop' in communi­

cations I plugged in the spare W15U 'Base Station' to the mains

supply and changed over the aerial connection.




The fitted 'Base Station' had been working on 'talk-through'.          This
is a ground to ground radio facility, so one radio can communicate

to another radio.   Therefore I switched the spare 'Base Station'

to 'talk-through', giving exactly the same communication as the

fitted 'Base Station'.



The spare 'Base Station' was situate on the floor underneath the

bench.   The box containing the spare 'Base Station' has a physical

size of 27 inches long by 11 inches high by 11 inches deep, the

mains lead and aerial lead are only of sufficient length to connect

to the spare 'Base Station' in situ and therefore I was unable to

place it on top of the Control Room bench.   This in turn meant that

the fist mic/hand phone, which is connected by a curly lead, only

just came about the level of the bench and the operator was obliged

to bend down to use it.   The loud speaker to the spare 'Base Station'

is incorporated into the set and therefore reception was at floor

level.



A hand held Motorola personal radio was therefore used by the

operator.   This enabled him to stand upright to transmit, the recep­

tion was via the loud speaker in the hand held radio itself and

it gave the Control Room equal opportunity for transmission.




The time was now about 1448 hours.   After checking the system was

working correctly I left the control room but remained at the

bottom of the steps by the gate, where I stayed for the rest of

the afternoon.




Many messages were coming over the radio, I remember the request
to open Leppings Lane gate.   That being around 1450 hours, I also
                                                       i

remember a request to delay the game, as there was still a large

crowd outside (Leppings Lane end).   Time unknown.   After 1500 hours

I remember someone asking for bolt cutters and a request for a

mortuary to be set up.   By this time I was helping in the direction

of ambulances at the south end of the stadium, by the control room

and the removal of casualty out of that gate.




Summary

At 1400 hours approximately communications began to break up.    At

around 1430 hours after the radio 'Base Station' was changed, to

the best of my knowlede the radio system was working and remained

working for the duration of the day and is still working today as

checked by Inspector Woodhead, 4.5.89 and Home Office Directorate

of Telecommunications Technicians.

From      6.00        a.m.        events           proceeded                 w ithout        any    problems




About        H.15      p.m.        I        went       to    the        perim eter           track        in    front           of     the         Spion

Hop w i t h          Police        Constable                 3082           Fletcher.          At    that         time          I    estim ate                that

the     Spion         Ho p wa s             about       t wo       thirds           fu ll,    but     looking              to       the    opposite

end     of     the     ground               there       were           far     fewer       Liverpool             supporters.                        The       two

 clubs       p e ns    on     the           Leppings           Lane          terrace         appeared            to       be    about              two

 thirds        fu ll,        there           seemed           to       be     few    supporters            in        the       outer           pens       and

 a    few    supporters                 w ell      dotted              around        the     West     Stand.               I    was       so

—s u r p r i s e d    by     the        lack       of       Liverpool               supporters            that        I    ma de       specific

 irfirererrce         to     it        to    Police           Constable              Fletcher         and        noted          the       time           as

 being       between          2.15           to    2.20           p.m.



 We     then      walked          to        the    Property                 Store      under        the    Spion            Ko p w h i c h           was

 manned        by P o l i c e           Constable                 3063        M arshall        and                                         C ivilian

 A dm inistrator.                      It    was        very       busy           under      the    Spion        Kop,          Nottingham

 Forest        fans        were         s till          arriving              in    large      numbers.               The           mood o f         those

 fans       was      good         natured           which          I    judged         from        their        routine              enquiries

 about        the      location               of    to ilets,                refreshments            and        entrances                 to       the

  terraces           and     their            general             behaviour.



 A fter       checking             that         a ll        was    in        order     at     the    property                  store,          I    walked

  w ith      Police        Constable                Fletcher                 towards         the    second            property             store          at

  the     Leppings           Lane            turnstiles.                     We w a l k e d    along           the        lower       passageway

  beneath         the      North            Stand           w h i ch was           allocated         to        Liverpool              fans.

  Moving        towards            the        Leppings             Lane           turnstiles         it        b e c a me       quite          busy       with

     supporters            entering               the       ground           to    gain      access        to     the          North       Stand.

At     the    e nd      of    the       passageway            we       passed        Sergeant             758      Morgan            w h o w as        en

route        to    the       gymnasium with                  an o f f d u t y         Police            Officer             who      had        had

h is    wallet          stolen.          At     t his      stage            I saw    nothing            abnormal              or u n t o w a r d

in     the    behaviour             of       the     c ro wd .

The     property             store       was        situated            inside       turnstiles                 1 - 1 6        a nd       on     the

ground        s ide      of       the    metal        fence            which       separated            supporters                 using         the

North        Stand       from        those          going         to    the W e s t       Stand          and      terraces.                There

was     a further             mobile           cabin       f or        programme           sellers           alongside               the        Police

property            store.          This       store       was         manned       by P o l i c e          Sergeant               1153     Booth

and     Police          Constable              3253       Campbell.                Whilst          walking             to    t his      location,

when      passing            under           the    end     of     the N o r t h         S t a n d , I had w a r n e d                  Police

Constable            Fletcher                that    on     the        occasion           of    the       semi-final                 the

previous            year,          the       area    had      resembled             a waterfall                   of    urine         from people

 using        the    s ta n d .         At    that       t im e    the       ground         wa s     dry.

At      the    property             store          matters         were       quiet         with        little          property              seized

 from        fans.           After       discussing               m eal      arrangements                 with         Sergeant            Booth

 a nd    Police          Constable             Campbell            we       left     the       store         intending               to r e t u r n

 to     the       gymnasium.                 However,         immediately                 on    leaving            I was           approached

 by     a gateman             who       was    manning            G at e     A.     This       g at e     is n o r m a l l y            used      to

 allow        Police          Officers             and     other            authorised          people            to    enter           the      ground

 without           using          the    t u r n s t i l e . The             gateman        was      in      an    agitated              state .

 He     t o l d me           that       because          the c r o w d       outside           the      g ate      was        so     heavy        he

 was     unable              to    open       the g a t e to a l l o w             authorised               access            a nd

 accordingly                 he    locked          the     gate.            I assured          him      he     had      taken           the

 correct           course          of    action,           but         during       the     course           of    ou r       discussion

 fans        started          to    appear           on    top         of    the    g ate      having           climbed            up     the

 outside           to        a height          of a b o u t       1 5 - 20    feet.            I signalled                  a nd    called        out

 to     them       to        get    off       the g at e a nd           t he y     did     in      f ac t    climb            down         to    the

outside.                 Because               of     this       situation                the    gateman          was       clearly        worneo

and aksed                 for    a Police                   O fficer          to    assist           him a t      this        gate.




My o n l y          view        of        the        crowd a t           that       stage        was        through         the     very        samll

windows             in     Gate           A,     but        I    could        see     there          was a        large         crowd    outside.

I           then   went     to        the        turnstiles                 adjacent            to     the    Gate         A but      found           only

on e P o l i c e           O fficer              who was              clearly         unable           to    leave         his     post.             It       was

engaged w i t h                  prisoners                  or        escorting            those       who       had      gained      unauthorised

access             from         the        ground.               There        were         no    supervisory               o fficers          present.

A small              number               of    o fficers              were        deployed           at    the       next      group      of

    turnstiles              but           were        fu lly          engaged.



    I       next    went        to        turnstiles                  A-G w h i c h        allowed           supporters             into      the

    ground          to     use        the       terraces.                   Then      I    saw       Inspector             W hite.       He      had          with

    him a          nu mb e r         of    officers               but       they      were       also        fu lly        engaged.             It        was

    clear          more     officers                  were        required            to    man t h e         turnstiles              1 16.               I

    radioed           a    request               to        Police        control           to     send       m o r e men t o         that

    location.               The           request               was    acknowledged.                    That       was       the    firs t       time             I

    had        u s e d my        radio,              my m e s s a g e         was     both        transm itted               and a c k n o w l e d g e d .




    For        some       time        prior            to       using        the    radio            there       had      been     interference

        large       crowd        was           present           outside            and     there          was    a       considerable               crusn.

operator              left       his        turnstile           to       remonstrate                     with       a    supporter.                 The          crush

was        so   great        outside            that       people             were           having           d ifficu lty              in    detatchm g

problem,              however,              seemed        to    be       the       number               of    people          reaching             the

first      climbing            on    top       of a        fence         which          separates              the        turnstiles             A-G

from      turnstiles               1-16.           I saw a b o u t            30     young          men       sitting           outside          this

fence      waiting           their        turn        to      climb          on    to    t he       w a l l.        Others           were

climbing          directly             to a        position             near       me        from       the    turnstile

enclosure.              On     my      arrival            these         people          were        swarming              over       the    wall.

I could          see    it w o u l d          not     h av e        been       safe          to    try a n d         force       them       b ac k

i nto      the    crowd.            In      view      of      the       desperate                 crush       below        I allowed              them

to    climb       on     to     t he     roof        of     the      turnstile,                   one     at a t i me,           and       showed          to

them       the    safe         route        b ac k       to g r o u n d        l e vel        inside           the     turnstiles               by the

way       I had    climbed             to     the        roof.          Some       of        these        men       h ad       difficulty

standing          and     had       been        drinking,                but      non was            disorderly.



A    substantial               proportion                of    these          people          were        in    possession                 of    tickets

which       they       were         waving          to     gain access.                      Others          m ad e       no    effort          to

 justify          this       means       of a c c e s s .            A       s m a ll    number           having           climbed          to       the

 turnstile             r oof       tried       to     pass        tickets            back          to    t h o se     outside          the

 turnstiles.                  I prevented                t hi s     happening.                     I became           so       engrossed             in

 ensuring          the       safety           of     these        people           that           I t oo k     no g r e a t          account          of

 what      was     happening              elsewhere.                    I was        aware          of     snatches             of    radio

 messages          about           opening           gat es ,       bu t       I was          not       aware        of    the       origin          of

 those       messages.                 The     crowd          outside             turnstiles               A-G       reduced          suddenly

 which       could        only         have        happened             by     the      opening            of G a t e s         B & C.            I did

 n ot      have    gate        C    in      view      but       I saw          the       last        of    the        crowa,         about       40-50

 entering          via        gate       B,    which          I saw was              o pen.             Shortly after                 the       cro w d s

 outside          turnstiles                A-G      r e du ce d,         th e     same           happened           outside          turnstiles

    1-16    indicating              t ha t     Gate         A had         also          been       open.            When       that     crowd

    reduced        to     such an             extent           t ha t     it      filled           about        half       of     the      enclosure

    within       the     permiter             g a te s ,       I managed                to    signal           to     Inspector            Hand-

    Davis,       Mounted           Department                 and    he       directed              one    of       his        officers          into

    the    enclosure            and      t ha t      officer             prevented                any more            supporters                climbing

into     t he       ground.




I gauge         that        t he     mood         of    the    supporters                 t ha t    I c am e        i nt o      contact          with

was     mixed.            Some       were         abusive       and        had       been      drinking.               Others          were

abusive         about          what       they         considerd           to    be       lack      of P o l i c e         action          to

prevent         crushing             outside            the    turnstiles.                    Many were             simply         fearful

that     serious            injury would                  occur       at    the       turnstiles.                   The      majority

demanded            Police          action         to     reduce          the    cr ush.           There        is     no       doubt       in m y

mind      that       the       most       appropriate                action          in the         circumstances                  was      to

open     gates        A,B       &    C    to      prevent        injuries              in the           c ru s h.      1 did          not       see

the     actions           of    t he       crowd        when     th e      gates          were      opened          because           it w as

necessary            to     ensure          the        safety        of    those          people         climbing            i nto     the

ground.




With      matters           under          control           outside        the        turnstiles,              I returned                 to    the

ground        and     was       rejoined               by P o l i c e      Constable               Fletcher.               Within          a f ew

moments         a    clear          radio         message        was       transmitted                  directing            officers            on

to     t he   pitch         in f r o n t          of    Leppings           Lane        terrace.             A   large           number          of

officers            ran     i nto        the      ground       and        went       in    the      direction              of    the       pitch.




I then        went        with       Police            Constable           Fletcher            towards          the        S p i o n K op.            As

we     passed        th e      area       where         I had        warned          Police         Constable              Fletcher             of

t he    waterfall              of    urine         I saw       there        was       a    l a rg e      patch       of      ground

covered         in    liquid             which         I took        to    be    urin e.            We     then walked                to    the

perimeter            track          in    front         of    th e    Spion          K o p.        I could          se e     large         numbers

of     people        including              Police           Officers           on    the      pitch         in f r o n t        of    the

Leppings            Lane       terraces.                I could           see    fans         climbing          from         the      terrace

into      the       West       Stand.             After       what        seemed          like      a    period        of       many

minutes,            Police          Officers            and    civilians              began         carrying           casualties

towards         the       Spion          K op .        A St.     Johns          Ambulanceman and                     a South           Yorkshire

                                                                                                                                           R1E9

            ambulance          drove        onto     t he      pi tch.       A    short    time       later        I heard        a    radio

            message        repeated          at      least       o nc e    from Police          Constable           £988    Burkinshaw

            stating        there       was      a   need       to   set     up a t e m p o r a r y        mortuary.         I passed,

            this        message       to a      s e n i or     ambulance          officer,       using        the    radio        in a n

            ambulance          s e r i »l    wange         Rover      to    indicate       to    him       th e    severity           of    the

                incident.




                I then went       to     t he       gymnasium         to    try an d      organise          the     reception

            of     casualties.              Within         a   short       space    of    time       it    became

            apparent           that     large        numbers         of    casualties          had    occurred.            Having

            ascertained           that       casualties             were     being       taken       to    t he    Northern           General

            Hospital,           I travelled            with Police               Constables          Fletcher        and    538 Horn              to

                that    hospital       to    carry         out      hospital       liaison       duties           whice    a re

                specifically          allocated            to C o m m u n i t y    Liaison       Officers           in th e       event       of       i
                major    disaster.           We      arrived         at    hospital       at    4.00       p.m.




                I did    not    handle       any      bodies         at    the    ground.

      We     then      walked              to        the    P ro p ertjlsto re                  under        the        Spion          Kop w h i c h           was

      m anned        by P o l i c e             Constable              3063            M arshall        and                                            C iv ilia n

      Adm inistrator.                          It     was      very         busy           under      the    Spion           Kop,          Nottingham

      Forest         fans        were           s till         arriving                in    large      numbers.                  The           mood       of t h o s e

      fans       was       qood           natured           which           I    judged         from        their           routine              enquiries

      about        the      location                   o f toilets,                   refreshments               and        entrances                 to t h e

      terraces             and       their             general          behaviour.



      After        checking                tnat all was                     in        order     at the p r o p e r t y                     store,          I walked

      with P o l i c e           Constable                   Fletcher                 towards         the        second           property             store at

      the     Leppings               Lane            turnstiles.                      We w a l k e d    along           the           lower       passageway

         beneath       the       North               Stand        which          was        allocated             to    Liverpool                 fans.

      Moving         towards               the         Leppings             Lane           turnstiles             it    b e c a me          quite          busy    with

         supporters              entering                the      ground              to    gain      access           to     the          North       Stand.

At     the     end      of     th e      passageway                  we     passed       Sergeant            75 8      Morgan         who      was     en

route         to    the      gymnasium               with        an       off     duty      Police          Officer         who       had      had

his     wallet          stolen.             At     this         stage        I sa w      nothing            abnormal           or     untoward

in     t he    behaviour               of    th e      crowd.

The     property             store          was      situated               inside       turnstiles               1 - 1 6        and      on    the

ground         s id e     of      t he      metal         fence           which       separated             supporters              using       the

North         Stand       from         those         going           to     the      West    Stand          and     terraces.             There

was     a further              mobile            cabin          for       programme          sellers             alongside            the      Police

property            store.         This          store          wa s      manned       by P o l i c e        Sergeant            1153         Booth

and     Police          Constable                3253       Campbell.                 Whilst       walking             to   this         location,

when      passing            under          the      end        of     the      North       Stand,          I had       warned           Police

Constable            Fletcher               t ha t     on       the       occasion          of    the       semi-final              the

previous            year,         th e      area       had       resembled             a waterfall                of    urine         from      people

using         the    stand.            At    that         time         the      ground       was       dry.

At     the     property            store           matters             were       quiet      with       little          property              seized

from      fa ns.          After          discussing                  meal       arrangements                with       Sergeant            Booth

and     Police          Constable                Campbell              we    left      the       store       intending              to    return

to     th e    gymnasium.                   However,             immediately                on    leaving           I wa s       approached

by     a gateman             who       was       manning             Gate       A.    This       gate       is    normally            used      to

allow         Police         Officers              and      other           authorised            people          to    enter         the      ground

without            using       the       turnstile.                  The     gateman         was       in    an     agitated             st a t e .

He     told         me t h a t         because            the c r o w d      outside          the      gate       was       so      heavy       he

wa s    unable            to    open         the g a t e to            allow         authorised             access          an d

accordingly               he      locked           the      gate.           I assured            him    he       had    taken         the

correct            course         of     action,            bu t       during         the    course          of     our     discussion

fans      started            to    appear            on     to p       of    the      gate       having          climbed         up      the

outside             to a h e i g h t             of a b o u t     15-20         feet.        I signalled                an d     called          out

to     them         to get        off        the g a t e a nd              they      did     in   fact        climb         down         to    the

outside.           Because              of    this       situation          the       gateman            was    clearly           worried

and    aksed       for       a Police             Officer        to a s s i s t            h i m at      this       gate.




My    only    view       of        the       crowd       at    t hat      stage       was        through           the     very      san.ll

windows        in G a t e          A,    but       I could          see    there           was     a    large        crowd      outside.

I then       went       to     the       turnstiles              adjacent             to    the        Gate    A but         found       only

one       Police       Officer           who       was     clearly         unable           to     leave        his       post.         It was

my    assumption              that       all        other      officers              deployed           at    this        position           were

engaged        with          prisoners              or    escorting             those        who       had g a ine d         unauthorised

access        from       the       ground.               There      were        no    supervisory               officers             present.

A     small    number          of        officers          were        deployed            at     the        next    group        of

 turnstiles             but    were           fully       engaged.



 I next       went       to        turnstiles             A-G w hich            allowed           supporters               into      the

 ground       to       use     the       terraces.              Then       I saw           Inspector           White.           He      had    with

 him      a number            of    officers             but     they       were also            fully         engaged.              It w a s               !

 clear       more       officers              were       required           to       man     the       turnstiles             1-16.      I                  f

    location.           The        request          was       acknowledged.                   That       was       the     first        time       I

    had    used my        radio,             my    message          was     bothtransmitted                    and        acknowledged,                     j




    For     some       time    prior          to     using       the      radio        there           had     been       interference

    and     distortion             of    messages             but    all        the    message               I had    heard        had       seen


     intelligible.

     officers          were        present.              I could          see    through               the    turnstiles             tnat      a

     large    crowd          was        present          outside        and      there           was     a    considerable              crush.

turnstiles             and     there       were      a number              of       reasons           for    this.           One

turnstile           operator            was     elderly and                worked          slowly.               One     younger

operator        left          h i s 't u r n s t i l e      to      remonstrate                with     a supporter.                    The         crush

was    so    great        outside          that          people          were       having        difficulty                in. d e t a t c h i n g

themselves              from      the     crowd        to    enter         the       t u r n s t i 1e s .         The       greatest

problem,           however,             seemed       to     be      the      number        of     people          reaching           the

turnstiles              who     had      the     wrong        ticket,           who       tried        to     pay      to    gain       admission

or w h o     attempted              to    gain       unauthorised                   admission.



As     those       who       succeded          in    passing             through          the      turnstiles               entered             the

ground       they        approached              Police             Officers          directly.               Some       were       abusive

and     offensive,               but     the     over-riding                   impression             I gained           from       them            was

of     panic       and       fear       that     serious              injuries            or    death were             about        to      occur

 in    the   crush           outside.



 The    information                passed        to me           by      those       supporters              c omp I-*                      my


 somewhat           restrictive                vision        of         what    was       happening              through          the

 turnstiles,              convinced             me     that         action          was    needed           to    relieve           the

 pressure           on    the       crowd       outside.                 I passed          a     radio       message           to    this

 effect        to      Police         Control          with         a    view       to    action        being          taken        outside

 the    ground.               I do       not     recall          this      message             being        acknowledged.                       i

 directed           officers,             including              Police         Constable              Fletcher,             to     assist

 supporters              in     through          the      turnstiles                as    quickly           as    possible.                 1

 instructed              that       everybody             should          be    allowed            in w i t h       or      without             the

 correct           ticket,          whether          authorised                or    not.



 Within        a       short      time      of      my    first          radio       message,               Inspector            Delaney            and

from       turnstiles           1-16.           I saw abo ut             30    young          men      sitting         outside           this

enclosure.              On m y       arrival           these       people          were        swarming            over     th e    wall.

I    could       see     it w o u l d      not     have          been     safe       to       try and         force        them     back

to     climb      on     to    the      roof      of       the    turnstile,              one     at a         time,       and     showed           to

way       I had     climbed          to    the        roof.        Some        of       these       men       had    difficulty

    messages       about        opening           gates,          but I w a s           not      aware        of     the    origin            of

    those m e s s a g e s .          The    crowd           outside           turnstiles            A-G        reduced       suddenly

    which    could        only       have h a p p e n e d Dy the                    opening         of G a t e s       B & C.             I did

    not    have     gate       C in view but                 I saw the              l ast      of the          crowd,       about 40-50

    entering        via       gate      B, w h i c h        I saw w a s         open.            Shortly a f t e r            the        crowds

    outside t u r n s t i l e s A - G             reduced,             th e    same happened outside                          turnstiles

    1-16 i n dicati ng' t h a t G a t e A h a d a l s o                         been          open.           When    that       crowd

    reduced         to     such an         extent           that       it     filled a b o u t              half     of    the      enclosure

    within       the     permiter          gates,           I managed              to    signal          to    Inspector           Hano-

    Davis,        Mounted          Department              and    he    directed              one      of     his    officers            into

    the    enclosure           and      that      officer             prevented           a n y more           supporters               climbing

                                                                                                                                       R 129

into    th e    ground.




I gauge        that       the       mood       of    th e    supporters                 that    I came         i nto       contact          with

was    mixed.            Some       were       abusive         and      had        been     drinking.             Others          were

abusive        about          what       they       considerd           to     be       lack    of P o l i c e        action          to

prevent        crushing             outside          the     turnstiles.                  Many were            simply        fearful

that    serious           injury would                 occur       at     the       turnstiles.                T he    majority

demanded        Police             action       to     reduce          t he    c r u sh .      There        is    no       doubt       in m y

mind    that        the       most      appropriate               action           in    the    circumstances                was       to

open    gates        A,B       & C       to    prevent         injuries             in the          c rus h.      I did          not       see

the    actions           of    t he      crowd wh e n          th e     gates           were    opened         because           it w as

necessary           to    ensure          the       safety        of    those           people       climbing          i nt o     the

ground.




With    matters           under          control          outside         the       turnstiles,             1 returned                to    the

ground      and      was       rejoined             by P o l i c e      Constable              Fletcher.              Within          a f ew

moments        a    clear          r a di o    message         was      transmitted                 directing          officers             on

to    the   pitch         in f r o n t         of    Leppings           Lane        terrace.            A   l a rg e       number          of

officers           ran    i nt o        the    ground        and       went        in the       direction             of    the       pitch.




I then      went         with       Police          Constable           Fletcher            towards         the       Spion       H op.          As

we    passed        the       area where             I had w a r n e d             Police       Constable             Fletcher             of

the    waterfall              of    urine       I s aw       there        was       a    lar ge      patch       of    ground

covered        in    liquid             which       I t oo k      to    be     urine.           We     then      walked          to    the

perimeter           track          in    front       of     the    Spion           Kop.        I could         see     large          numbers

of    people        including             Police          Officers            on    the     pitch       in f r o n t        of    the

Leppings           Lane       terraces,              I could           see     fans       climbing          from       the       terrace

into    the        West       Stand.           After        what       seemed           like    a    period       of       many

minutes,           Police          Officers          and     civilians              began       carrying          casualties

towards        the       Spion          Kop.        A St.      Johns          Ambulanceman and                   a South          Yorkshire

      *                                                                                  R 129

 ambulance         drove          onto    the     pitch.        A short       time       later       I     heard       a    radio

 message       repeated            at    least      once      from    P olice      Constable             2988     Burkinshaw

 stating       there         was' a      need     to   set     up a    temporary             mortuary.            I    passed

 this       message        t o a s e n i or ambulance o f f i c e r ,               using        the       radio       in       an

  incident.



  I   then    went      to    the       gymnasium        to    try    and    organise          the       reception

 of    casualties.                W ithin    a    short       space    of    time       it    b e c a me

 apparent          that      large       numbers        of    casualties          had    occurred.               Having

  ascertained           that       casualties           were    being       taken       to    the    Northern              General

  H ospital,        I   travelled           w ith      Police       Constables          Fletcher           and    538       Horn       to

  I   did    not    handle         any    bodies        at    the    ground.

Approximately          2.40       pm.        Young      Police       Constable          with    'stupid and       legless'

drunk   wandering           about       in concourse            at    rear A-G          turnstiles.         Did not know

where     to    go.        Took       him    to Police          Room.         Had     to   support      drunk    all    way.

(Police Constable 1719 or 1715 or similar).

2.45 pm                Checked        watch       leaving       police        room,      radio message,         "Get    some

more    horses        up    here"       (or       similar).           Auto     -    assumed      Leppings       Lane    end.

Unknown        officer      said,       "Sounds         like    its     getting         busy    at   your    end Harry".

Returned       to Leppings Lane                  end via route under North Stand.                         Getting busy.

Concourse       rear       11-16.        Climbing         over       wall     above     gate     'B'.     Joined Police

Constables        at       'B'    gate       entice       down.         Fans        distrustful.            Waving     their

tickets.         Inspector         John Bennett had climbed onto turnstile roof to deal.
                                                             -   n    _
                                                                                                                                  £   ?



Aware    of     the    crush outside           11-16     turnstiles.                Coming through very slowly.

Stepped        away    from     turnstiles          to watch              Inspector Bennett         but        two   or    three

times      I    was     pulled        by    Liverpool            people       who     hadgot        inside       who       were

complaining           about the crush outside.                       "You should       beout there.              People are

gonna get killed".

Through        the gate in the wall between the two concourses at the rear of two

sets of turnstiles.                  I became aware of a movement of people.                               From previous

experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

for waiting friends responding to a kick off or crowd cheer or similar.                                                           I

stepped        through        into    the    concourse           behind A-G.           (Not    sure       whether         pulled

again by fans).

Twice called on radio using allocated call sign 'India 7'*

I seemed to recall that all the turnstiles had stopped.                                            Men were screaming

trapped        in     them.      Gate       'C' was    open and peoplewere coming                        through.            The

terror         in     the     turnstiles communicated                      itself      to     me     and        brought      the

seriousness of the situation to mind.

I went out through gate 'C'.

I remember           standing        alongside        Inspectors            Graham Delaney and Bob Purdy and

Sergeant John Morgan pulling people                              out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                              I

feared some would be killed.                      Some were reluctant to come.                        I think they had

got   so       close    to     the    turnstiles        they         had     the    single    intention          of passing

through.            I shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the iron

bar   that      is a continuation of the wall                             housing gate       'C'.        The    crush quite

suddenly        eased.          I    saw     gate      'B'       had       been    opened.         The     queues         became

controllable           and    containable        again.              The     two turnstiles         nearest          gate    'C'

appeared to function again.                      Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of
                                                           - 5 -



this agitated crowd fans who produced tickets.                            I told the stewards on gate

'C' to take the stubs.

By now I have no idea of time or what is happening outside.

By word of mouth information passed,                        "Inside - Pitch invasion".               Went to the

pitch via rear of police                 control box and down the first steps                       in the South

Stand.       I saw no players or officials on the pitch.

The   invasion appeared to have                    spread as far as the penalty spot.                   I got on

to the pitch and had got near to the goal post when I noticed those on the

pitch were not running                towards        opponents end or away from Police Officers.

Some were holding themselves,                      others lying down.      I looked towards the fence

holding       back    fans       in   the    Leppings       Lane   terraces.         Police     Officers     were

standing       on    the    fence     and    leaning       over.   Through     the    gaps     in    the   legs I

could see the faces of fans pressed against the fence.                                I realised they were

stood       up dead.       The gate         to this pen was opened.            I think it was number 3

gate.

Automatically          (or it seemed) Police Officers formed a double line up to the

gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                             When there was no one

at your end of the line                  to pass on the casualty, you carried it on to the

pitch.        Police       Constable        2417    Pete    Rotchel    and I carried          the    unconscious

body of a 14 years old boy,                   dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

to    the    pitch.        I felt     his     heart    beat    but his    breathing      was        so extremely

shallow that I thought he was dead.                        We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

realised       he    was    in    fact      breathing       himself.     We    did    not     interrupt     this

natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

and protected.             I remember as I was kneeling over him that I was kicked in

the back.       I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.

         People       came     with     a board       and    this    boy    was     carried     away.       More       came     with

         another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                                                   I

         remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

         I   turned     and       saw behind me          a fireman         apply    cardiac massage              to a male        in

         early     thirties.             He    then    gave oral      resuscitation            and    I knelt         beside     the

         casualty to do cardiac massage.                       As   the fireman         sat back he signalled me                 not

         to continue.             We checked for vital              life signs,         there were none.               I covered

         the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.

         I heard someone say,                 "They're charging".             I looked towards the Spion Kop and

         saw     people      on    the    field       moving    towards       it.       They    were    not      running.         It

         looked as though a confrontation was imminent.                                  I went beyond the half way

         line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.                                    There was a line across

         the    width     of      the    pitch.       This     halted the progress              of the Liverpool               fans.

         Some    of them were crying.                  Some were          frustrated.      Some were angry.               It did

         not help to hear the                  mass of Notts fans behindchanting                      and goading.            They

         seemed unaware of the tragedy.

         4.20    pm            This was         the first lull in the sequence ofevents since                              I left

         the police room.               I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.                         I became aware that

         my radio was still working.                     There were public address announcements and the

         ground slowly emptied.

         5-00 pm               Given hot        drinks.        Mustered serials            in North Stand and spoke

         to officers distressed by experiences.

         About     5-30      pm    I    went    to    gymnasium       which       was   being        used   as    a    temporary

         mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

         11.00 pm              Went off        duty from the gymnasium.

2.45    pm              Checked        watch     leaving      police       room,      radio message,           "Get    some

more    horses        up    here"        (or    similar).           Auto    -     assumed      Leppings        Lane     end.

Unknown      officer        said,       "Sounds        like   its    getting          busy    at   your    end Harry".

Returned      to Leppings              Lane end via route under North Stand.                            Getting busy.

Concourse      rear        11-16.        Climbing       over wall          above      gate     ’B ’.    Joined Police

Constables         at      ’B ’   gate       entice     down.         Fans       distrustful.             Waving      their

tickets.       Inspector           John Bennett had climbed onto turnstile roof to deal.
Aware    of     the    crush outside            11-16     turnstiles.          Coming through very             slowly.

Stepped        away    from    turnstiles          to    watch       Inspector Bennett         but    two   or     three

times      I    was     pulled       by    Liverpool           people    who     had    got     inside      who    were

complaining about the crush outside.                             "You should be out there.               People are

gonna get killed".

Through the gate in the wall between the two concourses at the rear of two

sets of turnstiles.                 I became aware of a movement of people.                           From previous

experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

for waiting friends responding to a kick off or crowd cheer or similar.                                                I

stepped        through       into    the   concourse           behind A-G.        (Not sure          whether      pulled

again by fans).

Twice called on radio using allocated call sign 'India 7'*

I seemed to recall that all the turnstiles had stopped.                                       Men were screaming

trapped        in    them.     Gate       'C'   was     open and people were            coming        through.       The

terror         in     the    turnstiles         communicated            itself    to    me     and     brought       the

seriousness of the situation to mind.

I went out through gate 'C'.

I   remember         standing       alongside      Inspectors          Graham Delaney and Bob Purdy and

Sergeant John Morgan pulling people out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                                                I

feared some would be killed.                     Some were reluctant to come.                   I think they had

got   so       close    to    the    turnstiles          they    had    the single      intention        of passing

through.            I shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the iron

bar   that      is a continuation of the                      wall   housing gate       'C'.        The crush quite

suddenly        eased.         I    saw     gate        'B'    had    been    opened.         The    queues      became

controllable           and    containable        again.          The    two    turnstiles      nearest      gate     'C'

appeared to function again.                      Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of
this agitated crowd fans who produced tickets.                              I told the stewards on gate

'C' to take the stubs.

By now I have no idea of time or what is happening outside.

By word of mouth information passed,                        "Inside - Pitch invasion".                Went to the

pitch via rear of police                  control box and down the first steps                       in the South

Stand.      I saw no players or officials on the pitch.

The    invasion appeared to have                    spread as far as the penalty spot.                   I got on

to the pitch and had got near to the goal post when I noticed those on the

pitch were not running                 towards       opponents end or away         from Police Officers.

Some were holding themselves,                   others lying down.           I looked towards the fence

holding     back     fans         in   the    Leppings       Lane terraces.        Police       Officers     were

standing     on    the    fence        and    leaning       over.    Through     the    gaps    in    the legs   I

could see the faces of                 fans pressed against the fence.                 I realised they were

stood up dead.           The gate         to this pen was            opened.     I think it was number 3

gate.

Automatically        (or it seemed) Police Officers formed a double line up to the

gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                               When there was no one

at your end of           the line         to pass on the casualty, you carried it on to the

pitch.       Police      Constable           2417    Pete   Rotchel    and I carried           the    unconscious

body of a 14 years old boy,                    dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

to    the   pitch.       I    felt     his     heart    beat   but    his   breathing     was        so extremely

shallow that I thought he was dead.                         We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

realised     he    was       in    fact      breathing      himself.        We   did    not    interrupt     this

natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

and protected.           I remember as I was kneeling over him that I was kicked in

the back.      I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.
People       came     with a board           and    this   boy    was    carried      away.       More      came    with

another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                                                 I

remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

I   turned     and       saw behind me          a   fireman      apply    cardiac      massage         to a male      in

early     thirties.             He    then    gave oral      resuscitation           and    I knelt beside           the

casualty to do cardiac massage.                       As   the fireman        sat back he signalled me               not

to continue.             We checked for vital              life signs,        there were none.              I covered

the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.

I heard someone say,                 "They're charging".           I looked towards the Spion Kop and

saw     people      on    the    field       moving    towards     it.        They    were    not running.            It

looked as though a confrontation was imminent.                                 I went beyond the half way

line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.                                   There was a line across

the    width     of      the    pitch.       This     halted the progress             of the Liverpool             fans.

Some of them were crying.                     Some were      frustrated.         Some were angry.              It did

not help to hear the                  mass of Notts fans behind chanting                    and goading.           They

seemed unaware of the tragedy.

4.20    pm            This was         the first lull in the sequence ofevents since                           I left

the police room.               I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.                        I became aware that

my radio was still working.                    There were public address announcements and the

ground slowly emptied.

5-00 pm               Given hot        drinks.        Mustered serials           in North Stand and spoke

to officers distressed by experiences.

About    5-30       pm    I    went    to    gymnasium      which       was   being        used   as    a   temporary

mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

11.00 pm              Went off        duty from the gymnasium.

they had to cover.,' Most of them nodded their heads.   No one revealed

any doubt.     I told.them they would have to make sure people got to

their   places and that        police officers would only be able to assist

them in the function in the most e x t r e m e                   cases because a capacity

crowd was expected.          I read out the emergency and evacuation                               ' .

procedures    contained in Appendix A (-1) of the Operational Briefing

Notes..

From the time of the briefing until                     1    received a verbal message of a

pitch invasion      it is my belief that the stewards                          remained at their

posts and discharged their duties                    in an efficient manner.



I nave been asked         to expand upon what                instructions          I have     received in

the past about,      and what my understanding                     is as to whose             responsibility

it is to check and monitor the capacity each pen holds at any time

before and during the match and their                        rate of fill.

In all the time      X have      policed matches at this ground to the best of

my knowledge     1 have never received any specifi c.instructions as to

monitoring    content and rate of fill                  of the pens and. stands.

From my past experience            I know there             is in the adminstrative               block

beneath the South Stand a computer                    room.

I have seen on screens there,                figures displayed showing the. current

number of people which have passed through each individual                                     turnstile
                                                                                                              PAGE        3

            admitting           them to the various sections                 of the- ground.

             1   know that the                 police    control    box has telephone     communication with

             this      room and have               instant access      to the head count of fans who have

             passted through                the    turnstiles.           *

             Bearing         ini mind this knowledge and the'.'ifact that the police Control

             box     is situated at the                  corner of the Sibuth Stand and Lappings Lane

             Terraces          1 have, always' exercised the common sens-e approach that, the

             g r o u n d ..c o m m a n d e r    in the    control    box could assess best from this

             vantage         point         capacity and rate of fill.

                 have n e v e r           in all   my experience at the grarfrid been informed that a
                 ■ ■ ' ■ I   f ' }    :    , '■’                                ,f                .
             capacity situatian has «?„yer been reached..

             when in the past and during the build up to this match I have checked

             on the crowd using the vantage point of the Police Control Box steps

             I have done so to satisfy myself that there                             is no particular    problem

             with any section of the crowd necessitating                             police    intervention.        If

             1 had ever              considered that the terraces were full                   I would have liaised

             with the ground c orniTiander in the police box,                          I nave    never done     unis

of N o t t s . fans         behind        chanting and goading,               They seemed unaw ar e                           of

the    tragedy,

4.20pm             Thi s was the first                lull    in the sequence            of    events since                    I

left     the    police        room.        I looked at my w atch             it was 4.20pm.                 I    became

a ware      that my       radio was         still      working,          There were        public address

announcements             an d the ground slowly emptied,

A D D I T I O N A L P O I N T S A R IS I N G

During the briefing                  I received about             this m atch        I cannot         recall              ever

having       been told            that    I must monitor the build up and a tt it u de                                in the

pens     in L e pp i ng s         Lane    terraces.          Hav in g    said that       it has al w ay s                     been

my    practice        over        the years      to carry out such a check                     r e gu la rl y and                  I

would       often     climb the steps              to the polie control                box as        this       provided

a good v a n t a g e p a i n t .

D ur in g    the    b ri efing       no ,.fn.gntion was made about                the tunnel          gates           being
    used    to     control     ingress       of t h e     crowd.         A lt ho u gh on rare o ccasions                  in

    the    past     1 have     used the        gates      nearest        the   concourses        to    control           flow

    a way from the         tunnel       a r o u n d to the s ou th          pen.     1 did this            only for a

    few mome n t s       merely    as    a psychological                support    to    turn     tne fans          round

    to the south          pen.     I would         not use        them for any          length of time as

    when     they are      in the       closed       p os ition        they would be a n          o b s t r u ct i o n    in

    an e m e rg e n cy    evacuation          s i t u a t io n as they w o u l d        have    to be opened

    a ga i ns t    the   crowd a n d also          because        this     is the o n l y      ingress/egress

    for     fans    in the     central        pens to get           to the     snack     bar a nd toiie us.

    Part     of the b ri efing          1 gave       to the       two serials        14 and       15 was       to

    se ar ch fans a fter          they      had    passed t h ro u gh the t ur ns t il e s              into     the two

    offence        or to unpair         spectator         view or disrupt the game.                        To my

     r e co l le c ti o n this was         u n d er t ak e n    from the gates opening                at    12 noon

     until       gates C t he n B wer e opened.                   No    one ordered this to                cease.         I

     gave    no such      instruction.

12 noon              Turnstiles open.                Officers and stewards in position.                             Build up

dynatape       claiming          'Official          Liverpool         stewards'.            No    tickets      attempt      to

'yank' gate open but I anticipate and held firm.                                       I slammed it shut.             Repeat

performance ten minutes later.                           No entry.

About 2.30 pm.               'Last minute'           buld up started.                  Press on turnstiles.                Boy

and elevated section.                   No problems.

Approximately          2.40       pm.        Young Police          Constable           with      'stupid and legless'

drunk wandering about                   in concourse            at rear A-G            turnstiles.           Did not know

where    to    go.         Took       him    to    Police       Room.         Had      to   support     drunk       all   way.

(Police Constable 1719 or 1715 or similar).

2.45 pm              Checked          watch       leaving       police    room,        radio message,          "Get some

more    horses        up    here"       (or       similar).           Auto    -     assumed       Leppings      Lane      end.

Unknown       officer       said,       "Sounds          like   its     getting busy             at   your    end    Harry".

Returned to Leppings Lane end via route under North Stand.                                                 Getting busy.

Aware    of the        crush outside         11-16    turnstiles.          Coming through very slowly.

Stepped        away    from    turnstiles         to watch Inspector Bennett                but    two or three

times      I    was     pulled      by     Liverpool       people    who     had    got     inside     who     were

complaining about the crush outside.                         "You should be out there.                People are

gonna get killed".

Through the gate in the wall between the two concourses at the rear of two

sets of turnstiles.                 I became aware of a movement of people.                        From previous

experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

for waiting friends responding to a kick off or crowd cheer or similar.                                           I

stepped        through       into   the    concourse       behind A-G.        (Not sure           whether    pulled

again by fans).

Twice called on radio using allocated call sign 'India 7'-

I seemed to recall that all the turnstiles had stopped.                                   Men were screaming

trapped        in them.        Gate       'C' was open and people were coming through.                          The

terror         in     the    turnstiles       communicated          itself    to    me      and     brought     the

seriousness of the situation to mind.

I went out through gate 'C'.

I remember           standing alongside           Inspectors       Graham Delaney and Bob Purdy and

Sergeant John Morgan pulling people out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                                           I

feared some would be killed.                   Some were reluctant to come.                  I think they had

got   so       close    to    the    turnstiles      they    had    the    single    intention        of passing

through.            I shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the iron

bar that is a continuation of the wall housing gate                                 'C' .       The crush quite

suddenly        eased.         I    saw    gate     'B'    had    been    opened.         The     queues     became

controllable           and    containable      again.        The    two    turnstiles       nearest     gate    'C'

appeared to function again.                   Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of
                                                    - 5 -



this agitated crowd fans who produced tickets.                    I told the stewards on gate

'C' to take the stubs.

By now I have no idea of time or what is happening outside.

By word of mouth information passed, "Inside - Pitch invasion".                             Went to the

pitch via rear of police control box and down the first steps in the South

Stand.     I saw no players or officials on the pitch.

The invasion appeared to have spread as far as the penalty spot.                               I got on

to the pitch and had got near to the goal post when I noticed those on the

pitch were not running towards opponents end or away from Police Officers.

Some were holding themselves, others lying down.                    I looked towards the fence

holding    back     fans    in    the    Leppings    Lane   terraces.     Police      Officers     were

standing on       the    fence    and    leaning    over.   Through     the   gaps    in the     legs I

could see the faces of fans pressed against the fence.                        I realised they were

stood up dead.          The gate to this pen was opened.                I think it was number 3

gate.

Automatically (or it seemed) Police Officers formed a double line up to the

gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                      When there was no one

at your end of the line to pass on the casualty, you carried it on to the

pitch.      Police      Constable       2417 Pete Rotchel       and I carried        the    unconscious

body of a 14 years old boy, dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

to the     pitch.       I felt his       heart     beat but his breathing was              so extremely

shallow that I thought he was dead.                  We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

realised    he    was      in    fact   breathing    himself.     We    did   not    interrupt     this

natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

and protected.          I remember as I was kneeling over him that I was kicked in

the back.     I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.

People    came with a board             and   this       boy was        carried away.       More    came    with

another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                                       I

remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

I turned    and      saw behind me        a fireman apply                cardiac massage         to a male     in

early    thirties.         He   then      gave oral          resuscitation        and I knelt beside          the

casualty to do cardiac massage.                As the fireman sat back he signalled me                        not

to continue.         We checked for vital life signs,                      there were none.         I covered

the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.

I heard someone say, "They're charging".                          I looked towards the Spion Kop and

saw   people    on    the    field moving       towards           it.      They    were    notrunning.         It

looked as though a confrontation was imminent.                             I went beyond         the half     way

line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.                               There was a line across

the width of         the    pitch.       This halted the progress of the Liverpool                          fans.

Some of them were crying.Some were frustrated.                             Some      were angry.       It did

not help to hear the mass of Notts fans behind chanting and goading.                                         They

seemed unaware of the tragedy.

4.20 pm           This was the first lull in the sequence of events since I left

the police room.            I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.                     I became aware that

my radio was still working.               There were public address announcements and the

ground slowly emptied.

5.00 pm              Given hot drinks.          Mustered serials              in North Stand and spoke

to officers distressed by experiences.

About    5-30   pm    I     went   to   gymnasium            which   was being      used    as    a temporary

mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

11.00 pm          Went off duty from the gymnasium.

the closure of the tunnel leading to pens 3 & 4.          He has supplied three

I am Trevor Higgins,                                                                                                                  of

Rotherham.




Until July 1988 I was a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police

stationed at Wombwell, of Barnsley Division.




On Saturday 9 April 1988, I was detailed to supervise a serial of constables

performing duty at Hillsborough Football Stadium.                                                                                                               The two football teams

taking part were Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.




The serial was delegated duty at the rear of the West Stand and in particular

to control fans entering pens 3 and 4, that is the centre pens of the stand.




During the game and because of the amount of fans within pens 3 and 4, I

receive                             struction to close the gates to the entrance and thereafter direct


Slffned                                                                                                   Signature witnessed by

                                STATEMENT OF WITNESS

              (C.J. Act, 1967, s. 9; M.C.A., 1980, s. 102; M.C. Rulea, 1981, r.70)

        Continuation of statement of      TREVOR HIGGINS



        fans to the two outer pens of the stand.                  I cannot recall where the

        instruction came from.          Under normal circumstances instruction came from a

        Serial Inspector or via radio from control.                    I cannot say from which the

        instruction came.



        Bearing in mind the time lapse and having attended several matches at

        Hillsborough, it is difficult to relate detail regarding this particular

        match.

I,    DOUGLAS          JOHN LOCK, of                                                      South
Yorkshire,                         tfILL STATEs-


My    date of birth is                                          I am presently Chief of
Security          with       Sheffield          Wednesday Football         Club    at     their
ground       at       Hillsborough.              My    employment     in    that    post      is
part-time          and my main duties are on match days, but I -work on
a    part-time basis through the whole year - not just                              confined
to the football season.


My main career was in the Police Force for some 30 years until
I     retired         on     28 th    February,         1985.       At     the time      of   my
retirement            I     had      the rank of Superintendent, in                the    South
Yorkshire Police Force and I was promoted to Superintendent in
about         1979/80             after    spending       one       year    as an        Acting
Superintendent.


X     was    based at Hammerton Road Police Station, working in                                FI
Sub-Division               which      covers      the northern area         of     Sheffield,
including             Hillsborough.             From      Football Season1982/3 until               I
retired           I       was,"    under        the direct      command     of     the    Chief
Superintendent, in charge of policing the Hillsborough Ground*
For     the 3 seasons that I was the Superintendent in charge                                  of
policing          the       Hillsborough Ground the Club had 1 year in                        the
Second        Division,            1 year when they were promoted from                   Second
Division to First Division, and then in                             1984/5 aseason in the
First        Division.             During this period there were matches                 with
some very big crowds, for even in the                           first of those years the
Club        was       contending          for    promotion to       the    First      Division
although ultimately it did not succeed in that year.
                                                 -   2   -




During     that        spell        Inspector Clive Calvert           was       my         Liaison
Officer        and     he        and I had a good deal of            contact         with      the
Sheffield       Wednesday           Club.   Such liaison was            mainly with the
Secretary       of the Club - in the early stages Eric England                                 and
latterly        Dick        Chester - and each game that the                  Club          played
throughout           the        season was categorised according to the                       Gate
which     we    would           expect, not least dependent            on the          kind     of
following       that the visiting team would have.                      As I recall the
games     were categorised as A, B or C.                      A category C game would
involve        crowds           of up to say 20,000 people; category B up                       to
30,000 people?             and category A where yet larger crowds would be
expected.            There would be meetings with the Club prior-to the
start     of the football season proper, when the fixtures                                   would
be     known,        and the categories for each game would be                             agreed.
Each     category involved a consequent minimum level of policing
and     since the Club have to contribute to the cost of policing
they     have        a financial interest in the matter.                    I        would     say
however        that        in     my dealings with Sheffield            Wednesday             they
have     always        been        prepared to accept the level                 of     policing
which     we thought proper and not tried to influence us to keep
the     numbers        of        Police Officers down for            cost       reasons.            I
should         also        add     that   even       though    the    games          would      be
categorised           at        the start of the season if, for                 any        reason,
during     the        season things changed - e.g. if one of the                             Clubs
involved        had a successful run so that a larger crowd might be
expected - we could and did re-categorise matches.


Other     factors           were also involved of course in the                       level     of
policing we might require.                  We would typically liaise with the
Police     Force           for     the visiting Clubs'- home           town          for     added
intelligence from them as to the fans that might be expected.


About 2 weeks prior to each game Inspector Calvert and I would
have     meetings           with the Chief Superintendent and                   the         Deputy
Chief     Superintendent              to discuss the policing for the                       forth­
coming     match,           and then having established the contingent                          of
Officers        required we would go to the Football Liaison                                Offio
at South Yorkshire Police Headquarters at Snig Hill,                          Sheffield
to     arrange        extra manpower from other Divisions -               e.g.           from
Road     Traffic Division, Mounted Police, and (where                     necessary)
Dog     Handlers.           Within a week of the match we would                normally
have     confirmation of the extra manpower available to U3,                              and
then     Clive        Calvert and I would discuss the whole matter                        and
draw     up        an operational plan to be put into operation on                        the
day     of     the match.           This operational plan would         include,           in
particular,           deployment of Police Officers within and                     outside
the Ground.


Our     policy was to use Officers from F Division in those areas
where        there was likely to be pressure or problems because                           of
their        familiarity with the Hillsborough area.                  Thus we always
tended        to     use the same group of Officers for duties                     on     the
pitch,        not least because if trouble were to arise their faces
would        be well recognised by regular fans who would perhaps be
more     ready        to     approach them and report          matters.        Officers
would        also be deployed on duty for off-loading coach loads of
visiting            fans      and     escorting   them    to    the    Ground            from
particular           areas,    and likewise in relation to special trains.
When     large        crowds        of visiting fans were expected            we        would
control        their        arrival     by   close liaison     with     the        Traffic
Division,           who would direct traffic along a particular                     route;
coaches        coming        off     the Ml would,    for example, be         asked        to
exit     at a Junction at Tankersley where there is a very                              large
lay-by        and     they would be stopped in that lay-by and fans                        on
board        would     have        tickets checked.    Care would be          taken        to
co-ordinate           the     arrival of coaches and trains so             that,          for
example,           if a train-load of fans was expected the arrival                        of
a     group of coaches might be delayed until those fans arriving
on     the     train had been escorted to the             Ground.         Furthermore
coaches        were always directed to offload in a particular area,
then     to follow a particular route around the Ground and                              park
in      Cole        Road. After the match all visiting fans would                        then
be     escorted from the Ground back via Cole Road to the coaches
or trains,          as the case may be.

Wh e n     the       operational plans were drawn             up copieB would go          to
each       particular               group of Officers -i.e.      Traffic       Division,
Mounted Police,                   etc. and they would detail the duties for each
particular section of men.                       A copy of the operational plan was
always       given to the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club in advance of the match.


On       Match Day, before kick-off,                 I would brief all the Officers
on       duty.         Those         briefings normally took       place    within       the
Ground,          either            in the vicinity of the Police Room or in              the
gymnasium depending on how many Officers were involved.                                After
a     general briefing to all, the Inspectors and Sergeants would
 then      be separately briefed in more detail, but all                        briefings
 essentially broke down the operation into 3 ph ases:-


 1.        The period up to kick-off;
 2.        The       period from kick-off until 10minutes before the                     end
          of the match;
 3.       From 10 minutes before the end to dispersal of crowds.


 During      my          3        seasons   in   charge we never    had    a    F.A.     Cup
 semi-final              played at Hillsborough and to my recollection                   the
 largest          crowd           we_ had was one of about 48,000 people           for     an
 evening          match with a 7.30 p.m. kick-off.                 On that occasion         I
 r e c a l l that the               crowd of fans arriving was suchthat it became
 obvious that we                    could not get everyone into the       Ground in time
 for kick-off.                    When that was reported to me by my Officers, we
 approached              the        Club Secretary - I believe it was           then     Dick
 Chester          - and asked him whether the start of the match                       could
 be      delayed             so      that all the fans could be brought         into      the
 ground.            We        received prompt agreement to that            request,       the
 start      was put back for 15 minutes and we announced this                            over
 the      P.A.      system to the crowd.             That relieved the pressure
 in fact by 7.35 p.m. or thereabouts all the fans were in.
Because          of my experience of and interest in policing football
crowds,          following             my     retirement from the Force                I    wrote     a
series       of        3    articles for a local newspaper,                      the        Shaffield
Telegraph,             on       this        topic.         Subsequently I       did        appear    on
television on a couple of occasions in discussions on football
and     the football supporters'                       hooliganism problems and I wrote
some articles for the Police Review.


It     was       after the tragedy at the Heysel football                              stadium        in
Belgium          that I recall I was contacted by Superintendent                                    John
Freeman          of the South Yorkshire Police who told me that hfc was
calling          at        the request of Dick Chester to enquire whether                              I
might        be i n t e r e s t e d to join Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
as     their           Security Officer.                   Having retired from the Force               I
was      not working at that time, and I went to see Dick                                     Chester
 and        following             a         discussion        with    him   I    accepted            the

 appointment.


 In    my        post as Chief of Security I was involved with                                 general
 matters          of crowd safety and I was of course familiar with the
 Green       Code,          the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975,                            and    the
 recommendations                  of        the Popplewell Inquiry.             I therefore          had
 these       matters             very        much in mind in performing                my     task    as
 Security Officer. _ One of the early things that I did after my
 appointment                was to check all the gates around the stadium and
 to     change the padlocks on those gates to a common padlock                                         so
 that every gate could be opened with the same key.                                         The Police
 were        supplied with 2 of those keys - I gave them to Inspector
 Calvert          - so that they could copy as many as they wished.                                        I
 also        provided keys to each of the stewards within the                                     Ground

 who were manning gates.


  I    also       checked in relation to fire precautions and                                 I     found
 that        a    number of alarms and extinguishers were                              not        readily
  ac c e s s i b l e       on    match        day - the position was             that        the     Fire
  Brigade              would      inspect            the     Ground    without    a        full     croy"
  present,             and during matches certain gates may be locked whic
would     otherwise             be    open      or other changes             made       which        the
Brigade       apparently             had not realised.            I arranged            for     those
matters to be put right.


All     matters          relating           to the erection of          perimeter              fences,
gates     in     the        fences, the siting of crash                  barriers              in    the
standing        areas etc.             were,    I believe, dealt with between                        the
Club     and     the       Committee           set    up    by    the    Local          Authority,
pursuant        to       the      Safety of Sports Grounds Act.                     I     know        for
example        that        up     to 1985 the central pen at the                        west        stand
(Leppings        Lane)           end was not divided by the fence                        which'       now
runs     from        the        centre of the mouth of the tunnel                        under        the
stand,       down           to the perimeter fence.                     There       was a           crush
barrier        about        12' in from the mouth of the tunnel                           entrance,
and     my     recollection             is that the positioning of                      that        crush
barrier        relatively close to the entrance from the tunnel                                       was
capable        of        causing       a build-up of fans at the mouth                         of     the
tunnel         and          it was often          necessary             to    deploy a          Police
Constable           on     either       side of the tunnel              to    ensure           orderly
dispersal           of the crowd within the pen.                   Subsequently                however
that         crush barrier             was      removed     and         the     fence      erected,
presumably at the request of the Safety Committee.


The     gates in the perimeter fence are                         closed, but not locked,
 during       matches           so    far      as I am aware.           The     gates          are     so
 designed        that       the latch cannot be easily opened from                              inside
 the    pen,     and the position is that the gates would normally be
 manned       outside           by stewards and Police Officers.                         The        gates
 opened       outwards on to the pitch area, and to open them it was
 merely        necessary to press down on the spring-loaded latch                                      to
 release        it.             I do recall          that   after       my     appointment             as
 Security        Officer             I was a little concerned that some                        of     the
 advertising             boards        on    the perimeter of the              pitch          extended
 partly        across          the mouth of those gates and could                        create        an
 obstruction             and I arranged for the boards to be moved or,                                 ^f
 necessary           reduced in length, to prevent any possibility of
 obstruction arising.
I    also took steps to upgrade the Public Address System at the
Ground     and       indeed last year the P.A. System            was       completely
replaced        with        a    new, more powerful, system.         Part     of      the
reason     for       this        was that I was conscious of        the     fact      the
P.A. System          was an essential part of the emergency evacuation
procedures          at the Club.         Standing rules provided for a             coded
message        to    be announced over the P.A. and this               announcement
would     be        an indication to Police Officers and Stewards                   that
emergency           evacuation procedures were in force.             The     Stewards
were     then        required to take up positions at their               exits       and
gates,     and         to       open   those gates.   I   made   sure that          this
evacuation           procedure was tested on match days to be satisfied
that     it would work efficiently in the event of an evacuation.
Indeed     in the 1988/89 season which is just drawing to a close
we     have had 2 emergency evacuation tests in which the                      Police
were also involved.                Their part was co-ordinated via Inspector
Sewell     and         on the occasion of these tests the coded               message
would      be broadcast and then we would check quickly round                         the
Ground        to see that all the gateB had in fact been thrown open
and were manned by Stewards.


Following the Popplewell report the proper training of fit and
able     Stewards           was     a recommendation.     In fact    many      of     the
Stewards        at     Football Grounds are older men who              may    perhaps
have     retired or be approaching retirement from their                       regular
work     so     that it is not always possible to have Stewards                       who
are     fully        fit from the point of view of youth             and      fitness.
Where     possible,             however, younger candidates were recruited as
Stewards        and     I       did take steps to ensure that        training         was
available           to them.        Thus, at the beginning of the season,              for
the     last 3 seasons,             I have had 2 training evenings           organised
at     the Club.        The first evening is for gatemen, catering                     and
ground        staff,    and the second evening concentrates on training
of     Stewards.            On both evenings there are demonstrations                  and
instructions           given        on first aid; there is a talk by           Station
Officer        Miles        of the local Fire Brigade re fire             precautions

                                                                                    * ./ • .
and     fire d u t i e s      there is a talk by a Police Inspector                          (this
year     Inspector Sewell)                on emergency procedures; and finally I
talk to them about Ground Regulations and we finish off w ith a
video      of the Bradford and Heysel disasters in the context                                    of
stewarding          of     soccer                 grounds,     a   video   produced     by     the

Metropolitan Police.


In     addition the Stewards are given written instructions as to
their      duties        on     match days.               Initially these      were     printed
sheets       given to them at the beginning of each season,-but                                   of
lata I have altered the system slightly so that each match day
employee is provided with a booklet at the commencement of the
season,       which        he has to sign for.                     This booklet   contains           a
 separate         sheet       for     e   a   c   h   home match, which can be used          as      a
 signed      receipt for payment of wages for match day duties.                                   In
 the back of the booklet are printed the instructions for match

 day staff.

 I also caused to be produced a Management Information Sheet on
 "Use      and     Training           of Stewards" which was given to                   all       the
 administrative               staff           at the Club, to ensure that             there       was
 Management         awareness                 among all of them of the functions                  and
 duties of Stewards and part-time staff.


 Finally,         on the match day itself, Stewards are briefed by the
 Police,         usually in groups for each of the 4 separate areas of
 the Ground - north, south,                           east and west.


 The      Officer         in overall charge of policing                     Hillsborough          for
  several          seasons          until               earlier     this   year   was         Chief
  Superintendent              Brian           Mole.       Mr. Mole took over these           duties
  very      shortly        after I retired,                   following the death      of     Chief
  Superintendent Brian Moseley,                              Mr. Mole was one of those Chief
  Superintendents who took a very active or hands-on approach to
  being      in     charge          of policing Hillsborough and I                    had    worked
  fairly closely with him in my position as Chief of Security of
  the Ground up to the point where he was transferred to another

Division       in         about March of this year.                       During his        apell           in
F Division          he had been in charge of 2 F.A. Cup semi-finals at
Hillsborough              -     Coventry City v. Leeds United and in                             1987/88
Season,       Liverpool v. Notts. Forest.                            Inspector Clive             Calvert
had    worked        as         his Liaison Officer up to and                      including            the
1987/88       F.A.            Cup semi-final but he was then transferred                                 and
his replacement was Inspector Sewell.


When     Brian       Mole             was   transferred from               F   Division          he     was
replaced       by Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and Super­
intendent          Duckenfield's              first match at Hillsborough --was                             on
Saturday,            1st         April,       1989      when the           visiting        team        were
Millwali       F.C.            and      the crowd was relatively small                          and    well
behaved.


The     Club        was involved in an evening match on Wednesday,                                          5th
April,       against             Wimbledon F.C. and again on that                          occasion            I
met      Chief        Superintendent             Duckenfield               and     also         Inspector
Sewell.        After            that match had started, at about 7.45 p.m.                                   we
pulled        in     all the Chief Stewards into a meeting                                 to     discuss
with     them        the         arrangements for the                 forthcoming           semi-final
between        Liverpool               and Notts. Forest.                 In addition to              the        4
Chief        Stewards            also       present w       e    r    e    J   w   h   o         keeps           a
running        check            on turnstiles on match days and                        arranges             for
change         to         be'     available          e t c .),                                  (who         is
                      for payment of S t e w a r d s ),                                     and
                   We discussed with them what extra Stewards we                                       would
require        for        the semi-final,             for their differing sections                           of
the     Ground,       and we needed to have details of numbers etc.                                          so
that      special             passes could be organised for those                           additional
Stewards.           Because each Chief Steward knows his own area                                       well
and     we knew we would have a capacity crowd for the semi-final
their        views were very much listened to and heeded in terms of
what extra stewarding was required.


On     the     day of the Cup semi-final                         I arrived at the Ground                     a
approximately 9.45 a.m. and parked my car at the Leppings Lan

                                                                                                       . ./.
end of Fielding Road.                  I entered the Ground, and carried out a
general       tour         of      inspection around the whole Ground            in     the
period up to about 10.45 a.m.                    I recall that Roger Houldsworth
was     at        the Ground and indeed I assisted him by                 footing       the
ladder        for him whilst he was carrying out some repairB to one
of     the Police cameras in the west stand area near the                         Police
control           box.        I    also entered the control box and          spoke       to
P.C. Mick           Ryan who is the regular Police Radio Operator and I
left     with          him one of the Sheffield Wednesday            F.C.     personal
radios.           These personal radios had all been serviced prior                      to
the     match and I distributed additional radios to each-of                            the
4     Head        Stewards p 1 Lu                       1 to Craham Maokr»ll            and

another           to                        his Admin. Manager;   1 for the       Office

staff        generally;            1   to                one of my    Stewards          who
performs           a flexible role at my direction?           1 for the Turnstile
Room staff;             and the 12th one I retained myself.


I     told        the     Stewards that there would be a briefing                by     the
Police        Inspectors at 11.15 a.m., having already been informed
of that by Inspector Sewell.


 I     recall          that       about 11.30 a.m.   I went back     to    the    Police
 control box when there were a number of other Officers present
 besides          P.C.        Ryan.     One I recall was Sergeant         Goddard        but
 there       were others whom I cannot now recall.                 I had a       general
 chat     with           them, they had no special requests, and             I    walked
 back        from there to the offices in the south stand.                   I        recall
 that when walking back briefings were then in progress in each
 of the four areas of the Ground.


 The     turnstiles were opened to admit ticket holders from about
 11.30 a.m.              Each set of turnstiles is covered by a CCTV camera
 and     there           is a facility for recording the pictures taken                   by
 each        of     those cameras.           Each video tape however        lasts       only
 3 hours and we discussed the position and agreed that we would
 only switch on the cassettes from 12.30 p.m.
I        recall       that        at about 12 noon I checked          on     the       computer
print-out             and at that stage there were 600 ticket holders                               in
the        Ground.           I walked around the outside of the                   stadium           to
check          on the position/ and there were at that stage a                            number
of         fans        in the        area but      many     more     Nottingham           Forest
supporters             than Liverpool supporters.                In walking around              the
Ground          I      checked       with all      the     Car     Park     attendants          and
reminded             them     of the arrangements for that day                   where        there
were        2 different types of car park ticket - one for those who
were        entitled to park and leave their cars, and one a                              permit
merely           allowing          people to drop off passengers.                 I     reminded
them           also     that any vehicle not in the car park by 2.30                           p.m.
should           be excluded until 5 minutes after kick-off - this is a
standard              procedure          on busy match days, to avoid any                traffic
hazard           with       the     large number of fans who would                be     in     the

vicinity.


I        was      back       in the offices by about 12.30                p.m.     and    having
checked             with      the office staff I re-entered the control                         room
where           P.C. Harold GueBt was present for the Police,                            together
with           Roger Houldsworth and a representative from the                            Company
who had installed the CCTV system.


    At     about 1 p.m.            I left the control room, which is immediately
    adjacent          to     the     players'     entrance, and went             out     to     that
    entrance          where        I.met with Superintendent Glynn Marsh                      and        a
    Police          Sergeant. . Superintendent Marsh explained that he                              had
    come       out     to see            the Police      operation    generally,          having
    recently          taken over an operations'             group in the Force, and                      I
    gave . him         and        the Sergeant a tour of the          control           room.            I
    recall          that     at    about     that time     I also     had    a     visit        from
    Inspector          Calvert           who had been called in to assist                at     this
    special          match,        and     was   in charge of the Kop            area     of        the
    Ground.           I knew him well of course,             Inspector Calvert                having
    been       my     Liaison Officer in the days when I was                      involved           ifr
    policing the Ground.

Sometime        between 1.35 and 1.45 p.m. the Liverpool team                            coach
arrived,       followed shortly afterwards by the Notts. Forest team
coach.     I recall that outside the players' entrance there were
a     number     of fans awaiting the arrival, again                   mainly        Notts.
Forest     fans        but some Liverpool fans also.                A number        of     the
fans     were pressing forward at the arrival of the players, and
a Mounted Police Officer eased his horse through the crowd and
pushed     them back.            I clearly recall that the Mounted                  Officer
was     wearing a white shirt which would indicate to me that                                he
was     brought         in to assist from an outside Police Force -                        The
South     Yorks.            Police wear regulation blue shirts.                    I-"recall
this     instance            particularly for 2 reasons - in the course                      of
the     manoeuvre the horse seemed to be a little excitable, and
a     middle-aged man with a Liverpool accent complained that the
horse     had      stepped          on his foot and indeed his              footwear        was
visibly         dented.        I recall that Kenny Dalglish, the                   Liverpool
Manager,         went        to speak to the fan, and Superintendent                      Roger
Greenwood         was present and I suggested to him that the                            Police
horse     was      unnecessary for the type of duty at                     the      players'
entrance.              He     agreed     that     South    Yorks.     Police        did     not
normally         use        Mounted     Officers in that situation,                and     said
that      he would deal with the matter at the later                         de-briefing.
Superintendent                Greenwood         was   in   charge     of     the         Police
contingent         on        duty     on the pitch.        I walked   down       from       the
players'         entrance through the players' tunnel on to the pitch
w ith     him     and after chatting for a little while                      returned        to
the Control Room at about 1.55 p.m.


At      about 2 p.m.          one of the employees from the Turnstile                      Room
popped      into        the Control Room to see what the                   crowd     already
entering         the        Ground was like.          My recollection is that               the
computer         print-out          showed      that some 24,000 fans            were       in,
mostly      in     the        south stand and the Kop area             (NottB.           Forest
supporters)            and     a lesser number in the west and north                      stand
areas.     At regular intervals thereafter the Police Control Box
staff     would radio in (on one occasion they used the                             internal
land      line     telephone)          to check w ith us what the size               of     the
                                                   - 13 -




crowd     was       as     demonstrated on the                 computer       print-out,                 and
generally         either           P.C. Guest or I would answer them and                                give
them     the      figure.           It was noticeable that the                 Notts.              Forest
areas        of     the        Ground      were         filling    up    first.              This        was
demonstrated             both       on    tha      T.v.    monitors      and    also              on     the
computer          print-out.             We have a separate monitor                     within           the
Control        Room       for       each of the CCTV cameras                  trained             on     the
various        turnstiles            and the players'             entrance.             In     addition
there     is        an     extra         monitor which is linked               to        the       Police
cameras        and where we do not have a recording facility but                                          we
can     switch,           at the press of a button,                  from one           Police^         T.V.
camera to another to see what pictures they are displaying.


Between           2.30      and      2.40       p.m.      it   was      noticeable             that        a
significant              number of fans were arriving at the Leppings Lane
end       of      the      Ground.          This        was    noticeable       in           particular
through         the Police monitor from the Police camera situated on
 top    of      the       south west corner of the west stand.                                I     recall
 that     at      about 2.40 p.m. there was an announcement                                   over       the
 Police        radio       (P.C. Guest had one in the Control                            Room)          that
 Leppings         Lane         was closed to traffic because of the                               build-up
 in     that      area.        I looked on the monitor at the                   Leppings                Lane
 picture          and          I    recall        the     impression      I    had           was         that
 immediately             outside         the turnstiles in the area of the                             metal
 gate     there          was       a very tight crush of people.                        Just           behind
 them     was        an area which did not seem so densely                              packed,           and
 then     further behind again in Leppings Lane there seemed to be
 a     solid        crush of people coming along.                       I cannot say               however
 that     I       noticed any evidence of misbehaviour among                                   the       fans
 near     the        turnstile            area.     However there was               a        substantial
 number        of        fans waiting to get into the ground with                                 kick-off

 time approaching.


 By     2.50 p.m.          the computer showed that there were about 45,000
 fans     in the Ground.                  I cannot recall any report of                        problems,
 but     on       the      Police         monitor it was           noticeable            that          crowds
 outside          the Leppings Lane gates had increased, and they                                        were
                                          - 14 -



pushing     forward        and there was quite a crush.           The     computer
print-out        indicated that there were about 2,000 spaces                   still
to     be filled in the north stand area, and about 2,500 in                        the
west     stand area as I recall.            On the monitor I saw a            Mounted
Police     Officer        in the crowd at the Leppings Lane end and                  he
seemed     to be the same Officer as had earlier been involved at
the p l a y e r s ' entrance.       From the T.V. picture his horse seemed
to     shy and slip into something of a splayed leg position, and
then recovered and this was an indication to me that the crush
out     there was increasing.            Then suddenly Gate C opened and               a
crowd      of spectators burst through and P.C. Harold Guest                        said
something like "The gate's gone".                  I immediately left the room
in     something        of a hurry, as I was concerned that this                   could
cause      problems        and    that   further help might       be    needed        in
manning        that gate or indeed other gates around the Ground                      to
which      the     problem        of fans trying to get     in    quickly          could
 spread.         Because of that, on my way out of the Control                     Room,
 I     indicated to P.C. Janet Cruttenden who was just outside the
 Directors'        entrance, that she should step inside the entrance
 if     there     were any trouble and to the 2 administrative                     staff
 who     were at the players' entrance I said that I w ould arrange
 for     extra        Stewards.      I   called                         the
 Steward        in the south stand area,          to join me at the Directors'
 entrance        and     I asked him to provide 2 burly Stewards at                  the
 entrance        to     reinforce the staff there, explaining             what       had
 happened at C Gate.


 From     then I wanted to make my way over to the C Gate and went
 down     the players' tunnel on to the pitch.              As I walked            along
 the     side     towards the west stand area I met              Graham       Mackrell
 about     half way between the tunnel and the Police control box.
 I     told him my concern as to what had happened at Gate C,                         and
 he     said      "Leave     it to me" and turned and went back               in    that
 direction.           I recall looking and seeing that each of the north
 and      south       "wings"     of the Leppings Lane terracing          were        not
 over-crowded,          but the centre pen seemed very full.
                                              - 15 -




I       started to return,         and at this stage the players from                 both
teams        were on the pitch but the match had not started yet.                                I
had        to w a i t , because the gangway towards the players'                 tunnel
was crowded with members of the media waiting for Brian Clough
to        arrive.     He came down and sat in his Beat, and then I                         was
able        to w a l k back up through the players' tunnel speaking                         to
the        Stewards as I did so.             I went back into the Control             Room
and        Harold     Guest said to me, in a                            voice    "Doug,
they have opened the gates".                   Roger Houldsworth was not there.
I       ran back through the players'        tunnel shouting as I ran into
                          radio calling up the               at the west
my        personal
                                       asking him what is happening.              I        ran
end,
into        Graham        Mackrell and someone I now know as Glen                Kirton,
an        F.A.     official,      and told them that the Police           had     opened
the        gates     at     the Leppings Lane end of the           Ground.        Graham
responded           to     the    effect "Can we get them in, are we              up         to
capacity?"           and     I responded that we were not.           X made my             way
down         towards the west stand and then saw people climbing over
    the     perimeter fences at that end of the pitch.                  At that point
    a     Police Officer went onto the pitch and asked the Referee to

    stop the game.


    There     was a mass of people around the perimeter fence                      behind
    the     goal    area and I am not able to say whether the gates                              in
    the     perimeter fence were opened to allow people out.                     I could
    see     that     some people were being lifted over the top                  of        the
    fence,       people appeared to be lying on the ground injured,                         and
    many were wandering around in a dazed condition and in obvious
    distress.         I    helped      a number of people in that          state           back
    towards        the players' tunnel area and into the south stand                             so
    that they could be comforted and helped.                  I recall that one of
    the     Assistant        Caretakers,                     |said we     needed           more
    stretchers        from       the   Tea    Bar.     I went in   and     got     the               2
    stretchers        which       were stored on top of the cupboard in                    that
    Bar so that they could be used.




                                                                                       •   » /   *   t
At      one     point I recall that Brian Clough stopped me and                              Baid
»Sir,          x want you to find the Directors and the P.A. Officials
and      tell them I am putting my players in the bath and                              taking
t hem         home."     Mr. Clough knew that I worked with the Club                          for
I       had     been introduced to him earlier that day.                    I was        aware
of       the     fact     that        there   was a     meeting    going     on     in        the
Directors'             room     to     discuss the situation, which           was        still
unclear          and I went into that room to tell the Directors                             what
Mr.       Clough had said.              The message,     in effect, was that             there
could          be no thought given to re-commencing the game when                             the
problem          had     been dealt with - of course, at that                 time,            the
full nature of the tragedy was not known.


It       was at about that point I realised that there had been                                 no
announcement over the Public Address System in accordance with
the       emergency           arrangements      and procedures laid          down.             The
 South         Yorkshire        Police are in charge of the             Public      Address
 System         in the sense that they have an override system and the
 emergency procedures stipulated that the Police would make the
 necessary             broadcast.       I therefore used my personal radio                     and
 instructed all Stewards to unlock the gates around the ground.
    I   got replies from some of them only, and I recall I spoke to
                          and asked him to get round and ensure                   that         the
    gates were opened all the way around.


    I    recollect        that        I was also      approached   by      Superintendent
    Roger       Greenwood who said he wanted to take Kenny Dalglish and
    Brian       Clough        to the Police Control Box to broadcast                    to      the
    crowd       in the Ground and explain the position and I took                             them
    there by a relatively unobstructed route.


    I    subsequently           had     a request over the radio from              the        Head
    Stewards       to     allow        the men to stand down pending              the        crowd
    eventually leaving the Ground through the gates which had been
    opened,       but     I refused that request on the basis                 that           t h e ir
    attendance was still required whilst the crowd remained.
                                            -   17 -




    Since     the tragic      events on 15th April I have     been    able    to
    w atch    the video       recording of the position at    the    gates    at
    Leppings Lane, through the Club'B own static camera trained on
    those     gates.      I    now realise that the initial event     when     a
    crowd     of   spectators       burst into the Ground through    Gate     C,
    which    caused me to first leave the Control Room, was in             fact
    subsequently       controlled      after a number of fans had gone       in.
    They     apparently       got   in when the Police were   attempting      to
    eject     some of the spectators inside, through Gate C.'         It     was
    after    that,     it seems, that the order was given by the'"Police
    for Gate C to be opened to allow spectators in.


    I   have read this Statement and it is true and correct to               the

 On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between Liverpool
 and Nottingham Forest, and conrmenced rry duties at 10.00 a.m. that date.
 At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open I switched all video
 recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground via.
 the turnstiles.
 During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m. I noticed
 that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.                                                                     I am not
 sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be between 25,000 and 30,000.
 At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers the
 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in the streets,
 and on checking the conrputer it was stowing 19,000 plus, and when each area,
 of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate, the total
 capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, vhich told ms that nearly
 all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was near to .full
 capacity.
 I then switched to the camera that was cpvering the Leppings Lane end.of.the
 ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that .area...
 I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance right back
 into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.                                                I would estimate that there
 would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.                                          I made a check of the conputer and
 saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to
 capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of 7,000,
 vhich would be near to capacity and the computer would b e a t a point ready,
 to start pulsating.                       The figures on the cpmputer start to pulsate when the
 capacities get to within 15% of the total.
 It was obvious that lopking at the crowd frpm outside trying to get in, .that
 there would not be sufficient room for all to be accommodated.                                                                 As I looked,
 at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and.many at the back of
 the crowd were surging forward pushing yiplently towards the turnstiles.
 From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to get. the crowd,
 into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the.way.
 I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police.                                                          A.large, contingent,
 of the fans were climbing onto the backs of others and.climbing the .walls
 over the top of the turnstiles;                                     they were landing onto the asbestos .roofs,
 on the inside_of the ground and jumping onto people who.were on the inside.of

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.
 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being pushed on
 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of the
 West Stand.
 During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent
 MARSHALL requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors
 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident
 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.
 At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South side of
 Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into the
 ground.       Within a minute of this happening I noticed that the large doors
 of the North side of Leppings Lane open and again about 1,000 fans run into
 the ground.         I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers in
 that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and
 appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
 I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the area
 of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting out of
 hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the perimeter of
 the ground.
 I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of the
 ground to assist with the injured and dying.
 By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players' Entrance area
 of the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging
 for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to hospital.
 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police
 personal radios were working very well, but during the day there appeared to
 be some distortion, and some messages could not be read clearly.
 I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of this major
 incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the natch too late and
 being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground without.
 tickets.       It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the ground prior
 to kick off there were several thousands that were attempting to enterwith-
 out tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside
 the ground.
 During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received.

HAROLD GUEST



Police Constable 1421



I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

area than the regulations set.    If there are to inform control to arrange

for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

are not known in advance.

On a ticket match this rolB becomes a watching brief with the main

concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.   Any

problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock

    cuid involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

to the control room.

In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

turnstiles.    There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the main




                                                                              JJ

Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.             There is

also a computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.            The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

date.      At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

via the turnstiles.

During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

3 0 ,0 0 0 .

At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in t]

streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus              When

each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

the total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me

that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

near to full capacity.

I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that

area.     I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.       I would estimate

that there would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans.      I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7,000 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,     The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within    15%   of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.     From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

side out of the way.     I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

Police.     A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

the ground to break their fall as they landed.

On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

the West Stand.

During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further      15    minutes.

At this point I noticed that a large door situated on the South Side of

Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

the ground.     I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.

At fekie -paint I tried to use my personal radio in order to contact Police
                 A
Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use it.

I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

through.     At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

organise some safety measures with the security personel.

Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

he is the person          who installed     all the videos                 and computersystem.

As he could also           see what was taking place he also              left        the room inorder

to assist in any          way he could.

I could see that          all available     officers were being                       sent   tothis areaof

the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

hospital.

I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground

without tickets.    It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the back to back radio system owned by the club,as I knew

Mr Lock would deal with any situation that had developed.

After the incident I made a note of all the people that hadentered the

ground as shown on the computer and they are as follows :-

Spion Kop                           19,906

North Stand                          8,109

South Stand Covered                  4,740

South Stand Uncovered                3,255

Leppings Lane                        7,038

West Stand                           5,618

                   TOTAL            48,666

These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

means.
HAROLD GUEST, Police Constable 1421, South Yorkshire Police.



I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present

stationed at Deepcar.



During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.




My duties consist of working in the video room in company with the

Chief Security Officer, Mr. LOCK.



The video room is situated near to the Players' Entrance on the

South Stand of the ground.




In this room there are 20 T.V. monitors which are covered by

cameras which are strategically placed around the ground to cover

all 95 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be

operated by a switch which will operate and show any view by the

cameras from the main Police control point situated between the

West and South Stands.   There is also a computer which shows all

95 turnstiles and can tell at anytime during a match how many

persons have passed through     each turnstile at any given point.

Each section of the ground for example the Spion Kop it will give

a figure showing the exact number of people in that area of the

ground.   These figures for that section of the ground are then

added up to give a grand total at the end.     The computer scans all

the turnstiles and takes approximately       seconds.




On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the Semi Final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10.00 a.m.



                                         ♦

that date.    At about 12.45 p.m. after the turnstiles were open

I switched all video recorders on to record all the fans as they

were entering the ground via the turnstiles.




During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 p.m.

I noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the

turnstiles.     I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it

to be between 25,000 and 30,000.




At 2.40 p.m. that same date I checked with the camera which covers

the Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people

in the streets, and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000

plus, and when each area of the ground gets near to capacity the

totals start to pulsate, the total capacity for that area of the

ground being 21,000, which told me that nearly all the Nottingham

supporters were in the ground and it was near to full capacity.




I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane

end of the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of

fans in that area.     I could see that the fans were spread from the

turnstile entrance right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking

5,000 fans.    I made a check of the computer and saw that the

figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to

capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of

7,000, which would be near to capacity and the computer would be at a

point ready to start pulsating.    The figures on the computer start

to pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get
                                                                 •3 .

in that there would not be sufficient roan for all to be

acconmodated.   As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd

getting larger and many at the back of the crowd were surging

forward pushing violently towards the turnstiles.   From that point

I could also see Police Officers trying to get the crowd into some

sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the

way.   I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police.      A

large contingent of the fans were climbing onto the backs of others

and climbing the walls over the top of the turnstiles;     they were

landing onto the asbestos roofs on the inside of the ground and

jumping onto people who were on the inside of the ground to break

their fall as they landed.




On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being

pushed on his horse down towards a large double door which leads

into the rear of the West Stand.




During all this I could hear several officers including Superinten­

dent Marshall requesting further assistance in that area, for the double

doors to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a

major incident outside, also for the match to be delayed for a

further 15 minutes.




At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South

side of Leppings Lane open, and there was a surge of about 1,000

fans run into the ground.    Within a minute of this happening I

noticed that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane

open and again about 1,000 fans run into the ground.     I could tell

from the noises on the radios from the officers in that area that the
                                                                .4.

Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and appeared

to be heavily intoxicated with drink.




I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered

the area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation

was getting out of hand and people were being pushed up against the

fencing on the perimeter of the ground.




I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area

of the ground to assist with the injured and dying.




By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players'

Entrance area of the ground and I assisted in treating people in

that area and arranging for ambulances to be directed in that area

to ferry the injured to hospital.




I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the

Police personal radios were working very well, but during the day

there appeared to be some distortion, and some messages could not

be read cleanly.



I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of

this major incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at

the match too late and being under the influence of drink and trying

to enter the ground without tickets.    It was obvious that looking

at the crowd outside the ground prior to kick off there were several

thousands that were attempting to enter without tickets at all cost

to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside the ground.

HAROLD GUEST



Police Constable 1421




I am a Police Officer in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed

at Deepcar.

During the last four years I have worked all football matches at

Hillsborough Football Ground.

My duties consist of working in the video room in company with Chief

Security Officer, Mr Lock.

Under the ground regulations in respect of the amount allowed in each

section of ground, it is my duty to check with the computer, the number of

persons who have entered and then the number of persons outside the ground

about to enter, to make sure that no more persons are allowed into that

area than the regulations set.   If there are to inform control to arrange

for turnstiles to be closed and for the persons outside the ground to be

moved to an area where there is sufficient room to accommodate them.

This is very important at a no ticket match where the numbers attending

are not known in advance.

On a ticket match this role Becomes a watching brief with the main

 concerns being persons turning up at the match without tickets.

 The video room is situated near to the players entrance on the South

 Stand.   My duties are to liaise with the club and the Police.    Any

 problems which may arise on behalf of the club are passed over to Mr Lock

     and involving the Police are forwarded by radio or telephone through

 to the control room.

 In this room there are twenty T.V. monitors which are covered by cameras

 which are strategically placed around the ground to cover all 95

 turnstiles.   There is also a T.V. monitor which can be operated by a

 switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the main
                                  - 2 -



Police control point situated between the West and South Stands.          There is

also a computer which shows all 9 5 turnstiles and can tell at any time

during a match how many persons have passed through each turnstile at any

given point.

Each section of the ground is shown in separate columns, each column shows

a number of turnstiles for that area and how many persons have passed

through each turnstile and at the bottom of each column the total is shown

for that area of the ground.

There are six areas of the ground recorded on the computer and at the end

there is a total shown for the full attendance in the ground.          The

computer scans all turnstiles and is updated every two and a half seconds.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty for the semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10am on that

 date.     At about 12.45pm after the turnstiles were open I switched all

 video recorders on to record all the fans as they were entering the ground

 via the turnstiles.

 During the afternoon leading up to the kick off time at about 2.15pm I

 noticed that the crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles.

 I am not sure of the size of the crowd but believe it to be 25,000 and

 3 0 ,0 0 0 .

 At 2.40pm that same date, I checked with the camera which covers the

 Penistone Road area and noticed that there were very few people in
                                                        tM(tilS^o.'oyj Kcf=>.
 streets and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000 plus.A When

 each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate,

 the total capacity for that area of the ground being 2 1 ,0 0 0 , which told me

 that nearly all the Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was

 near to full capacity.

 I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of

 the ground and noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that
                                    - 3 -




area.   I could see that the fans were spread from the turnstile entrance

right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road.    I would estimate

that there would be between 3»000 and 5,000 fans.    I made a check of the

computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and

showing near to capacity and the Leppings Lane figures were showing

approximately 7 , 0 0 0 which would be near to capacity and the computer would

be at a point to start pulsating,     The figures on the computer start to

pulsate when the capacities get to within 15% of the total.

As I looked at the scene I could see the crowd getting larger and many at

the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing violently towards the

turnstiles.    From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to

get the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one

side out of the way.    I saw several missiles being thrown towards the

Police.   A large contingent of the fans were climbing the walls over the

 top of the turnstiles, and they were landing on the asbestos roofs on the

 inside of the ground and jumping on to people who were on the inside of

 the ground to break their fall as they landed.

 On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted Policeman being pushed on

 his horse down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of

 the West Stand.

 During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent

 Marshall, requesting further assistance in that area, for the double doors

 to be opened in order to let fans into the ground to save a major incident

 outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further 15 minutes.

 At this point I noticed that a large door situated on the South Side of

 Leppings Lane was open, and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into

 the ground.   I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers

 in that area that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited and

 appeared to be heavily intoxicated with drink.
I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the

area of the West Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting

out of hand and people were being pushed up against the fencing on the

perimeter of the ground.
   fop£wur      dOufO                   W   cctJ& kic     k*
At trhio      I tried to use my personal radio in order to contact Police
            4
Control that further Police assistance was required urgently at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground, but each time I tried to use the radio I

was blocking others already using the radio, so I did not try further to

use it.

I then tried to use the internal telephone system to contact Police

Control but again each time I tried the line was engaged and could not get

through.     At this point Mr Lock then left the video room in order to

organise some safety measures with the security personel.

Also present during this time in the video room was a Mr Roger Holdsworth,

 he is the person who installed all the videos and computer system.

As he cbuld also see what was taking place he also left the room in order

 to assist in any way he could.

 I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of

 the ground to assist with the injured and dying.

 By this time injured persons were being brought to the players entrance of

 the ground and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging

 for ambulances to be directed in that area to ferry the injured to

 hospital.

 I can say that during the time prior to the major incident the Police

 personal radios were working very well but during the day there appeared

 to be some distortion and some messages could not be read clearly.

 I would like to add that in my opinion, the main cause of this major

 incident was caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late

 and being under the influence of drink and trying to enter the ground
                                 - 5 -




without tickets.    It was obvious that looking at the crowd outside the

ground prior to kick-off there were several thousands that were attempting

to enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool

supporters inside the ground.

During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received

on the Police radio network but did not listen to what was being

transmitted on the back to back radio system owned by the club,    asI knew

Mr Lock would deal with any situation that had developed.

After the incident I made a note of all the people that had entered    the

ground as shown on the computer and they are as follows

Spion Kop                           19,906

North Stand                          8,109

South Stand   Covered                4,740

South Stand Uncovered                3,255

Leppings Lane                        7,038

West Stand                           5,618

                   TOTAL            48,666

These numbers would not give a true reading of the exact amount of persons

 entering the ground due to the gates being opened and several hundreds

 entering the ground without tickets and trying to gain access, by any

 means.

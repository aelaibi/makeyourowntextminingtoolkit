     Further to our meeting of 28.11.89 my comments are as follows.
     Chapter 16       Estimation of Safe Ground Capacity
     To change any element requires major restructuring of clauses 221
     to 228 inclusive, the following are my initial thoughts:
     Clause 221
          Where                    by allowing "a maximum packing
     density of 54 persons per 10 square metres, depending on the
     condition of the terrace or slope".
          Only those          .... this calculation
     Clause 222
          Omit existing.
          Insert
          "Where a terrace deviates from the recommended guidelines,
     eg regarding width and rise of steps, underfoot conditions etc,
     this density should be reduced commensurate with the degree of
     deviation."
     Clause 223
          Omit "It may ............. two extremes".
     Clause 224
          Stet.
     Clause 225
          Rewrite formula:
                                A    x       54 (ie omit 27)
                                10


          Insert before example:-
          "As described above where the conditions of the terrace
     deviate from the guidelines the 54 should be reduced accordingly.
          There is no lower limit to this reduction, ie if the terrace
     was in such poor condition that it was totally unfit as a viewing
     area the figure could be 0.

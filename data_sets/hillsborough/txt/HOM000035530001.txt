         Dear Sir

         Hillsborough Documentation.

         1 have recently perused my files to ascertain requests for documentation which are still
         outstanding. These are as follows;-

          j On the l2'h August I faxed a request for statement numbers S1473, SI473a and SI473b
           ■' ' - ‘        - 1 1 presume this to be I                  '    ‘         y°u have
          previously sent me a statement on 12th August of P C Wadsworth.

          2 Photograph ref numbers C326A, C449, C489 and C490 were first requested on 30,h July
          1997 Poor quality laser copies of C326A C489 and C490 were forwarded on 8 August. I
          asked for actual photographic copies on 11* August. A reminder was sent on 29 August
          You replied on 8,h September stating you were not then in a position to provide me with the
          photographs A further reminder was sent on 27th October. Whilst acknowledging the volume
          of requests handled by South Yorkshire Police it is unacceptable that this particulat request is
          more than 3 months old. I would inform you that I intend to use at least one of these
          photographs as the basis o f further submissions to Lord Justice Stuart Smith. Please let me
          know by return when I can expect to receive the same.

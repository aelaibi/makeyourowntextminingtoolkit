This .is my account of what happened on the afternoon of 15 April        1989

(150489).



I arrived at Hillsborough football ground at around 14.20hrs where I

met ambulance member                 We then entered the ground and

reported to the first aid room.       .1 was then directed to the area near

to the disabled enclosure,    along with A/Cadet                     A/Member

            and another A/Member w h o ’s name I am unable to remember but

would recognise again.       At first when the crowd appeared to spi'll on

to the pitch we remained where we were.       A/M            said wait here

while   1 go and see what is happening at the other end of the ground.

We then realised there was a situation where more help was        required,

and we proceeded to assist everyone at the opposite end of the ground.

As we got approximately three quarters of the way to the other end of

the ground we met Divisional Superintendent Mr D Senior,       who was

returning with a casualty on a strecher he then handed the patient

over to myself and                     nd asked us to take him to the

first aid room.      He was then taken off the stretcher. We returned to

the Leppings Ln end with the stretcher.       I was then split from________

when nursing member                     asked me to look after a man

having an asthma attack who had lost his inhaler in the crowd.           He

was sat on the ground treating himself where        I reassured him until he

composed from his asthma attack.       I was then going to help

with another casualty when 1 saw someone else requiring as I proceeded

to him,   his mate get away you scab or else,   to which I left him alone
                                                                        PAGE      7
                                                                        D743

and continued along to help                    I then had to help a woman

who was hyper-ventilating.        I tried to calm her down as much as

possible,   but due to the situation this was very difficult.       After a

short while,    her boyfriend came along and managed to calm her down

slightly.      Then a Liverpool   fan came over to myself and nursing     cadet

               and ask if we could help his mate who was bleeding from

the ear.



As we approached him we noticed he was bleeding from the ear and the

corner of his eye by which we suspected he had a fractured skull.

The. casualty was dazed but conscious.        We tried to turn his head to

the injured side but he would not hold still and was shaking his head

about.     His mates then went and fetched one of the display boards to

use as a stretcher, we then placed him on the board while we were

continually reassuring him, he was having to be physically       restrained.

His mates also    reassured him and calling him           and that he was in

safe hands.      He was then taken round to the first aid post.         I then

stayed at the first aid post where I sat       in the police cell van and

looked after the younger cadets who were suffering from shock.            We

then stayed there until the duty had finished and I left the ground at

around 17,30hrs to 17„45hrs approximately.

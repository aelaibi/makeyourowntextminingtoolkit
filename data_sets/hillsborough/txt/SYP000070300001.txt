  19S9 we also visited Hillsborough football ground to

 4ee   the same two fc/otball teams,      in the same fixture.            When Liverpool

  FC qualified for the semi final, we both arranged,                via

  the telephone,    to go to this years fixture,       if we could obtain tickets

  for the event.

  Due to the fact,          family reside       in Liverpool,       he was able to get

    ticket for himself,    but not for m e .                    -

  Approximately a week before the game on Saturday 15th April                  1989, we

  again spoke to each other via the telephone and discussed going to the

  game, although he only had a ticket for himself.              We decided to travel

  to the game, and obtain another ticket so we could be together.

  On Friday 14th April    1989,         travelled from his place of employment

  to his home address, and on the following day,          I picked him

  up at his home,    and together we travelled to Sheffield in my private



' I collected        at approximtely 10.J30 am on Saturday 15th April               1989,

  and arrrived in Sheffield at awJroximately 12.30 pm.

                            Tilgithe Ml motorway and gained access to the
  We travelled from Leeds using

  A61 which was marked football      t raf f i c .

  There were no problems travelling to Sheffield,          and we arrived

  approximately half a mile from the Hillsborough ground at

  approximately 12.30 pm.

  Approximately half a mile,      north of the Hillsborough ground,             on the

  A61, was a public house,    I cannot     recall the name.          It was   closed and

  Police were at the entrance to this pub car park.                 They allowed us to

  park at this point.

  Once we had parked the car, we walked to the Leppings Lane end of the

  ground.   Whilst on route, we asked different         people in the area         if

  they had tickets to sell or swap.

  This was negative,    so we decided to go to the main entrance of the
                                                                               PAGE         3

ground and to the Spion Kop area,

It was evident,         wpdn we arrived by the main entrance,      that t i ^ e t

touts were p i ^ se n t , several      people were buy ina^afm selling /tickets.

We were directed to a white man, aged a p pj*fx ima t e 1y 30-35 yrs 6*             tall

a nd thin, wearing          casual   clothes and /r rucksack on his back.

He offered us two           tickets for the Spion Kop for a price of £50        <£25

e a c h ).

At this       point, we     had to sell m a r ks js'eat ticket for the West stand

valued at £12 and           sold it, to another Liverpool supporter for

af te rwhi ch we a^raed a further £20 to this, and pur chase^/Jfwo t i ckets

for the Spiafi Kop.

Due to tbre fact the tickets were for the Spion Kop and the Nottingham

Forest supporters end we decided whether to go with the Forest

supporters or consider the possibility of entering the Leppings Lane

End, and be witn the Liverpool supporters.              At this time,   it was

approx       1.3Q/pm a n d we decided to try and enter

the Leppings Lane end.           We walked along Penistone Road north,        to the

traffic       island,   north of the ground and then turned left,       back along

Leppings Lane.

Whilst travelling along Penistone R o ^ T N o r t h ,     a large no of mixed

supporter were queuing outside or^/off licence,            and purchasing alcohol

They were       consuming    it outsider the shop and Police officers       in the

inirnediate area showed no oj/Jection.

I did in fact stand in tne queue for about five minutes with the

intention of purchasing some myself.             However due to time,    w a i t i n g in

the queue I decided against it, and^we^tontinued to the Leppijfrgs Lane

On arrival, although there were people outside the turnstiles,                 no one

appeared to want to enter.

        It wasyat this time, we decided to speak to a Police Officer outside

        the turnstiles A - G , as per the ground map          (Ref No           )

         <Ex No            ) and ask    if it was possible to enter this area with

    ^   ^ *c k e ^s 'for      s Pi°n Kop.     to this   request,   the Police Officer stated

        that he had no objection provided the turnstile operator also had no

    Vj obj ect ions»       He also said that a few people had al read^/tSfone this.

        -We entered through the turnstile,

                                            and spoke to the tur~o«tile
                                                               rj/tXi   operator,

                                                                                                    He

                                                 /li
        had no objection to us entering and he collected the stub part of the

        ticket.      He did say,    that the tickets were stand and n o ^ seat tickets,
                                                           C       ^
        Once    inside the turnstile,       we were searched by ujnrrormed Police

        officers and we then walked towards the tumuli               entrance       (as per map)

        which was clearly visible.           Whilst walking toward the tunnel            I did not,

        see any obvious signs as to where to g o . / O u r          passage to the pdmnel

        was    completely free of people although quite a few people/were                  in the

        immediate area.
                                    c
        We walked along thjf tunnel which gave us direct access to the Leppings
    V
V       Lane terracing, ypens 3 and 4.           At the end of the tunnel,          we turned

        right, and stood directly at the back of the pen, with our backs

        against the wall to the seated area which was above us.

        The volume of spectators         in the pens were approximately 507. full and

        it was easy to obtain a view point.             At this time,    spectators       in this

        area where well behaved and the atmosphere was good.

        We were    in this area for about five minutes,            and we decided to move to

        a better     location.     A number of reasons helped us make this decision.

        1st was the fact the view was not particularly good,               second was the

        area known as area 7 was         virtually empty and thirdly,       the number of

        people who were lifted into the seats from this area,               last year was
                                                                                       PAGE      5
                                                                                       S145 6

quite high due to the large numbers           in this       location,   and we did not

want to possibly be in that       position on this oce^sion.

Together with         I walked around the ra*fr of the west stand, and
                                                  ^     '
gained access to the upper half of             ction 7 of the Leppings Lane

te r rac inq via a staircase at thr rear of the stand.

We gained access to section 7 and stood at a point marked X on the map

of the ground (Ref No             ) (E:< No        ) whi cjy'was to the back of

the terracing. We stood at point X from abjydft 2.00 pm and the view to

the playing area and all the L e p pingsJ/ane terracing was totally

unobstructed.

The number of spectators in the terracing was getting/fnore in numbers
                                        fere £-+4-
and it was evident that by 2.30 pm pens 3 and 4 >*Hs full to its

capac it y, to such an extent that people co u kf not move.                 In fact I

believe    it was at this time,   that I saw / female teenager being

ferried across the heads    of the spectators to the front of the

terracing.    I cannot recall what happened after that.

It was also evident that pen surrounding 3 and 4 wej^e^vi rtual ly half

full.                                fer© I- a -v 5

From this time,    I witnessed a number of s.pe^gTators climbing the side

partitions of pens 3 and 4,       in order to/gain access to the side

sections supporters were also being^/lfifted from the rear of pens 3 and

4 into the seated area above and behind them.
                                                                  C, "teims csn .ptibn
At approximately 2.55 pm the football          teams        come onto the playing area

and the spectators were still       climbing to side fences of pens 3 and 4

and still being    lifted to the seated area.

At 3.00 pm the game started and the situation in this area did not

improve.                                                                - ^n s o f &
At 3.06 pm the game was stopped due to the number of spectators

climbing the perimeter barriers and spilling onto the playing area.

Immediately prior to this,    the Police Officers              in my view,     thought      it
                                                                                          PAGE     6
                                                                                          S1456

was possibly a pitch invasion by the supporters,                     but once they

obviously saw the problem of overcrowding and people                       collasping on the

pitch,    they tried to calm the supporters down.                          ^

When    it was obvious supporters were            injured,      the Police tr>ed to help

them over the barrier fencing.

The spectators were panicking and obviously concerned for their

safety.     W h en it was evident the people on c'
                                                tp€ / playvng area were

seriously injured,        other spectators starred to assist them,                  by pulling

away advertisement boards and using tbfem as stretchers.

At this stage, Police         reinforcements        came from the corner of the Spion

Hop and formed a cordon across the               centre line of the placing area,

Other Police of f i c e r y ^ a m e   to the a r e a ^ i ^               ejrfa.cing to assist

uf.ith helping the i n j u r e d ,

Dur i ng this tiafe, I saw some spectators very s/\qry and upset against

the Police, and at the same time,              people tried to assist the police by

trying to pull away the fencing, and carrying                    injured people down

towards the Spion Hop at a point next to the North stand.

It was also evident that some people had died when they were                         covered

by blankets.       Generally the area was full of people who were

hysterical,     walking around in shock,            and gasping for their breath.

With regards to        coverage by the media in general about alleged public

disorder within the ground,            I cannot say I witnessed anything of this

nature and other than this particular                incident when people were

obviously concerned for their safety,                the     s pe cta^irt) rs behaved very

 ell,    under the    circumstances.             n         /

I feel that the Police         could have      conti^en.led the large numbers             in the

Leppings Lane area much better,             with' regards todistribution             of

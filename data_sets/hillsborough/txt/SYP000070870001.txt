                  On Saturday 15th April        1989   (150489)        I attended the FA Cup Semi Final

                  at Hillsborough.         I am a Liverpool     supporter and obtained my ticket

                  for the game via my father.          I p f e i d £6.00 for the ticket wjpdch is for

                  On Saturday we used the local bus service to get t,o the game and
    / ^ m         walked approximately three quarters of a mile arlso.

                  We arrived at the entrance to the g r o u n d / ^ / a b o u t           1320 hours

                  By this time there were very few fa^nsy^Ubout and only a handful of

                  Police Officers.
                                                                         PAGE             2
                                                                         S1513

I walked straight through the turnstiles and handedyfiy ticket           in.

Once    inside the ground I was body searched by a^ P j i ice Officer.
                                                    Pg4       Of f i           I

purchased a programme and then walked down the tunnel o nto the

terraces.                          /

I did not see any signs directing me to the te rra ces .        I saw the pitch

at the other end of the tunnel and I thought       it the most accessible.

At this time there was only a few fans,       some of whom were sunbathing

on the terraces.     Gradually as time w                                           'ill

up.     The fans were all    in good spirit

anyone drinking.

I w o u l d ’ve got into the terraces abou

I stood with my three friends       in the terraces.

At about    1445 hours,   the pen became obviously full.

At •"'1455 hours, as the players    came onto the pit         kick off   it had

become more    crowded.     After about a minute of t         ing onto the
                 CfVldCf xJlvCr<o /C kA 'O-'Y
pitch I was then pushed dov<rythe/Xerraces from a position N3 almost up

to the fencing to position M7t/ I stopped at the first barrier as you

walk up the terraces from the pitch with a few people          in front of me

and behind the barrier.

I d o n ’t know what actually caused the surge of people but       it was just

due to the amount of people       coming onto the terraces.

I then began shouting at the Policeman on the touch line to open the

gate as did a lot of people.

The Policeman d i d n ’t open the gate and fans started to climb over the

fencing.    The Police Officers on the touch line seemed reluctant to

let the fans climb over the fence onto the pitch and were          indicating

to the people on the fences and the people       in the terraces to get

back.    The crush from behind seemed to remain constant but all          the

time you were moving trying to stop yourself from falling over.                It

was effecting a lot of pe opl e’s breathing.
                                                                                                PAGE      3
                                                                                                S1513

               Slightly to my right I sav/ a man who had his back to the barrier.  He
                                             uui /         h o -^ ^ u
               was bent at 90 degrees oyer the i/arrier and was screaming in obvious

               pain.     At that point the front gate opened and I tried to calm the man

               telling him that the gate was open and the pressure would be relieved.

               A man who was stood next to me on my left was having terrible trouble

               breathing and was     the man directly in front of him.            I   told the m«

               not to scream and     to save his breath,

               I turned away for     a moment and when      I turned back/ h e ’d slipped onto

               the floor.

               With other fans we pulled this man up.           He w a s n ’t b re ath in g, h e ’d

               turned blue and showed no obvious signs of life.                I would think this

               man fell on to the floor at about        1510 h o u r s .
                                        /
               After a few minutes/the       pressure was   relieved and two other fans took

               this man to the s/Lde of the terraces,        lay him on the floor and began

               giving him heaVX m ass age .

               I'm sure this man was dead at the time. / I          do not know if they managed

               to revive him.

               I would describe     the man as aged about 45-50 y e a rs, but he looked

               older.    He had short dark h a i r, average b u i l d .      I c a n ’t describe any
      US
               of his clothing.

b-C            There was other fans on the terraces who were               in distress.     I made
p^-c<r\<iS |
               sure one man who was sat with his head in his hands was alright.                       I
\jS iK$-C
ip    in>.     then climbed over the fencing on to the pitch to join my friend



               We looked around for our other friends,          ^er^isted one man on the         pitch

               who was having problems breathing.

               I left him with the St Johns Ambulavfce people

               Later on with          and    some other/fans we carried an injured man with

               a spine    injury off the    pitch omja hoarding to an area outside at the

               back of the stands where there was ambulances waiting.                 We returned

         to the pitch trying to assist anyone else.             By this time the whole

         area was full of people trying to help the injured and we were getting

         in one anothers way.                       /

         We continued then to look for our/other two friends and found                      on

         the actual terraces,     who was    in/some discomfort with his chest and

         stomach.    We eventually c1imb^d over         into the North Stand made our way

         speaking over the loudspeaker.         I wasn't     paying much attention to the

         announcements and left the ground shortly after that.

         I would say that the Police Officers on the pitch intitially thought

         it was a crowd disturbance.        I d o n ’t think they realised that   it was a

         This obviously caused a delay in getting fans out.

         I would also add that there seemed to be inadequate medical            facilities

         available to deal with the injured.

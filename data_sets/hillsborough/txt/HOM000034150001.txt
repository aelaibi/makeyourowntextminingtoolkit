Thank you very much for your letter of 6 December in which you asked to meet me in
order to discuss what options were open to the families of the victims who would Hlfp to see
a fresh inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster. Since that earlier letter, I did of course
respond to your adjournment debate on 17 December and it was good of you to write in the
terms that you did on the following day.

As you know, I have undertaken to consider carefully the points which were made in the
programme “Hillsborough”, by yourself in the debate, and in the letters which I have
received. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire will make a report to me on the separate
issues. Once I have received this report, and had an opportunity to reflect upon it, I would be
happy to meet you and discuss the findings.

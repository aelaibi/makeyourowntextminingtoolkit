  Dear M r Kennedy

   HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

   I enclose for your information a video tape which has been made up to
   assize in the forthcoming interviews if necessary. The document number is
   143a for the D.P.P. file.

   The ta p a shows a split screen of the crowd build up in Leppings Lane at
   set intervals from 2 pm onwards using the original video material from the
   1988 and 1989 games.

   I accept that evidentially the video is not best evidence but it helps to
   show the difference in crowd build up on the two occasions. It is my
   belief this is a factor that may be introduced by some of those to be
   interviswed.

   From y o u r present video 1ist the respective video Document Numbers are 146
   for 1988 and 110 for 1989.

   In due course I will forward a revised document list and schedule to
   update your file.

   Yours s i n c e r e l y

   DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT

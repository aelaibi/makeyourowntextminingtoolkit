  Thank you for the update re funding the defence. It is mildly satisfying, for a change, to be mere spectators,
  rather than participants - although the result, of course, could have significant implications for us.

  I am happy with Sue's draft letter, subject to a couple of small points (and some minor drafting points, with which
  we need not be troubled here).

  The first full paragraph on the second page should refer, in the first line, to Section 6(1), not 6(2).

  At the moment, the draft suggests that it will be sent by Sue, rather than by us. Is that right? I had assumed that
  the letter would come from us. It might look a bit too defensive if it comes from our solicitor - but perhaps that is
  intentional!

  I should certainly like Philip Havers to cast his eye over the draft. Subject to the views of any other recipient of
  this, could the papers go to him today?

  We can deal with the drafting points later.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY;                          HOME OFFICE EVIDENCE
I enclose for information a copy of the final version of the Home
Office evidence which has now been passed to the Hillsborough
Inquiry.
2. The evidence includes the replacement in Part V of the
earlier paragraphs 121 to 126 by the revised paragraph 121
referring to Restriction Orders under Part II of the Football
Spectators Bill, as agreed by the Home Secretary. There are one
or two very minor editorial changes.

           Dear

           Thank you for your recent letters to Mr Moynihan and the Prime
           Minister which have been passed to this department in view of
           our responsibilities for the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I
           apologise for the delay in replying to you.

           Your view that all seated accommodation at football grounds
           will not solve the problems of crowd safety and control has
           b ee n noted.  However, it is a view which the government does
           not share and which does not equate with the views expressed
           by Lord Justice Taylor in his Final Report on the H il ls borough
           Stadium disaster.     He recognised that there was no single
           solution to achieve total safety and cure all the problems of
           crowd control.    However, he was satisfied that seating does
           m ore to achieve these objectives than any other single
           measure.    Furthermore this is in line with the policies of
           b ot h FIFA and UEFA.

                                                                       Yours sincerely




                                                                       MR S BILBE

Dear Mrs Thatcher,

      I am w     r    i     express my concern at proposals of
all-seater football stadiums as recommended by the Taylor
report on the Hillsborough tragedy. I feel that all-seater
stadiums would not neccesarily be a w a y of making a ground any
safer, & that a properly and safely organized terrace would be
no less safe than the seated equivalent; In fact there would be
other dangers involved in having seated areas rather than
terraces, such as in the event of fire - The time taken to
clear a terrace would be substantially quicker than that of an
all-seater area.

     I am a supporter of Southampton F.C. and regularly watch
matches from the terraces, and from my experience I have no
doubt that a safely, well-designed terrace along with efficient
marshalling is as safe as any area of seated area of a stadium.
I realize the importance of learning from the Hillsborough
tragedy, but to scrap terracing is not the answer to the
problem, especially when there were so many other variables
involved in that particular incident.

     I was pleased to see that, from the budget, money is going
to be put into football to help fund improvements to grounds,
but I believe that the money would be best spent on making
safer terraces rather than making them all— seating areas, & I
also hope to see this money distributed fairly to all league
teams rather than to the rich few. The terraces are an
important part of British Football, & if terraces were to
disappear then the whole character of the game would change
because less people would be able to afford to go to matches,
because of the inevitable increase in admission prices that
would occur as capacities decreased. I personally would be very
unhappy at having to sit rather than stand to watch matches.

        I believe that terraces can be safe if properly organized,
& the terrace that I stand on, Milton Road, is an example of a
safe terrace in practice. Therefore, I am inviting you to come
to see a match from the Milton Road terrace at Southampton as a
guest of mine, so that you can see the situation first-hand and
decide whether or not there is really a need for all— seater
s ta di u ms .
        I look forward to hearing from you.
            Yours sincerely,

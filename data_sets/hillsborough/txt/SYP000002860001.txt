                  I am a single man and I live at the above address with my son.

                  At 11.15 am on Saturday              15th April1989 I attended at Shef f i e 1d in
a   m k                                                       tJ'Z-OiL      hlCUbfc        a7V£>-7 y/5~S
                  company with four friends,             Andrew BROOKES',

                             and Mark RICHARDS.           We started our journey at 9.15 am from

                  B r o m s g r o v e , and travelled by c a r .

                  When we got to Sheff ieId we parked the car and went                             into Hi 11sborough

                  Cent re and we went to a public h o u s e .             Except     for _________________ we

                  all    had four       pints.

                  It was our intention to go to the Hillsborough f o o t b a l 1 ground to

                  watch the Liverpool              v Nottingham Forest football           semi-final.

                  We all had tickets for the Leppings Lane e nd of the ground and we all

                  arrived at the turnstiles at about 2.25 pm to 2.30 p m .                             Because of

                  the amount         of people we all got split u p .           I went        into the ground
                                                                                     P AG E        2
                                                                                     S 2S6

and stood on the         right hand side of the terracing as I looked at the

p it c h .

The game started at 3.00 pm and at that time                    I was stood on my o w n . I

did not know where any of my friends were.                          r
                                                           S '0 ■
At about 3.05 pm I noticed to my left a surge of people bursting                        i nto

the centre of the ground on the terracing and at almost                      the same time

I saw people spilling onto the playing area.

Shortly after that the pitch got full                of people and some time        later      1

deci ded to leave the ground and make my way back to the                     c a r . By this

time I had met                          we saw Hark RICHARDS,           we shouted him and

he came and joined us.            The other two remained at the ground and t                  left

on my own and went           back to the c a r .Some time       late r when I got to the

car I met _________ and some five minutes                 later we we re joined by

and Hark.      We waited at the car for Andrew B ROOKES but he d i d n ’t arrive

Enquiries were made to try and find Andrew BROOKES and later that day

I attended at Hi 1Isborough football              ground     in company w ith

             an d Ma r k .

At 10.55 pm I was shown the body of Andrew BROOKES and I positively

identified him to Police Constable               1779 WILLIAMSON.

Andrew BROOKES is about 25 years of age and he lived with his                       parents

at                                     B r om sg rov e.

To my knowledge Andrew was not suffering from any illness or anything

to do with his general           health.

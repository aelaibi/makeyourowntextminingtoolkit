TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN




Dear Sir/Madam

Re:     Mr & Mrs J S Williams

In my opinion a further inquest on my patients s o n ’s death would
be beneficial to a more sustained emotional recovery from the
severe bereavement stress that both parents have been coping with
for y e a r s . The longer the delay I fear the longer it will take
for them to come to terms with Kevin's death.

Recently, more information concerning events at the scene have
improved their state of mind and although attendance at an inquest
would indeed by stressful, I am confident that they are able and
willing to deal with this most pressing and urgent m a t t e r .

Yours sincerely




Dr S J Crosbv^

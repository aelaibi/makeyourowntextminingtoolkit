Dear Mr Joynes

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

I am writing further to our telephone conversation last week.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated that he would like individual requests for meetings to
be made as part of a written response to his letter. I should therefore be grateful if you would
include your request in a letter to him which should also include any information relating to
the disaster which you wish to put forward. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will then consider the
representations he has received, and will make arrangements to meet interested parties as
appropriate. I should like to take this opportunity to remind you that representations to Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith should be made to the above address by 1 September.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further queries.

Yours sincerely




Mike Ward

    Dr Athwal. HOEP




    PROFESSOR PHIL SCRATON

%   We spoke.

    2.      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been appointed by the Home Secretary to
    conduct a scrutiny of new evidence relating to the Hillsborough Football Stadium
    disaster. I am acting as secretary to this exercise. You may be interested to see the
    Judgeâ€™s terms of reference, and I attach them.

    3.      Since this work began in the summer we have had some contact with Professor
    Phil Scraton, of Edge Hill College (which is of course near Liverpool). We met him
    when the Judge went to Merseyside last week to meet and listen to the families of
    those who died. The Professor seemed to be acting as a spokesman of sorts, and sat
    in - with their consent - on several of the private meetings which we had with
    relatives. He is coming to London next Friday for an interview with the Judge.

    4.      Professor Scraton has told me over the phone - and you kindly confirmed -
    that he has written a research paper for HOEP on the management of the aftermath of
    major disasters such as Hillsborough (he also mentioned the Marchioness, Lockerbie
    and Dunblane as other examples which he has researched).

    5.      It would be helpful if, before we see the Professor again next Friday, we could
    have a chance to look at his research paper, which I think you said was with you. We
    ought I think to know what it says.

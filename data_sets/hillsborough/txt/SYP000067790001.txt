                  am a married woman living at the above address with my husband and

                                     I am                              t-he Harrogate and district

                .ivsrpool     supporters        club*   My duties       involve the general              organisation

               of the club, arranging tickets^                 transport etc.        Along with others                  I

               started the c1ub about four years ago *                    I organised the trip to

               Hillsborough football ground for the semi final match between

               Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15th April                      1989 and attended the

               ground myself.         I travelled to Sheffields, along witn forty five

               members of the club?             on a coach f rojir^the firm o f DQDSwQR 1H c o a ch e s

               W e t h e r by ' % 8 a rougher i dge, N a rJ/h Yorkshire.         All our members were in

               possession of tickets for the ground.                     I caught the coach from near my

               home address at about             1 0 .00am and we travelled via Leeds to the Ml

               motorway picking up club members as we went along.                            Once on the
                                                                                                            Si 205

m o t o r wa y we stopped once at Woo l y e d g s             services         to pick up two              club

stiembe   r s and as a t o i 3.e t s t o p «

We arri v e d       in S h e ff ie ld at about        12.45pm and the             coach      parked        near a

brewery       close to the ground.              As    I got off      the coach I noticed                    that

there were a few people a pp ro a c h i n g               the    coach      parties and asking                    if

there were any spare              tickets.        I had two tickets               left over so             I sold

them to two teenagers               who    had asked.         The   tickets          cost £ 1 2 . 0 0 each so

thats what         I sold th e m f or r they were             f or the West S tand              part of the

ground.        We all w a l ke d to the Leppings Lane area of the ground and
                                                           f'
a rr iv ed there at about            1 .00 p m ,_ I b^fd a r r a n g e d to meet              seven other

people      outside      the L e p ping s    Lan^entrance           to hand over             their      tickets

so a group of us stood on t h e /road by the                        entrance          to await        their

arrival.        At this       time and up until           around 2 . 0 0 p m the            crowds at the

turnstiles yere           not excessive and            I saw no disorder.                   Gradually

m em b e r s J6V our group f i l tered          into the ground and                  I was    last with

                       and                            At about 2. 1Q p rn the three                 of us

w a l k e d over     to tiyi t,hey i . a r g 8 blue   outer     gates    on Leppings            Lane.         i had

                                                                           y
               and his brother            who had not yet arrived.                    The    three      of u*

s tood     in a sort of         p r o tected are      b etween/Che       triangle           of open gates.

became      one big      crowd    rather     than queues.           At about 2 . 4 0 pm 1 h eard a

loud      chanting and saw! a group cyf               hundreds      of Liverpool             s u p p o r t e rs

approaching          the entrances         a'Ldng Leppings Lane            from the d i r e c t i o n of

the South Stand side.                These also        Joined the          crowd.       The     crowd was

protected area between the gates                      1 became      extremely worried.                     I feared

that      the hinges       on the gates might           break under            the    pressure        of

t h e c row d s .     1 m a n a g e d t o h a n d o v e r t h e tw o t i ck e t s t o

through the gaps             in the gate,       this was at about 2.45pm,                                  mo v e a

through the             crowd, and m an a g e d        to get out onto Leppings                   Lane.        The

crowd was spread out                 right across           the    road around the Leppings Lane

area,        I then         informed some         foot officers              about               and where         she

was and m oved back with them                      into the        crowd and to where                  the m o u n t e d

officer was             situated.         They spoke        to the m o u n t e d officer.                 I then

m o v e d out of the            crowd and stood at the back on Leppings Lane.                                      At

about 3.00pm the                crowd had dispersed somewhat                          but there were          still       a

lot of       people         outside.       I heard a loud hailer anno u n c e m e n t                     w hich      1

the       ticket,       and entered the           ground.         By this         time    it was       very    close

to about 3.10pm.                 I made my way ar o u n d to the North Stand and got                                      to

my viewing             seat.     This was      situated almost                in line with the halfway

line and about               halfway      back.        At this time           I saw that         the    players           had

left       the    pitch.       E v e r y b o d y was    standing      up and           looking    towards        the

carried on stretchers                towards      the SPION KOP              end and the N o t t i n g h a m

into a line,            side    by side,     across     the      pitch ar o u n d the halfway area.

I saw that          fans were       being    carried and e s c orted from the West                        terrace

to a l l o w the        injured to be t r a n s ported away.                       I left    the ground at

about 4.25pm and made my way back                       to the           coach.       Several     memb e r s    of

Further       to the above          I also     recall       that a line of              police wit h dogs

p ositioned         themselves       in a line       in front            of the N orth S t a n d along              tne

length side            of the    pitch,     they were        situated         there      for    some time

whilst      injured fans were             being    carried off.               As a result         of this a

number      of supporters a r o u n d by me were heckling and shouting                                   at them

to go and help the               injured     instead of standing                    there,     because    there

was    no disorder.

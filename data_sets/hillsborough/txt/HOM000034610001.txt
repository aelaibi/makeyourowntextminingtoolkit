HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:   LETTER FROM HR HICKS
You asked for advice and a draft reply.
We have consulted briefly with the Deputy Chief Constable of
South Yorkshire, Mr Hayes, who emphasises that his response was
in answer to a specific question about Mr Duckenfield lying to
his Deputy Chief Constable and is being wrongly attributed to
much wider questions.
Mr Hayes agrees that any question of possible disciplinary action
against any of the officers involved at Hillsborough must await
the outcome of the Taylor Inquiry.   He will be careful to make
no further pronouncements on the subject.




                                                MISS R HATCHER

Thank you for your letter of 8 June 1989.

The responsibility for deciding whether disciplinary action should
be taken against a police officer of chief superintendent rank or
below lies with the chief officer of police of the force concerned
subject only to the procedures for investigating complaints against
the police by members of the public.   There are statutory
procedures governing the investigation of complaints which require
the involvement of the independent Police Complaints Authority in
the decision on disciplinary matters.

As you know, the Government has instituted an inquiry by Lord
Justice Taylor into the unfortunate events at Hillsborough.
Whilst I cannot comment on individual cases I would have thought
that as a general principle any final decisions on disciplinary
matters must await the outcome of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry and
the investigation of any related complaints against the police.

I understand that the Deputy Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
takes a similar view.

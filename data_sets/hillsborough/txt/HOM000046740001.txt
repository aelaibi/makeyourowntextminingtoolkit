NOTE FOR FILE




Telephone call from Mrs Jennifer Hicks today (1420). She wanted to
make an appointment to see Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.


I said that the judge wanted to assess all the submissions before deciding
whom to interview. Could not make any appointments yet because it was
not clear who he would want to see or when he would be meeting people
- (though this would probably be late September or October).


She said she had written to the Support Group, who wouldforward her
letter to us. She would wait to hear from us.

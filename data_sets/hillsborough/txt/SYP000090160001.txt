              Further to the questionnaire           I made earlier this year in connection

              with the Hillsborough disaster after                 I had climbed from Pen 4 into ^Pen

                 " I then was assisted        in climbing up into the stand.             I then saw a

              lot of bodies        lying on the pitch and decided that I would be needed

              there.     I climbed back down onto the fence by this time the gate was

              open to the pen and I was able to go "Lbr ough onto the p i t c h , looki ng

              towards the pitch and to the left o f the 6 yrd box by the corner I saw
   o>*
!M            a youth about 14 years _of age „ ve t/y             thin smooth complexion with a
  p5Urs
              light brown curly h a i r .        I ’ve no/ idea what he was wearing         I saw a St
     ^    ‘

S3            Johns Ambulance man giving hea/t massage and a civilian giving mouth

              to mouth.        The civilian aopea/ed to be giving up so I went over to

              assist.

              I gave mouth to mouth resuscitation w h i 1st the St Johns Ambulance man
                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                          S3442

               was giving    cardiac massage.     The youth was a greyer shade of white and

               slightly blue around the mouth.          We gave him three or four minutes

               before I decided that it was in vain.

               After this    I moved further over towards the penalty area to the right,

               there we re a lot of bodies in this area being 1 i ned up, but I made my

               way to a rather large male of about 30 y e a r s .       I think he had long
    Itjf
               dark shoulder    length hair almost black.       I would estimate him to be

               about 16-17 s t o n e .   He appeared to be d e a d , there were two young

               people with     him but they did not appear to know what to do.        I

               assisted by     giving him mouth to mouth for a couple of minutes but it

               was futile.       I then wandered around for a few minutes      looking at all

               the bodies.       I was basically looking for someone with at least a        bit

               of life in them everyone seemed to have either a police officer or St

               J o h n ’s ambulance man with them I was in some shock myself.        I was on

               the pitch for some fifteen minutes and other than assisting those two

               bodies I merely assisted others to assess the people were dealing with

               After this I left the pi ton via the Leppi ngs Lane end about         10 minutes

               after the announcement w        leave.

           ^   I was wearing a bright/red sweat top with a small motif on the left

    $          breast and a pair o-<\/bright strong green tracksuit bottoms

    i          I am unable to identify these apparent deceased persons further,             nor

               do I know who the St John's Ambulance         person w a s .

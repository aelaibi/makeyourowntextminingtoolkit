                LONDON   SW11 9AT




               Dear Mr Whalley,

               Thank you for your letter of the 11th Instant, the contents of which I
               note.   I am obliged for your assistance.

               I have received subsequently some more statements which I have forwarded
               to the Treasury Solicitor.   As far as I am aware those have not been
               sent direct.

               I understand from those instructed on behalf of the Supporters Association
               that on Monday there will be available a copy of the Compilation video for
               each party who has been granted representation and that the full ivdeo in
               the Police possession will be available to view if needed.

               It may well be on particular matters that we would wish to see parts
                  thie video and no doubt this can be dealt with as the occasion arises.

               Yours sincerely,




              MISS E M STEEL

    The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter
of 8 June 1989 and to offer his personal sympathy for your
terrible loss.

    The Government has instituted the inquiry by Lord Justice
Taylor in order to discover what went wrong at Hillsborough on
that day. Whilst the responsibility for deciding whether
disciplinary action should be taken against a police officer or
chief superintendent rank or below lies with the Chief Constable,
the Home Secretary considers that any final decisions on
disciplinary matters are bound to await the outcome of Lord
Justice Taylor's inquiry.

    I understand that the Deputy Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire takes that view.




                                                                     'fit,0-3   9

 Dear Home Secretary,


                                                             r p : Hi 11 sborough Pi sawLor


 I am the father of the late Sarah and Victoria Hicks who unfortunately
 were among the 95 people so tragically killed at Hillsborough.


 You    will    require              little                   reminder           of   the     increasingly          acrimonious        rounds
 of    accusation        and              counter                   accusation           that    abounded          in    the   media       until
you had the good sense to issue your instruction to the police and request
a general cessation.

Despite        acute    provocation                                and     at    times      great     personal          anquish,      my    wife
and     I have        resisted                  numerous                  opportunities          to    fuel       that    deplorable         and
unseemly        state         of      affairs,                       preferring          to     assist       the    Taylor       Inquiry      in
its difficult task - including being prepared to await the outcome before
making detailed comment to the media.


I write        to you         today                 to request your                    comment        and    intervention following
the statement,          widely reported                                    in the media,          by South Yorkshire’s Deputy
Chief    constable            Peter                 Hayes             to    the       effect    that        "no    further     action        was
required”        in      connection                                with         the    actions        and     behaviour          of        Chief
Superintendant David Duckenfield.
I was under the impression that Lord Justice Taylor on the one hand and
the internal Police Investigation by the West Midlands force on the other,
would draw conclusions when and only when                                                      they had       concluded        their work
and    had     time    to      deliberate.                            Despite         the     careful       wording,       the     issue     of
this statement by the Deputy Chief Constable pre-empts these findings!


Words fail me when 1 try to convey to you the hurt and totally u n n e c e s s a r y
anguish this untimely statement has given my wife,                                                           myself and presumably
the other       families.                 Apart                    from    the    crass       nature     of this         action,      I find
the need to issue such a statement at this time beyond contempt.
 One can only conclude that this is yet a further attempt by South Yorkshire
 Police     to    divert    public    opinion    away   from   their        appalling      performance
 both on the fatal day and subsequent to it.


Apart      from   obvious    offence    to    the bereaved,      how     are   the public      to view
th      premature "absolution" by the Deputy Chief Constable!
That a senior police officer - who by his own admission deliberately chose
to doceive his superiors (and others!) should not be disciplined is totally
incredible.
ttven if one believes Chief Superinlendant DuokonfieId's reasons for lying
to the general public at the time,              (and ] am bound to say that I personally
do not!) there could have been no credible reason to have misled the Deputy
Chief Constable.


Is    it   purely    coincidence       that    this   provided      an      excuse   for    the    Chief
Constables silence during the lead-in /initial week of the Taylor Inquiry,
when the fans were able to give their views?
I trust      that   under    the   circumstances      you   will    understand my          fears of a
•’whitewash"      at the least and at the worst a deliberate                     attempt to ”close
ranks” and distort the course of justice.


I regret that Mr.Hayes's insensitive and untimely public                         action has further
reduced my opinion of the South Yorkshire senior police.
It leaves me no alternative but to formally complain directly to yourself,
and to ask you as the vanguard of a Government claiming to be ’’committed
to    law and     order"    to make    an unequivocal       statement of your opinion and
intended actions in the wake of this regrettable development.


I will await your urgent response during the course of today or tomorrow,
but   would      advise    that   should   I fail     tq, recieve      an    appropriate response
I reserve the right Lo follow Mr.Hayes                   example     and     release    this      letter
to the media tomorrow evening.

     for a b o u t       30 minutes,              having          a r r i v e d at       about         quarter           to    two    (1345).

     I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r         the      pub     name.          In the         pub       there        were       about       8-10

     other       Liverpool            supporters,              I did       not      see a n y          other        supporters             in

     some     waste        land       j us t     off    Peniston\ R y K                about        a fifteen minute                     walk

     not    see     or     receive           any Police            direction             from       parking             the    car    to    the

     ground,        but       I wasn't           looking          for    any,       as      I had        been       to    the      ground

     three       t i mes      be f o r e .       The     c r o w d was        good       humoured and                   1 did      not     see      any

     2.40pm       (1440)         to 2 . 4 5 p m        (1445).           When       I arrived             here          it was       just       a

      arge       mass      of,       in e x c e s s      of 5 0 0       pe ople.            We    joined           the mas s ,        about

     30ft     to 4 0 f t       from        the    turnstiles.                 There         was     pot       queuing         at     all.

     After       I joined            the     queu e,        two    or    three         Policemen              on ^ hoyses          came     behind

     me,    stopping           anyone           else     joining         the mas s .              T hey w e r e          telling         everyone

     were     closer          together           and were          swaying          from         side     to       si.de.       There       were

     no    other       Policemen attempting                        to    direct          the      crowd.

The    turnstiles              are    about       seven       or      e i ght    f o ot        tall,       1 s a w a Po 1 i c e m a n ,

who    appeared           to    be    standing           on s o m e t h i n g ,       behind          the       turnstile,

leaning        o ver      the    top       and    pul 1 ing y o u n g           k ids      of a b o u t         eight        or    nine

years       o ver    the       top    of    the    t u r n s t l ^ e ^ a nd          onto       the     ground.              I d id      not

see    any     stewards          at    the       turnstiles.

I found        no d i f f i c u l t y       in f i n d i n g        the L e p p i n g s         Ln    entry        point,          as    I was

familiar          with     the       ground.

When    I first           joined       the       queue      I had a n           unobstructed                view        to    the

turnstiles.               T h e n at       about       2 . 4 5 pm     (1445?         I saw a Pol i c e m a n                 on a

horseback           who    was       about       10ft     in f r o n t       of me.             He    pul led f ^ / t w r g a t e s

across       which        prevented my             entry         to    the      turnstiles.                 The        crowd were

swaying        behind          these       gat e s ,    but      there       wa s     no       surge       to    get     through

them.        I think           most    people          realised           that       t his      was     d one      to    operate             the

crowds       and     prevent          crushing.             I was         then       stood          in the       s ame       spot       for

about       ten m i n u t e s ,       1 was       not     cr u s h e d ,     th e     Police          horses           were       stood

directly          b e h i n d me      and     there       was       a build          up    of       people       the     other          side

of    the    Police        horses.            Nothing         drew my a t t e n t i o n               to    these        people          so    I

assume       they were           just       gathering            in a n      orderly manner.                       It w a s        obvious

we    could       not     go a n y w h e r e      a n d at       t his     t ime      to me          it a p p e a r e d       that

everything           was       under       c o n trol.

After       the     ten m i n u t e s       I saw       the      gates       10ft         in f r o n t      of me        open.           I did

not    see     by who.           I could          then      see a n u m b e r             of    people          wh o    had       been

standing          in the        t u r n s t i 1e q u e u e , ground              side          of    the    gates,           move       to

their       right       and     down       the    side      of      the    turnstiles,                to a g a t e           which       ran

at    right       angles        to    the     turnstiles.                 I could          j ust      see       the     top       of    this

gate,       w h i c h was       a folding          type.            I saw       the       gate       openijng a n d m o s t              of

the    p e o p l e , about           400    in nu m b e r ,         entered          through          Xp.i s gate.                They       were

walking        quickly,          but       not    ru n n i n g .       This      was       about        a few m inutes                  before

three       o ’ clock       (1500).

Originally when                 the    gates       opened           I was       at    the       rear       of    the     crowd,          but       I
made    my way        forward attempting                         to    catch       up w i t h m y            friends.            I am

therefore        unable           to     tell       if     the    Police        horses            b e h i n d me      had m oved            to

a llow more          of    the      crowd          through.

Having       entered           through         the       g a t s ,1 w a s     in the          gr o u n d .       I stood           near         the

turnstiles           waiting            about       1 minute           to    see    if       I could          find my          friends.

The    people        just       k ept     funneling              through        this         gate,        the    horses          must       have

moved and        it a p p e a r e d           everyone           was    coming          through.              I would          estimate

that    maybe        no m o r e         than a        1,000       people        came         through          the     gate       while          I

was    watching           it.      But        they       were     s t ill     coming          in w h e n        I decided             to    walk

away    and     find a m at c h               viewing           position.

Nobody asked              to    see      my    ticket          which        I had       in m y        hand.          There       was       no

control       o ver       the     gates        a nd      I did        not    see a n y P o l i c e m a n             at    thi s      p o in t

in the       g r o u n d , there          w e r e n ’t a n y          stewards          either■

I st i l l    h ave       my    ticket         complete           in m y      possession,                 but    I d o n ’t w a n t             to

part w i t h     it at          this      stage.

When    ins i d e     the       ground         I      did      not     see a n y        signs         directing           me     to    the

terracing,           but       I was           not l o o k i n g       because          I knew          the w a y f r o m        previous

experience»

When    past     the       turnstiles,                it       looks    like       the       only way           to    the      terracing

was    via    the     centre            tunnel.            Steps       leading          to    the       seating           area     obscure

the    view     to    the       terracing             s ide      entrances.                       /

At    about    3pm        <1500)         1 entered             the     centre       tuyftel,            at    the     head       of    the

tunnel       I could walk                freely,           but as       I got       further             forward you              got

closer       together           u n til       when       I was        about     h a 1f way            down      I came         across           a

solid mass           of    people ,           w h i c h was       slowly moving                   forward.

I realised           then that                the c e n t r e i e n s         would          be    full.        So I t u r n e d

a ro un d and        forced my                w a y o u t w a r d s , as        I was         w a l k i n g out peo pie we re

still    co m i n g       into      the       t u n r|     -     When       1 came       to       the     tun n e l       exit     Che re

opened.             At    this       t ime       the       g ame      had     started.

I heard         no       directions              from       people           for       us    to    get     out     of    the     tunnel,             but

you would            not      of     been able              to       hear     it a n y w a y         because        of all          the        n o ise

in t h e r e .

At    the      entrance            to     the       tunnel           there        was       no P o l i c e    or    steward           control.
                                                                                                                   ^     --------------
I then         decided          to m a k e          my way           to a s i de            pen    near      to y h e     Sou th Stand.

Whilst         walking          to       thi s      area        I    saw     four                                                                    to

the      entrance          to      the >^est S t a n d ,                  checking           peoples         ncKets.             it       seemed

too m a n y         to    that       place.            I would              have       thought        some        should       h ave       b e e n at

the      tunnel.

I did       not w i t n e s s            any     disorder,                it w as       j u st     people         attempting              to       get a

view      to    the       pitch.            I saw          no       one     drinking          alcohol         in the          gro u n d .

When      in the         side        terrace I              made          my way a bout              h alf w a y        down and           towards

the      cen tre.          It was          sparcely                 populated,              which     was     really          surprising.

I took         up m y      position              here       at a b o u t          five       pajg^ t h r e e       (1505).            I    was       not

with my         friends            as     I ha d       beerp/ u n a b l e to                find     them.

When      I looked across                      to     pyns 3 a n d            4,       the     ones      behind         the    goal,           I

could       see      it was          a    crush,           it was           just       solid,        there        was    no    surging.

During         my    time       in the           packed             tunnel        I did        not    witness           any    deaths              to my

knowledge.                I was          not     in a       position              to a s s i s t      any     of    the       inj u r e d .

I think         the m a i n          factors           causing              the    deaths          were      the    gates        outside

having         opened.             There         should             h ave    been       directions            at    the       tunnel           and

people         being       informed              to    go       to    the     s ide         terraces.             I believe           that          the

side      fences         to     the       pens        do    not       serve        any       purpose.             They    should           not       be?

ther e .        Then       everyone              would          have        Mist       filled        out     to    the    sid es.

TI"!e l o u d s p e a k e r        wa s     very       poor %jnd y o u                 could       not     h ear    much       on     it.

There       was      obviously             a distinct                  lack       of    communication               between           the

ground         stewards            and     Police.                  The     people          in the       crowd      should          h ave          been

k ep t    informed            o f what           was       happening.

I witnessed a                 lot        of Pol i c e m e n           just        standing           around,        doing        nothing, I

                                                                                                                                    S2377

             believe        they      could       have     a s s i s t e d more.

             It was       obvious         everyone         was    not    going     to    get       in b e f o r e    the    k ick    off

             and     I believe          the    ga m e    should     have       been     delayed.

             The     tun n e l     should      h ave     been     blocked       off     with Police            w hen   it was

             apparent           the m i d d l e    pens     were    full.                      /

             I attended            last    years        FA Cup     semi-final           a t / the     same     venu e,      but     the

             Police       con t r o l     outside        the     ground    appeared         completely              different,        we

             we re    getting         searched,          tickets        checked and         the       crowd were           filtered

             through.            There     just     d i d n ’t s e e m    to    be/ t h e   Police         control         outside        the

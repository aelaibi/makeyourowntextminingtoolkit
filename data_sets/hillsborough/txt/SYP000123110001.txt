  INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND,15.4.89.


 I sun a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police,presently stationed at Hammerton Road
 Police Station,Sheffield?fSince being posted to F1 sub division in 19?>3 I have regularly
  worked at the Hillsborough Football ground and at different times have worked in all areas
 within the stadium.

   At 10.00am on Saturday 15th April 1989 together with other Officers I paraded at the
   Hillsborough football ground for the FA Cup Semi Final match between Liverpool and
   Nottingham Forest.At this time I was designated as part of Seriel 3 under the direct
   supervision of PS 577 Gardner.After the briefing,together with other members of the ^eriel
   I made a search of the upper deck of the South Stand and then reverted to duties on
   turnstiles Nos. 29 to 32 which were in sole use for the Nottingham Forest supporters.This duty
   was in company with PC 2817 Hudson,PC 261 Cooper and PC 33^1 Mitchell with occasional
   visits from supervisory Officers.From 12 midday to approximately 1.30pm a slow trickle of
   supporters entered through these turnstiles and from 1.45pm onwards the trickle became a
   steady stream of supporters,but at no time did I see more than five or six people having
   to queue at any turnstile,and supervision of the turnstiles was easily maintained.The overall
   mood of these supporters was friendly and no animosity displayed at any time prior to the
 Jcick off.I encountered little evidence of fans having consumed alcohol.Prior to 3.00pm I
^ p i d not leave this area and at 3*00pm together with PC Hudson I stayed in the same vicinity
   for any latecomers,but there were very few.At approximately 3.10pm it was quiet enough
   to resume to the South Stand upper deck.Together with PC Hudson I went to the upper deck
   and on entering the stand above the pitch I could see that there appeared to have been a
   pitch invasion in front of the Leppings Lane terraces and I could see Police Officers,support
   supporters and pressmen massed around that end of the pitch.I could see that a number of
   supporters were hanging on to the goalposts and causing the goal to move quite violently.On
   speaking to the Nottingham Forest supporters initially,they appeared to be under the
   impression that the situation had been caused by misbehaviour of faJis and for the following
   few minutes there was a degree of animosity by these supporters that the game should be held
   up by the actions of the Liverpool supporters.Prior to entering the stand I was not in
   contact with a Police radio,although a gateman had said to me that he had heard that a gate
   had been broken at the Leppings ^ane end.I remained in the South stand for at least another t
   ten minutes during which time I saw a large number of Officers come oh to the pitch,initially
    lining up down the length of the pitch in front of the North Stand and then movmng in a
   line accross the centre of the pitch.By this time I could see several supporters were
  using advertising hoardings as stretchers and I could see several people being given first aid
   on the pitch*

    approximately 3.30pm myself and PC Hudson left the stand and made our way on to the bar .
 area where a number of Nottingham Forest supporters were leaving the ground.We then made our
 way along the rear of the South stand to the rear of the Leppings Lane end.Alongside the
 railings bordering the river at that location,I could see approximately 12 people
 apparently dead,with their faces covered.I then went to the area immediately to the rear of
 the West staJid where I assisted injured people from that area and joined a number of other
 Officers in directing supporters away from the entrance and vicinity of the waiting
 ambulances.My impression of the supporters at this time was one of general disbelief at the
 situation with a large proportion of the fans quietly standing,although a number of the
 supporters were uncooperative with Police requests and were vociferous in their condemnation
 of Police action prior to the match and in particular with the ticket allocation.

  At approximately 6.00pm together with other Officers    I made my way to the North stand
 and short time later was stood down from the ground.

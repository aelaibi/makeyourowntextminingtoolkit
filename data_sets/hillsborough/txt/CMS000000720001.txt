W1HBHY STADIUM

     With reference to your note of 14 August to me, I could not
give a considered view as to whether or not the tunnel link
between Wembley Stadium and Wembley Park Underground Station
forms part of the former for the purposes of a safety certificate
without more detailed information about the tunnel. However, as
I see from the letter attached to your note that the tunnel also
serves the Wembley Arena and Conference Centre, my provisional
view is that it does not. It might be different if it served
only the Stadium.

     In any event, I doubt whether it is proper for us to be
drawn too far into this question.  It seems to me to be a
question of fact about the extent of a particular ground and, as
such, is a matter for the local authority.  You might suggest in
guidance of general application that local authorities might
consider whether areas outside the perimeter of the sports
grounds buildings form part of the grounds for the purposes of
the 1975 Act. However, this is a grey area and some caution is
desirable. The extent of a particular ground for those purposes
can be finally determined only by the courts.

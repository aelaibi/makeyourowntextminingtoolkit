            t h a t ’s                                                  and myself,        had a r e l a ti v el y free

            passage along             it. / i n fact we were            singing      in the tunnel.

            I didn't         notice any d ividing             barrier at       the     end of the tunnel            but we

            went       into the       pen w here      the barrier        later    collapsed.           We got      into    the

            pen and        it was      f airly full.          The    people    coming      b ehind g r a d u a l l y     pushed

            us forward.              I was    eventually       pushed f o rw a rd to a point a bout 3 people

            from the front             fence.      I have      seen the       picture      0/    the   pen on the         front

            page       of the D a il y M irror         dated    17.4.89       170489



            When       I got    into the       pen the      players were         on the     pitch and then the

the     last    I saw of the game.                I was having            difficulty     brea th in g      because

of the       pressure a nd        I had to        lift my head up to keep breathing.

W h il st    this was       going     on a person was            on the floor holding              onto my

leg.        He or she was         gripping my         leg t ig ht ly and e v en t u a l l y the hand

fell a w ay from my            1 e g . / E v e r y o n e was    s cr ea mi ng    for   people     to move

back.        I never       saw tKat      person.

As we had gone             f orward    in the      pen         I saw a m an poss ib ly 4-0-50 w i t h dark

greying        hair.       His fea tu re s a c t u a l l y made           him look younger,         I think he

had a mou st ac he and a grey shirt.                            When      Isaw him he had his         back to a

crash barrier and was                 facing      back         towards the seats.          He was    a l re a d y

in a g o n y a n d was       being     crushed.          He was     screaming.          We e v e n t u a l l y got

pushed       past the end to the             barrier and           I think               actually       climbed

under       the barrier.

X was       t rapped w i th this         p r e s s u r ^ a r o u n d me    for a bout     15 m in u te s    or

even     longer.        I was aware         of /#ne      gate    opening        onto the    pitch and

people starting to get o u t y put there were so m a n y people in there                                         that

they kept          jamming     in the gateway.             T he y had to be d r ag g ed out.

W hen    the    pressure       ceased     I was able           to move      back a nd     rest a g a i n s t a

barrier.           Close    to me was a man whos                hand had gone          dead and he was

trying       to get the        c ir cu l a t i o n back    into     it.      Also      I saw a man and

woman,       the man was        in his forties a nd he was                   having     trouble     breathing.

I had       lost     contact with                  and                    and x spent      some    time

              a bout and there was               some    verbal abuse        but e v er yo ne was   trying     to help

               I think        the Police were           not   prepared for      the situation.         O f f i c er s at

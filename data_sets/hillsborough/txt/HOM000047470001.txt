RE: CIVIL ACTIONS RELATING TO HILLSBOROUGH

I refer to my letter dated 8 October and your response of 15 October 1997, which related to a
number of issues raised at our meeting of 24 Septem ber last. In this letter I am responding
specifically to paragraph 4 about the civil actions.

As I understand it, insurance cover is carried by the South Yorkshire Police Authority, not the
South Yorkshire Police, nor the Chief Constable. In April 1989 the insurers were Municipal
Mutual Insurance (MMI) and the maximum amount indemnified was £8.5 million. Since that time
MMI has gone into liquidation, but the company plus its liabilities was taken over by Zurich
Municipal Insurance and civil claims have continued to be dealt with by them. About 2 months
ago the £8.5 million indemnity limit, which includes costs as well as settlements was reached.
Current estimates of the total cost of claims already dealt with and those not yet decided is
£ 13 .35 million. The Police Authority has therefore set aside in reserve £4.85 million to cover the
shortfall between the amount insured against and the estimated total cost.

Zurich Municipal Insurance retained 2 firms of solicitors to advise them on the civil claims,
Hammond Suddards of Bradford, who had specific responsibility for advising on the claims made
by police officers and Weightmans Solicitors, Richmond House, 1 Rumford Place, Liverpool,
L3 9 Q W to advise on the claims by supporters and families, as the vast majority of these were
commenced in the Liverpool Courts.

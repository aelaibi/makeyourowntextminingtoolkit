Q 18

 Q3E

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 WHEN THE MATCH WAS STOPPED AFTER THE DISASTER,           THEY PUT A CORDON ACROSS THE

 PITCH ON THE HALFWAY POINT.      I FELT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE USEFULLY

 EMPLOYED TENDING THE INJURED AND THE DYING, RATHER THAN THE LIVERPOOL

 S U P P O RT ER S, THERE WERE SOME POLICE OFFICERS,   BUT ONLY A FEW, SEEING THEM STOOD

 ON THE HALFWAY POINT, AGGRAVATED THE SITUATION AND FRUSTRATED A LOT OF P E O P L E .

 354

       THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 IN 1988 (000088) WHEN I ATTENDED THE MATCH,           A POLICE CORDON WAS PUT ACROSS THE

 ISLAND JUNCTION LEPPINGS LN AT PENISTONE RD N, BARRIERS WERE ACROSS THE ROAD,

 AND PEOPLE HAD TO PASS THROUGH THEM AND SHOW THEIR TICKET.           THIS PREVENTED ANY

 ONE WITHOUT A TICKET GETTING NEAR THE GROUND.          THIS YEAR   I APPROACHED THE

 GROUND FROM THE SAME DIRECTION AND TICKET CHECKS WERE MADE.

 I SHOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT HAD THERE BEEN SOME CONTROL OVER THE NUMBER OF

 PEOPLE GOING DOWN THE TUNNEL BY A GATE OR POLICE/STEWARDS,           THEN THE VOLUME OF

 PEOPLE IN PENS 3 AND 4 COULD HAVE BEEN CENTRAL AND ANY EXCESS DIRECTED TO THE

 LEFT OR RIGHT WHERE THERE WAS PLENTY OF ROOM.

  AFTER THE MATCH    HAD BEEN STOPPED FANS WERE TRYING TO    CLIMB OVER THE FENCING

  OUT OF THE PENS    AND THE POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK IN INSTEAD OF       HELPING

 THEM OUT.      ALSO AS THE FANS WERE     TRYING TO RIP THE FENCING DOWN THE   POLICE

 AT FIRST WERE STOPPING THEM.        IT   WASN’T UNTIL THEY REALISED THE EXTENT

 OF THE INCIDENT THAT THEY HELPED.

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO,

G33 .

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

STEWARDS AND POLICE APPEARED CONFUSED AND DIDN’T APPEAR TO KNOW MfAT TO DO,

DID NOT REALISE THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES.              IT

APPEARED THE POLICE INITIALLY THOUGHT IT WAS JUST AN OVERSPILL ONTO THE

PITCH.

I | g p"HERE   ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

1) CRUSHING OUTSIDE LEPPINGS LANE IS A COMMON OCCURENCE, THAT’S WHY I LEFT AND

GOT THERE SO EARLY.

2) AT 2.20PM (1420) PENS 3--4 WERE HEAVING AND NOTICEABLE FROM UPPER AREAS OF

PEN 7 AND WE REMARKED AT THE TIME WHY DIDN'T THE POLICE AND STEWARDS DIRECT

OTHER PEOPLE TO STHE SPACES IN PENS          6-7.   IT MUST HAVE E3EEN APPARENT TO POLICE

AND STEWARDS IN F RO NT OF THE PENS THIS WAS REMARKED ON PRIOIjr TO THE INCIDENT

BY A NUMBER OF FANS IN         PEN 7,

3) AT 2.50PM (1430)       IT   APPEARED THERE WERE GENIUNE PROBLEMS   IN PEN   3 AND 4 AND

TiJ^GAME SHOULD HAVE SEEN DELAYED UNTIL SOMETHING HAD SEEN DONE ABOUT THE

CRUSHING.

4) AT 3,00PM <1500 5 I COULD STILL SEE CROWDS OUTSIDE THE GROUND THROUGH A GAP

IN THE STAND AND GENUINELY FELT THE GAME SHOULD 8E DELAYED.           I MUST ADD THAT

THOUGH I COULD SEE A HORRENDOUS CRUSH IT WAS NOT APPARENT THAT PEOPLE WERE

BEING KILLED AND INJURED.          BUT THERE WERE PEOPLE CLIMBING OUT OF THE SIDES

AND FRONT OF THE PENS,

5) AT 2,50PM (1450) SOMEONE SAID ON THE TERRACE "IT'S MURDER OUTSIDE THERE’S

THOUSANDS TRYING TO GET IN, I ONLY GOT'         INBECAUSE EITHER   AGATE'S BEEN

PUSHED IN OR OPENED TO         LET US IN,"
                                                                          PAGE    9

 6) THE MAIN PROBLEM APPEARED TO BE NO DIRECTION OF SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE
        *
 GROUND AND OUTSIDE THERE APPEARED NO FILTERING OF THE CROWD. AT OLD TRAFFORD

 IT IS A S IM ILAR SYSTEM OF PENS AND AS YOU ARRIVE THEY FILL UP A PEN AT A TIME

 IN AN ORDERLY WAY AND WHEN EACH PEN IS FULL THEY DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE TO ENTER

 THAT PARTICULAR GATE„   IN PARTICULAR THERE WAS NO DIRECTION OR SIGNS TO PENS     6
 AND 7.

Q16

 NO

 Q47

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DEATHS?

 SAW DEAD ON PITCH.

 048

^ D I D YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,   IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO


G17

 049

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR      IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 OVERCROWDING OF PENS, SIDE GATES OF PENS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENED ALLOWING

 CROWD INTO OUR MORE SPACIOUS AREAS.

 Q5Q

 ^A T   TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 4.23       (1623)

 051

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION    OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD,

 A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR    OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT.


018

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 ON MY WAY OUT I SAW A CROWD OF    PEOPLE,   MANY WERE SWEARING AT THE POLICE.

 I SAW AT LEAST TWO ASSAULTS ON    POLICEMAN BY THESE FANS.
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    QSL2543

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1.     INITIALLY NOTTS FORREST FANS WERE CHANTING AND SOME LIVERPOOL FANS

 WHO WERE BY NOW ON THE PITCH STARTED TO CHARGE TOWARDS THE FORREST

 END.      THIS RESULTED IN POLICE MAKING A CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH.         THEN

 A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT MADE EVERYONE REALIZE HOW SERIOUS THE SITUATION WAS

 AT THIS THE FORREST FANS STORED CHANTING.

 THE PROSPECT OF TROUBLE HAD THEN DISAPPEARED         AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER

 REASON FOR POLICE TO CORDON          OFF PITCH.   THE POLICE COULD THEN HAVE BEEN

^ N volved    in   the   rescue.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.     AT FIRST MYSELF AND THOSE STANDING NEXT TO ME DID NOT REALISE WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING.         WHEN AT FIRST THE LIVERPOOL. FANS WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE

 ONTO THE PITCH,         THOSE NEAR TO US THOUGHT THIS WAS MERELY CROWD

 OVERSPILL.

 2.      I AM TOLD THAT AT THE PREVIOUS YEARS CUP SEMI FINAL POLICE HAD A CORDON

 ^p^ROX.     50 YDS FROM THE GROUND WHICH PREVENTED THOSE WITHOUT TICKETS FROM

 GETTING TO THE TURNSTILES.            IN FACT WE WERE PULLED OVER BY A UNIFORM P.C.

 ON FOOT NEAR TO SHEFFIELD IF WE         HAD TICKETS, ALTHOUGH NO PROOF OF US

 POSSESSING TICKETS WAS REQUIRED.           I FEEL THAT IN FUTURE POLICE SHOULD

 MAKE GREATER EFFORTS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE GOING TOWARDS THE TURNSTILES HAVE

 TICKETS.

 3.      WHILST    I APPRECIATE THE GOOD WORK OF ST JOHNS AMBULANCE SOME OF THEIR

 MEMBERS ON THE PITCH WERE AWFULLY YOUNG AND SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO

 SUCH EVENTS.

 4.     THE AMBULANCES APPEARED AT FIRST TO DRIVE AROUND THE SIDE OF THE

 PITCH AND I BELIEVE THEY WERE HAMPERED BY THE ADVERTISING HOARDINGS.

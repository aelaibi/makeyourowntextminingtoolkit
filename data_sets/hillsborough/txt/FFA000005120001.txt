FA/HILLSBOROUGH



He was asking about the Noades material and I said we had
just received a two page fax enclosing Noades' memorandum.
I had sent him a copy in anticipation of tomorrow's meeting.

I mentioned      ^ point on the Old Trafford/Liverpool
conflict,   I was doing the research but I did not think it
was a terribly effective point.      agreed and said that it
was dubious for two reasons.   Firstly it was not actually
taken into account by the semi-final venue committee and
secondly if there had been semi-finals played by Liverpool
clubs at Manchester before (even replays) it was not a good
point. He thought it was dangerous to cross-examine any
Liverpool officials in relation to Old Trafford not being
appropriate for Liverpool games on those two grounds. The
judge was quite likely to ask what our case was and whether
we took into account to which the answer was not going to
satisfy him.

We briefly mentioned last week's committee meeting and
was pretty unimpressed with the FA members of the committee.
>Je agreed we would need to get drafting quite soon and I
said that the extension request had gone off today,

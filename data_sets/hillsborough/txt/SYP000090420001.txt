          I have never          been to Hi 1 lfbp/o ug h g r ou nd before and saw a tunnel                               a he ad

          of me w h i ch       people were          %1'ki'ng down and           I just    f ol l ow e d them.         As      I

K//'3‘T   e nt e re d the             el    I^Toufh    see the      pitch the         players were          not out and

          i think it tJjas about t wenty five to three (1435).                                 As we w a l k e d down

          the   tunnel      it was         r easonable    c lear and we were             not    & shed or crushed,

          On    reaching       the terrace we went             to our      right      i m t g f / ;n 3.     It was very

          crowded and we had to                push our way         in.        We wt^pt ^fbojj^r t we nt y to our

          right and a bout            four yards       down the t er race            towards     the      pitch.       I was

          stand in g     behind a crush barrier.                  It was        getting     pretty        crowded and

                    could not see,            so we took                  down near to the front                  of the

          pen where       she s tood w ith some o ther                girls.         At this     time where

          s to od was quite           clear a nd she        could     pick her spot            to stand.



                                     a nd m yself     then m o v e d back to the            posi ti on we were             in

          before and a g a i n         I stood behind the barrier.                     We were a bout           three

          y ards    from the fence w h i c h divides                pen 3 and         pen 2.      Just after

          g et ting     into    the    p o siti on    I h eard the teams anno un ce d,                 I was      not very

          h ap py because        of the barrier           in front        of me.       1 was     being      pushed

          a ga i ns t   it, and also as           I looked at the              pitch I was       looking        t h ro ug h

          the    p erimeter      fence.        I did not       like this a nd we d e ci de d to jump over

the fence         k n Vtf pyn 2.        It took me a few m in ut es                to get over because

s ev er a l / p t h e r    pe({3_gJjs-'-lSere j um ping    over.      I saw the teams              come out just

as    I jumped over the fence.



We got back           into      the fence and t ried to see                           because          could see

that     it was      getting        really    packed       in pen 3.        I could see            people were

being      pushed up a gainst            the fence d i vi di ng          pen 3 and 2,                       went

down to the front of                 pen 2 to try and f i n d ____                  and        I did not see him

a g a i n until      about        seven o'clock       (1700).



Pe op le       in pen 3 were         very scared,         girls were        s creaming                others were

shouting and              complaining.        I s tood csn the fence h e p e o p l e                         over,

and then s tood on the g round and                        put my arms       throdnghlthe bars               in the

fence so that              people    could    climb       into my hands and get over                   the fence

into     pen 2.           Other    people were doing the same thing,                           and others were

s tood behind me             catching      the   people w h i c h      I was       pushing up.          I

remember        one old man about 33 years                   who w o u l d not get over               the fence

w it h o u t   getting       his    shoe w h ic h had       come off,             I had          to reach t h ro ug h

and    put his       shoe on before           he w o u l d get      over.



I knew at this time                 the game had s ta r te d but                  I did          not see a n y ofthe

play,      because         I was still       helping       people     over the fence,            a nd the

crushing was              getting worse.



I saw one m an s tanding                on the barrier         shou ti ng at the                police on the

pitch to rip the fence                  down,    the P o li c e a r o u n d t h e / p i t c h were up on

the fence s houting at                 people    to move      back a nd      y € o p |pushing.           I could

see    people climbing              over the     perimet er        f e n ^ y ir           he    pitch and the

game     had been stopped,              I only saw Bruce GROBBLEj                                 g and then the

players disappeared.

                I was still          helping    people over the fence and                 I could see       people        in

                pen 3 in a bad way,             they were       very badly      crushed.         A Policeman          came up

               to me and said,              “Get a way from the fence y ou 'r e             in the way."

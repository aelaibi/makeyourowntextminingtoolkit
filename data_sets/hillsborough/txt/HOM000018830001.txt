Ms. M. Wither,
Hillsborough Inquiry,
Room 448,

LONDON SU1H 9AT.



Dear Margaret,
                                       re:- Hillsborough Inquiry.

Further to our telephone conversation, I would confirm that I have had sight of
the detailed submissions made to the Inquiry by both the Football League and
the Football Association as well as the more general submission made by the major
Spectator Sports Division of the CCPR, of which the Rugby Football League is a
member.

LJe have nothing really to add to those submissions,                              I would just make the
following general points

a. LJe fervently hope that the recommendations made regarding Football League
    Grounds uould not, as a matter of course, necessarily be applied en bloc to
    Rugby League Grounds though we realise as a designated sport that many such
    recommendations will be relevant to our grounds.

b. It is absolutely essential for the future that clear lines of responsibility
    and procedure are worked out as between the Police and the Stewards at any
    one ground.

c. As with Soccer, we have had occasions when the Police, having imposed an all
    ticket situation, have insisted subsequently that gates are opened to
    accommodate fans who have arrived without tickets. This must stop.

d. As a result of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, it is inevitable and
    quite proper that the conditions relating to the issue of Safety Certificates
    will be tightened.     When this happens, it is absolutely essential that a
    much higher degree of consistency across the Local Authorities is achieved
    than was the case following the Popplewell Report.

With Uery Best LJishes.


Yours sincerely,

              Secretary to the Inquiry
              The Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor's Office
              50 Queen Anne's Gate
              LONDON SW1H 9AT



               Dear Mr Whalley,
               HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

               Thank you for your letter dated 23rd May 1989, to which the
               RAC Motor Sports Association replies as follows:
                1             Motor   sport  in   Great Britain is                        governed  and
                              administered on behalf of the RAC by                        the RAC Motor
                              Sports Association.
                2.            The safety of spectators at motor sport events is
                              largely concerned with ensuring that competing cars
                              cannot enter crowd areas.    Because of this, many race
                              circuits are lined with debris fencing, which may
                               incidentally prevent access by spectators onto the race
                               track.   Circuits which lack debris fencing rely on
                               marshals and/or low-level barriers to ensure that
                               crowds are kept at a safe distance from the track.

                 3.           Motor sport crowds are spread over a far larger area
                               than in any stadium: even the smallest motor racing
                               circuit has a circumference of at least one mile.
                               Where there are terraces (for standing spectators),
                               these are not enclosed on any side, because no charge
                               is made for access.   Where there are grandstands (for
                               seated spectators), these are far less densely packed
                               than at sports stadia, and there are no barriers to
                               prevent movement from side to side, or escape from the
                               front of the stands.
                                                                                                 Cont'd ....2

4.   Motor sport events tend to take place over a longer
     timescale than stadium sports.       Spectators arrive
     almost exclusively by car, and filter slowly into many
     viewing areas, most of which offer unrestricted access
     and escape.
5.   Because a motor sport event does not involve merely two
     teams, but usually 20 or more, the spectators are not
     polarised into opposing camps, so that crowd control
     (in the sense applied to football) is not necessary.
     The complex and technical nature of motor sport,
     together with the need for vehicular transport to reach
     the venue, make it less attractive to the casual
     spectator.
6.    Rallying does not take place at enclosed venues at all.
      In Great Britain, the special stages (the competitive
      sections,   which   attract   the   vast   majority   of
      spectators)   take place mainly     on   forest  tracks.
      Spectators are spread over very long distances: they
     /typically stand on both sides of the track over a
      length of two miles or more. Competing cars run one at
      a time (at one-minute intervals). No admission charges
      are made; apart from being prevented by marshals from
      going onto the track when a competing car is due, the
      spectators are totally free to move in any direction
      and have virtually unlimited space in which to do so.

It is hoped that the above is of assistance           with    your
inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.

Yours sincerely,

        Dear Mr Whalley,
        HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

        Thank you for your letter dated 23rd May 1989, to which the
        RAC Motor Sports Association replies as follows:
        1.        Motor   sport  in   Great Britain is                                             governed  and

I attach a copy of a letter which we have sent to the Chief Fire
Officer of South Yorkshire following the Home Secretary's
statement to the House on 17 April.

Could I ask that you write in similar terms to the hospital and
ambulance services.

I shall let you have a copy of the reports received here -
perhaps you would reciprocate.

                                        Yours sincerely

FA/HILLSBOROUGH
Attending                of ITN Channel 4 News. He wanted
copy of our submissions. I asked which one. He said the
first one to do with wider issues. I ascertained that he
wanted to put in something tomorrow about what the judge
ought to be recommending to happen before the start of the
season. I said he would get all that information from our
Phase 1 written submission which he had apparently got a
copy of. He confirmed that was right. He said he would be
trying to get in touch with Glen Kirton later to discuss the
matter in detail. He said that he might ring me tomorrow to
try and get a copy of the wider issues submission if he was
having trouble getting hold of Glen.

Engaged 10 minutes including dictation

Glen Kirton had Channel 4 News coming in that afternoon to
see him. Was there any reason why he should not discuss
Phase 1 written submission. I said there was no reason why
he should not if he chose to.

Engaged 5 minutes including dictation

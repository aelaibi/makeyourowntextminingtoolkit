     Dear Sirs

     ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 23 December 1998, following the receipt of a
     letter from the CPS dated 18 December 1998, informing you of the Service's decision not to
     exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take over the
     criminal proceedings against your client with a view to discontinuing them.

     You ask for further information; first, for full and detailed reasons for the decision taken;
     secondly, for confirmation that the evidentiary test applied by the CPS in coming to our
     conclusion was that set out in our letter to the HFSG of 27 July 1998; and thirdly, as to the
     way in which the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors in deciding whether to
     intervene.

     These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors that the CPS considers when
     deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request o f a defendant, with a view
     to discontinuance. It may help if I indicate again in broad terms the approach that the Service
     adopts to these decisions.

     As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general principles applied by the
     Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to continue a prosecution it has taken over; or
     whether to institute proceedings, or to advise the police whether to do so. It is correct that the
     CPS decided in 1997 that the evidence at that time was not sufficient, in its view, to provide a
     realistic prospect of the conviction of either your client or Mr. Murray for any offence.
     However, the decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a view to
     terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied. It is quite possible for a private
     prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the CPS is not satisfied, on the basis of its own




                             Crown Prosecution Service • Working in the interests of justice
assessment of the strength of the evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential
sufficiency test in the Code (that there should be a "realistic prospect of a conviction").

In broad terms, the reason for this is that Section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act
1985, the Act which established the Service's powers and duties, specifically preserved the
right of private individuals and prosecuting authorities or bodies other than the CPS to bring
criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among other limitations) to the limitation in
Section 6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless take over the proceedings with a view either to
conducting or to terminating those proceedings.

Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors when deciding
whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the evidential sufficiency test in the
Code when deciding whether there is a case to answer. The Service therefore recognises that
it is not appropriate to intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That
general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its Consultation
Paper No. 149 "Consents to Prosecution" (see paragraphs 6.3 and 6.4).

The Service’s policy is that it will not take over a private prosecution with a view to
terminating it unless one or more of the following applies:

(i)     there is clearly no case to answer.      A private prosecution started in these
         circumstances would be unfounded and ought not to be permitted to continue; or

(ii)    the public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those in favour
         (examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or the offence is
         one for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned; or where, although
         the offence may be serious, the defendant is terminally ill); or

(iii)   the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests of justice.

In this case, I took the decision not to intervene. After careful consideration, I concluded in
respect of the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, were considered against each individual separately) that I could not
say that there is clearly no case to answer. It was not right, therefore, for the Service to take
over the proceedings with a view to terminating them.

Against that background, and after specifically considering the appropriate course to take in
these circumstances, I concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect of
the one remaining charge against Mr Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the course of
justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case to answer on that charge
alone. The charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice is a serious one, particularly
when levelled against someone who was, at the relevant time, a serving, senior police officer.
Nevertheless, in the context of the case as a whole that charge is not the gravamen of the
criminality alleged against Mr. Duckenfield and I concluded that my approach to that charge
 should be led by my conclusions on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to
perform a public duty.

I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors that
should lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance, but I came to the
conclusion that any public interest factors tending against prosecution did not clearly
outweigh those in favour; nor did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage
the interests of justice.

The Crown Prosecution Service is not obliged in law to provide detailed reasons for its
decisions, let alone an analysis of the evidence. However, in the circumstances o f this
particular case I consider it appropriate to explain the factors taken into account in more detail
than was contained in the Service's letter dated 18 December 1998.

I have written in similar terms to those representing Mr Murray and enclose a copy o f that
letter, for your information. I have sent copies of both letters to Ms Adlington.

Yours faithfully

     Dear Sirs

     ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     You wrote to the Crown Prosecution Service on 18 December 1998, following the receipt of a
     letter from the CPS, also dated 18 December 1998, informing you of the Service’s decision
     not to exercise its power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to take
     over the criminal proceedings against your client with a view to discontinuing them.

     You ask for further information: first, as to the factual matters on which the CPS relied,
     identifying which parts of the evidence is “new” since the Crown last considered the case; and
     secondly, as to the way in which the Service applied the Code for Crown Prosecutors in
     deciding whether to intervene.

     These questions indicate that you misunderstand the factors that the CPS considers when
     deciding whether to take over a private prosecution at the request of a defendant, with a view
     to discontinuance. It may help if I indicate again in broad terms the approach that the Service

     provide a realistic prospect o f the conviction of either your client or Mr Duckenfield for any
     offence. However, it does not follow that, when considering the evidence and the
     representations submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your
     client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there is now any new evidence
     sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. The decision whether to intervene in

              I am a Police C on st a b l e        in the S Yorkshi re^Fol i c e >• currently

              st a t i o n e d at west Bar PSTN,          Sheffield.1



              At 3.00    pm    (1500 hrs)       on S a t u r d a y    15 April          1989,    (150489)          I was        on duty

              in unif o r m at H i l l s b o r o u g h ¥ ootball            Ground,     Sheffield,          in company

              with several        other    officers.           At this time we             received a radio mess a g e

              to a t t e nd at the L e p p i n g s Ln entrance                to the ground.



              On arrival       at this     location,          I saw that          thro u g h the       turnstiles           at the

              side    of the    c o ncertina doors            there was ^-''large crowd g a t h e r e d and

              people were       fighting       to gain entry y f \            thro u g h he turnstiles.                   People

              at the front were           knoc k e d to the^f loor and were                     being      trampled         under

              foot„     People were        shout i ng to the Police O f f i c e r s                  present           to o pen

                                                                                                               S577

the    large gate       to the i r left as             people at the          front were           be i ng

crushed-         I heard one y ou t h shout,                 " T h e r e ’s w o m e n an    children and

even one of your             lot out       there.       Get     the fucking        gates         open,    people

are    gonna get killed."



Some    youths      were     climbing         over    the wall       into    the ground.             1 could        see

that    the    large door         in q u e s t i o n was,       in fact,      bowing under            the

extreme       pressure       being      exerted on it by the                people    outside          the

ground.        After what         seemed       several       minutes,       the   gate was op e n e d            to a
                                                                          '                                             i5r
flood of       people      b^irng p hysically           carried       off the      floor,         thro u g h     the

opening.        Many of these were a sh e n y f a c e d and gasping                         for    breath,         some

were    close     to u n c o n s c i o u s n e s s . / The m a j o r i t y were      visibly         shocked and

e xt re m e l y shaken.          Several       had to be a s s i s t e d       from the area             to

recover.        The    shock      turned       to anger and          man y   protested s t r o n g l y about

the    delay    in opening         the    gates.



After    the     initial     flood of          people myself,          F S 2 9 1 6 KNIGH71-3, P C 5 8 6 X

E A R L S and about        six    other       officers made         our way onto the               pitch side

infront       of the L e p p i n g s     Ln terrace.           As we made         our way to d i r e c t l y

infront       of the terrace            see    that    the sect i o n d i r e c t l y       infront       of the

goal    mouth was       full      to over       capacity.           I could see       that        persons at

the front       of the terrace were                  being    crushed a g a i n s t        the    p e r i m eter

ba r r i e r y ^ u . na b 3,e to move „       The    exit    gate    in the       bar rier was        o pe n ,

however,        due to the         crush       persons were          unable       to move in any way                and

unable     to climb free.



It was obvious          that      the     persons at the front were a l r e a d y unconcious,

if not dead.          The victims             ranged from young w o m e n and                children to

old    people.         The    crowd at the            rear and       the middle        of this s e c t i o n of

the terrace however a p p e a r e d unaware                    of the       carnage at the            front and
                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             S577

were a gg ra v a t i n g     the     s it ua t i o n by continuing          to    push.         The    tunnel

connecting          the    terrace w ith       the    outer    part    of the ground was                   full

wit h   persons       still       enteri ng    the terrace.           Q.n seeing all of this                     I

went    to assist          the    removal     of the j>arfvs at       the     front      of the        terrace

both through           the open gate ,^j>d^aTso by pul 1 ing                     parsonsv               thetop

of the     peri meter        barrier.         The    removal    of these          fans was        extremely

difficult          due to the        n arr owness     of the exit       gate and the              extreme

pressure       being e xe r t e d      by those       behind.     Attempts            by myself         and other

Officers       to     inform the       crowd at the       rear of       the       terrace        to move         back

were met       by a hail          of abuse and        items were       t h r own at us.



The m a j o r i t y   of fans were          totally     unaware       of the s i t u a t i o n at the

•front of the          terrace.        After    several m i n u t e s       of    c^jyfng^bodies                 from

the terrace,          both a live and a p p a r e n t l y       dead,       we were        c o n s t a n t l y being

hinde r e d    by fans who a p p e a r e d to be drunk,                or under          the     influence            of

alcohol.           These    persons were        either    v e r b a l l y abus i v e       or    phys i c a l l y

obstructive.              Some were      se r chi ng for friends and                relatives an d were

 n d e r s t a n d a bl y f r u s t ra te d and became abus i v e           to O f f icers        present.



At 3 .30      pm    (1530 h r s ) on the same day              I rec o v e r e d a girl who                I now

know to be M a r i o n H„ McCabe,               fron the front          of the terrace.                    Her       face

was a s h e n and she            had stopped        breathing.        Wit h      the a s s i s t a n c e    of fans

and Police O f f i c e r s         X placed McCabe        on a m a k e - p i e c e       s t retcher        on the

pitch.        I then a t t e m p t e d wit h the aid of a fan to                      r esuscitate          McCabe

by m o u t h to m o u t h        r e s u s ci t a t i o n and heart massage.             After        several

minutes       it was       obvious     that McCabe was          not going           to regain

conciousness.              McCabe was       carried on the        stretcher            to the g r o u n d ’s

gym n a s i u m which had become a te m p o r a r y morgue.



At 4.09       pm    <1609 h r s ) of the same day McCabe was                        projnourured dead                in

            or friends which may have                  been    present at        the ground but was

            unsuccessful,           I then      'laid-out*       the body and a list of her                  property

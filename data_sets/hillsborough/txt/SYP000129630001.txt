Dear Keith/
          Sheffield Wednesday, South West Corner
      The drawings were not quite completed and I have not
had time to finally vet the report.   As I am to be out of
the office for the next two days I thought I should let you
have this preliminary version so that I can have the benefit
of any thoughts you may have before the final version goes out.

                               Yours sincerely,
                                                      FILE

          Dear Mr England,
                           Possible Elevated Stand at South West Corner
                 Following our discussion with Mr Addy I have pleasure
          in letting you have some proposals together with an
          estimate of cost for an elevated stand at the South West
          corner of the ground.                                      During our meeting with Mr Addy on
          29 May the intention to construct five extra turnstiles
          and to divide the West terrace was also discussed.
          Because of the short time scale,                                           and due to John Strange
          being on holiday,                          we are not in a position to present
          detailed proposals and cost estimates for the turnstiles
          and radial barriers but these will follow shortly after
          John's return on 22 June.
                 There are various constraints on the new stand.
          Firstly its possible shape in plan is limited by the need
          to be able to see past the West Stand to the two corner
          flags at that end of the ground,                                           and also by the need to
          see past the South Stand and the public address box to the
          South East corner flag.                                            Secondly,   the stand must be set

      sufficiently high to not obstruct the view of the field
      from the back of the existing terrace.       But if it is
      set high and also comes close to the existing safety
      fence,   the occupants of the new deck will not be       able to
      see the near corner flag unless the      slope is made
      unacceptably steep.    Finally,    the number of columns
      must be kept to a minimum so as not      to spoil the     view
      from the existing terrace.
           A possible solution to these constraints is shown
      on the attached drawings 3391/1,      2 and 3.    The sight lines
      for people on the existing terrace are illustrated on
      drawing 2.    It will be seen that someone standing on the
      very top step of the existing terrace will have an upward
      sight line which is just above the horizontal,         but because
      he is reasonably elevated he will be able to follow all
      except very high balls.    It should also be pointed out that
      viewing of play close to the near corner flag by spectators
      on the upper deck will not be good except for those who are
      tall or are near the front.       Nevertheless,   the view from
      the new upper deck will be very good for the majority of
      the playing area.
           The slope has been made about 25° which is just below
      the maximum recommended in the green guide for standing
      spectators if there is not to be danger of surging.             Crush
      barriers will be provided of course,      and the front
      ballustrade will be mesh covered,      similar to the new exits
      which were cantilevered from the West Stand,         for safety
      reasons.
           We have provided one access staircase only.          This is
      placed on the side nearest the South Stand where it does
      not use up space on the existing terrace,         nor does it
      obstruct the flow of spectators in and out of the ground.
      The top part of the staircase runs alongside the new
                                                                      SHEET

      terracing,    but will be set about 200 mm   (8 inches) below
      the terrace level,      so that it will serve as a gangway and
      will not become blocked by spectators.       The length of
      this   'gangway'    has been chosen to give access to each
      section of the new terrace which will be split into three
      parts by two continuous horizontal crush barriers.
             Although the new stand is supported on a total of
      four columns,      two of them are at the back where they do
      not obstruct the view of people on the existing terrace.
             The area of standing space on the new deck would be
                    2
      about 130 m  which would provide standing space for 702
                                                      o
      spectators at the 'green book' rate of 5.4 per m .
             Our estimate of the cost at today's prices is £37,500.
      This does not include professional fees,      nor the fees
      payable to the local authority with the planning application.
      The cost per standing place is £55.
             The size of the scheme could be reduced    (500 to 600
      places was mentioned to us as being sufficient) but the
      reductions in cost would not be pro-rata.       This arises
      because the cost of the staircase is constant        at say £6000.
             We should also warn that our estimate is based on
      prices which are artificially low because of the present
      recession of the building industry,      and the virtual standstill
      of raw steel prices in the last two years.       It is possible
      that if there is even a slight upturn in activity in the
      construction industry there will be an acceleration of prices
      which will be more rapid than the general rate of inflation.

                                     Increasing Spectator Capacity to not less than 60,000
                                                    SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS         ____

                        1.                    It is not possible to achieve the increase in
                                              accommodation you require in the near future
                                              by development at the S.W., N.W., or N.E.
                                              corner of the ground.

                        2.                  Only by extension of Spion Kop can your
                                             specific requirements be met.

                        3.                  We suggest a rearward extension which would
                                             raise the total ground capacity to 61,324.

                        4.                  We would be pleased to prepare a scheme and
                                             estimate of cost of our proposal after
                                             discussion with Mr. Taylor of your detailed
                                             requirements, once the proposal has been
                                             accepted in principle.

                        5.                  We await your further instructions.


                                                                                                   Yours faithfully,
                                                                                                     HUSBAND & CO.
         SECTION I - TERMS OF REFERENCE


Mr. E. W. Taylor has requested Husband & Co. to
advise on the possibility of increasing the total
spectator accommodation to not less than 6 0 , 0 0 0
people by increasing the standing capacity of
the ground in a selected area.


This report, with appendices, outlines the
consideration of the problem for a rational planned
development.


The major issues for consideration may be outlined
as follows

a)     Could sufficient extra standing
       accommodation be made available in
       the South West Corner between the
      (Leppings Lane) West Stand and the
       present South Stand?


b)    Alternatively, but as a second choice,
      could the equivalent accommodation be
      found at the North East Comer?


c)    If neither of the above is adequate,
      what other area might be considered
      for development to achieve the
      desired capacity?


Although the most obvious increase of capacity could
be obtained by simply building Stage II of the North
West Quadrant Stand, this is not possible until
property in Vere Road has been purchased which may
not be for several years; in any case such
development on its own could not be adequate to
raise the total capacity to 6 0 ,0 0 0 .
        SECTION 2 - IN GENERAL


 The immediate problem is to devise the best means of
 raising the total capacity (i.e. both seated and
 standing) to 6 0 , 0 0 0 plus, by an increase of, say,
 5,000 - see Table 1 at the back of the report.
 Appendix 1 gives the current capacity of the ground.


 As provision for seated spectators is adequately
 met for the moment, the increase is to be arranged
 entirely by increasing the standing capacity only.


 Any individual development proposed should be within
 the framework of an ULTIMATE DEVELOPMENT PLAN.


 Such plan does not exist either as a drawing or
 written document.

 However, since the World Cup development of the West
 Stand, we have assumed, and in discussion Mr. Taylor
 agrees, that the ultimate layout would probably be a
 symmetrical arrangement with a new roof cantilevered
 over an enlarged South Stand to mirror the North Stand,
 with a South West corner (unroofed) stand to match
 that on the North West corner (unroofed), and with an
 extended Spion Kop having a central permanent electronic
 scoreboard installation.

 Appendix 5 shows one way of achieving an ultimate
 development.

 Work to date on the West Stand terracing and the North
 Stand terracing has been so arranged to make this
 ultimate development a practical and harmonious
 proposition.


 The phasing of the stages of such development, would be
 decided by the Club, but with the South Stand roof
 renewal near the end of development.


 Therefore, the questions in this report must be
 answered by a solution which satisfies the following
 three main criteria:

  (i)   it must be capable of assimilation into
        the ultimate scheme.

 (ii)   it must be compatible with the South Stand
        roof remaining for the immediate future.

(iii)   it must provide a standing capacity of
        not less than 5 *0 0 0 .
  SECTION 3 ~ EXAMINATION OF SOUTH WEST CORNER


Any development here should be to match the partly-
constructed North West Quadrant Stand.

The North West Quadrant elevated deck connects the
North Stand and West Stand, both of which have the
same deck slope and the same height to roof; but
the front pen, holding 800 spectators, was built as
a low concrete platform (but raised relative to the
original terrace) to enable the spectators to see
past the rake of the North Stand deck.   It is
steeper than the original Leppings Lane terrace.

Any similar South West Quadrant deck should match
the steep rake of the West Stand to the rake and
lesser height of the South Stand, but an arc swept
from the West Stand rear corner would intersect the
gable of the present South Stand projected at a
point behind the Stand, due to the different front-
to-back depths in plan of the two stands.   Refer
to the diagram in Appendix 2.

Furthermore, pedestrian access from Leppings Lane
would be required beneath any new South West elevated
deck for its full width to feed the West Terrace, so
that the North West "800" front pen could not be
repeated at the South West because the space available
would be devoted mostly to circulation.


Hence any deck at the South West corner built
southwards from the West Stand in 1969* would be so
high relative to the gable of the South Stand, that
many spectators would not be able to see the South
East c o m e r flag until the South Stand roof were
modified.      For similar reasons, many would not see
the North West corner flag until the West Stand gable
were removed.


In Appendix 2 we show a possible new deck superimposed
against the gable ends of the South Stand and of the
West Stand to show the relative heights and slopes of
construction.   The zone coloured red shows the limit
of the area which could be made available for standing
accommodation until such time as the restrictions in
3.2 were removed.    The capacity of the RED ZONE is
estimated as only l8 00 spectators, which does not
satisfy your requirement.

If this stand were accepted as a partial contribution
to the total required, it would be very expensive to
construct for a limited end result; even if the RED
ZONE only were built, beams and columns would have to
be built well beyond the red deck zone.   There would
also be expenditure on works of a temporary nature.




                     - 3 -
As we understand you would not wish to build a new
roof over the South Stand in the immediate future,
we must conclude that the South West proposal is
not presently valid and cannot provide sufficient
accommodation to match your requirements in 1 9 ^9/
1970.
        SECTION 4 - EXAMINATION OP NORTH-EAST CORNER


 As the (partial) construction of the North West
 Quadrant Stand has demonstrated how good viewing can
 be from such a corner vantage point, it follows that
 equally satisfactory accommodation should be possible
 at the North East by provision of a mirror image of
 the first.   See Appendix


 However, there are objections to such a scheme.
 The four major objections are:


  (i)     the equivalent of the North West "800"
          pen would be required at the North East
          in order to see past the deck of the
          North Stand to the North West corner
          flag: but because of the necessity for
          maintaining an access tunnel for mowers
          and rollers (the only vehicular access
          to the arena), it would have to be cut
          down to an area capable of holding
          perhaps 500 spectators only.

 (ii)     the quadrant deck could not be entirely
          built in 1 9 6 9 / 1 9 7 0 because the rear would
          be partially suspended over the site of
          the corner shops by the Penistone Road
          entrance; even if it were only partially
          built to the boundary, there might be,
          and probably would be, difficulties over
          "rights of light".

          This location would be reconsidered should
          you buy sufficient property to eliminate
          that objection.

(iii)     it would be extremely difficult to find room
          for 5 , 0 0 0 additional spectators because any
          new stand would partially displace existing
          spectators at the North end of the Spion Kop,
          and hence not all new accommodation would be
          a net gain in total capacity.

 (iv)     there is a floodlight tower on the site.


 Please refer to Appendix 3 where we have shown a
 possible stand superimposed on the North East corner.
 With the East gable of the North Stand removed, the
 North East Quadrant Stand proposal would be a mirror
 image of the existing North West Stand with viewing
 of comparable standards; about 2240 spectators on
 Spion Kop would be displaced by new construction,
 and therefore the net gain from this proposal would
 only be 3 8 0 0 spectators.
This scheme would not meet your accommodation
requirement, and therefore we conclude that the
extra capacity must be sought elsewhere within
the stadium.


We give an opinion that it would be a good
development in the distant future, were it ever
thought necessary to raise total ground capacity
beyond 6 5 ,0 0 0 .
       SECTION 5 - SPION KOP


As there is no other part of the stadium capable of
producing the required increase in capacity in
1968/1970, then the Spion Kop must be examined.


This area is constructed of terracing with concrete
steps (having average jjs" riser height and average
1 2 " tread width) cast upon filled ground, probably
with earlier terracing beneath.     The average slope
is roughly 18°, but it is variable.     It generally
is a little steeper to the rear.     Appendix 4 shows
Spion Kop.


The current capacity is given by Mr. Taylor as
2 2 , 0 0 0 spectators, (closely l-g- square feet per
person) although in earlier years an (uncomfortable)
maximum of 24,000 is reported to have been achieved.
The size of the present available area has clearly
been limited by the amount of fill material which
could easily be placed (that is without expensive
retaining walls), and in turn this fill has been
limited by the unfortunate fact that Penistone Hoad
North is not parallel to the East End of the pitch
but converges to the North.           Thus 'the fill, and
hence the terracing, forms an asymmetrical mound
relative to the pitch centre line.


Spion Kop could be increased in area to provide the
extra spectator accommodation required: at the same
density of packing as at present you would require
an area not less than about 7 500 sq. feet for any
extension.


The mound has reached the point where the extra space
cannot be gained by simply adding fill: complications
(=expense) would arise because of the necessity for
retaining walls at the North, access tunnels for
spectators, short-term instability of new fill.


We suggest that by means of a framed construction,
the total capacity of Spion Kop could be raised by
raising the capacity generally to the East (or rear)
where the extra space can be found.


The arrangement we would propose to achieve the
necessary increase is shown in Appendix 4; the
area actually provided would be rather more
generous than the minimum required.


For the extension shown by a full line we estimate
an additional capacity of 5 , 6 7 0 spectators.
The total In Spion Kop would then be 27,670
spectators.


The ground total on completion of this extension
would then be 61,324 spectators.


A further Increase In capacity of about 1200 might
be obtained by constructing the extension within
the dotted line but this would be of more
complicated angled construction and is not
recommended as first choice.


Any rearward extension would mean re-siting of
the Scoreboard which would interfere with vision
from behind.   We propose a new central and
permanent position but its elevation to a new
height would remove it from the vision of several
rows to the rear of the South Stand.


As we have not supervised constructional works at
this end of the ground, our knowledge of the subsoil
conditions should be confirmed by trial boring.
We predict that, as the Spion Kop area is near the
confluence of the River Don with the River Loxley,
with the original ground waterlogged and marshy,
almost certainly any new structure should be founded
on piles, through the present embankment where
necessary.


As a structure without a roof should only be defined
as a "single-storey building", the Local Authority
may permit an all-steel framework without concrete
fire resisting encasement, with a favourable effect
on cost, although for the greatest permanence with
the least maintenance we would visualise the
structure as similar in concept to the North West
Quadrant Stand which was in reinforced concrete.


Appendix 4 shows the feasibility of our proposal.
We would prepare a large-scale proposal drawing only
after further discussion with Mr. Taylor.


In the preparation of a large-scale proposal drawing
we would bear in mind the following requirements:

(i)   At least one additional access would be
      required to the extension, thus providing
      an additional access to Spion Kop as a
      whole.
 (ii)   Refreshment facilities are required
        at this end of the ground and could
        be located at an intermediate level
        of the framework.
(ill)   Consideration of the visual effect
        of this structure, e.g. possibility
        of enclosing it within alloy cladding
        similar to the West Stand.

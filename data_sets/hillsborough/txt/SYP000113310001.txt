                was      responsible                to    Inspector              Woodward           of F D i v i s i o n .

                The      last       five         officers          and      myself        patrolled              on the       upper       level

                positive            action.              A number           of     the    supporters                complained about                  the

             earlier    and    the   f e ar    of    the    chance      of    being    set    upon,      I feel    that,

             especially       when   a serial         like       mine   was    split    up,    then more        than    one

             radio,    mine,    should        have    been made         available,       and    t h at   more    than    one

             serial    should    have     been       on    the    upper      level    concourse.

lack       of    turnstiles              open and           said       that        there          were       many        people        still

outside          the      Leppings            Lane       End waiti ng              to      get       in.

Myself          and     three       other          officers           went        down       the      c a mp       from       the     upper

level       in the           direction             of L e p p i n g s       Lane        and       sa w     dozens         of L i v e r p o o l

Leppings             Lan e.      The      most        we    could          do w as         strongly advise                     and     move

them       on.        It w a s      obvious           the     majority             had       c o n s u m e d a f a ir              share     of

alcohol          throughout              this,        the     radio         reception                was     poor        to    say     the      least,

Many       of    the      fans      showed aggression                       either           to      us    or      towards          the     st aff

operating             the     gates       in t h e i r        frustration                  of     being          allowed           e n t r y at

such a          late      time.

I c an n o t         comment        on    the       actions           of    the        stewards            as      s uch was          the

density          of     people       on the           upper       level           p ri o r      to    kick         off    that        I had       no

chance          of    gaining        entry          to     the    N o ^ x h Stand.

As    stated          before,        radio          reception              wa s    poor.

the      police         room.        Whilst           there       a    radio           message            w as     received

requesting              officers          to       the     p i t c h ar e a .           I left PC 3 1 1 6 w i t h                     the

prisoner             and went        up       to    the     upper          concourse              and managed                 to    find     town

members          of m y       serial          and     took       them down              to      the       r am p    between           the N o r t h

Stand and             the     Hop    but       were        prevented              from       go i n g      o nt o    the       pitch.
                                                                      KjJkSS               ftVX?.

on    to    the        pitch and          it was           only       then        t ha t     I saw         hundreds            of

supporters              on    it.        I gave          assistance               to    carry         one        injured           party     off

the      pitch        but a p a r t       from        that       stayed           with       other         officers            on     the

            Police       Station           at      0830       and     shortly          afterwards                along     with      several

            other       officers          was       transported                 to   Hillsborough                 football        ground.             I

            kick       off    to    ensure             that     fans       entering             the    ground          were    not    in

            possession             of    items          prohibited              by    the       ground          rules.        (Banners,

            weapons,          missiles             or    alcohol).

            The    last       five       officers             and     myself          patrolled             on    the     upper      level

             concourse         of       the     North         Stand        to    maintain             o r d e r , paying          attention           to

            the    refreshment                bars       and     the       betting          booth          there.

            Up    to    just       before          kick       off     time       there          was    a    steady        stream^f

            Liverpool          fans        to      the    N o r t h Stand.

            Prior       to    kick        off      there        was    an       influx          of    hundredjs               fans    to    t he

             upper       level      concourse             many        of w h i c h         had       obviously           hiad a    f^^^amount

             positive         action.              A    number        of    the       supporters                complained         about        the



                                                                                                                                                      r-
lack    of    turnstiles              open       and       said     that       there           were       many       people          still

outside       the     Leppings             Lane       End     waiting          to      get        in.

Myself       and    three        other       officers             went       down         the       camp       from       the       upper

level      in t h e      direction              of    Leppings           Lane        and       saw       dozens          of    Liverpool

fans    urinating          openly           on       the     fencings          on      either            side       of    the       route        to

Leppings          Lane.       The      most          we     could       do   was       strongly advise                        and    move

them    on.        It w a s      obvious             the     majority          had        consumed             a    fair       share        of

alcohol       throughout              this,          the     radio       reception                was     poor       to       say    the       least

Many    of    the     fans       showed          aggression              either           to      us     or    towards             the     staff

operating          the    gates        in       their        frustration               of      being          allowed          entry        at

such a       late     time.

I    cannot       comment        on    the       actions           of    the        stewards             as    such       was       t he

density       of      people on        the           upper     level         prior           to    kick            off   that I          had     no

chance       of    gaining entry                 to       the N o / x h      Stand.

the    police         room.      Whilst              there a        radio         message               wasreceive d

requesting            officers         to        the       pitch     area.            I l e f t PC        31'16          w i t h t he

prisoner          and went        up       to    the        upper       concourse                 and    managed          to       find     town

members       of    my     serial          and       took      them       down       to      the        ramp       between          the     North

Stand      and     the     Kop    but       were           prevented           from       going          onto       the       pitch.

supporters           on    it.        I gave           assistance              to     carry         one       injured          party        off

the     pitch      but     apart       from           that     stayed          with       other          officers             on    th e

halfway       line.

I must       admit        it w a s     unnerving               being         on     the       upper       concourse                amongst

         especially when         a   serial     like       mine   was    split    up,    then more      than    one

         radio,    mine,    should      have    been made         available*       and    that   more    than    one

         serial    should    have     been     on    the    upper      level    concourse.

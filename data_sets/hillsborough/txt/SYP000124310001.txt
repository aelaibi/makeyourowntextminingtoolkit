 DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 YES AS MENTIONED ABOVE BUT WHEN HE DIED THE PRESSURE FORCED HIM TO THE GROUND

 A      , WAS PUSHED FORWARD.


G17

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR THE

 INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE FENCES IN FRONT OF THE PEN HINDERED PEOPLE BEING LIFTED OVER AS THEY GO

 UP THEN COME BACK TOWARDS THE CROWD ALSO THE GATE AT THE FRONT ARE TOO SMALL

 AND THERE IS NOT ENOUGH OF THEM.

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I CANT REMEMBER AN EXACT TIME I THINK ABOUT 4.30 PM (1630)

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OWN ACCORD.


Q18

 Q5S

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO


m3
 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I DONT THINK ENOUGH WAS DONE TO GET PEOPLE OUT FROM THE FRONT THE EMERGENCY

 SERVICES WERE NOT EQUIPPED WELL. ENOUGH AND THERE WAS A LACK OF CO-ORDINATION

 BETWEEN THEM.   I COULD NOT SEE THE POINT OF THE LINE OF POLICE ACROSS

 THE HALF WAY LINE IN MY OPINION T H E Y SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED TO GET PEOPLE

 OUT OF THE PENS AND HELP ON THE PITCH.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 mICIAL   ™ auiRY,
 IN RELATION TO THE FENCING THE WIRE MESH LOCATED ON THE FENCE HAD TO BE

 PULLED AWAY IN PARTS BY BARE HANDS.   I WAS SURPRISED THAT NO PROPER EQUIPMENT

 WAS AVAILABLE STRAIGHT AWAY TO DO THIS IN ORDER TO RELEASE PEOPLE QUICKER.

 THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS BY THE FA IS TOTALLY WRONG AND THE LIVERPOOL FANS

 SHOULD GET THE LARGER SPION KOP END ALSO I FEEL IF THAT GATE WAS NOT OPENED

 BY THE TURNSTILE PEOPLE WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN KILLED OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 THERE IS NO REAL DIRECTION TO THE TERRACES INSIDE THE GROUND IF WE HAD

 SEEN SIGNS TO GO TO THE LEFT OR RIGHT WE WOULD HAVE STOOD ON THIS POSITION

 ON THE TERRACES.

 TOTALLY INADEQUATE,


Q 19

 QS4

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) ROUTE FROM LIVERPOOL TO SHEFFIELD APPALLING,TOO MANY ROAD WORKS, NOT ENOUGH

 ROUTE SIGNS.   NO POLICE CONTROL ON ROl

 2) INADEQUATE SIGNPOSTING TO GROUND ON ARftsJVAL IN SHEFFIELD.

 3) ABSOLUTELY NIL ORGANISATION OUTRIDE G R O U N D U P ATTEMPT TO ORGANISE   QUEUES.

 4) NO FILTERING PROCESS BEFORE GROUND T C F I L T E R OUT FANS WITHOUT TICKETS.

 d^KlO CLEAR LEADERSHIP AT GROUND LEVEL TO S&PADS OR INDIVIDUAL POLICE OFFICERS

 6) TOTALLY INADEQUATE STEWARDING IN THE GROUND.

 7) OBVIOUS BREAKDOWN OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN AUTHORITIES IN AND OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND WHERE A DELAY IN THE KICK OFF COULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTED.

 8) NO OBVIOUS LIAISON BETWEEN POLICE, MANAGEMENT OF THE GROUND AND FOOTBALL

 ASSOCIATION.

 9) THE FA SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO ADVICE FROM THE DIRECTORS OF LIVERPOOL.

 10)WHY THE ALLOCATION OF A TOTALLY INADEQUATE NUMBER OF TICKETS TO LIVERPOOL.

 11) WITH WELL PUBLICISED PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE AVERAGE LEAGUE ATTENDANCES

 (^|000) AT LIVERPOOL FC AND THE AVERAGE ATTENDANCES AT NOTTS FOREST (20000).

 WHY COULD NOT SOME ARRANGEMENT HAVE BEEN FOUND TO ALLOCATE THE SPION KOP &

 NORTH STANDS TO LIVERPOOL AND SOUTH AND WEST STANDS TO NOTTS FOREST.

 12) IT MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INCONVENIENT AND REQUIRED MORE POLICING BUT WHEN

 £14 IS PAID FOR A TICKET, SURELY THE FOOTBALL FAN IS ENTITLED TO SOME

 CONVENIENCE ON HIS/HER PART.    (SIGNED)

 GATE DID ALL THEY COULD TO GET PEOPLE OUT,        THERE APPEARED TQ BE A LACK

 OF ORGANISATION AND IT SEEMED TO BE A LONG WHILE BEFORE AMBULANCES ARRIVED.

 PENS, THIS SHOWS THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OFFICERS

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR

 THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 NO.

 Q50

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF MY OWN ACCORD,


G 18

 352

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 THE ONLY THING I SAW WAS FANS PUSHING AND SWEARING AT POLICEMEN IN THE TUNNEL,

 SHOWING THEIR AGGRESSION FOR THE LACK OF POLICE ACTION, IN ALLOWING THE

 SITUATION TO HAPPEN.

 Q33

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLEDy

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 ^ T H O U G H T THE POLICE WERE STANDING AROUND, NOT DOING ENOUGH.   I THINK THERE

 WAS A LONG DELAY IN GETTING AMBULANCES AND FIRST AID TO THE GROUND.

 THE POLICE DID NOT REALISE HOW BAD THE SITUATION WAS UNTIL FAR TOO LATE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN POLICEMEN ON THE PITCH BEHIND THE GOAL TO

 MONITOR THE CROWD IN THE TERRACES.        THERE WERE TWO THERE BEFORE THE GAME r

 BUT THEY WENT AWAY ONLY TO RETURN WHEN PEOPLE STARTED CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT

 i^plCES.   I BELIEVE THE TUNNEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUPERVISED AND SEALED OFF WHEN

 THE TERRACES WERE FULL.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO

 THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?
 1.    IN HINDSIGHT, HILLSBOROUGH WAS NOT A SUITABLE GROUND FOR THE TIE,

 DUE T6 THE FACT THAT IT WAS HELD THERE, MANY LIVERPOOL FANS COULDN'T

 GET TICKETS FOR THE MATCH.     NO CONSIDERATION WAS GIVEN TO THE

 AVERAGE GATES OF THE CLUBS.

 2.    THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LN END -

24000 FANS ALL HAD TO TRY A^£> GET INTO THE GROUND AT THAT POINT.

3.     I THINK Tk|AT THE OPENING OfN j H E GATE BY THE TURNSTILES WAS THE

CORRECT THING TONX) - I AM IN NO DOUBT THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE

BEEN KILLED OUTSIDE IF THE GATE HADN'T BEEN OPENED.

THE FENCE.     ITS OBVIOUS THAT THE FENCING TO THE FRONT AND SIDES CAUSES

PROBLEMS WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE ARE PLACED IN THEM.

G50

WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 AFTER 4PM (1600)

 051

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

       SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 ON OUR OWN ACCORD


G18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL

 OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE   ANY    VIEWS O Rb ^SERVATIONS ON THE       WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AE^TER THE MATCH WAS S T O P P E D ? f a   A^l„g / n

 THE POLICE WERE WRONG TO THROW PE&Fl).E BACK INTO THE PENS WHO HAD TRIED

 TO GET OVER   THE    FENCE.   THIS CAUSED A LOT OF       ANGER AMONGST THE CROWD.   BUT

 ITS OBVIOUS   THAT IT WASN'T THE LADS OR YOUNG POLICEMAN WHO      WERE TO BLAME

 BUT THEIR SUPERIORS FOR LACK OF ORGANIZATION.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 NO THA T ’S ALL

 WEARING DENIM JKT AND JEANS. HE WALKED FROM A POINT NEAR^FflE GOAL ACROSS THE

 ^ ® C H TOWARDS THE N STAND. HE WAS UNSTEADY ON HI§^P££T (WALKING LIKE A DRUNK).

 HE WALKED TO A POINT ABOUT 2YDS INSIDE T H ^ S l D E L I N E AND ABOUT TEN YARDS OUT

 FROM THE CORNER FLAG. WHEN HE REACJrfEl5THIS POINT HE DROPPED DOWN ON HIS KNEES

 AND THEN FELL BACKWARDS. WFOi^HE FELL BACK IT MEANT HIS LEGS WERE BENT

 UNDERNEATH HIM. HE DIDJ^'T MOVE AGAIN. NO-ONE SEEMED TO GET TO HIM FOR 2 OR 3

 MINUTES. THEN TWO^fALE SUPPORTERS CAME OVER TO HIM AS HE WAS LYING ALL ON HIS

 OWN. LATER A JST JOHNS AMBULANCE MEMBER WENT TO HIM AND EXAMINED HIM, THEN

 SOMEONE jBdT A COAT AND COVERED HIS FACE . THE COAT WASN’T THE DEAD M A N ’S COAT

 I DOR£*J KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM OR WHO PLACED IT. THE MAN WAS THEN CARRIED OFF

G 17

 G49

 HE HAD STAGGERED AWAY FROM THE GOAL AREA AND NO-ONE ON THE PITCH SPOTTED HIM

(318

 (352

        YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO NOTHING WHATSOEVER.

 (353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR 0BSERVAJ^(5NS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS S T O P P E D ^

 THE POLICE JUST FORMED X      CORDON IN FRONT OF THE N STAKrD AND ANOTHER ONE ACROSS

 THE WIDTH OF THE FI^CH FACING THE LEPPINGS LN END. WE WERE SHOUTING AT THEM TO

 GET STUCK IN ANP/DO SOMETHING BUT ALL THEY SEEMED CONCERNED WITH WAS
                /
 CONTROLLING ANY POSSIBLE PITCH INVASION. " m E ^ N L Y ONES DOING A N Y T H j L W M E R E THE

 P£kICE
 P ^I   OFFICERS WHO WALKED BEHIND THE^€i6 a L WHILE THE GAME WAS'ON.

 IT WAS LEFT TO THE FANS.TO TAKE TJrfE INITIATIVE. THE B0LICE OFFICERS WHO WERE

 BEHIND THE GOALS DID EVER Y T H I N THEY COULD, BUT THERE JUST WASN'T ENOUGH OF

 THEM.

 I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND W H ^ THE AMUBLANCES WEREN'T ALLOWED ACROSS THE PITCH,

 AFTER ALL PEOPLE WERE DYING. THERE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE ENOUGH FIRST AID

 PERSONNEL OR EQUIPMENT.

 THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM COULD HAVE BEEN USED BETTER TO DO SOME ORGANISATION,

 WHEN I LEFT THE GROUND I SAW THAT THE AMBULANCES WERE IN A BIT OF A JAM WHICH

 MEANT THAT THE LAST ONE TO ARRIVE WAS FIRST TO LEAVE AND VICE VERSA.

 IF THE AMBULANCES HAD BEEN ALLOWED ONTO THE PITCH SUPPORTERS WOULD NOT HAVE

    HAD TO RUN THE FULL LENGTH OF THE PITCH WITH DEAD OR INJURED, TIME WAS

    ESSENTIAL 30 SECONDS COULD HAVE PROVED CRUCIAL BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.

    HAVING TO WATCH THE DEAD BEING CARRIED PAST YOU ALONG THE FULL LENGTH OF THE

    PITCH COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED IF THE AMBULANCES HAD GOT TO THE SCENE.    IT WAS A

    VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE.

    Q54

    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

    JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

    I BELIEVE THAT THE PREPARATION FOR THE MATCH WAS VERY POOR I.E. IT WENT

    ALRIGHT AT THE MATCH LAST YEAR SO THIS YEAR WILL BE THE SAME.     EVERYTHING WAS

    T ^ E N FOR GRANTED.

    IN    FUTURE THE PLANNING OF SIMILAR GAMES SHOULD BE VERY THOROUGH AND IN DEPTH

    I.E. ROADWORKS WHICH CAUSE DELAYS SHOULD SE ACCOUNTED FOR.

       ASSESSMENT OF THE POLICING OPERATION FOR THE FA CUP SEMI-FINAL
                STAGED AT HILLSBOROUGH ON THE 15TH APRIL 1989_ _ _ _ _ _


In assessing the South Yorkshire policing operation                at Hillsborough,        I
have been hypercritical of their performance but, I hope, objective.                      It
should be noted that I take the view that some of the conclusions set out
here   are    influenced   by factors     outside the   policing     purview    but   have
relevance to the events of the day.


I have sub-divided this assessment into the following subject areas to
enable separate and distinct conclusions to be made.


       Pre-match planning
       Intel 1 igence
       Policing arrangements prior to the Leppings Lane turnstiles
       The 'crush' outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the
             opening of the gates
       Policing arrangements for crowd control on the Leppings Lane
             terraces
       The police reaction in the stadium to the disaster
       Communications


PRE-MATCH PLANNING
I have examined the divisional operational order for the semi-final which
deals with the main aspects of policing Hillsborough and find it less than
adequate and,      in some cases,       imprecise   in much   of the       information    it

contains.

                                                                   tw l-         Hovve-



                                                                                RV^
                                                    NTIAL
Having regard to the importance of the occasion and the fact that at least
one third of the South Yorkshire Force was to be involved in the policing
arrangements for the semi-final, I consider that it justified a composite
Force    Order        covering         all   the        policing      arrangements           and     that    the
complementary          orders      produced        for        the     day,        dealing     with     traffic
arrangements         and the       deployment       of     officers         in    other     divisions,      were
confusing and unco-ordinated.


To    deal     in    detail     with     those     parts      of     the     orders       which    I consider
inadequate and lacking precision would be unwieldy and confusing for the
purpose of this assessment.                      I will,       however,          make   reference to        some
material parts of the divisional operational order where I consider there
are significant defects.


(i)      No reference is made in the order to:
               a)     allocation of tickets to either cl ub;
               b)     allocation of tickets to neutral supporters;
               c)     forgeries;
               d)     fans without tickets;
               e)     conduct of fans at the 1988 semi - f i n a l .


(ii)     No instructions are given regarding the exclusion or action to be
         taken in respect of non-ticket holders.


(iii)    The        duties    of    superintendents             in        some    cases     are    imprecise,
             particularly       in respect         of     areas      of     responsibility         inside    and
             outside the football ground.


                                                          2
(iv)    The parts of the order dealing with licensed premises are less than
        clear.   Those premises to remain open near to the ground are not
        identified and the advice to be given to off licence holders                      is
        unsatisfactory.


(v)     The instructions for an emergency evacuation             are unclear        and   in
        some cases are confusing.


(vi)    There is no specific deployment of officers concerning the manning
        of the perimeter gates.


(vii)   The order does not detail      instructions         to the mounted         officers
        deployed at Leppings Lane entrance and they are not included in the
        serial instructions covering the duties of officers engaged at that
        entrance to the ground.


(viii) There is a conspicuous lack of instruction given to officers as to
        their duties and responsibilities in respect of the terraces of the
        football ground.


(ix)    Implicit in the order is the assumption that serial commanders will
        brief the officers under their command as to their specific duties
        and responsibilities.       There       is   no   information   in   the     order,
        however, as to how this will be done and what instructions will be
        given to officers.


(x)     There is no contingency plan or strategy dealing with latecomers to
        the ground.

Conclusion
It was conceded by those officers responsible for the preparation of the
divisional        order     that   it    followed,           in     virtually     all   respects,        the
operational        order     for   the        1988     semi-final       at     Hillsborough   and        the
justification for this was given as the success of the policing operation
in 1988.      It is difficult to sustain this position of complacency and it
suggests that little attention was given to reviewing the 1988 order and
identifying its shortcomings.


INTELLIGENCE
It is axiomatic that the strategies devised to police any major event
should take account of available intelligence.                           This is particularly the
case in relation to football matches, with their well known association
with hooliganism and crowd disorders.                          The Association of Chief Police
Officers' Guide to Policing Football                        (hereafter referred to as the ACPO
Guide) highlights the importance of this:


   "It is important that the officer responsible for policing the match
   determines the pre-match planning in the light of the intelligence
   at hand."         (ACPO Guide para. 1.7)                 Whilst that intelligence can be
   obtained from a variety of sources, "the prime source for football
   intelligence           is the Police National                  Intelligence System which         is
   based     on     the     network      of     Police       Liaison     Officers.        Summaries
   completed by police officers of the home club Force are                                forwarded
   to      the      visiting       club's            liaison        officer,      making available




                                                        4

           intelligence about fans' behaviour at both home and away fixtures.
           This   information will          be collated          and made      available for           future
           matches involving that club."


     On the occasion of the               1989 semi-final,            it would fall       to the         liaison
     officers of Merseyside and Nottinghamshire Constabularies who would make
     available       to     the     South      Yorkshire         Constabulary        relevant          pre-match
     intel1 igence.
C*
     It is therefore of particular concern that details of a report compiled by
     the     Hertfordshire        Constabulary,       following        an    all-ticket        match     between
     Watford and Liverpool (at Watford) on 13th February 1988, were not passed
     on to the South Yorkshire Constabulary.                          This related to an attempt by
     some 1500 non-ticket holding Liverpool                      supporters to gain access to the
     stadi um.


     Though it is of course supposition, it is likely that information of this
     nature       would   have     influenced        the    policing        strategies    to     be     employed
     outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles.                       In particular, any suggestion of a
     common practice by a substantial number of Liverpool supporters to attempt
     to gain access without tickets may have concentrated the planners' minds
     on the need for a determined and specific filtering system, as opposed to
     the rather more random strategy adopted.


     The     usefulness     of     this     information,        and    South    Yorkshire's       failure       to
     receive       it,    was     confirmed     by    the       testimony      of   the   Assistant        Chief
     Constable, Operations, Mr. Jackson.

Conclusion
What could perhaps be described as normal                         'low grade'          intelligence was
supplied by Merseyside to South Yorkshire.                     However, the failure to supply
the    aforementioned        information        appears      to     have        been     a   significant
breakdown in the established Police National Intelligence System.                                 Though
the judgement as to what intelligence is relevant, and current, is largely
a subjective one, it would certainly seem that                         this information was             of
significant       interest to        anyone        hosting    Liverpool          supporters      in     an
all-ticket match.


It may have been of particular importance on this occasion, in view of the
allegations that the policing operation was deficient in comparison with
1988, in terms of the efforts made to filter out ticket holders prior                                   to
them gaining access to the turnstile.                    Whilst it is, of course, correct to
note    that     the   senior       officers       concerned       refute        any     suggestion     of
differences in this respect, it is nevertheless reasonable to assume that,
had this information been made available to them, it would have had the
effect of concentrating minds on this particular aspect.


(The    establishment         of      a    national       computer based          police     football
intelligence       system     could       ensure     that    all     relevant           information     is
available to police responsible for policing a football match.)


POLICING ARRANGEMENTS PRIOR TO THE LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES
In planning the policing of the semi-final,                         detailed arrangements were
made   to      co-ordinate    the     arrival       of    spectators       by    whatever      means    of
transport and provide police escorts to the stadium.                            Liverpool supporters
who were travelling by special train (in the event there was only one)
                                                     6


                                   COEnI F I D E N T I A L
    would alight at Wadsley Bridge Railway Station and walk the half mile to
    the ground under police escort.           It was anticipated that some Liverpool
    supporters would arrive at Midland Railway Station, which was designated,
    in the main, for use by Nottingham Forest fans.                  Arrangements were made to
    transport those Liverpool          supporters       to the      stadium by special         buses.
    Those supporters arriving by coach would be escorted by the police from
    the designated parking areas to the stadium.


^ ^ A r r a n g e m e n t s of this nature are common practice in the policing of all
    major football matches and they can, to a degree, be undermined by the
    vagaries    of   the   transport    network,        the   use   of   private    vehicles     and,
    indeed, the willingness or otherwise of supporters to go directly to the
    ground.


    However, the critical aspect of this area of the policing operation on
    this occasion does not appear to have been the reception and collection of
    Liverpool   supporters on alighting from their transport,                      but rather the
    absence of a predetermined strategy to systematically muster supporters
    into queues on the approach to the perimeter fence outside the Leppings
    Lane turnstiles.


    Any such strategy would involve a combination of mounted and foot patrol
    officers utilising the building lines outside the perimeter fence,                           both
    right and left, along Leppings Lane (terraced houses in one direction and
    the bridging parapet in the other).             Such a deployment would, in effect,
    attempt to form two queues, perhaps six deep, up to the perimeter fence,
    with fans being fed in a controlled manner from these to the turnstiles.
    A filter system designed to check for non-ticket holders could also have
                                                    7


                                       CONFIDENTIAL
been accommodated within this strategy.                    In this way, the uncontrolled
entry of spectators to the somewhat constricted                      and   'funnel-1 i k e 1 area
between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence may have been avoided and a
degree of success in eliminating non-ticket holders from the same area
achieved.


By utilising foot patrol officers within such a strategy, the number of
mounted officers required is reduced, though obviously the total manpower
required is dependent upon the number of spectators anticipated at any one
time.    The plan did include the deployment of 44 officers                         immediately
outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles whose brief included the forming of
orderly queues.        However, this had little chance of success in the face of
a capacity crowd,         swelled    by an    unknown       number   of non-ticket       holders
attempting to enter the stadium through                   23 turnstiles,        which   it would
appear may have been inadequate to achieve the necessary                        'flow rate' to
admit the numbers attending at the time of their arrival prior to the
commencement of the game.


It is of course debatable to what degree the police could have anticipated
these factors.     It was known that there would be a capacity crowd.                     It was
anticipated that a number of non-ticket holders would attend with officers
briefed to check for this, though in an informal manner, as opposed to the
employment of a 'cordon' or formally established filter system.                           Whilst
the degree of police knowledge regarding the turnstile flow rates was
based upon club advice, this is inextricably linked with the issue of late
arrivals.    Though, in evidence, Chief Superintendent Mole stated that the
late    arrival   of    spectators    was    not       anticipated   to    be   a problem,    he
conceded that this was an aspect for consideration at the planning stage.

                              CONFIDENTIAL
It is the case that there were considerable police efforts through the
media prior to the event encouraging spectators to arrive early.                         However,
there appears to have been little consideration given to the consequences
of these appeals failing.               In this situation, the adopted strategy for
controlling       queues   in   the      Leppings       Lane     turnstile   area    would     prove
inadequate in terms of its extent, and indeed limited ambition.                              In the
event, this proved to be the case.


It should be noted that the ACPO Guide contains specific advice on the use
of mounted officers in the forming of orderly queues.


   "Queues forming at turnstiles should be closely monitored by police
   and    stewards.        It    is     recommended       that     mounted   officers,       where
   available, are used for this purpose." (ACPO Guide, para. 1.43).


While the Operational           Order    did   indicate        a deployment     of   six mounted
officers in Leppings Lane, there is no reference to their duties, including
the control of queues.          It is curious to note that the serial instructions
for foot patrol officers engaged in queue control at turnstiles in other
areas of the ground         include reference to assistance being provided by
mounted officers, yet this is omitted from the instructions to serials
similarly engaged at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.


If this     is an acknowledgment of the restricted area available outside
these turnstiles rendering the deployment of horses problematic, then the
existence of a pre-determined strategy for queue formation                           and control
outside     the    perimeter     fence     assumes       an    even   greater   priority.            In
evidence,     Chief Superintendent Mole             conceded       that   it is difficult for
                                                    9

horses to operate within the perimeter fence, but that they can operate in
Leppings Lane to form queues on the footpath and that this is "the kind of
action they undertake".         However, this comment and the lack of reference
within   the   Operational      Order    seems        to     suggest        a    casual     approach    as
opposed to a known and positive strategy.


Conclusion
In view of the geographical make-up of the area immediately outside the
Leppings Lane turnstiles, the existence of a pre-determined and commonly
understood strategy, catering for queue formation and control of the type
described earlier, combined with a filtering system to detect non-ticket
holders, would have been desirable.               The absence of such a strategy (as
opposed to a general understanding) appears to have been the result of
heavy reliance      being    placed     upon   the         success     of       previous     operations.
Though the devising of strategies based upon hindsight is a 'comfortable'
occupation, it may be that, on this occasion, a degree of 'comfortable'
familiarity    dulled     the   essential      questioning             aspect       required      in   the
planning of any operation.


It would perhaps also be fair to say that the same familiarity, had it
been present within the commanding officer on the day, may have resulted
in a realisation of potential problems much earlier than was indeed the
case,    allowing   for     remedial     action       and     thus      affecting          the   outcome.
Unfortunately, in the event, the commanding officer was only able to adopt
the negative aspect of the two aforementioned 'faces' of familiarity.

                                CONFIDENTIAL
Further, it should be said that the proposed strategy, as outlined, would
have provided no guarantee in preventing the subsequent              'crush'   outside
the turnstiles.     Excessive numbers of determined supporters arriving late
en masse may well have overwhelmed both mounted and foot patrol officers
thus deployed.     However, this does not mitigate the culpability associated
with inadequate planning.     Additionally, the early establishment of queues
may influence late arrivals to comply and join them, perhaps even to a
degree well beyond the capability of the strength of the police presence
to enforce.    This will particularly be the case if the queues can be seen
to be making progress.


THE 'CRUSH' OUTSIDE THE LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES AND THE SUBSEQUENT
  OPENING OF THE GATES
Accepting that the 'crush' of supporters immediately outside the Leppings
Lane turnstiles did take place, it is necessary to examine the actions
taken to deal with that situation in the light of available options.


However, prior to doing so,          it is right to comment upon the apparent
confusion over the command structure for this area of the operation.               The
'F ' Division Operational    Order indicates Superintendent Greenwood to be
the officer in command of Sector 1 (Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium)
with   Superintendent     Marshall     in    command   of   Sector     2   (Liverpool
supporters).      Chief Superintendent Mole's interpretation of this is that
the Sector 1 Commander's area of responsibility extended to the perimeter
fence outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, with the Sector 2 Commander
having responsibility "within the road and beyond".            However, based upon
custom and practice, there appears to have been an understanding that, in
view of the 'blurring of edges' in the area between the turnstiles and the
perimeter fence, the physical positioning of the two Sector Commanders at

                                            11

a certain time prior to the game commencing would,                             in effect,     involve a
transfer of responsibility for this area and the officers deployed within
it.   This is precisely what occurred on the day.


The criticality of this transfer is perhaps not immediately obvious, as it
is apparent    that   it was        a common        and        previously       successful    practice,
therefore indicating that the supervisory officers deployed in this area,
chosen because of their previous experience in the same roles, would be
perfectly aware of the command structure.                        However, what is also apparent
is the failure of Chief Superintendent Duckinfield, who was not familiar
with the operation,         to     inform the        Sector           1 Commander       (Superintendent
Greenwood) of the situation            developing              outside     the turnstiles      and the
possibility of consequential problems inside them, and indeed within the
associated    terraces      and     stands.          Additionally,             the   Chief    Inspector
supervising the Leppings Lane turnstile area also failed to request that
his Sector Commander, as per the operational                           order, be informed of the
developing situation.


In    consequence,    the        scenario     was        one     of      the   Sector     2   Commander
(Superintendent       Marshall)             operating            in       increasingly        difficult
circumstances in an area of blurred responsibility immediately outside the
turnstiles, taking actions which would have a critical effect within the
ground, which was most certainly within both the theoretical and practical
responsibilities of the Sector 1 Commander, who, perhaps because of the
confused areas of command* was not informed of the dangerous situation
developing.




                                                    12

Though it can only be supposition,              it is distinctly possible that, had
Superintendent Greenwood been informed of the situation, his experience
may have allowed him to instigate effective remedial action on the inside
of the turnstiles to deal with the effects of the opening of the gates,
thus affecting the eventual outcome.


However, it was Superintendent Marshall who, from approximately 2.00 pm,
effectively found himself in command of the area immediately outside the
Leppings Lane turnstiles.           He estimates that, by 2.15 pm, Leppings Lane
contained        approximately    6,000-8,000        people.        In    consequence     of    the
deteriorating traffic situation, he requested that Leppings Lane be closed
to traffic.        He believes that he made this request at 2.25 pm, though the
Ground Control          Incident Log indicates that it was received at                   2.17 pm.
After     2.30    pm,    the   situation   immediately          outside    the     Leppings    Lane
turnstiles began to deteriorate rapidly, with what he describes as a vast
and     progressively      unruly crowd massing.                By 2.45 pm,      he describes    a
situation of total mayhem, with a massive                      and disorderly crush of people
making little apparent progress through the turnstiles,                          causing him to
believe that death or serious injury would be likely to result.                          It is at
this time that he first asked for the gates to the stadium to be opened,
in order to reduce the pressure outside                        the turnstiles.      At   2.48 pm,
Gate 'C' was opened for some 30 seconds and then closed.                         Apart from this,
it was some 7 minutes after the first request to open the gates was made
that Gate 'C' was opened, allowing uncontrolled access into the stadium.
Gate 'A' was also opened at 2.57 pm to alleviate crushing.




                                                13


                                 C O N F in rM T i af
It is a matter for debate whether Superintendent Marshall's impression of
an unruly crowd "swarming over gates . . .                   and parapets . . . .     kicking and
fighting"       is    a correct     one.     There      is   certainly     considerable       police
evidence that supports the notion of a determined                         crowd,    unwilling or
unable     to     accept   advice    and    direction.         There     is,   of   course,     much
conflicting evidence which suggests that the people who found themselves
within the crush outside the turnstiles were the victims of poor police
crowd control and direction.


Having examined previously a possible strategy which may have prevented
the 'crush' outside the turnstiles developing, the following provides an
appraisal of options available and actions taken to alleviate the crush.


a)   Prevent further         access to the limited area between the turnstiles and

     the perimeter fence.
     This was attempted by the mounted officers, who closed the perimeter
     gates and placed a line of horses on the outside of the perimeter
     fence after it was clear that the area outside the turnstiles was
     full and that there was a need to prevent further access.                             However,
     it would appear that they were overwhelmed by weight of numbers and,
     it is suggested, the extraordinary determination of many spectators

     to gain access.


     Clearly, this was an emergency manoeuvre to cater for an unexpected
         problem.      The very size of the existing problem which prompted this
         action      militated    against    the     manoeuvre's       success,     with    control
         needing to be exercised prior to the situation developing.


                                                   14


                                     CONFIDENTIAL
However,    the   surprise     expressed     by    the   South   Yorkshire     Mounted
Inspector (Inspector H a n d ^- Da vi e s) regarding the total disregard many
supporters had for the presence of horses, a situation which in his
considerable experience was unprecedented, must be acknowledged.


Dispersal utilising public disorder tactics.
Clearly,    this was never likely to be considered                  an option.       The
nature of the event would not suggest the need to prepare for this
type of deployment.          Additionally,    the geographical         nature of the
restricted area within the perimeter fence renders any sort of rapid
dispersal    involving a large crowd both            impractical      and   dangerous.
Further, the use of a mounted deployment to effect rapid dispersal of
a 'massed' crowd is specifically advised against within the Police
Mounted Training Manual.


Employ the use of public address systems to exhort the crowd to stop
pushing, etc.
This was done, but with apparently little effect.                   It is likely that
the crowd noise rendered         the   announcements       ineffective.       This    is
supported by Superintendent Marshall, who, having made the request
for announcements to be made, did not subsequently hear any.


Request     the   attendance     of    additional        officers     to    assist    in
controlling the situation.
Again, this was done.         At approximately 2.10 pm, additional mounted
officers were deployed to Leppings                Lane to assist,       along with     a
reserve serial of officers from the gymnasium.


                                       15

                       CONFIDENTIAL
However, with regard to foot patrol officers, it is                            unclear as to who
was going to deploy them on arrival and what they                              were going to do,
as by this time the situation was such that Superintendent Marshall
was clearly unable to exercise any degree of co-ordinated command for
the    area outside        the        turnstiles         and   deployments        from within         the
ground.        If it hadn't been apparent previously, there was a clear
requirement by this time for Superintendent Greenwood to be informed
of     the    situation,         so     that       an     assessment       could     be      made     and
preparations laid within the stadium for the possible conseque.nces of
the situation outside.


The responsibility for this failure lies within the Control Room and
Chief Superintendent Duckinfield.                        The CCTV pictures of the Leppings
Lane turnstiles at            this time, which were being received within the
Police       Control   Room      along       with       the    'zoom'     facilities       available,
clearly demanded command decisions.                            It should have been apparent
that     Superintendent          Marshall's             position     outside       the     turnstiles
precluded him from            dealing with anything but the                        'crush'    that was
developing around him.


Delay the start of the game.
At     approximately       2.30        pm,     discussion          took   place      between        Chief
Superintendent         Duckinfield           and        Superintendent      Murray        within      the
Police Room regarding the circumstances applicable for delaying the
kick-off.        The former decided at this time that a delay was not
required.




                                                   16


                        CONFIDENTIAL
In arriving at this decision, Chief Superintendent Duckinfield relied
solely upon the advice of Superintendent Murray, who was with him in
the Police Control Room, and a visual assessment of the stadium and
CCTV pictures.         In that this was a matter that he was considering, it
would also have seemed advisable to have requested assessments from
officers outside the stadium regarding the number of spectators still
to   be      accommodated.               In    particular,          to      have         spoken     to
Superintendent         Marshall      about         this      may    have         highlighted       the
possibility of announcing a delay as a favoured option in minimising
the crush that was soon to develop outside the turnstiles, as it was
shortly after 2.30 pm that this officer considered the situation to
be deteriorating rapidly.


It   is     debatable     what      degree          of     influence       the     pre-determined
parameters governing the option to delay or otherwise had on Chief
Superintendent D u c k i n f i e l d 1s decision at this time.                    With hindsight,
it would seem that the factors upon which it had been decided that
this option should be based took too little account of reality and
safety in that,         if supporters were                late by their           own    choice,    as
opposed     to   the    existence        of    an        identifiable      problem        (e.g.    bad
weather, etc.), then this would not represent grounds for delaying
kick-off.


It would seem that an early decision to delay the start of the match
was a viable option.          However, it should be noted that those public
address     announcements         that    were       made     to   the     crowd        outside    the
Leppings Lane turnstiles were ineffective, perhaps as a result of the
noise or the mood of the crowd, or both.                           There was no guarantee,
                                              17


                          CONFIDENTIAL
     therefore, that an announcement to delay the start would have met
     with any greater degree of success, though it is logical to assume it
     would if the message could be communicated.


f)   Utilise mounted officers to 'peel a w a y 1 sections of the crowd (from
     the Directors' Entrance side) and transfer into a queue along the
     wall in the 'sterile zone' (i.e. on the Directors' Entrance/Penistone
     Road side of the crowd).
     Whilst possible,     this would     have   been     a relatively      slow process;
     perhaps it could have been employed in addition to a number of the
     options previously discussed.


g)   Open the large gates and permit uncontrolled access to the stadium.
     At approximately 2.45 pm, Superintendent Marshall                  did request that
     the gates be opened, to prevent what he feared would be death or
     serious injury.      Gate 'C' was opened at 2.48 pm for approximately
     30 seconds, but on this occasion is was to eject a supporter, and then
     again at 2.52 pm after Chief Superintendent Duckinfield had agreed to
     his   request.     This   appears   to have       cleared    the   area within   the
     perimeter gates, though there remained a crush at Gate 'A' which was
     subsequently opened at 2.57 pm.


     Clearly, the opening of these two gates was successful in alleviating
     the crush outside the turnstiles.           However,        in view of the tragedy
     that ensued, the following questions require to be addressed.




                                           18

                          CONFIDENTIAL
Was     there     any    alternative       other    than      to    open    the     gates?
Accepting the situation             as     it was    outside       the Leppings           Lane
turnstiles some time just prior to 2.40 pm, and the perception
of officers present relating                to the     possibility of death                 or
serious    injury,       it is difficult to envisage                any other       single
option     available        to     Superintendent           Marshall       which      would
guarantee to alleviate the almost overwhelming situation with
which he was faced.              If 'instant relief' was what was required,
then this was the most viable option available to him.


Would it have been desirable to have opened Gate 'B' instead of
or as well as Gate 'C', and who should have assessed this and
decided accordingly?
There     is some evidence           that Gate      'B ' was       open for    a short
period, approximately 30 to 60 seconds.                      However, had the main
uncontrolled       influx         of spectators      been     through Gate         'B '     as
opposed to 'C', it is likely that far fewer numbers would have
found themselves going down the central tunnel into the already
crowded Pens 3 and 4.               Instead, they would probably have made
their way to the relatively emptier terraced viewing area to the
north side of the Leppings Lane terraces.


On making his request, Superintendent Marshall did not specify
which     gates     he    wished     to    be   opened       initially,       though        he
subsequently specified the North Stand Gate.


Clearly,    in view of           the situation      which he was attempting to
control     outside      the turnstiles,            Superintendent Marshall               was
                                      19

                         CONFIDENTIAL
    never    in   a    position        where     one     could have       expected      him   to
    rationally consider which gates to open and the consequences of
    doing so.         Indeed, though his experience may have suggested to
    him that Pens 3 and 4 were likely to be the fullest enclosures
    on the West Terraces, he could not possibly have known this for
    certain, nor how full they were. Whilst there may have been
    confusion as to who should be in command immediately outside the
    turnstiles, there could be no such confusion regarding the area
    within the stadium.                That should have been             for the Sector        1
    Commander,        Superintendent           Greenwood        in    liaison    with     Chief
    Superintendent Duckinfield.


    However, as the latter did not inform Superintendent Greenwood
    of the developing situation,                 the responsibility for assessing
    which gates it was most prudent to open lay entirely with Chief
    Superintendent Duckinfield and his Control Room staff.


iii) Accepting    that    Gate         'C1 was         opened, was       there    a    strategy
     available that may have prevented the tragedy, and who should
     have implemented it?
     If one ignores the opening of Gate 'C' for 30 seconds at 2.48 pm,
     there appears to have been some 7 minutes between the Police
     Control Room receiving Superintendent Marshall's initial request
     to open the gates and the eventual opening of Gate 'C'.


     Though by no means could this be considered a lot of time in
     the    circumstances,        it     was     perhaps        sufficient       for    someone
     who     appreciated      the         dangers          of        uncontrolled       access,
                                          20


                       C ON-F4-B-ENXIA_L
particularly through              Gate      ' C 1, and   the     natural     tendency           for
persons so entering to go down the central tunnel                                into Pens 3
and      4,     to       deploy      officers         accordingly.               That      Chief
Superintendent             Duckinfield          appreciated         there         could          be
consequences of this action for the Leppings Lane Terraces                                       is
evident from his written recollections, when he states:


      "I watched the Leppings                 Lane    Terrace     intently        for     any
      developments as a result of the gates opening."


However, he issued no instructions to deal with the consequences
of    the     uncontrolled         influx     of     spectators    through         Gate       ' C 1,
despite the fact that even he appreciated that the "centre two
pens of the terrace appeared to be almost full".


Only he and his Control Room staff were ever in a position to
equate the consequences of the gates opening with the situation
upon the'terraces.             Only he, therefore, was in possession of the
full picture upon which to base deployments.


There is no doubt that options were available to deflect the
influx of spectators entering through Gate                          'C'     away from the
central       tunnel     towards the relatively empty enclosures to the
north and south of the terraced area.


The     gate        at   the   tunnel       entrance     could     have     been        closed.
However, this may have caused some panic amongst those in the
tunnel        and    at the       rear   of    the    terraces     of     Pens     3    and      4.
                                         21



                         CONFIDENTIAL
Additionally, it may have created another crowd problem within
the enclosure behind the turnstiles                             and   in front of the now
closed gate.


Alternatively, officers inside the Leppings Lane turnstiles or
mounted officers, perhaps four, could have been deployed from
the Penistone Road end, entering the stadium through Gate 'E' to
position     themselves            head      on    at the        entrance     to        the     tunnel,
discouraging supporters from entering same and giving verbal and
physical signals for fans to go to the left and right.                                        There is
every     likelihood         that         such      a     deployment        would        have         been
successful,     particularly              as video recordings                reveal           that the
spectators who entered through Gate 'C' on the second occasion
did so not in a rush, but at a controlled pace.


Though     clearly      it        was     a difficult           situation     which           existed,
particularly       in        view       of    the       radio    problems which           had         been
experienced,       it         is        considered         that       there may          have         been
sufficient     time          to     arrange for           a deployment as           above.             The
proviso here though is that the officer in command needed to be
very familiar with the geography, the plan and his role, and in
addition have the confidence to demand information where more
was     required     and      deploy          officers          accordingly        to     the         best
advantage.                 Clearly,               for      whatever          reason,                 Chief
Superintendent Duckinfield was ill-fitted for this task on the
day in question.           Perhaps the             most    damning      indictment              is     not




                                             22

             that he selected the wrong option in attempting to minimise the
             danger on the terraces, but rather that he did not attempt to
             select any option.


Conclusion
The command structure for the area between the Leppings Lane turnstiles
and the perimeter fence was confused, with a contradiction evident between
the operational order and practice on the day.     This may have contributed
to a failure to implement effective deployments within the stadium to deal
with the possible consequences of opening the gates and the subsequent
uncontrolled access of spectators.


Whilst options were available to attempt to minimise the crush in this
area, a number of these were tried and failed.       However, once the crush
was allowed to develop, creating fear of death or serious injury and a
requirement for 'instant relief', the single most viable option available
was to open gates.


Nevertheless, an assessment should have been made as to which were the
most appropriate gates to open in the light of existing occupancy of the
stadium.     Only Chief Superintendent Duckinfield and his Control Room staff
were ever in a position to make this assessment.     Similarly, only he could
assess the consequences of the opening of Gate 'C' for Pens 3 and 4 on the
Leppings Lane Terraces, as only he was in possession of the total picture.
That he was aware there would be consequences       is evident from written
recollections.     There was sufficient time for him to attempt an effective
deployment to block off the entrance to the central        tunnel, either by
closing the gate or, preferably, deploying mounted officers.     However, the
                                       23

fact that he did nothing other than watch the situation develop                                         is a
severe indictment on his fitness to fulfil his role on the day.


POLICING ARRANGEMENTS FOR CROWD CONTROL ON THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACES
It    is    clear   from      the     operational   order     and     the     testimony          of    senior
officers that the policing arrangements for crowd control on the Leppings
Lane Terraces for the 1989 semi-final relied                         heavily upon the perceived
success in dealing with the identical event in 1988.                              It was felt that the
methods employed in 1988 (and indeed 1987) were both tried and tested,
therefore indicating that only minor adjustments were required for 1989.


Whilst, in itself, this approach was both natural and logical, it did not
allow for the identification of weaknesses which may have existed within
the    original        plans,       the   criticality    of    which        was    dependent          upon   a
combination of factors thus far not experienced.


In this regard, the de-brief report for the FA Cup semi-final                                     staged at
Hillsborough Stadium on the 11th April                   1981 (Wolves v Tottenham) should
have       indicated    the     potential     for   disaster        which     existed       in    terms of
overcrowding on the Leppings Lane Terraces.                    The de-brief identifies that,
on that occasion, crushing incidents occurred on the terracing following
the admittance of an over-capacity crowd to the Leppings Lane enclosure.
This necessitated the opening of perimeter fence gates to                                   alleviate the

situation.


Subsequently, and on police recommendations, radial fences were erected to
compartmentalise the Leppings Lane terracing area in an effort to improve
crowd control           arrangements.         Whilst fences         of this        nature        are wholly

                                     CONFIDENTIAL
consistent with advice contained within the                            Guide to       Safety at       Sports
Grounds (hereafter referred to as the Green Guide)                              (para.       206) and the
ACPO     Guide      to   Policing     Football      (para.            1.49),    the    absence      of     any
systematic          method   of     monitoring      and     sequential         filling        of   terraced
enclosures would, at best, do nothing to remove the potential for crushing
incidents of the nature experienced in 1981.                           Indeed, it is reasonable to
assume       that     the    creation       of    'pens'        has    considerable          potential      to
exacerbate the problem if the policy adopted is one of allowing spectators
to find their own level of occupancy.


The ACPO Guide makes specific reference to the advisability of sequential
filling of pens (para. 1.49), whilst the Green Guide refers to the need
for even distribution on terraces (Ch.                     8, page 31).


Yet, in the face of both this advice                       and the clear need for 'management'
of     the    occupancy      rate    of    enclosures,          the   operational       order      makes    no
reference to the general need for systematic sequential filling of pens,
nor does it contain reference to the deployment of                             individuals or         groups
of officers on this duty.                  Two serials of officers (14 and 15 consisting
of 22 officers in total) were designated as having general duties on the
Leppings Lane Terraces during Phase 1 of the operation (i.e. pre-match),
in addition          to a supervisory role            of spectators            entering       through      the
turnstiles.          However, this did not entail any directional role in relation
to the sequential packing of enclosures.                         That this was not an oversight,
subsequently rectified               by briefings         and     deployments,        was    confirmed      by
Chief        Superintendents        Mole    and   Duckinfield,         both    of     whom    supported      a
policy of "self levelling" by spectators in the enclosures.


                                                     25

It is noteworthy that the police accept responsibility, in league matches,
for monitoring and packing the Leppings Lane terraces, which are used to
accommodate visiting teams.             It would seem from the evidence given that
this responsibility does not extend to matches other than league matches.


While it is true that both the Green Guide and the ACPO Guide emphasise
the stewards' role in the distribution of spectators and club management's
responsibility for crowd control arrangements, there is tacit acceptance
in the latter of a significant degree of police responsibility in this

regard.


   "...   police do       not    directly    control       the    employment   of   stewards
   ......       it should be accepted that there is a responsibility within
   the wider context of public safety, to exert                      influence to ensure
   that the     arrangements made           by the management         of the ground       are
   adequate in this respect." (ACPO Guide para. 3.2).


Additionally,      when   giving      evidence,    Chief     Superintendent     Mole    accepted
that   stewards     "would      not   be   over-eager"       to    place   themselves    on     the
terraces amongst the Liverpool fans on the occasion of the semi-final.


Conclusion
Clearly, there was no control exercised in terms of the occupancy levels
in enclosures on the Leppings Lane Terraces prior to any recognition that
a problem     of    overcrowding       already     existed.         Further,   recognition       of
overcrowding was totally dependent on visual perception in the absence of
a turnstile totaliser system which was specific to individual enclosures.
In these circumstances, it is clear that the planning of this operation
                                                  26

                                 CONFIDENTIAL
was deficient in this respect, with the failure to deploy officers and/or
ensure     the     placing    of    stewards        to     achieve     occupancy       monitoring            of
enclosures, amounting to an abdication of responsibility.                             The stance that
previous experience had not revealed this to be                             a problem      is     largely
undermined by the de-brief report into the 1981 incident.


The combination of circumstances relating to the apparently unanticipated
late     arrival     of   a   large        number     of     spectators,       the     absence         of     a
pre-determined positive strategy to maintain some form of queueing system,
the crush outside the turnstiles and the subsequent opening of the gates,
revealed     the    serious    shortcomings          of    a   crowd       control     strategy        which
permitted uncontrolled occupancy of the compartmentalised sections of the
Leppings Lane Terraces.


POLICE REACTIONS IN THE STADIUM TO THE DISASTER
The video footage of the disaster and the subsequent rescue operation does
not support the view of police officers deliberately ignoring the pleas of
fans within the enclosures on the Leppings Lane Terraces.


What is clear        is that,       among some officers,              there may have been some
initial    misconception       as     to    the     nature     of    the    problem.       It     is        not
unnatural for first thoughts to be concerned with pitch                                invasions.            In
terms of experience, it is this form of problem that is most prevalent and
therefore most likely, as opposed to crushing within the enclosures.                                        The
emphasis     placed upon preventing pitch                  invasions within           the operational
order would have had little effect upon junior officers,                             not least because

that     document's    circulation      was   restricted           to    Inspectors     and     above.
However, it is not clear how heavily this point was                         'laboured' when the
officers were briefed.


Nevertheless, from the early stages, officers are seen on the perimeter
fence motioning the crowd to move back.                          These   officers     were    clearly
concerned    with     relieving   the    crush        at   the    front,    as   opposed       to   the
suggestion that they were attempting to prevent people climbing the fence.


The video footage also makes apparent the physical                         limitations        imposed,
firstly by the perimeter fence itself, and secondly by the narrowness of
the access gates within it, upon attempts to evacuate the enclosures onto
the pitch.     Clearly, the nature of the fence and gates rendered the pitch
an unrealistic evacuation area in the event of an emergency.


The much criticised deployment of officers onto the pitch to reduce the
risk of disorder between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest supporters, who
were perhaps still unaware of the nature of the problem, would also appear
to be fully justified.


In positive terms, there is much evidence of officers acting on initiative
to effect both rescue from the pitch and from the rear, with a number of
police officers to be seen coming down the terraces towards the perimeter
fence.

However,    there   is again much to        criticise        in terms      of the degree              of
command exercised.          In brief,    Chief Superintendent           Duckinfield and his
Control Room staff were in an advantageous position to quickly assess the
real nature of the problems in Pens 3 and 4.                 He was aware that there was
an uncontrolled influx of          fans through the gates at                  the Leppings Lane
entrance.    By his own admission, he observed the Leppings Lane Terraces to
monitor the effects of the opening of the gates.                     He saw some spectators
emerging    through   the    perimeter    gates      onto    the     track.       He    had     video
available of the affected pens, with zoom facility, allowing him to have a
'close up' view of the problem.


Yet he was unable to assess the situation, thinking that there may have
been a pitch invasion.         This is despite the fact that, at approximately
the same time that he was considering the possibility of a pitch invasion,
Superintendent      Greenwood,     who    was     oblivious        to the problems      at      the
Leppings Lane entrance and the            subsequent opening of               the gates, noticed
from where he was standing in the players1 tunnel one                          or two spectators
climbing over the perimeter fence               and "immediately realised that there
must be a crowd problem, not . . . .              a pitch invasion because that would
not happen so early in a match".


This alone is a damning indictment on Chief Superintendent D u c k in fi el d's
inability to appreciate the problem despite the knowledge and facilities
available to him.         Additionally, a BBC video contains an almost immediate
assessment     of   the   problem from     the       match   commentator        on     seeing     some
spectators emerging onto the track, when he discounted the possibility of

a pitch invasion.

Further,        according           to     his           written          recollections,                Chief
Superintendent        Duckinfield's inability to assess the situation                            extended
beyond the     above time      scales    to when         the    match          had    been stopped         by
Superintendent          Greenwood,       and even        to      when                Assistant          Chief
Constable     Jackson      attended      the Police       Control              Room      requesting        an
appraisal.       At     this   time,     he still        appears    to have       been    under           the
impression that the problem was one of pitch invasion.


It does not appear that Chief Superintendent Duckinfield used the radio to
ask anyone for an assessment, or,                   in the event         of     radio communications
being difficult, go and assess the situation for himself.


Even when     he realised the nature of the problem and the need to mount a
rescue     operation,     as   he    surely must,         there     is        no evidence       of      Chief
Superintendent        Duckinfield exercising any degree of                      command, control           or
indeed co-ordination of the police efforts.


The scene on the           pitch was one of chaos, with the dead or dying being
scattered     about in and among police and spectators.                          Additional officers
were called to assist but, at the actual scene                           of the incident             itself,
there was no attempt by the commanding officer                            to bring        to     bear     any
organisation.         Nor does      it seem that          he delegated           any of        his   senior
officers to take          charge of the scene.                He did not attend;            rather         he
busied himself with the establishment of operational                             support within the
Pol ice Control Room.

It is fair to say that the initial              chaos on the pitch was inevitable.
What is reprehensible, however, is that no attempts were made at an early
stage by the commanding officer to organise and co-ordinate the rescue
operation.    Attempts should have been made to clear the casualties to a
casualty area away from the vast numbers of supporters 'milling about', to
establish an emergency vehicles reception area, to co-ordinate the early
provision    of first      aid         and stretcher parties, and to organise the rescue
effort itself through the most effective deployment of police officers.


Clearly, to achieve the degree of organisation required would have been
extremely difficult.       To     overcome     the   initial        confusion      required     a
cohesive and positive approach by the commanding officer in directing the
police operation and, sadly, this was lacking.


The decision to delay the announcement of the abandonment of the game
until after the departure of the last ambulance is not, it would seem,
critical.     Whilst, on   balance, it may have been better to have provided
more information via the public address systems, the decision however to
ensure that the roads remained clear for the emergency service vehicles,
by delaying    announcement       of    the   postponement,    is    a sound       operational
reason for the action taken.


The police role in co-ordinating the emergency services left much to be
desired,      in that       the        information   passed    to the Fire      Brigade   and       the
Ambulance Service was noticeably lacking in the sort of detail to enable
them to respond effectively.               Not to    arrange   location      and    attendance
points for the Fire Service, who were responding to a request for bolt
cutters, was particularly reprehensible.

Conclusion
There may have been some initial misconception among junior officers as to
the nature of the problem on the terraces.                This would be understandable
based upon previous experience,           and would have        little       to do with      the
emphasis     placed upon preventing pitch            invasions within        the operational
order, though it may have been influenced by the contents of briefings.


However,    there   is no evidence to support the             view of        police    officers
deliberately ignoring the supporters within the terraces, whilst there is
a great deal of evidence highlighting initiatives being displayed by many

officers.


In contrast, however, the commanding officer displayed poor perception in
his    inability    to   correctly    assess        the   situation     on    the     terraces,
particularly in view of the knowledge                and facilities       at his disposal.
Additionally, the failure to attempt to minimise the inevitable chaos at
an early stage within the rescue operation                  is an     indictment      upon the
commanding officer and, possibly, Assistant Chief Constable, Operations,
who was      present.    However,    it   is   appropriate     to     point    out    that   the
Assistant Chief Constable was not given the full                      information     by Chief
Superintendent Duckinfield regarding the opening of the gates                         and,   not
being familiar with the events leading up to the disaster, would probably
be unaware of the weaknesses in this officer's command abilities on the

day.




                                               32
It is the responsibility of the police to co-ordinate               and control   the
emergency response to a major incident.          Not only did the police commander
fail to co-ordinate this response, but the staff in the Police Control
Rooms lacked a professional and competent approach to their duties.


COMMUNICATIONS
Undoubtedly the breakdown in the police radio base station, albeit for a
few minutes, necessitating a switch to the use of a personal radio in the
Police Control Room, created some problems, but it would appear that most
of the 'breakdown'     in communications referred to by police officers was
caused by background noise and broken transmissions on the "talk through"

mode.


It is difficult to calculate the precise number of police personal radios
operating on the main match channel (Channel 25), but it is clear that all
ranks of    Sergeant and above were in possession of radios together with
some    issued   to   mounted   and   dog   personnel    and    special   constables.
Certainly, there would be in excess of 100 radios operating on the match
channel, with a possibility of as many as 150.


"Talk through" mode, which enables all transmissions to be heard by those
possessing a radio, encourages simultaneous use by officers, which has the
effect of cancelling out individual transmissions.             However, depending on
the proximity of the       transmission,    it may be possible to hear a strong
signal.     It follows that strict radio discipline must be maintained in
order that only priority messages are transmitted.

Conclusion
To    have   in excess        of     100 radios         on       one     channel       for        this     semi-final
undoubtedly overloads the system.                      Many would consider that, in a closely
controlled        situation        like    a major football               match,           there        should    be     an
absolute maximum of 50 radios to each channel, which would of course mean
that additional Force contingency channels be utilised.


The    use   of     a minimum         of       two    operators          to     each        channel        should        be
considered, allowing one operator to receive and transmit while the other
performs tasks connected with transmissions.


LOUD HAILERS
The availability of loud hailers has been referred to within the Inquiry.
Access       to     a     loud        hailer          may        have         been         of         assistance         to
Superintendent          Marshall          in    the     'crush'          outside           the         Leppings        Lane
turnstiles, as evidenced by his request for tannoy announcements and the
attendance of a vehicle with a public address facility.                                          For a loud hailer
to have been instantly available to him, he would have required an officer
to have been deployed as his equipment/communications operator.                                                  This is
consistent        with the pre-determined                   arrangements             for        the    deployment        of
officers in a ground command role in public disorder situations, where
they are provided with an officer who                              is,    in effect,                  the commander's
communicator and 'runner'.


However, it must be said that the tannoy and PA announcements that were
made proved ineffective, thereby rendering the question of availability of
 a hand held loud hailer somewhat academic.

Similarly, it is difficult to see          how the availability of hand held            loud
hailers to the officers attempting to relieve the crush at the perimeter
fence in front of the Leppings Lane Terraces would have been any more
effective in the face of excessive crowd noise, certainly at least in the
initial stages of the rescue.


Nevertheless, it may be that the           judicious positioning of hand held            loud
hailers at specific points within the stadium would prove beneficial                       in
certain circumstances, particularly perhaps at points around the perimeter

of the pitch.


GENERAL COMMENT
It was unfortunate that it was decided that Chief Superintendent Duckinfield
should succeed Chief Superintendent Mole three weeks before the 1989 se m i ­
final   at      Hillsborough,    particularly      when     it    would      seem       Chief
Superintendent     Mole,   who      had   experience   of     policing      Hillsborough,
including semi-finals, was available to command the police operation.


Chief   Superintendent     Mole's     extensive   knowledge      of   the    ground,      his
familiarity with the operational           order and the other police commanders
deployed at Hillsborough would have given him a tremendous advantage in
co-ordinating the police response to the events on the day.


Chief Superintendent Duckinfield, notwithstanding his previous experience
in commanding major events, was placed in a position of overall command
not having been involved in the pre-planning of the              police     operation     and




                                             35

having    insufficient         knowledge     of    previous   incidents     and     problems    at
Hillsborough.       This could have had some effect on his lack of general
awareness, anticipation and speed of reaction.


The    parts    played    by    some    of   his   subordinates   who     had     experience    of
policing the ground, particularly Superintendent Murray who commanded the
Police Control Room, must be questioned, in the sense that it would seem
they     also    failed    to     appreciate       the   dangerous      situation     that     was
developing and to advise Chief Superintendent Duckinfield accordingly.


Assistant Chief Constable Jackson, who was present at the semi-final                            in
plain clothes and who occupied a seat in the Directors' Box, appears to be
something of a shadowy figure during the course of the day.                        Even when he
was fully aware of disaster, it does not appear that he made any positive
or purposeful contribution to the policing of the operation.                        Although not
in uniform, his rank and authority could, in my view, have been used to
greater effect.

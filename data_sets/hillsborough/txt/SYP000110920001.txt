       the W e s t     Stand         via      'C*     Gate        where       I immediately                 saw m e d i c a l         staff

       giving       attention           to a y o u t h            in the       rear     of a n a m b u l a n c e .                 There        were

       supporters          in    large' n u m b e r s             injured and           scattered about                        the    area with

       Police       Officers          and       civilians           administering                 first          aid.          The    a r e a was

       in total        c o n f u s i o n as         other         supporters          were        constantly               running             about-

       carrying        casualties               and    searching              for    friends           and       relatives.                We       were

       instructed          to    c l ear        away       for     the    ambulances              to      get     into         the    g ro u n d .

       supporters          from       t his      area.            In this        area       I sa w m a n y          supporters                 who

       were     very      upset       and angry             towards           us.     1 sa w         one      youth        face       to       face

       with     one P o l i c e w o m a n ,         and     he w a s      verbally abusing                       her      and      pointing

       his    finger       in her          face.           Th e    Policewoman              was      getting           visibly           upset

       and    so    I went       across          and       remonstrated with                     the y o u t h w h o            was      eventual

       dragged away             by    s ome      of    his        friends.          More         and more           supporters                 were

       coming       out    of    the       tunnels          and     I was        asking          them       to    l eave        the      ground

       verbally        abusing          myself         and        other       officers           was      unbelievable.                    A

supporters            out     and      tried       to    t alk      some       sense     into        the     supporters              who

were    being      abusive.               In n o r m a l       circumstances                a    lot    of       the    supporters

who    were     being         abusive         to m y s e l f        and       other     Police         Officers          would           have

been arrested               for     public         order       offences.

The    Po 1 i ce      in the        area were            all     being        accused           of   being        murderers              and

being     responsible               for    allocation               of    tickets        to      the    Liverpool

supporters.

X was     then        directed          by P o l i c e      Sergeant            2822 Kennedy                from              Division

to a c c o m p a n y    him and           other         officers          including             Police       Constable            235

area    on the          first       floor       of      the W e s t       Stand.         We w e r e         to    try and

persuade         supporters             who     were       there         to    le ave    the         ground       and    Co go           back

ascertain          if a n y       of    their        party were               missing.

The    majority          of    people         were       visibly          shocked and                readily       agreed           to    do

this.       I remained              with      PC     233 Blackham               until       it was          announced             that

the    game      h ad    been a b a n d o n e d and would                      they     leave         the    stand.           1 he

majority         of     the    people         filed        out      in s i l e n c e ,      some       thanked          us    for

being     there         and    for      everything             we    had       done,     whilst         one       or    two       were

abusive        towards         us.

As    s o o n as      the     stand       was      c l ear ed,       along       w i t h PC B l a c k h a m            I went        into

the    seating          area      and with           other       officers           conducted           a search             -for

property         with a negative                   result.           Whilst           I was      m     the       seated area              the

following          names       and      addresses           were         given      to me.

             These     two    people          stated       they    had   been       in the    seated area       above      the

             terraces        and    had       seen what         had    happened.

             I    then went        back       outside          along   with    PC    235    Blackham where        we m e t      up

             with     the    remainder             of    our   serial.        We w e r e    then   directed      into     the

             Whilst        waiting       for       the    debrief      1 heard       an    Inspector     b e h i n d me   say

             th at    he    had    been       kicked whilst            trying       to    give a   casualty     mouth      to

             mouth and        t ha t     he    had       seen another         officer       have   his   hand    kicked      away

             whilst        checking          for    a    pulse.

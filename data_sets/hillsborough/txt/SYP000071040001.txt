By approx         a . 45pm              there    seemed          to    be a s u d d e n         surge        of M o t t s       Forest

intoxicants,               were          rowdy       and    looked          like       potential           trouble         causers.

They    were      pushing                from    the       top    of     the       stand       and    their        action        was       such

that     the    people              who       were    stood       at     the       barrier          fence     overlooking              the

aged     persons,           the          situation          seemed          to     ease    slightly           after        about       10

As     the    gam e       started,           looking             across       at       the    Leppings             Lane       stand         this

appeared           to     be      full     to     capacity.              I did          not       see    any       u s u al      sudden          serge

like     a    pitch          invasion.             I wa s         then       informed             by a      colleague              t h at    a

barrier         had       collapsed             the     stands.              We    were       instructed               to     remain         in       the

line     in the           position where                    we    were       as    by       this    tiem         the      Notts       Forest

crowd.

At     this     tiem         several        of     the       Liverpool             fans       with       sma ll        children

came     across           to      the     police        line       stating             that       they      felt       things         were

getting         out       of      hand and         wanted          to    l eave         they       were       instructed              to     leave

across        the       b ac k      of    the     K o p as        there       is       no    separate            area and           there         only

way     of    leaving             wa s    through           the    Notts          Forest          fans.

When     the       first          announcement               was       made       by L i v e r p o o l s         Manager,           I together

with     a few          other        officers           from my          serial             went    into         the      Liverpool              area

advising           them        to    leave        as    it       seemed       unlikely             t h at     it was          more       likely

than     not       t ha t      the       match     would          be    postponed.                 Due      to     the      position             of

th e    area       in w h i c h          they     had       been       placed          it w as      necessary               for     them         to

leave        by w a l k i n g        through           the       Notts       Forest          fans,       and       many       of    them         were

reluctant            to      do     this    as     they          feared       for       their       ow n      safety.              The      match

was     then a n n o unced                o ver    the       tannoy          system          as    having          been       abandoned               and

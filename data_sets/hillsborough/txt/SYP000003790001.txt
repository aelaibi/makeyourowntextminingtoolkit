during       the       chat.           The       c l u b was       fairly          empty and                there       were       no     other

football          supporters                in    there       as       far    as       I am       aware.           The       four        of    us

left    about          2.20pm          (1420)        in o r d e r           to w a l k       to     the      Hillsborough

Ground»           We    went       to       the    Leppings             Lane       end       turnstiles.                 This       a r e a was

packed with around                      900-1000             people.             I was        quite          surprised             as     the

route       to    this       area was             fairly          qui e t .        We    all        arrived about                  2,40pm

(1440).           Because          of       the    amount          of       people       I c o u l d n ’t see                if    I was        in

the    right       place          to    get       into       the       ground.           I showed my                   ticket       to a

mounted          Police       Constable             who       pointed           to a set               of    turnstiles             on the

left    of       the    Leppings             Lane       end.           There       was       no     organised            queue           of

people       for       the    turnstiles                so    I j ust         joined          the       mob       of    people           and made

my    way    slowly          to    the N o . 1 t u r n s t i l e ,                       I believe            h o w e v e r it w as           the

first       stile       on the          left as          you       look       from           Leppings             L a n e . By this             t ime

I had       become       separated                from       the       other       3,

being     open.          I do       not       know who                opened       this        gate     or at w h a t         t i m e or

in f a c t    the       number       of       the          gate       itself.

A    crowd    sur ge towards                  this             gate    car r i ed me           t h r o u g h for      a good        twenty

five    yards          inside       up    to       a       concrete          ramp     that      l e ads       to the        North

g a t e , pressure            seemed          to       ease       and       I was     able      to w a 1k at m y             own     pace

again.        I would          estimate                that       more       than a       hundred          people          we re    carried

through       like       m y s e 1f .         This             ramp    I was       walking       on     l e ads       to    the     rear       of

the    North Stand and                   into          a       covered       corridor          where       the     toilets          and    tea

stands       are.        Off       this       corridor                are    the     walkways         into       the       stand

itself.           My    ticket       was       for             A block,       row 38,          seat     No.      I ’m not          sure

of.     On walking             through             the w al k w a y           and     out      into     daylight            I heard

          shout         me    and    on       looking             around          saw where        my      s eat      was.         I was

not    aware       of    any       stewards                in m y      vicinity.              I joined                      and     sat    down

The    players          were       already             out       on    the    field       and    were        j ust     kicking           off

as    I got       to m y      seat.           My       s e at     was       in the       first     block         of    the    North

Stand     nearest            the    West       Stand,                 I had a g o o d          view     of    the      terraces

where    the       Liverpool             fans          were.           After       a short       t ime       I became         aware

of a L i v e r p o o l        fan who          had             climbed       ove r    the      anti-invasion                pitch        fence

and was       speaking             to the          Liverpool                goal     keeper      pointing             back    towards

the    West       Terraces.              My    a t t e n t i o n was              then    drawn       to     the      crowd        behind

the    goal.           I was       aware       of          a    large       number       of    people        in the m i d d l e

pens    being          pushed       up a g a i n s t             the    pitch        fence.        People          were      being

pulled       up    into       the    stand             above.           The       pens    on    the     two      outsides

appeared          to    be    clearer          with             less    people.

I then       saw a Police                Constable                along       with       about     4 or       3 supporters

pulling       at       the    pitch       fence                behind       the    goal.        it w a s      d e f i n i t e l y the

fence    not       any       gate.        There                were    two    stewards          p u l l i n g at      the    gate         from

the    pen w h i c h w a s          nearest                to me.           They     appeared         to     have      been

having       s ome      difficulty.               There       were        also     quite       a number          of    f ans

climbing          o ver      the    pitch       fence.           At    that       time    I was       not    aware          of     any

persons        who      died       or w e r e     injured.

The    game       was     stopped          shortly         after       the L i v e r p o o l     fan    ha d      spoken           to

the    goal       keeper       and       by t h i s     time        all     the    team me mbers            were       off       the

pitch,

It g r a d u a l l y      became         apparent          that       people       were     i n j u r e d as      f ans      and

Police       used       advertising             boards        as      stretchers,          ferrying          injured             to     the

East    terraced             side     of    the    ground.             Ambulances          arrived          at    the       scene

after     a short            time.

I then       became          aware       that     people         were       dead.        One    person was             carried

from    behind          the    Lepping          Lane       g oa l     on a m a k e       shift    stretcher.                 His

head was          covered.            This      lad a p p e a r e d         to    be a t e e n a g e r ,         1 cannot

recall       what       he w a s     wearing          but     was      covered         by a     dark    bomber          style

jacket.           He    was    being        carried         by      six     supporters          whose       description                 I

cannot       remember,

I then       became          involved with              a young           boy who        was    sat    in the N o r t h

Stand     by                        He     believed         he      had     s e e n his    Father       being          carried

away.        H o w e v e r , he w a s        mistaken.

It a p p e a r e d      to    be    a non       stop       ferrying          of    injured across                the    pitch.              I

was    not     aware         of a n y      other      deaths          or w h o     was    injured,

I left       my    seating          position          at    approximately                5,OOpm       (1700)          after        we    had

been    requested             by a t a n n o y        announcement                to   remain     in our          seats          so

that    the       emergency          services           were        not     hindered,           I left       of my          o wn

accord       when       I saw       other       people        starting            to   leave.

The    two     who      had    been        in the       North Stand               with    me   then walked              back, to

the    car                          who     had    been       in the         West      Stand     was    waiting             for       us,

However        there         was    no     sign    of               or C a r 1.

Myself       and                     walked        back       to      the    ground       in a n a t t e m p t         to    locate

the    two     lads.          Eventually           after         speaking          with Police          Of f i cers          we       went

             The    two       of    us    then w al ke d        b ack     to    the     car a n d     joined        the     other        two.

             We    then made             our    way     to a P o l i c e       S t a t ion a n d wai t e d       for      i n f o r m a t ion.




             C a r l ’s p a r e n t s         were     contacted        and     they       came    to S h e f f i e l d .     We     d i d n ’t

             see    them,           There       was     nothing       else      to    do    so we     left     for     home,         I was

                                     Hillsborough Disaster 1989.




                              With reference to the above I report that on Saturday
        1 5 th of April 1989 I attended at Hillsborough Football Stadium in
        order to watch the F.A. Cup semi-final between Liverpool and
        Nottingham Football Clubs.

                              I was present throughout the disaster and would put
        myself forward as an eye witness to any interview by the investigating
        team from the West Midlands Force.

                              I respectfully request that this report be forwarded to
        the Chief Superintendent at Lower Lane for his information and
        attention.




                                                                Constable

                  a good deal of the operation and the build up to this

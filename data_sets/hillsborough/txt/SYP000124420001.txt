 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 Q53                            j

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS s/oPPED?

 THERE DID APPEAR TO/BE A LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLICE OUTSIDE AND

 THOSE I N S I DE .    HQ ONE SEEMED TO HAVE ASSESSED THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE

 s m w n o i T ^ R L ^ENOUGH.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1. THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES ASKING FOR TICKETS

 I THINK POLICE SHOULD DO A TICKET CHECK 200 TO 300 YDS AWAY FROM THE

 GROUND TO PREVENT ALL THOSE WITHOUT TICKETS GETTING THAT CLOSE TO

 THE GROUND.                        /

 2.    IT WAS AS BAD LAST Y e / r AND I THINK THE F .A. OR WHOEVER MADE THE

 D J ^ S I O N TO ALLOCATE LEPFINGS LANE TO LIVERPOOL MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

 THEY SHOULD HAVE ALLOCATED THE KOP TO LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE FA GAVE LIVERPOOL fNE/ WRONG END WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE SPION K O P .

 THE FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER SUPERVISED BY POLICE AND STEWARDS.              THE

 SEGREGATION FENCES WITHIN THE TERRACE SHOULD BE REMOVED TO ALLOW THE CROWD




                 EVENLY ACROSS THE TERRACE.     THE TUNNEL IN ITS PRESENT FORM IS

 DANGEROUS IT 'SHPlX-D BE BIGGER TO ALLOW BETTER ACCESS AND EXIT.            THERE WAS A

 LACK OF SIGNS INSIDE THE GROUND TO DIRECT FANS TO THE TERRACES.              THERE

 WERE ENOUGH TURNSTILES FOR THE GROUND AND THE AMOUNT OF FANS OUTSIDE.

 ALSO THEY SHOULD HAVE DELAYED THE K I C K - O F F .

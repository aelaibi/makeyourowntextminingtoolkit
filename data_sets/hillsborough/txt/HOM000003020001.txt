HILLSBORDOGH STADIUM DISASTER 151H APRIL, 1989

I have to report that I have been investigating the behaviour pattern of
Liverpool Football Club Supporters at matches played away from hone. I
have limited this enquiry to the 1987/88 and 1988/89 Football Seasons.

There have been a number of areas which I have looked at including the
behaviour of fans on the day of the disaster. I have categorised the
various enquiries and will outline the sailient points under each heading.

1.        POLICE REPORTS CONCERNING LIVERPOOL AWAY MATCHES WHERE PROBLEMS
          HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED WITH LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS

1.1       Everton versus Liverpool, the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley
          on 1 0 Mav 1986. There was a capacity crowd of 98,000. Over          ^
          1 .OOQ^'fans ~wrp        many without tickets or in possession
          or forged tickets. 25 Police Officers were injured.

1.2       Tottenham Hotspur versus Liverpool on 28 November 1987. Enquiries
          with New ScollanCT Yard Public Order Branch and having seen the Police
          Report on this match,it was declared 'all ticket' with a capacity
          crowd of 47,363. A total of 10,311 Liverpool Supporters visited
          White Hart Lane out of               Liverpool piippr»rrt-Q-r-c -aro
          locked out-^£>-fche_ ground. This group caused policing problems
          intliaf'lshop wimows were broken in TottenhamHigh Road .but they
          were eventually dispersed into an underground station.               ~

1.3       Watford versus Liverpool on -jAJ e b m a r ^ 1988. This match was __ ^
          d@5Smypr“r3TT ^cket ’ with a total crdfe attendance of 23,838
          which included 6 ,20(1 Liverpool fans. 1,500 Liverpool fans 7 some
          of whom had been drinking, arrived without tickets. Given that
          it would have presented severe policing difficulties and problems
          were the 1^ 500 fans allowed to disperse and run the town of
          Watford and frequent local p J b E c “Houses, consultations between
          Club Officials and the Match Contnander ended in a decision to
          allow tha^fans injtp^^ ^ g ffl^ a m ^ nt.

1.4       Liverpool versus Wimbledon the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley
           on 14May 1988. Again there was a capacity crowd of 98,000, 92
           f a n s ^ l B ■aC'Jested, 85 of than from Liverpool. Over 3,000 persons
           were ejected from the Stadium for possession of either forged
        f tickets or no tickets at all.- The Stadium authorities recovered
        1/1478 forged tickets. Seven Police Officers were injured. The
        I [majority of those rejected were Liverpool fans and the majority
        I lof forged tickets were presented by Liverpool supporters.
1.5       Southampton vp-rr
                          si.is-             Sc»pterrft->er 1988. This match
          wa's declared ’all ticket1. 150 Liverpool fans arrived without
          tickets. Those fans were isolatt^'outside the ground and again
          because manpower would have been soaked up by allowing the fans
          to roam Southanpton, they were allowed into the around,on payment,
          after discussions between the Match Corrmander and Club Officials.

1.6      Arsenal versus Liverpool on 9 November 1988. The Match Commanders
          repo^Ttetr«-<^®aGA.ty -crowd attendecT the match with approximately
          6,000 fans being locked out of the Stadium. The kick-off was
          delayed for 15 minutes to allow the fans to get into the ground.
          Many of the locked out fans attenpted to climb or break into the
          Stadium. Reinforcements had to be called in. Not        of the
          locked out fans were Liverpool supporters.

1.7      Southampton versus Liverpool on 12 December 1988. This match
          was also declared *M l ticketr. 750 Liverpool fans arrived at
          the ground without tickets. Many relafgcT'ar story of being unable
          to purchase a ticket from the Office at Liverpool because it had
          not been opened to sell tickets for a sufficiently long enough
>      * period. The ticketless fans were isolated and although the situation
          was tense for a while the Southanpton Football Club agreed^to
          open a turnstile and after paymentallow all the fans Into the
          ground.

1.8      Millwall versus Liverpool on 29 January 1989. The match was declared
         'all ticket', with a crowd of 23,615 of which 2,900 were Liverpool
         supporters. Several hundred Liverpool supporters attended without
         tickets and forged tickets were being sold outside the ground.
         No*~other problems were encountered.

1.9      Hull Cit^ versus Liverpool .,<%!                 . This was .an. F-A.
         Cup Round and a fjartiHtl^iy troublesome match for the Section
         CcimHnder in charge of the Liverpool fans. Forged tickets were
         in evidence and a nurrtoer of fans arrived without tickets. There
         was evidence that the majority of Liverpool fans had been drinking
         heavily. 1 Q0 tigketless fans outside the ground rushed a gate,
         when it was being opened by "Stfevs^rds to allow someone to leave
         the ground, and at the same time Liverpool fans inside the ground
         also rushed the gate and attenpted to pull it wide open. With
         the assistance of Mounted Officers the situation was eased but
         ticketless fans outside, when the turnstiles were closed, shouted
         conments to the Police Officers that if the turnstiles were not
         opened they would rip the gates off and 'nobody closed doors on
         Liverpool supporters'.

1.10     Norwich City versus, I^Ye^qpc^l oo                         . This match vras
         dec2afed' *all ticket' but information was received by the Club
         that 1 ,s23.2_ tickets a l l x ^ 5e5 , ^ yja5eBjqpe0 l:»had not been sold and
         would be returnecf*to Norwich on the team bus on the day of the
         natch. A number of Liverpool supporters arrived without tickets
         and gave varying reasons for not knowing the match was 'all ticket'
         or that they had come from areas distant from Liverpool. It was
         decided to sell the 1,272 unsold tickets returned by the
         Liverpool Club to get them into the ground. All the tickets were
         sold although it is believed some Norwich supporters also
         benefitted this way and got into the ground.

1.11    Winnbledon versus Liverpool on i Mav iq r q > This match m s declared
        'all ticket' with a capacity crowd of 14,730 of which 6,473 were
        Liverpool supporters. Enquiries with the Public Order Branch
        at New Scotland Yard reveal that Liverpool F.C. was allocated
        6,500 tickets which were sent with a request for supporters to
        be advised by means of local radio and the press that the fixture
        was an 'all ticket' one. Some 4,000 unsold tickets were returned
        to Wimbledon F.C. On the day, nearly 6,500 Liverpool supporters
        attended the game, excluding a number who entered the home supporters
        parts of the Stadium. It was clear that a large number of
        Liverpool supporters attended without tickets despite publicity
        before the match. Turnstiles were opened to facilitate those
        supporters who had come without tickets. -

1.12    Everton versus Liverpool on 20 May 1989. This was the F.A. Cup
        Final played at the Wembley Stadium, some 5 weeks after the
        Hillsborough Disaster. The report from the Section corrmander
        tends to show that Liverpool supporters had not learned frpn this
        disaster. Ticketless fans caused considerable problems for the
        Police and when they were clearing the area of those fans, bottles
        and cans were thrown at them. Just before .the end of the gams
        all gates to the Stadium were opened in preparation for the exodus.
        An equalising goal was then scored by Everton which resulted in
        an influx of fans who had been leaving and also those still around
        the ground without tickets. All managed to get into bays around
        the Stadium to watch extra time.

2   .   WITNESS STATEMENTS WHICH SHOW HOW CERTAIN LIVERPOOL FANS INTENDED
        TO GET INK) THE MATCH         -                  “

2.1     Julie Dawn SHELIfTY is a part-time barmaid who assists behind the
        bar at j           licensed premises,
                         Sheffield. From mid-day on the day of the disaster,
        she had a conversation with three to four male persons who described
        themselves as Liverpool supporters. They told her they had come
        from Liverpool on the train, had no tickets for the match but
        it was their intention to go to Hillsborough and gain entry.
        They further told her that it was easy because they had done it
        previously and there were other Liverpool fans who had come down
        with them without tickets who were going to get into the ground
        as well. They left the public house by taxi to the ground between
        2.30pm and 2.45pm.

        Garry TAYLOR who is a retired Sales Director was drinking in The
                                _________ Sheffield, some 1^ miles from
        the Hillsborough Stadium on the day of the disaster. Whilst in
        the premises he heard a conversation between three men sat nearby.
        Two of the men spoke with Liverpool accents and he assumed they
        were supporters of that club. He heard them talk about Leppings
        Lane and that they would meet up with others outside the leppings
        Lane entrance. They would organise as many other people as possible
        to cause whatever trouble they could. If enough trouble was caused
        the gates would have to be opened. Mr. TAYLOR concluded that
        this had happened before and the person doing the talking appeared
        confident that this action could be forced. More detailed evidence
        can be read in his statement.
                                  -4-

2.3   Peter Kevan MARJORAM is r\ Onnpany Director who visited The
                                   some 2 \ miles from the Hillsborough
      Stadium, on the day of the disaster. He arrived at 2.35pm to
      find numerous persons both inside and outside the public house.
      He would estimate that 25 of than were Liverpool supporters.
      He got into conversation with two of them. They did not mention
      tickets, neither did Mr. MARJORAM see them in possession of one.
      At 2.45pm he mentioned to the two that they were leaving it late
      to get to the ground and one of than replied 'Don't worry about
      that, we know either a gate will be open or opened'. Both men
      laughed at each other. The two left shortly afterwards.

2.4                      is a Quantity Surveyor who was also i n ___________
      t              J cm the date of the disaster and was joined by Mr.
      MARJORAM sometime, he says, after 2.00pm. He corroborates that
      one of the two Liverpool supporters he and Mr. MARJORAM were talking
      to said words to the effect that they were*, confident of getting
      into the ground because the gate would be open or opened. The
      manner in which this remark was made did not suggest that they
      irrttmdfcid lt> fdKeer-fencry "irrtx) -ins ypruGncII'— He GesCriBfes the Iwo’
      meir ay decent" pSRons ancTtftey- dicfliwt say that they had tickets
      for the match and he did not see than in possession of any.

2.5   Statements from the four witnesses are attached to this report
      under Appendix 'B'.


3.    SCHEDULE SHOWING EVIDENCE THAT CAN-BE GIVEN FRCM WITNESSES REGARDING
       LIVERPOOL FANS ATTENDING THE MATCH WITHOUT: TICKETS

3.1   There is arrple evidence of fans arriving at this match without
       tickets to get into the Hillsborough Ground. Attached is a schedule
       showing that 25 Police Officers have submitted reports stowing
       numerous fans without tickets, fans asking for spare tickts, fans
       asking for the tickets of those arrested, evidence of fans coming
       to the match expecting to buy tickets from'touts, evidence of
       fans having tickets snatched, evidence of seeing stubs from tickets
       being thrown back into the crowd and evidence of persons complaining
       of having their tickets stolen.

3.2   The 25 reports submitted showing this evidence appears to be only
       'the tip of the iceberg'. Further reports are still being processed
       from other officers which will no doubt contain a lot of similar
      material.

3.3   Further evidence in relation to this matter can be given by civilian
       witnesses listed under Appendix 'B'.

3.4   A schedule showing the report number, the time, location, the
       officer involved and a brief summary of what he could say is
       attached to this report under Appendix 'C'.
                                 -5-

4.    EVIDENCE OF TOE BEHAVIOUR OF FANS AT THE SEMI FINAL MATCH BETWEEN
       NORWICH AND EVERTON PLAYED AT VILLA PARK ON 15TH APRIL 1989

4.1   A statement from Chief Superintendent Mellor, the Match Commander
       at the Sard Final match played the same day between Norwich City
       and Everton at Villa Park, showing the behaviour of the fans,
       especially those supporting Everton, together with two of his
      Mounted Officers is attached.

4.2   Whilst the evidence does not have any bearing on the match played
       between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough, or the
       fans who attended the match, the Everton supporters behaviour
       at Villa Park shows a remarkable coincidence with the Liverpool
       supporters at Hillsborough which may indicate some Liverpool
       characteris tic.

4.3   Statements from the three Police Officers are attached and have
       been listed under Appendix 'D'.


5.    OBSERVATIONS AND COMMENTS

5.1   It does appear that there is a nucleus of Liverpool supporters
       (unidentified) who do travel to matches played away from Liverpool
       without tickets and cause severe policing problems. At the end
       of the day, rather than soak up Police manpower, it is felt better
       to allow them into the ground, impossible, rather than them cause
       havoc in the town, their team is playing. Whilst there is no
       direct evidence to support this, the fans do appear to know this.
       In the case at Watford where numerous ticketless fans arrived
       they did irrply that if they were not granted admission to the
       ground they would go into Watford and cause havoc.

5.2   The evidence    in the attached reports etc., has been gathered from
       material in   possession of the South Yorkshire Police. Given the
       opportunity   to read and study the many civilian statements taken
       by the West   Midlands Investigation Team, it may be that the
       evidence to   hand could be enhanced further.

5.3   Since the 1 January, 1989, theF.A. Cup match played at Hull   and
       the F.A. Cup Final played at Wembley both show a similarity in
       crowd behaviour to that displayed on the date this disaster occurred.

 RE:   LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 Attached hereto is the Football Match Summary relating to the match
 played between Watford and Liverpool at Vicarage Road, Watford on
 13 February 1988, the total crowd attendance being 23,838 this
 included 6,200 Liverpool Fans.

 Together with Superintendent HOWLEY I was responsible for policing
 this particular game. I was responsible for policing outside the
 Football Stadium. Prior to kick-off it became apparent that approx­
 imately 1,500 Liverpool supporters had arrived without tickets. The
 game, which had been declared 'All Ticket' at Police instigation, was
 well publicised prior to 13 February. The majority of all fans
 attending were in possession of tickets. Some of the 1,500 fans had
 been drinking and were somewhat noisy although I am bound to say the
 behaviour was generally good. The prevailing weather, without doubt,
 assisted the policing of the crowd and after consultation with
 Superintendent HOWLEY I decided to' hold the 1,500 supporters in the
 Cardiff Road area at the bottom of the walkway giving access to the
 Stadium. Given "that it would have presented severe policing
 difficulties and problems were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and
 run the town and frequent local public houses. After further consul­
 tation with Superintendent HOWLEY and Club Officials it was decided
 prudent to let these fans into the arena upon payment. I was aware
 that there would be sufficient room in the Stadium to accommodate
 these fans because of the shortfall on sales of tickets in Liverpool.
 I was also conscious of the fact that previously Liverpool fans had
 attempted to enter the ground by forcing open gates. The match was
 relatively trouble free there being 2 arrests of Liverpool supporters
 and 14 ejections of Liverpool supporters.

 At the match briefing officers were told of the strong possibility of
 visitors arriving without tickets and seeking access to the Football
 Stadium.

         The tactics of establishing a holding area for those non-ticket holders was a
         success and will be done at future all—ticket games where this is likely to
         prove a problem.

          A C.C.'O'


          S; r,


                      I submit this report at the request of D,I. KING of
          sjuth Yorkshire Police. Hillsborough Incident Room based at Police
          Headquarters, Sheffield, Fux. No. 0742 523243. The report has been
          requested to assist the Burris lur representing Police at the Hillsborough
          Enquiry in connection with the behaviour of Liverpool fans at other all
          tttket matches in recent years.

                         I have to report that the First Division League match
           b stween Southampton and Liverpool on Saturday, 24th September, 1900
           w *s an all ticket match and had been advertised as such. Pre match
           ii formation was that only 1,700 tickets had been Bold to Liverpool
           fins, although tho whole of the Archers Road end {capacity 4,000)
           hid been given over to their fans. Cuncern was expressed that a _
           It rge number of Liverpool fans might therefore turn up without tickots
           a Liverpool Football Club had only sold tickets to callers at their
           g: ound and not sent any tickots out by post as a postal strike was
           t< king place at the time. Plans wore therefore made in advanco
           t< ask any fans who arrived without tickets, to queue in Silverdalo
           R tad, noar to the ground so Police could identify the scale of the
           p oblem in terms of fans without tickets. Such fans were told that
           tl ere was no guarantee of them getting in. 150 of those who arrivod
          jit? thout tickets chose to queue in this fashion.

                        Near kick off time it was decided by Superintendent
             IOMPSON that an approach would be made to tho club to open a
           cfish turnstile to allow these fens access.

                          The main reasons for this wore that:

                          1.     Manpower on the day was limited to 0 P.S.U.s and
                                 tho crowd had exceeded the previous Liverpool
                                 fixtures by 3,000 on ticket sales, so it was felt
                                 that 150 fanB wandoring in the town, frustrated
                                 at not getting into the match, could have soaked
                                 up manpower, which would have been better
                                 committed at the ground.

           2,   A local couple had booked tho Church next
                to the ground in Archers Road for a wedding at
                15,30 hours in the mistaken belief that it was
                not a match day. They had phoned the Police
                3 days before requosling assistance lo avoid
                disruption of the service. The presence of 150
                frustrated fane In the area would not have bean
                a good start to married life.

           3.   It was felt that the postal strike had frustrated
                the 'all ticket1 system.

            The Club Secretary agreed to open a cash turnstile
Shortly after 15.00 hours and the fans were let in.

?            The Liverpool fans behaved well throughout the match
and there was little evidence of dmnkcness.    Five Liverpool fans
were ejocted from the ground for breaches of tho ground
regulations. Two Liverpool fans were arrested for being drunk
 md disorderly beforo the match. Two were arrested in tho ground
 or drunkeness. This is        below the averags for matches at the
 Jell during the 1988-09 season.
           I ask that this report bo Faxed to the Incident Room
>n the above number for the information of D.I. KING.

                        (a) In transit: ■      low'number of coaches attending this match underlines the
                                           residual support for Liverpool in London and the South East*
                                     . . . Crowds started to build up outside the Stadium at 6pm and

COMMENTS ON POLICING TACTICS:

Late arrival of fans estimated 30 to 40 thousand arrived after 7pm.

Radio reception on Force Radios intermittent.
                                                            A

Intelligence from TO 20 Arsenal FC and Liverpool FC indicated a crowd
of 45,000 to 50,000.

A crowd of 54,000 inside the ground and approximately 6000 locked out
was beyond the police resources employed as per grade ’B ’ matches.

The presence in Gillespie Road of a considerable number of fans before
the turnstiles opened prevented police removal vehicles operating and
therefore parked cars added to the obstruction.

Turnstiles at Gillespie Road ran out of change causing delay and further
congestion in Gillespie Road.

Fans ignored Police instruction to fora queues not enough Police present
to enforce instructions.

Kick Off delayed by me until 8pm but many of the locked out fans attempted
to climb or break into the stadium.

The only police available to police outside the ground after kick off
were Mounted Section and Dog Section until reinforcements arrived from
West Ham FC match and Commissioner’s reserve.

While Mounted Branch, Dog Section and local officers were splendid ’Aid
serials' generally seemed overwhelmed by the situation and were not as active
as one would hope.

Searching at turnstiles had to be abandoned because of crush. •

There were few problems inside the stadium during the match.

Due to late kick off and extra time match finished at 10.20pm in nil nil draw,
therefore fans only interested in getting home and the dispersal prsented
no problems.

Future Plans

Due to Arsenal's successful season and Tottenham’s failures crowds are larger
than expected at Highbury therefore policing levels are to be reviewed.

For evening matches Commissioner’s regulations will have to be 3 hours before
kick off instead of 2 hours to enable vehicles to be removed before crowds
arrive.

Turnstiles will be opened earlier and Arsenal are to supply a PA S y s t e m into
.Gillespie Road to assist in directing fans to correct queues.

More Barriers will be used in Gillespie Road to operate queues.

           For the Attention of Chief Superintendent T ..7.w a i n


           Dear Sir,


                                        Re:    Letter dated 7th June 1989

                     On Saturday 12th December 1988, I was on duty in uniform as the
           Superintendent in charge of the First Division Football League match between
           Southampton and Liverpool at the Dell, Southampton; kick off 1500 hours.

                      The match was an ’all ticket' match in that entry to the ground for
           Liverpool fans would only bo allowed if they arrived with a ticket already
           purchased.

                     At 1345 hours it became obvious that a large number of fans
           supporting Liverpool did not have tickets.

                     Our strict and rigid policy at the Doll has always been that fans
           who arrive without tickets will not be allowed entry and that the Club will
           not open a turnstile.

                     However, on this occasion there were about 750 Liverpool fans
           without tickets. Many related a story of being unable to purchase a ticket
           from the office at Liverpool because it had not been opened to sell tickets
           for a sufficiently long enough period.

                     Therefore, I got all 750 into an orderly queue and Southampton
           Football Club opened a turnstile and charged them all £5 per head entry
           instead of tne usual £3.BO.

                     The situation was extremely tense for a while and we had to use much
           tact and good humour to avoid a situation of serious disorder.

                    We were helped by the fact that we still had room inside for those
          750. Had that not been so then controlling those locked out would have been a
          major problem.

                                              Y^u^s faithfully,

8.   COM M ENTS ON POLICING TACTICS
     i.e. Escorts, Turnstile Searches, Control of Licensing Laws, etc:

     All the Liverpool Coaches attended the meeting point at lower Bridge as' arranged. They
     were escorted to the ground without any incidents. Several hundred Liverpool Supporters
     from the London Area attended without tickets. An unknown male obviously "from Liverpool
     was selling forged tickets in the car park for £15* Several persons obtained entry to
     the ground with these tickets but several were noticed at the.turnstiles and the holders
     refused entry* The seller was not located* Apart from the supporters who attended by
     Coach, the rest arrived via service trains and by their own means* In the main, they
     were well behaved* Because of the position of the Turnstiles i.e. only at each end of the
     ground, the main problems were getting all the Millwall supporters into the ground before
     the start. Many arrived late the worse for drink. The game took place with only minor
     incidents. Considering Millwall were well beaten, not too much was thrown onto the pitch.
     Some damage was caused inside the ground when Millwall supporters forced their way out
     into the car park. Lack of lighting in the Car Park was again the main problem together
     with all the debris lying about. The Liverpool Supporters who had attended by train
     were escorted to the railway station and seen off to London without any problems. To lool
     back on the day, a total of 32 persons were injured. The Dog Section suffered the most,
     with Seven Officers injured One with serious back injuries. Following many games without
     any disorder, this one game showed that the Hooligan element is still present waiting to
     strike. The main targers being visiting supporters, their coaches and Police Officers.
     The Chief Superintendent from Liverpool attended the fixture                 as an observer together
     with Inspector CLOW the F.L.O. $nd a Sergeant* We were unable to offer them any decent
     hospitality but they seemed to understand. I think they also appreciated the problems in
     Psliceing First Division fixtures with a Third Division ground surrounded by waste land*

    HULL CITY V LIVERPOOL. SATURDAY 18.2.89
    F A COP 5th ROUND MATCH - VENUE Bo Gt HFe KRY
    PARK, HULL, KICK OFF 1500 HOURS

    Further to the general report sent on the 8 June 19$9 with regard to
    a summary of the day’s events, I submit my observations as to the
    conduct of Liverpool supporters at the turnstiles aithe North East
    corner of Boothferry Park, Hull which are used by atfaysupporters
    wishing to enter the ground.

    I was the Sector Commander responsible for the Nortft East turnstiles
    and the two designated areas allocated to Liverpool:supporters,
    these being the North Stand and the enclosure on th£ northend of the
    East Stand which areconnectedby a large gateclose to theperimeter
    wall of the playing area, allowing free access to arid from the two
    areas.                                              I

    Prior to the match I was engaged outside the turnstiles, all of which
    were open, admitting Liverpool supporters upon production of a natch
    ticket (this being an all ticket match).

    Forged Tickets                                     j
                                                        i
    It was discovered that many fans had several batche^ of tickets all
    bearing the same serial number, there being severaljdifferent numbers
    used.   Some of the tickets appeared to have been pointed and others
    were poor quality photocopies, all being of a similar colour to the
    genuine tickets (yellowish).   The fans stated they!had bought them
    close to the ground and in Liverpool from touts.   A r r e s ts of the
    sellers were made by officers other than my Sector itaff.
                                                       iI
    Offers of Cash

    I was approached, as were my staff, by Liverpool faijis with £10 or
    £20 notes held in their hands asking if we could possibly get them
    into the ground.   They were informed this was not possible and
    several made attempts to several different officers*

    Behaviour of FSns

    The general behaviour of the fans at the turnstilesjwas peaceful but
    it was evident that the majority of the Liverpool fins had been
    drinking intoxicants heavily.



                                                        I

  The fans formed up at the turnstiles and were marshalled into orderly
  lines with officers carrying out good hearted searches.

  I was informed by Stewards from inside the ground tljiat several
  fans had jumped over or crawled under the turnstile land entered
  the North Stand.

  There are 2 wire meshed gates between the turnstile* and fans who
  had entered the ground were passing their retained ijialf of the
  tickets to fans outside who tried to gain entry alleging they had
  lost the other part of the ticket or had it snatched from them.

  The crowd were physically pushed back from these gates at which
  point the fans inside crumpled up their retained pa#t of the ticket
  and threw them out of the ground for fans outside t<j> pick up.

  Then, shortly before the kick off time, I had my baik to the wire gates
  observing about 100 fans who were without tickets aijid had gathered
  close to the turnstiles.
                                                       i

  From their conversation they were of the opinion th & t we would let
  them in the ground shortly after kick off.   They w4re informed this
  was not to be the course of action we would take and they would not
  be admitted without tickets.   From the replies I farmed the opinion
  that this was an expected course of action and had happened at other
  grounds.                                            |
                                                      |
  These fans then started to rush towards me at whichjpoint I noticed the
  gate had been opened by a Steward to allow someone to leave the ground.

  Fans from inside rushed to the gate attempting to pijtll the gate wide
  open and appeared to be trying to lift it off the hinges which they
  could not do because of restraining pins through thi hinges.

  A short struggle ensued and with the help of Mounted Officers fans
  were bodily thrown and pushed from the gate and we Managed to re-
  secure the gate.   Prompt action by my staff and Club Stewards
  prevented the gate from being fully opened and only la small number
  of non-ticket holders entered the ground and ran into the crowd
  knocking fans out of the way in their efforts to mingle with the
  standing crowd.   I instructed my officers not to pursue these
  fans.

  After this the Mounted Section pushed all fans without tickets onto
  the car park.   I then lined officers from the Dog Section with their
  dogs on leads across the front of the turnstiles and the Mounted
  Section allocated me two officers, one to each wirejgate between
  the turnstiles to preserve a sterile area.   After all fans with
  tickets had entered, the turnstiles started to clos^, at this
  point about 30 fans in the over 30 age group staggered, they had
  obviously consumed a lot of drink and started to shd>ut comments
  to the effect that if the turnstiles were not opened they would
  rip the gates off and nobody closed doors on Liverpool supporters.

      At this time I only had two officers outside the ground.   We calmed
      them down, checked their tickets and they entered by a turnstile.

      During the match I received a report that due to attempts to reach
      in and steal stock from the refreshment hut it had been closed and
      fans in the North Stand round the hut were startir g to damage it.

     I requested fans to back off from the hut so that my officers could
     supervise an orderly purchase of refreshments and the hut would re­
     open.   Despite several requests there was no movement even though
     there were areas away from the hut.   I therefore used uniform
     officers who in the end had to bodily fight their way into the
     crowd to prevent fans banging and pulling at the * ooden end of the
     hut.   After a bitter struggle we managed to bodilly force them away
     and preserve a sterile area around the refreshment hut.    At no
     time did any of the fans assist in clearing the ar ea, they acting
     in a mindless way pushing towards the hut.

     For the rest of the match officers physically retained a small
     sterile area and supervised sales.                !

     Holdback after the Final Whistle

     It is the policy of the Humberside Force to allow home supporters to
     leave the ground and holdback the away supporters to prevent any
     confrontation on the car park or around the ground

     This was the case of this date, announcements were made over the
     public address system to this effect.

     The holdback is achieved by a cordon of uniformed officers across the
     entranceway from the two areas.    After a short tito
                                                         :e X could see the
     fans at the back pushing the fans in front of there forward and
     pressure started to build up at the front.   Verbal requests were
     made to fans at the back to ease back and stop pushing,this was
     totally ignored arid they just pushed all the more prom theback.

     It was obvious to roe that fans at the front were bjeing crushed and
     there was a danger of them being seriously injured along with police
     officers engaged on the holdback.

     I instructed my officers to ease back and allow tihie fans to leave in
     an orderly manner.   As we started to move back a large cheer went
     up from the away supporters and a big surge forwa;r i broke through the
     cordon.   The fans then rushed out in an uncontro.11ed manner, best
     described as a herd of wild horses knocking their ?wn supporters out
     of the way.   My staff were unable to prevent this because of weight
     of numbers against us.

     At no time was any request by myself or my officers willingly followed
     and various degrees of force had to be employed to achieve our
     requests.

           "I was the officcr in charge~of the policing of the Norwich City
       Football Club versus Liverpool Football Club football match at Carrow
       Road, Norwich on Saturday, 1st April, 1989.

            It is usual procedure to categorise football matches as of high,
       medium or low priority In our pre-season planning. This match had been
       categorised as high priority even before the result became of greater
       significance in the Division One Championship Competition. The Carrow
       Road ground capacity is 26,81,2 and for this reason it was also decided
       that the match would have to be all ticket, a fact which would be well
       publicised in advance.

             Carrow Road offers limited options for the acconmodation of
        visiting supporters and the total available space, taking into account
        the need for segregation and accommodating home club members, is 5,000.

             There is terracing behind both goals at the football ground. Hie
        River End terracing is part of a 51% membership scheme and, therefore,
        always occupied by home fans. The Barclay Stand terracing is divided
        into 4 enclosures to limit lateral and forward movement and segregate
        opposing factions. The pens are numbered 1 to 4, pens 1 and 2 are
        always occupied by home fans, pen 3 at medium and low priority matches
        remains empty and pen 4 is for visiting supporters. In addition there
        is another area of terracing, the Triangle, which faces obliquely across
        the pitch and is adjacent to pen 4 and seating in blocks F, G and II
        normally taken up by visiting supporters. Pens 3, 4, the Triangle and
        blocks F, G and il were allocated to Liverpool supporters for this match.
        A,800 tickets were sent to Liverpool for sale in advance.

             Access to the visitors enclosures is through turnstiles at the
        rear of the Barclay Stand which are completely Independent of the
        access points available for home supporters. The rear of the Barclay
        Stand borders the main A.47 Norwich to Great Yarmouth trunk road.

                                                                   Cont'd      /

            was obvious, owing to Liverpool's recent success that there
    would be a large, if not capacity, crowd for this match. Local interest

              i            °f ?ny match durln8 the season, This level was 313 officers
    including Special Constables.

    n i u rt1 p ursday, 30th March, 1989, I saw the Norwich City Football
                           **ert CHASE, at the football ground; He told me
            c et sales for the match were not selling ag well as expected in
   Liverpool. lie had been told that 1,272 tickets would be returned and
   would be brought to Norwich on the club coach on Saturday. Mr. CHASE
                !??t 1)611 ?,now 1x2 allocated to home fans as pen 4, the Triangle
        tI!?,s?a4 n8 c°uld accommodate the reduced away support. 1 told him
                 i            t0 fc?k® that decision in the light of experience
   wmch showed that Liverpool always attracted considerable national
   support. The probability being that many people would attend who either
   could not obtain tickets because they were only on sale at Liverpool or
   unaware that the match was in fact designated as all ticket. I
   suggested that the decision be delayed until the morning of the match
   end I would then consider the situation with regard to pen 3, although
   because of access and egress to this enclosure for home fans it was
   most likely that the space would still be allocated to Liverpool
   supporters.

        On Saturday, 1st April, 1989, there was a significant crowd
   assembling outside the Carrow Road Football Ground     by midday. Almost
   all were Liverpool supporters and the majority had     tickets. By 1300
   hours there was a considerable crowd gathered, a number of whom did not
   have tickets. Many said they were not aware it was an all ticket match
   and others that they could not obtain tickets because they came from
   areas distant from Liverpool. I decided, therefore, to open 2
   turnstiles and sell the returned tickets, after agreement with the Club
   Uiairman, to Liverpool supporters for access to pen 3. All the
   tickets were sold in this fashion and there is no doubt that some home
   supporters benefitted in this way. They were, however, met by officers
   just inside the ground who directed them to accommodation reserved for
   home supporters. The visiting fans were quite well behaved and formed
   orderly and quiet queues outside the ground. They did not arrive late
   and all supporters were in the ground by 1500 hours.
         .


     j      visiting fans were quite boisterous, generally good humoured
   and totally partisan in their support for their team to the exclusion                  j

            evidence. The locel public houses were quite empty*

            of the toilet window by the C.C.T.V, but on the rerun of the video after the
            match it was not clear that the arrested person ( though clearly involved in the
            damage with another person ) committed the offence. He wasreleased without
            charge. Two other arrests in the home end one for threateningbehaviour and
            one for drunk and disorderly a Chelsea supporter*

                  Subject   F.A. CUP FINAL   -   20 MAY, 1989.

JfeaBCK»e&fciab&QnB{XKXiraa<

I am a Chief Inspector in the Metropolitan Police, attached to Wembley Division.
 My duties include the policing of events at Wembley Stadiun and T have been doing
this in my present rank since January, 1987.

The Hillsborough tragedy, after the initial shock, gave me hope for the future.
This hope was that the behaviour of fans in Leppings Lane, which I recognise as
a not unknown tactic at Wembley, would now cease - the danger being acknowledged
by those who indulge in such acts. ^

On the 20 May I was in charge of the concourse at Wembley Stadium frcm the Royal
Tunnel round Westwards to Turnstile 'K1. This area has two groups of turnstiles.
•F* and 'G1, which are approached by flights of steps and are relatively safe from
crushing.   It also has three groups of turnstiles, *H', 1J ' and 'K', approached
by level ground and which are liable to crushing problems.    The stadium offices
are close to 'H', 'J* and 'K' and likewise on level ground.

I saw the first Liverpol supporters on my way into Wembley at Stanmore Broadway,
some six miles frcm the stadium, where a number were sitting on the pavement drinking
cans of beer or lager, at about 9.30 a.m.

The        to Wembley, the more        fans I saw who were drinking in      the street,    often
carrying more cans with them.

I arrived at Werrbley Stadium at about 10.30 a.m. and saw that a large nunber of
fans were already on the complex, perhaps as many as 10,000.    Again, many of them
had cans of drink, i.e. beer or lager with them. I was dismayed to find that many
of those present did not have     tickets for the game. My advice to them to leave
the area went for the most part, unheeded.
On inspecting the area I found that at Turnstile 'H' a small section of
fencing, secured by scaffold clips, had been slackened so that a signifi­
cant breach of the fence could be made, giving* access to the circulating
corridor.   From the enquiries I made it appeared that this hod been done
by fans during the night, no doubt intending to apply pressure at the
right moment to gain,entry to the Stadium.

Information was passed to officers under my conmand by an unidentified
Liverpool police officer, that he had heard fans planning to rush the
'H', 'J* and ‘K* turnstiles.    This confirmed my own view that these were
the most vulnerable areas and therefore the most likely to be attacked.

As time progressed, I noticed that there were more people in that area
suffering the ill effects of alcohol and tension was beginning to increase.
This culminated in a number of fights at the 'pinch point', the narrowest
point of the concourse, outside the Stadium Offices.       The fights were
caused apparently by tlie tsale of tickets by *touts'. Although well known
touts were not evident, there seemed to be a number of people selling
one or tvro tickets. The fans were keen to attack such people and yet
also to buy the tickets at inflated prices.

By 12.30pm, the crowd was building up generally, but especially so outside
turnstiles 'H'# , J t and ’K*.   Because this area is confined, l had to
put in a cordon of police horses and foot police between the T.V. compound
and turnstile 'H' to prevent the danger of crushing.

Outside of the cordon, there were more outbreaks of disorder among fans
who had been drinking and I personally received a blow to the head whilst
assisting one of iny officers in making an arrest.

The turnstiles were- late in opening because a lorry was still carrying
out some .-work in the circulating c o r r i d o r . This Jarry could only «akc
an exit through a gate at the side of turnstile 'X'.            it did this just
before 1.15pm but caused quite severe problems with crowds waiting for
the turnstiles to open.    The gate stuck when it was o n l y half open and
a lot of effort was required to prevent a large number of illegal entries
to the Stadium.

Once the turnstiles opened, 1 expected the crowd to ease considerably
and to reduce the cocrplaints of crushing I was getting from people in
the crowd.   That people were obviously pressing forward and causing a
crush in these circumstances, in the wake of Hillsborough, amazed ire.
I was more amazed, however, to find _that the crush was not diminishing
as I expected -it to at turnstile 'H*. This was because of ticket less
fans forcing their way through the turnstiles with ticket-holders and
having to be removed through exit gates, slowing down the whole of the
operation.

Whilst a lot of illegal entrants were removed, I believe an appreciable
nunber were not.   The rrost intense crush was at turnstile 'H', which had
had a fence weakened during the night, and in my mind must have been pre­
planned by a large number of fans hoping to breach the security of the
fence, if they were unable to get in through the turnstiles.

By 2.30cm. the number of people going in through turnstiles 'H\ 'J' and
'K' had reduced greatly.   This had been achieved by having tickets for
turnstile 'H* accepted at 'J* and *K* turnstiles and filtering people
       at the cordon and allowing only those with tickets through. Many people
 *     were reluctant to produce tickets, fearing that they might be snatched
       from them.      They took the trouble to secrete than in shoes, socks and
       other places,          made it difficult when production was demanded. The
       m u t e r of street robberies for this event are much hi^ier than for similar
       events.

16.    There were now boob 300 people on the outside of the cordon who did not
       have tickets but were still -anxious to find a way into the.Stadium. Rather
       *than leaving t*** <y»r ^ n as a fixed target, 1 decided to catmence a sweep
       of       concourse,.           these fans towards the Royal Tunnel and away
       ■from the vulnerable area.

17.    When the sweep front the other side, turnstiles ■ ’A ’ to *E*, reached the
        Royal Tunnel, the crowd which mattered about* 500 began throwing bottles
        and       art police. A nurrber of arrests were made during the completion
        of the sweep.

18.    Despite tte sweep, small pockets of ticketless fans returned to the concourse
        during the progress of the garre. At about half time, there was a determined
        attenpt by about 200 to gain entry through gates and windows at the stadium
        Offices and turnstile »H’. This was successfully repelled.

19.    Just before the end of the game, all gates to the Stadium were cpenea
        in preparation for the exodus. At this stage, Liverpool were in the lead
        and fans were starting to leave.     However, the equalising goal was then
        scored by Everton. This resulted in an influx of fans who had been leaving
        and       those still around the ground without tickets. All managed to
        get into bays around tte Stadium to watch extra time.

20.    The number of arrests, 76 on the outside of the Stadium, does
       reflect the magnitude of misbehaviour by drunken fans. Father a balance
        is struck in deciding whether arrests can be made without seriously reducing
        the nuntoer of police left to control the crowd.

21 .   Cn this occasion.         w s a rajsort befca®. the ^ i ^ l and E^rton
        supporters.   Had this not been the case, I believe much greater disorder
        would have emanated from the section of fans determinedi to gain entrance
        to the Stadium, regardless of the cost in any terms, to others.

22 .   Having described a lot of bad behavior cn the part o f sane toe.             *
        say that the majority were well behaved and concerned for the                   ty
        themselves and others.

             We     opened          the    pub       at    about       11.30am        <1130)             and    business             was    quiet.


             At     1E    midday          (1200)          about    3    or    4    Liverpool              supporters                came    into       the


             pub,        they       ordered          their      drinks        and     stood          by    the       bar,       talking       to       me,

             they        informed          me    that       they       were       Liverpool              supporters             and    they       all       had


             Liverpool              accents,          they      were        dressed        casually             not       in    the    Liverpool


             colours           although          I    think       one       was    wearing           a    Liverpool             scarf.


             Whilst        they          were    in       the   pub     they       were       well        behaved          in    good       humour       and

             could        be    described             as    merry       although           they          were    not      drunk.

             They        were       polite       and       talked       to    me    on    a     number          of    occasions,             in
                                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                                      S53

between          serving          customers                   from       the       conversation                   I       had       with    them       I


ascertained             that       they          had          travelled             on       the       train          from          Liverpool          to


Sheffield          with       other          Liverpool                   supporters                and          although             none       of    them


had    tickets          for       the       semi          final          match          it    was       their             intention             to    go    to


the    Hillsborough                ground             and       gain          entry          into       the       stadium.


They    even       asked          me    to       go       to    the          ground          with       them          and       I    said       that       they


would       not    get       in    without                a    ticket,             but       although             I       cannot       exactly


remember          how    they          said       that          they          were       going          to       get       in       they    said       it

would       be    easy       as    they          had          done       it       before          and       there          were       other


Liverpool          fans       who       had       come          down          with       them,          without             tickets             who    were


going       to    get    in       the       ground             as       well.

Also    in       the    pub       at    the       same          time          there          were       a       small       group          of


Nottingham             Forest          fans       but          they          did    not       have          any       conversation                   with


myself       or    the       Liverpool                fans          and       these          people             left       the       pub    at       about


1.30pm       (1330).


At    about       1.45pm          (1345)          I was             asked          by    the       Liverpool                supporters                to


call    them       a    taxi       to       take          them          to    the       Hillsborough                      football          stadium,


the    first       two       occasions                I       tried          to    phone          for       a    taxi       the       line       was


engaged.           I    eventually                got          through             at    about          1.55pm             (1355)          and       booked
        *


a    taxi    for       them       with       a    company                called          City          Cars,          I    think,          this       taxi

eventually             arrived          at       about          £.30          (1430)          to       £.45       (1445)            and     took       the


L iver pool        supporters                to       the       ground.

During       their       stay          at    the          pub       I    am       unable          to    say       exactly             how       much       they

consumed          in    the       way       of    alcoholic                   drinks,             but       they          were       drinking


steadily          all    the       time          they          were          there.

The    group       of    Liverpool                supporters                      were       aged       in       their          mid    twenties,


well    presented             in       casual             dress.              I    had       no    doubt          to       believe          that       what


they    told       me    about          not       having                tickets          was       not          true.


I    left    the       pub    at       about          4.30pm             (1630)          that          day      and        made       my    way       home.

                                   is       situated                about          five       miles             from       the      Hillsborough

 supporters                  and        traffic           was    light.              I     saw    that         the       Police              had           blocked

 about           50     policemen           in           that    area.


 H a v i nq       1 1me       un       hand— befnre              meeting             my     friends,            I    stopped                 at       the

 the        pub       and         ordered       a half pint                of     lager,          and      sat       down              in     the              bar

 ioung.


 I   sat         just        to    the     right           of    the       main       entrance.                There           were


approximately                      fifteen           people           in    the       pub.         The     room          has           ’b a y s '          around


 its        circumference                  and I          sat    at        the    end       of    one      of       the        'bays’                 nearest


the         entrance,               with    my back             to    the        next       ’b a y * .     Sitting                 behind                  me        were


three         men,          who     were    already                  there       when        I   arrived.


After         a       few    minutes            1    became           aware          of    their         conversation.                            I    cannot


now        remember               the    exact           words,         but      I    gathered            first          of     all          that              they


were        football               supporters,                  intending             to    go    to      the       semi-final                        at

Hi 11sborough.


As     I    went        to        sit    down        I    had        noticed          that       these         three          men        were              as

3.         Mid     twenties,              hair           light       brown        and       cut     ear        length,             wearing                     a


tweed        sports           jacket.                I    cannot        describe              this       man        as    well           as       the

others           as     he    sat        farthest              away     from         me.


As     I    listened              to     this       conversation,                    1     heard       this         older          man        (no.                 1)


talking            to       the    others,               saying       that        they       should            not       worry           about                 not
                                                                                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                                                                                   S45

having          tickets.                 They    would          meet       up       with       "the       others"             outside


Leppings             Lane       entrance.              They          would          organise             as    many       people             as


possible             to    cause          whatever          trouble             they          could.           If       enough          trouble          was

caused          the       gates          would    have          to    be       opened.              I    gathered             that       this          had


happened             before,             and    this       man       seemed          confident                that       this          action          could


be    forced.


The    sandy          haired             man    (no.       2)       asked       how       the       "others"             would          know       to


meet       up    at       the    right          time.       (No.          1)    The       other          man    said          if       they       got


there       for       about          2.15pm       (1415)             he    knew          most       of    the       other          lads       and       they


could       quickly             be       got    organised.                 He       said       " W e ’ ve      got       to    get       as       close


to    the       turnstiles                as    possible."                 He       said       when       the       gate       was       opened,


they       would          force          their    way       through             to       "the       back       of       the    goal".

At    this       point          one       of    the    three          men       noticed             I    was    listening,                   and       they


glared          at    me    in       an    unfriendly                way.I          hurriedly             drank               the       remainder


of    my    drink          and       left       the    pub.          The        time          would       then          be a b o u t         12.20pm


(1220 ).

I    was    in       the    pub          for    about       t e n to       fifteen             minutes.                   I was        able        to    see


these       men       as    I    walked          from       the bar             to       my     seat,         and       as I       stood          up    to


leave.


I    know       that       these          men    were       Liverpool                supporters                because             nos.       2    and       3


had    Liverpool                accents.              No.       1    had       an    East       M i d l a n d s / N o t t i rig h a m s h i r e


accident.                 They       spoke       of    the          Leppings             Lane       end       arrangements                   as    though


they       were       well       aware          that       this       was       their          t e a m ’s      end       of    the       ground.

I    did    not       place          too       much    importance                   on    the       conversation                   I    had       heard,


and    went          to    play          golf.        On    my       way       home       in    the       car       I    heard          on    the


radio       that          there          had    been       an       incident             at    the       semi-final,                   and


thereafter                the    conversation                   became          more          significant                to    me.           The


course          of    the       public          hearings             of    the       enquiry             currently             being


conducted             by    Justice             Taylor,             prompted             me    to       tell    this          to       the    Police.


I    must       say       that       I    gained       the          impression                that       the    Police             were       being
                                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                                           S45

             unfairly       blamed      for    this    course     of    events.


             On    the    day   after    the    Hillsborough           tragedy,       I    discussed        with      a   golfing

             friend,                      , what       I   had   heard    in    the       pub    on   the   previous        day.

             He    suggested      I   tell     the    Police     about    it,    but       I    did   not   do   so

             immediately.


                                                                                                       G.   TAYLOR        SIGNED

in    the       offside                lane.        1    could          see       the       vehicle             clearly             in       the       wing

mirror          and          it       was    travelling                at    high       speed             with       the       driver             apparently


unaware             that          the       lights       had       changed             to    red          against          him.           The          vehicle


was    within                50       yds    of    the       crossing             when       it          began       to    brake             suddenly.

There       was          no       sc r e a c h i n g     of       tyres       but       the          vehicle          dipped             considerably


onto       the          front          suspension             and       came       to       an       abrupt          halt       at       the       side       of


my    van       in       the          offise       lane.           At       one    point             I    was    extremely                worried


that       it       would             not    be    able       to       stop       in    time             and    put       out       my       hand       to    try


and    attract                   the    attention             of       the    two       pedestrians                   shouting                to       them       to


stop       where             they       were.

After       the          vehicle             had    stopped             they       managed                to    cross          the       carriageway


and    I    looked                down       from       the       cab       into       the       vehicle.                 It    was       a       dark       grey


coloured                family          saloon          either          an    Escort             or       Montego          and       contained                5

mates,          2       in       the    front       and       three          in    the       rear.              They       all       appeared                to    be


dressed             smartly             in    casual          clothing             with          no       apiparent            football                favours


or    clothing                   on    them.        However             I    did       see       what          appeared             to       be    red

scarves             in       the       vehicle.              All       the    occupants                   except          for       the       driver          were


drinking                what          appeared          to    be       Heineken             lager          from       green          Heineken


cans.           The          driver          was    slightly                obscurred                from       my    view          by       the       roof       of


the    vehi c l e .

As    soon          as       I    looked          down       the       front       seat          passenger                seemed             to    take


offence             and          began       shouting             numerous             swear             words       at    me.           I    could          not


hear       what          he       was       saying       due       to       the    window                being       closed          but          it    was


easy       to       lip          read       words       such       as       "Fuck       off".              I    began          to    wind          my       window


down       to       say          something          to       him       but    the       lights             changed             to    green             and    the

vehicle             set          off    at    speed          pulling          away          from          us    quite          quickly.                 I    was
                                                                                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                                                                                         S48

        very    annoyed                 with        the          occupants                of        the       vehicle              and    it    was        obvious             to


    me     that           they          had        been          drinking                heavily              and           displayed          an        aggressive

    attitude               towards             myself                 and


    I     continued                 our       journey,                  dropping


                                                                                               I    then           returned              to

    where        I    then              called           into          the       Pheasant                 Public             House        on    Jaw       Bone        Hill.


    On    my     arrival                 there           I       saw       numerous                people              both     inside          and       outside             of


    the        pub.           These           people              were          clearly             not        regulars             at        the    pub    and          due

    to    their           accents              I    took              it     that         they       were              Liverpool              supporters              on


    route        to       the       Semi           Final              at    Hillsborough.                              It    was    2.35pm           (1435)          when           I


    arrived           at       the           Pheasant                 public             house       and           I    would       estimate              that       there

    were       25     Liverpool                    supporters                    present.


    I    entered              the       bar        of    the           pub      and           saw    two           colleagues             drinking              at       the


                                                                                                     I        joined          them       and                bought             me

a        pint.            I    then          became              aware          of       two        men        behind          me    who       were        drinking


    shorts.               From          their           accents              it      was        obvious                 they       were       Liverpudlians


and        I    began              to    talk           and           joke      with          them.             The          time    was       now        2.45pm


    (1445)          and        I    said           to    them              something                to    the           effect       that       they        were


leaving               late          to       get        to       the       ground             for        the       3pm        (1500)          kick       off.


One        o?    the          two        men        then          said          to       me     "Don't             worry        about          that,        we       know

either           a    gate              will        be       open          or     opened".                    At       this,        both       men       laughed           to


each           other.              This        statement                     struck            me        as    being           very       strange:               I    was


puzzled              as       to        how    they              could          be       so    sure           that          they    would           find    a        gate

or       gates        open              at    such           a    late          time.              Neither              men    made           any    mention             of     a


ticket           or       showed              me    a        ticket.                 I    have       attended                 numerous              football


matches              at       Hillsborough                        and        other            grounds              and       the    statement              from          the


man       made        me       wonder              how           he    could             be    so    sure              that    they        would          find       a


gate       open           at       that        late              time.          After           my        initial             thoughts              on    the    matter


I       dismissed              it       from        my           mind       and          continued                 drinking          with           my

colleagues.                        The        two       men           then       left          the        pub          at    2.45pm           (1445).           As       they
                                                                                                                                             S48

               left    they       shook    the       hands       of                                    It    was       apparent          to       me


               that                                  had    also          been   speaking        to    the       two       men    prior       to       my
  I
               ar r i va 1 .


               Following          the    news    reports          of       the   disaster        and    circumstances                   of    it,
  I
               the    statement          made    by       the    Liverpudlians             in    the    Pheasant             Public          House


  I            the    day      before     came       to    mind       again.        It    again       struck          me    as    being       a


               very    strange          statement          from       a    supporter       attending             a    match       at    such       a

  I
               late    time.        It    became          apparent          from    the    news       that       a    gate       at    the


               ground       had    been    opened          to    allow       late    comers       into       the       ground          and    I
 I
               conjectured          that       the    statement             made    by    the   man     and          the    opening          of    the


 I             gate    was      connected.            It    was       for    this    reason       I    contacted             the       Police

               and    reported          what    this       man    had       said    to    me    prior       to       attending          the       match.

               During             the    morning       of    Saturday       15    April          1989       (150489)      I   was   working

               at     the         above    development             until    approximately                   12.30pm      (1230)     when      I


I              left          and    visited       the                                                       which   is    situate       at    the


               junction             of                               and    the    main          road       leading      to

I                                            I    had       arranged       tq) m e e t      a    friend       called                              at


               the       public          house,

I
               When          I    arrived    at       the    public       house    I     saw         the    landlord,

I                                       standing       at    the    entrance       and          he    was    obviously        vetting


               people             before    he    allowed          them    access        to      the       premises.
I
               I    was          aware    that    a    semi-final          football             match       was   being       played    later
                                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                                  S47

 that       day        at    the        Hillsborough                  Stadium             and    the


 is    positioned                  on       the        main     road       leading           from      Sheffield,               over        the


 Pennines,              to    Manchester                  and        the    North          West     of      the    country.                 This


 public           house       is        regularly               frequented,                on    match       days,         by    football

 supporters.


 I    went      outside             the           public        house       and       I   would        estimate          that         about           80

 persons          were        within               the    bar        area,       a    mixture          of   football             supporters

 and       local        people.


 I    easily           ascertained                  that       the     football             supporters            were          from       Liverpool

as     I    could           tell        by       their     accents.


These        people           were           behaving           in     an       orderly          manner        and     there          was        no

trouble.

The        premises           were           very        full    and        I was         subsequently               joined           by    my

f r iend                                           We     had    a     couple          of    drinks         and      due     to       the


                                                  we     decided        to      visit        the

which        is    situated                  on                                                                   and      is     a    short

distance           away        from           the                               public           house.          The    reason             we    chose

that       public           house            is    due     to    it    being          located          on    a    quiet         side        road       off

the    main        highway              and        we    assumed            that      football           supporters               may       not       have

found       it.


                            and     myself              arrived        at       the                         public         house           at    about

1.15pm          (1315)        and           we     discovered              that       these        premises            were      also           being


used       by     Liverpool                 football            supporters.                  The    premises            consist             of    S


rooms,          the     loung           bar        which        is    comfortably                furnished             and      the        public


bar    which           is    used           for        games     etc.           Outside          the     premises            there          is    a


terraced/paved                    area            where       benches           and       seats     are      used       by      customers


wishing           to    remain              outside.             The       terraced             area     was      busy       and      I     quickly


ascertained                 that        a    large        number           of    the        people       outside         were         Liverpool

football           supporters.


We    entered           the       premises               via     the       front          door     and      turned         right          into        the
                                                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                                                              S47


lounge       bar       which       was     very          busy       and       contained             a    large       number          of       people


which       included          the       regular           customers                and       Liverpool          football


supporters.              The       supporters                 were       in       the    main       well       behaved          although


several          were    rather          noisey           but       nothing             unpleasant.              I    believe             that       I


overheard          the       landlord                               say       that       several          of    the       supporters                had


booked       a    table       at    the        premises             for       a    meal       and       that    this       was       a    regular


occurrence             whenever          Liverpool                 were       playing          at       Sheffield.


            and    myself          were        enjoying             a    drink          and    we       struck       up    a

conversation             with       2    Liverpool                 supporters                who    were       standing          at       the       bar


next    to       us.                     ind    myself             were       wearing          our       working          clothes             and    it


would       be    obvious          that        we    had          been    working             on    a    building          site          as    we

were    covered          in    cement           dust          and       other          debris.           They    asked          us       what       our


occupations             were       and     it       soon          became          apparent          that       they       were       also


employed          in    the    building              industry.                    The    men       are    described             as       followss-


1.     Male,       white       about           30-35          years,          medium          build,       5*7       tall,       light


       brown       hair,       collar           length.


S.     As    above.


I    cannot       describe          them        further             other          than       they       both    spoke          with


Liverpool          accents.


One    of    them       stated          that        he    was       a




At    about       2.00pm       (1400)           my       employer,                                               arrived             at       the


premises          and    he    joined           us       in       the    lounge          bar.

We    continued          to    talk       to        the       2    Liverpool             supporters             about          the       building


industry          and    I    believe           the       conversation                   related          to    payments             of


craftsmen          as    it    is       part        of    any       duty          to    work       our    payments             for       sub­


contractors.


At    about       2.30pm       (1430)           I asked             the       men       if    it    was    about          time       they


were    leaving          as    it       was     a    considerable                      distance          between          Oughtibridge

and    the       football          ground           and       I would             estimate          the    distance             at       about
                                                                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                                                                  S47

           two    and       a    half       miles.                        ~


           We    told       the       men    that       they       would       have       to    park       their       car       in    the

           vicinity             of    the    Texaco          Filling          Station,          near       to    Middlewood                Hospital,


           and    walk          to    the    ground          from     there.             One    of    the       men    said          words       to    the


           effect       that          they       were       confident          of       getting       into       the    ground             because


           the    gate          would       be    open       or    opened,          I    am    not    sure       which       word          was    used.


           (Open       or       opened)          The    2    men    did       not       appear       to    me    to    be    potential


           trouble          makers          and    they       appeared          to       be    decent          people.           I    didn't          hear


           them       say       that       they    had       tickets          for       the    match,          nor    did    I       see    any


           tickets.

           The    manner             in    which       one        of t h e m s a i d      that       the       gate    would          be    open       or

           opened       did          not    imply       to        me that they            were       going       to    attempt             to    force


           entry       into          the    ground.


           The    2    men       with       whom       we     had been speaking                  left          the    public         house        at


           about       2.40pm             (1440)       and        at that time            the    public          house       was       almost


           vacated          by       all    the    Liverpool            supporters              leaving          only       the       locals          inside

             Arrived          at       Hillsborough                for     briefing             in       North       Stand       attached             to

            Following                 the       briefing         engaged         on       duties          at    Eskdale          Road       and


            Shenstone                 Road       off    Leppings           Lane,          prevg,p*4i»fl             unauthorised                parking

             fans       arriving,                many       with       packs     of       beer       -   Targier.          Remained             in    that


            area        mostly             in    company         with      PS    Reynolds                on    foot       patrol          along       Leppings


            Lane        between             the       two    roads       above.            As    time          went       by    the       volume       of


             spectators                arriving             grew,       many     asking          for          directions             to    Public          Houses


            and        it   was        apparent             to   me     that     a    large          number          of    them       did       not    have


             tickets          for          the    match.           I    must     have       been          asked       at       least       50    —    60    times


             if    I    had       any       spare       tickets.

                                                                                                                                                               R24



There       were          groups             of    fans          walking             up       and       down       Leppings            Lane           asking


others          for       tickets,                this       went          on       from       the          time       of    my    arrival                at    the


point       until          just          before             kick-off.                    I    saw       several             instances             of


spectators                purchasing                   tickets             I       think           25       was    the       asking          price.




The       mood       of    the          fans       arriving                was       generally                happy/boisterous/singing,


obviously             looking                forward             to       the       match.              I    did       not       see    any       bad


behaviour             as       such          but       as    time          got       nearer             kick-off             there          were          still


many       asking          for          tickets.




From       about          2pm       I    was       with          PS       1561       Reynolds                standing             in    front             of    a


private          garage            area           almost             opposite                Eskdale          Road          just       after          I    think


Bickerton             Road.              This          was       a    result             of    a    complaint                from       an       elderly


couple          who       were          washing             their          car       in       the       garage          area       regarding                   fans


using       the       garages                as    a    toilet.




From       that       point             we    could          see          down       Leppings                Lane       to       the    bottom             at       the


roundabout                at       Penistone                Road,          during             that          time       there       was       a    continuous


stream          of    fans          arriving,                causing                problems                for    traffic             on    the          road,


one       fan    was       spoken             to       by    PS       Reynolds                for       deliberately                   walking             on       the


road       in    front             of    a    bus.           The          mood       was       generally                good       natured                and

enthusiastic.                       There          seemed             to       be    no       let       up    of       numbers          arriving                and


about       2.50pm             I    made          the       point          to       PS       Reynolds             that       there          was       no       way


could       they          get       into          the       ground             for       kick-off,                and       for    them          to       do    so


the       kick-off             would          have          to       be    delayed.                 About          3pm       I    heard          on       PS


R e y n o l d ’s      radio             that       there             was       a    large          crowd          at    the       turnstiles                   and


apparent             trouble             there.




As    a    result          together                with          PS       Reynolds,                PC       Bradley          and       PC    Severn             we
                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                        R24

       went directly to to the turnstile area,             large   numbers of persons

       there,      I saw some    climbing up over the wall      into the ground and many

       of them running up and climbing over the turnstiles themselves.                    The

       time then wou ld be about 3.05pm just after the main bulk of them had

       been let in through the gate which had been opened.                Not knowing at

       that time that         the gate had been opened I prevented several youths

       from climbing over the turnstiles and mo ved others to the other side

       of the gates         in front of the turnstiles.      Re ma in ed there and several

       •fans'      leaving the ground then informed me that there were serious

       problems       inside,   one described it it as being worse than the Heysel

       disaster.



       Ma n y    people    leaving the ground now and the general attitude         now was

       of anger and sheer            hatred towards the Police,    many threatening

       officers and         calling us murderers,    the m ai n were very hostile towards

       us,      so m u c h so that    I was afraid for my own and other officers

       safety.        M a n y of them were   in tears.



       About 3 .20pm I was           in desperate need of the toilet,    so I went     into

       the      ground and walked down the side of the No rt h Stand to the toilet,

       there were         large numbers    leaving the stand by them, while     in the

       toilet      (alone)    I was subjected to a barrage of threats and abuse from

       about 30 men,         3 or 4 told them to leave me alone as it was not my

       fault,      if they had not done this I feel        sure that I would have been

       assaulted.         On leaving the toilet      I walked around the back of the

       Wes t Stand trying to find a way on to the playing area,               but not

       knowing the ground            could not get on.   U n a b 1e to get on to the   pitch I

       then had to return outside the ground and join other officers there.

       Amb ul anc es and fire tenders were arriving now and a steady continuous

I   remained    there    until     we       were    stood       down    and    asked    to   regroup   in    the


North    Stand.     From   there        I    walked       with    my    serial    to   Claywheels      for


food    and   subsequent    transport              back    to    Doncaster.

PULFREY


Back of North Stand packed with men urinating against the wall when shouted

at by myself, carried on regardless.               At this time my attention was drawn to

back of turnstiles for North Stand where Police Constables from my serial

had come through the turnstiles. Entrance gates 'A' were shaking violently.

Fans coming through turnstiles drunk and hostile shouting 'THEY RE GETTING

KILLED OUT THERE, THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER HEYSELS,' and screaming for

gate ’A' to be opened.

Gate    'A' opened and crowd surged forward through the gate.                         The gate was

closed again only seconds later.

Back on turnstile duty only a few Liverpool fans coming through suddenly a

crowd appears at main gates to turnstiles which are closed.                        Only people now

attempting      to    get    in   are   very    drunk    Liverpool     fans.   Turnstiles     closed

scuffling breaking out between Liverpool fans and in one occasion a drunken

Liverpool fan lashed out at a Mounted Officer with a broken bottle. Suddenly

Special Inspector beckons wildly at me.                   I ran to gates 'B' where I saw an

 obviously dead boy being put in an ambulance, passed a near naked dead man

at     gate   'B'    and   into the area between gate            'B'     and the   tunnel    for the

 terraces.      In this area approximately 10 dead people were strewn about.

 I checked      these to ensure they were dead then assisted with the injured

 people some of who were also lying in this area.                      I then, after seeing the

 arrival of ambulance crews, ran through the tunnel to the terraces where I

 was met by a wall of Liverpool fans, looking over them I could see the pitch

 had been invaded, people around me in the tunnel began moaning, I assisted

 to    escort   these       people   out   of   the     tunnel   where    if   they   were   injured,

 directed ambulance crews to them.

 Myself and Police Constable 809 carried the body of a young fair haired boy

 in a Liverpool shirt and light trousers in the lane running adjacent to the
PULFREY


River Don, we then went onto the pitch.

People were being carried away but no bodies were on the pitch.

Attention   called   for   Leppings   Lane   terraces   where   Liverpool   fans   were

attacking another Liverpool fan who they say was picking up belongings from

the terraces and putting them in his pocket.

Called by another officer to go to Leppings Lane.               On the way assist to

remove bodies from back of terrace tunnel to lane running adjacent to the

River Don then form cordon helping fans to leave ground, stream of urine

running down from North Stand like a waterfall.

Fans leaving ground violent and asking if the match is off.

Ambulances convey bodies away.

Liverpool fans leave, then instructed to go to North Stand for de-brief.

Throughout these events I felt nothing, I just helped where I could.

It seemed as though nobody really knew what to do but help with the dead and

injured.

I have worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on numerous occasions and

usually have policed the same turnstiles without any trouble.

From       my     observations I                would        say     that       the    major          cause        of the      in cid en t

wa s    the       fact        that        so many         people     a rrive d        late       and      had      no i n t e n t i o n    of

a lcohol         although           only        a    few    were      obviously             drunk,          and    there      were

The    crowds             were       heavier              and       heavier         and     the     h i 11        wa s    a     total         mass     of

A few       fans          had    been          asking           where         the                        t nd a n o t he r          pufa w a s        as

running          along          the       roads.

People          were       asking          to        pass       our      b a rrie r       and      so    2    dozen           old       and    young

people          were       allow ed            down           the    centre         of    the      road.           People           were       s t ill

PC S t u b f a i n s       then       jo in e d           us    and      said       to    fans      that          there        wa s      no    point

running          as       the    game          had        started            and    2,000        were        queuing           to       get    in .

The    fans           in    the       west       Stand          were        pointing        and       chanting              and     people            were

clim bing             from       the       stand          into     the       terrace.

The    fans           behind          us       were       fa irly       q uie t      and    seemed             to    sense        that

som ething             was       amiss.

Standing              on    the       lin e ,        the     ground          appeared        to       be a b s o l u t e l y           packed          and

1. f e l t      that        the       cheer          from       the     Spion        Kop    would          nave          brougnl        the       tans

The general behaviour I would describe as good. Some had been/were drinking, many

.ere not.     By this time all making towards the ground.              Could hear over the radio

of problems at Leppings Lane end and at a certain time, I believe after t

 had started,    an   instruction "ALL AVAILABLE OFFICERS TO THE GROUND".                 Hy few

 serials were soon gathered together and we made our -ay to Leppings Lane aide of

 On arrival      could see a large         group of Police u i n c

 with supporters.        I thought         this was a      public ordersituation   and I formed a

 cordon across the turnstiles to keep spectators away.                  The turnstiles were closed
                                        1-irVpts and were demanding entry.                   These

  wrong.
  I entered the ground itself behind the West Stand. A large number of people were

  injured, some were obviously dead.               Others were in a state of shock.     People were

  tending to the injured. After the initial shock, I remember giving first

   youth who had obvious     i n t e r n a l   injuries.

   1 cannot remember if the radio was working at this time - but I do not recollect

   hearing any transmissions.
   Together with      another officer I moved the injured youth, who was conscious, to

   the sterile area behind the West and South Stand.                   I remember a doctor arr>vlng

  I
         At       that    time        our       brief           was     to       identify              travelling             pickpockets              and    if

         Due       to    this        Det.       Con.        Hallam              was     in      possession           of       a    wallet        alarm,       and

  I         the    remainder            of      the        team       were        to       be     in    a    position             in    order     to

  I         and    paddock           area,           the    area        was       very          quiet        and    the       crowd        being       sparse.

U n i f o r m Officers were           on duly in that area,                      officers were at each

t u r n s t i l e entrance       gate,       and officers were on duty at a barricade on

the d r i v e w a y to the         rear of the South stand.

Further       officers were            on duty as a coach reception party in the area

i m me d i a t e l y   in front      of the turnstiles.          It appeared at that time the

number of unif o r m ed P o l i ce officers was                 in the                       region of AO.

At this        time the crowd which had started to gather was mixed with

many families being                present. The behaviour                    of the fans was good

humoured.

As the a f t e r n o o n wore          on the crowd steadily built up and the mood

became        fairly hostile,            because numerous fans were milling around

wit h o u t    tickets,       at this time I lost count of the number of peole who

a p p r o a c h e d me and a s k e d whether         I had either tickets                                to sell or just

 spare.
 I p e r s onally saw a number                 of men selling tickets with                                 large       groups of

 people       stood a r o u n d     them, j*ho ^ e r e obviously trying t 0;:buy-tickets

 for the game.             Due    to this the area around the corner .shop which is

 d i r e c t l y adjacent        to the football       stadium became                                 particularly

 congested.
 The     vehicular       t r a f f i c - al o n g Leppings Lane              itself a p p eared to grind to

 a   halt,      with    the odd       vehicle     passing,   although                            it    should    be    said    that


 numerous         coaches and Public Service Vehicles                                    came along             that    road

 under      Police      mo t o r c y c l e   escort to the reception area.

 The     unif o r m e d o f f icers          in that location    a       t   t   e   n   d   e   d    those   vehicles and a

  se arch of persons             leaving the vehicles was undertaken.

  I recall         seeing two        coaches arrive at the same time,                                     two officers

  a p p r o a c h e d one vehicle and the            remainder           of the serial 6 or 8

  officers ap p r o a c h e d the other vehicle.                     I           recall thinking that there

  was     less officers           in that area,       than there had been in previous

  years.         However      I must         say that I had several arrests                                   take     place

team    loitering               around          the          corner       shop       and        the        entrances           to        both       the

Whilst        at       this     location             I       recall       moving           numerous              bottles            of    both


alcohol           and        soft    drinks          which          h a d iieen          d i s c a r d e d       underneath               the

The     Merseyside              Mounted           officers               together            with          one     South       Yorkshire


officer           (female)           were        constantly               moving           the        crowd        on    who        were       just


standing              about,        these        people             obviously            had        no     tickets.             This          was


interferring                  with    the        operation               to    c a t c h     offenders              so    much           so    that


several            likely       suspects              were          moved      on     by     the         officers.


At     2.20pm          (1420)        or        thereabouts               the     crowd           became          very     dense,              so    much

 so    that        the       observations                 team       i n c l u d i n g     myself           was        forced        to       move        out


 from       the       area     adjacent              to      the     metal       fencing              to    an     area        of    relative


 calm       beneath           the     signs          on       the    metal          fencing           further           along        towards              the


 entrances              to    the    West        stand.

 Whilst          at     that        location             repeatedly             asked           for        spare       tickets           or     tickets


 for    sale,           those        persons          obviously               now        getting            very       worried           about


 seeing          the     football              match,          the       majority           of       those        persons           having


 enquired              about        tickets,          moved          into       the        paddock           area        and    towards


 turnstiles              which        by       now       had       large       queues.

 At    the        present           location             I    liaised         with         Det.          Sgt.     McSloy,           who        reported

  constantly              moving          in    and          out    of    queues           in       the     paddock           area.            It

 appeared              that     these          men       were       pickpockets,                    the     two    men        had        disappeared

we    had         now     taken          up,        which                   was     directly            adjacent              to    the        roadway              and


is    on     a     lip     which          affords                       a    view          which       is    slightly              elevated               and       looks


down       on      the     heads          on        the             persons                queueing          to     gain       entrance                  to       the


football               stadium.

it     seemed            that       from        the             area              near      to    the        shop       some       considerable                                *j

moving            towards           the        ground.                        By    this         time        vehicular             traffic               had       ceased


and     the        entire           carriageway                              was    blocked             by       people.

Whilst            stood         with       DCs          Hallam                    and      Lilley        and       looking          down            into          the


 paddock           area         which          was          now              totally         full        with        people         and         still             more

walking                towards           the    g   r   o   u   n   d   ,     I    s a w    groups           of    young       men        pushing                 into


 the       c r o w d ,     the      majority                     of          these         being        the       worse       for        drink,               I   saw


 several               carrying           and       drinking                       from          large       2    litre        bottles              of        both


 lager           and      beer.

 At    this            time     I    noted          that                    the    Police          horses           were       moving           amongst                 the


 dense            crowd        in    front           of             the       paddock             area       to     alleviate                 the    situation.


 My    impression                   of    the           situation                    was         that       the     crowd          was        becoming


 desperate                due       to    having                    no       tickets             and    with        no    hope       of        getting

 tickets,                also       the    fact                 that           the         ones    who       had        tickets          would            miss          the


 start            of     the    game       due              to          large        amount            of     people          trying           to        gain       entry


 to    the         stadium.

 I     cannot            recall          the        time,                   but     whilst         stood           at    this       location a Police                           j

    I looked both down and up Leppings Lane and the area was totally

    b lo c k e d   in both di r e c t i o n s with people moving towards the football

    g round.

    I was now stood to one side of the Landrover with DCs H a llam and

    Lilley,        and whilst   there we were joined by a uniform Inspector,

    identity unknown.

    PC B u xt o n the driver       of the vehicle,       alighted and stood on the body

    of the vehicle and whilst doing so he was using the vehicles PA

    system,        repeatedly stating      'Please stop pushing there are people at

    the front being crushed*.              I noted several      large groups of young

    Live r p o o l   fans, who were    pushing    into the crowd and making some

    hea d w a y towards         the turnstiles,    these fans pushing others out of the

    way.
     I spoke to several          fans saying     ’D o n ’t go forward,           stay b a c k ’.    Many

     i gnor ed this.
     At this       point I      saw several    people    climbing      o r v   the f e n c e s around t h e ■■

     paddock area.           Once climbing      into that position those                people were then

     helping       others up onto the fence tops.            I then saw one fan climb over

     into the actual         ground,   he was then followed by others,                    I then saw

     Inspector Bennett appear on the              roof of the turnstile area.                      I saw

     the     officer assist      several   fans to climb into the ground area.

      It was obvious at this stage that many                people        were being        crushed at

      the turnstiles,        people were not moving through the actual                       turnstiles

      and    I recall thinking that I couldn't see             a n y      Police helmets at the

      turnstiles .
      B o t h PC Buxt o n and the unknown uniform Inspector were now using                            the

      P A system,       repeatedly asking the crowd to stop pushing and that there

      » as    people being      crushed.      I recall   one of the officers stating that

      game was going to be delayed.               The    people still approaching the

      gr ound and turnstiles were taking no notice whatsoever and were

continuing              to       push     forward.

The    Mounted              officers              strength           had    been        increased,                and       saw    that           those


officers          were           attempting              to    get     nearer           the       turnstiles                to    enable


people       to        gain        entry          to   the     ground.         Still              no    one       taking          any        notice


and    still       more            people          pushing           forward.            At       this       time          there       was        no


other    obvious                 Police           manpower           deployed           in    that          area.


I    observed           the        Police          Mounted           Inspector,              obviously                shouting           at       the


crowd,       I     noted           that       his       horse        seemed        to    be       going          under       due        to    the


people       pushing               against             it,the        front    of        the       horse          started          to     rise          with


the    rear        end       disappering                 from        view,     it       appeared                that       the    officer              was


falling          backwards,                  however,           somehow       he        regained                his    footing.


The    mood        of       the        crowd       was       now     very    desperate                 and       becoming           more          and


more    hostile.

The    anger           of        the    crowd          now     being       directed           at       the       uniformed              officers


present,           I    noted           several          people        coming           towards             both       PC    Buxton           and        the


Inspector,              pushing              at    those        officers,           saying             do       something,              stop        the


pushing,           some           of    these          men     were    crying           in    what          I    believe          was


frustration                 at     the       situation.

PC    Buxton           who        was    continually                 using     the       PA       system             then        directed           the


Mounted          officers               to    form       a     line    in     front          of    the          Paddock           area,           this


was     partially                 successful,                 five    Police        horses             completing                 the        line,


however          as     the        crowd          pushed        forward        the       horses             were           pushed       towards


the     ground.

PC    Buxton           still           attempting              to    reassure           the       crowd          stating           that           they


would        all       get        in    and       to    stop        pushing.

I     recall       seeing              Inspector              Bennett        who    was       still             on     the       roof        of    the


turnstiles              and        was       still        pulling          people        onto          the       roof.

By     now    I    c o u l d n ’t         actually             see     the    turnstiles                 due          to    the    vast           sea    of


 people       and        still          no     sign       of    Police        helmets.                 PC       Buxton           still


attempting                  to    reassure             the     crowd.

Whilst          stood       at       that         location           a        large       roar        from        within       the       ground,            it


appeared          to       me     that           the    football               teams       had           come     onto       the    pitch,            this


being       around          2.55pm               (1455)        the       mood        of    the           crowd     being       desperate,


more      and     more           fans        pushing           forward,              still           many       carrying           both        cans       and


bottles          of       drink.

Together          with           the       other        officers               of    the        observation               team      knowing            that


we     c o u l d n ’t       help       the        situation               I    moved        off          down     Vere       Road.

Whilst          walking              down        that        road       another           large            roar       from    within           the


ground          was       heard.             I    noted        that           football              fans     were        running         up        that


road       in    the        direction              of       the     Leppings              Lane           end,     those       fans        obviously


coming          from        Liverpool.

Having          walked           down        that           road    and        into       Penistone               Road,       I    noted           that


there       was           very       few     spectators                  in    that        area,           together          with        the       other


officers              I    then       went         into       the        gyff;.

At     3.05pm             (1505)       or        thereabouts                  whilst           in     the       gym     having       meal,


information                 was        received              that        the        crowd          was     on    the     pitch       and       that         all


available                 uniform          p e r s o n n e l       to     attend           that          area.          Together          with        both


DC's       Locking              and       Askew         left       the        gym        and        took    up     a    position          near        to


the      entrance               to     the        pitch,          however,               having          been      there       only       a    snort

 time,       together                with         the       other        officers              1     was    instructed              to    return            to


 the     gym      to       await          casualties.

 Whilst          in       the    gym        I     was       informed               that    there           had     ueen       deaths           in    the


 ground          and       was       told         to    clear        the           gym    by        Chief       Inspector           Beal        and       to


 make       it    ready           to       receive           corpses.

 The      bodies           then        began           to    arrive            within           the       gym,     the       first       person


 having          been        carried              into       that        area        was        thought           to    be    dead       however            it


 was      found           that       he     w a s n ’t       dead        and        therefore              was     moved       to    one           side.


 The      area        within           the        gym       was     now        ready           to    receive           the    bodie-           a.iu    tho.e


 that       were          brought            in    were        blue           in    the     face,           many       obviously           dead,           some


 of     which         were        still           being        attended              by        first        aid        personnel.              I    notes

that    several         of     the     bodies          (deceased)               had       vomitted            and       soiled

themselves           and      I recall         seeing         one     which           had        blood           coming      from     his

head    body       orifices

All    the    deceased          which        were       brought            into       the        g ym w e r e       accompanied                by

Police       officers,          some        being        carried           in    on m a k e s h i f t             stretchers             and

others       actually          being        carried.            I recall              seeing           one        female          Folice

officer       and       some    spectators              struggling               with          the    body         of    a    small       young

male,    I went          to    her     assistance              and      took         hold        of     the       boy    and       carried

him    into    the       main     hall       and       placed        him        on    the        floor          along        with    the

many    others,          the    female         officer          then        stayed             with       the      deceased.

Many    of    t he      bodies         I saw       o b v i ouslyhad             broken           l i mb s         and many         were        in

some    form       of    state         of   undress.

Together       with        other        officers             mainly        CID       F1     personnel,              I moved          amongst

the    bodies        and      Police        officers,           instructing                    the        officers           to    stay     with

the    deceased          and     to m a k e        a    brief        description                 of       the     body and          to

search       the     body      for      both       personal           effects             and      identification,                   I

handed       the     officers           plastic          bags        and     labels.

Having       completed           this        task,       again        together              with          other     F1       CiD

p e r s o n n e l , I searched               several          bodies         placed             them        into     body         bags,

making       sure       that     the        head       was    the     first           thing        to       be    seen       once    th e      bag

was     opened,         the     bodies        were       then        lined       up        m      rows       of     twelve,         the

attending          officers            were    again          instructed               to       stay       with      the      deceased.

I cannot        recall          the     time       but       it w a s      some        consicerable                  time         later

certainly          after        si x    o ’clock         (1800),           I was           instructed               to    convey         the

very     distraught             relatives              and    friends           of     the        deceased           to H a m m e r t o n

From that time until 8.00pm (2000) on Friday, 21st April, 1989

(210^89) I was a member of the Exhibits Team under the direction of

Det. Sgt. McSloy dealing with all the personal effects clothing and

other exhibits, at that time state the entire exhibit side of

disaster was handed over to the West Midlands Police enquiry team.

With regard to the day of the disaster I cannot recall the time of

the turnstile being opened but I recall being told that the gates

would be open at 12 noon in order for spectators to gain entry to the

     As     the      situ a tio n            d eteriorated                I    decided           that        the        match          would          not

              O n Saturday,        15 April,       1989 <150489)     I was on duty at Hillsborough

              Football       Ground.         I came on duty at about fe.45am<0845)             that date and

              travelled       to S h e f f i e l d from Barnsley by my own car.            I arrived at

              S h e f f i e l d at about 9am       (0900) and parked my car          in the    premises of

              L i verpool      were    in and around the Herries Road area.                Fast      food

              m o b i l e s were    ready to sell       refreshments.       After    collecting my coat we

              proc ee d e d to L ep pings Lane from Penistone Road and onto the junction                               r

              w i t h Fielding Ro a d and Leppings Lane.

              U p o n arrival we set up barriers at about                  10.4 5 a m (1045)    in order to

              stop vehicles           parking     in the road which d i d n ’t belong          to residents and

              to    control     the flow of pedestrians.

              B y this time Liverpool              and Nottingham fans had b e g u n to arrive and

tried       to explain that         local         pubs were       closed or only open for local

residents.          This did not deter them as many stated that it was early

a n d they would walk a mile or so for a drink.

At   this time the mood             of the fans was very cheerful and jokes were

being made from all               quarters.             During the ne>:t four hours the

f ollowing events           I remember took place but not necessarily in

chronological            order.

Inspectors and ranks above were                          in abundance         outside    the ground early

As   time     progressed more and more fans arr i v e d and m a n y were very

boisterious,          throwing      food a n d litter around as well as swearing and

chant i n g .

Fans     were turning up without tickets and were asking other fans                                            if

the y had spare tickets.                   This at the time sounded                   like    ' Sp u r s ’ and we

about        E    hours.

By    1.30pm           (1330)       there          were          hoards            of    people             on    Leppings          Lane        and


many        asking       for     toilets               as    there          was         already             massive          queues          forming


outside           the    turnstiles                on       Leppings               Lane.

At    about        E .10pm       <1410)            I    remarked                  to    PC    Patterson                that       the     train


carrying           Liverpool             supporters                   was         just       pulling             into    Wadsley             Bridge


Railway           Station.            Traffic               was       using            Leppings             Lane       and    fans        were

walking           in    amongst          the       traffic                because            of    their          sheer       numbers           they


c o u l d n ’t     possibly           keep         to       the       pavements.

Club        Stewards          from       Sheffield                   Wednesday               persistently                tried          to     park


their        cars       in    Fielding             Road,             which         by    now       was       already          full        with


residents              cars.        At    one          point          I   was          told       by    a    Club       Steward           to    ’F u c k


O f f ’     for    not       allowing          him          tt   f   park.         ,T h e     general             behaviour             from     the


stewards           was       poor     and      I       would          have         expected             better          from       them        towards


us.         If    they       treat       us    as       they          did         what       would          they       treat       -the      -fans


like.            Many    used       an    excuse             that          their         boss          had       given       them       permission


to    park        where       they       wanted             and       were         not       slow       to       drop    names          of.certain

us    tickets           and    were       generally                   convinced               that          they       had    gone        to    the


wrong        entrances.                Many,           and       I    would            say    to       be    conservative,                   about     500


people           stating       that       they          had          tickets            for       seats          in    the    North          stand     and


because           of    the     prefix         letters                before            their          seat       numbers,          had        been


told        that       they    had       to    go       into          the         football             ground          via    the       turnstiles


on    Penistone              Road.        These             were          Liverpool               supporters             and       it     was

obvious           by    their         accents.               After           being           sent       down          Leppings          Lane     and

onto    the       turnstiles             on       Penistone                   Road       they       were              rather          dismayed                   when


they    came          back       and    saw       the       mass          of       people          waiting,                 or    rather                pushing


to    get    in .


By    about       2.45pm          (1445)          the       crowds                were    so       immense                 outside             the


turnstiles             in    Leppings             Lane          that          I    remarked             to        PC       Patterson                that          no


way    would          all    these       people             get          in       in    time       to    see           the       match          kick-off.


People       were       pushing          that          much          that          people          were           retreating                   back          towards


us    and    stating             that    no       way       they          would          get       in    and           they       were          going             to


sell    their          tickets.              Police             horses             were       in    attendance                    and          seemed             to


be    having          little       effect             in    controlling                   the       crowds.

Fans    were          climbing          over          fences             and       walls       but           I    couldn't                say       whether


it    was    to       avoid       being       crushed                or       because          they              had       no    tickets.


On    entry       towards          the       ground             several                fans    from              Liverpool                had       obtained

Nottingham             Forest          scarves             and       hats          were       kicking                 and       throwing                them       down

from    within          the       ground          and       I     assumed               that       the           players          had          come          out

that    there          were       still       a       few       thousand                fans       waiting                 to    get       into             the


North       and       West       stands       on       Leppings                   Lane.

Whilst       standing             here       Traffic              patrol               cars    were              very       much          in    abundance                   *

if    our    presence             was    required                 as      we       had    NO       RADIOS              —    Only          Sergeants                and


above       had       them.        We    were          told          to       remain          where              we    were.

Some    fans           came out of the ground and remarked that a pitch                                        invasion

was     in progress.                 These were Notts. Forest supporters.                                 Over     the next

20 m i n u t e s         or so ambulances and fire engines arrived on Penistone Road

and after              several       beat cars arrived,                   some from A Division,                we began

to ask        them questions as to what had happened.                                        We got the        impression

that     there was              trouble within the ground and a message                                  had been sent

out     to get           every available man to the ground.                                This had been done so

q u i c k l y that there was a distinct                                smell of burning            clutches        from the

cars.         I looked back up the                      road to see my colleague G r ah a m Patterson

a n d several             other officers w aiting around.

I returned               back to the barrier at the top of Fielding R o a d with

L e p p i n g s Lane and asked Graham                            if he knew what was going on.

N a t u r a l l y he d i d n ’t have much of an idea.

Residents               came out of the houses and were stood                                  looking    rather

shocked.                I went      to one       lady and all she could tell me was                            that it

was t e r ri b l e and these were                       people dead,              but she d i d n ’t fill           in any

d e t a i Is .

I    returned            to   the     barriers         and       watched       the L i v e r p o o l   fans   spill       back   .-i



out     onto           Leppings      Lane.           Many    initially were              very     distressed,, tears             _

 I   remained            behind       the    barriers            oblivious        to w h a t    was    happening      and

tried     my           best   to     soak    in w h a t      had       hapened       in t h e    football      ground.

Ambulances               were       trying      to    get    up L e p pi n g s      Lane     being     led    in   turn    by

either        a Police              motorcycle         or    a traffic           car.      The    fans were        not.

 prepared              to m o v e    to   one    side       to    let    the     emergency       services      through.

As m o r e        fans        came onto the street we were met with fans who were

 e x c e p t i o n a l l y aggressive and were                         calling us from fucking                bastards to

 cunts and anything                       linked.       Our so called incompetence and all we

were     doing was standing around while their friends                                             lay dead and we

d i d n ’t    care. Of       course   we     did care but they knew more             than we    did.

A    lot more.

When       there were        so m a n y people on the streets we were getting a lot

of aggro           from the residents to stop them coming from Leppings Lane

end       into F i el d i n g Road.        As more       protests were aimed       personally at me

and       insults several         fans spat     in our general          direction.     Insults and

a b u s e were          constantly hurled at us and when threats were administered

I really felt              threatened.       We were alone,          no radios   to call for help,

nowhere        to go or hide and 1 felt frightened,                     so m uch so I had hold

of my staff and              if anyone had attacked m e I would have used it

without        notice.        I feared for my safety so much as we were so

helpless.               I remember seeing a sergeant who I don't know stood in

front        of me.        He was trying to calm the area down as we tried to

a l l o w Doctors,          nurses and fire         personnel       into Fielding Road in order

to keep L e p pings Lane open for the emergency services.                             While    I moved

the       barriers        out the Liverpool         fans did nothing to help only jostled

and       insulted us as well as push the sergeant away.

D u r i n g this         barage a woman ran across the road from Shentall Road and

s aid      to us that a man had collapsed                      in her house.     Immediately PC

P a t t e r s o n and friyself attended at                                     to find a man

h a v i n g an epileptic fi*ti in her house.                      I remembered my first aid and

put the man              in a recovery position while I tried in vain to ring for

an ambulance.               Ev e n t u a l l y I got t hrough and about 20 minutes            later an

a m b u l a n c e a t t e n d e d and took the m a n who           I only know as __________________

f roiri                   a w a y to Hospital who was still            in deep shock.     He' had

rung home to say he was fine and after                            ringing off went    into an

epileptic           fit.     I obtained a telephone               number from him and said I

w o u l d try and          ring home for him.

We    then went back onto Leppings Lane to find our serial and enquire

what we        could do,       if anything.          We       came across Sergeant liozley and
                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                             R220

informed           him     that we         had    some        p r o p e r t y which was           ha n d e d    to us

personally            in    the     day     to hand           to c en t r a l       control.

We    then     went        into     the     g r o u nd      s till      not      aware     of what had              occurred.

Property           was     h an d e d    to a s er g e a n t          and we        then looked          for a

t el ep ho ne .          I r em e m b e r      l oo k i n g      t hr o u g h    the p a s s a g e w a y s     under    the

North        stand       and s e e i ng        de b r i s     scattered           on the      floor.

I proceeded              towa r d s      the     gymnasium            in o rder         to find a phone               and once

in s i d e    I was met            by a mass          of people            standing         around.            As    I walked

through        I was        aware        of bags         of c lo t h e s         and d i r e c t l y    behind        I saw one

body     on    the       floor      apparently              being       searched.           Curiosity           got    the    better

of me        and     I noticed           rows     of dead           bo d i e s    with no real           outs i d e

i n j u r i es .      I w a sn 't        aware      that         they were          dead at this             time.      I just

remember           f ee l i n g    numb.         I eventually              found a phone               and     tried    to get

an    o ut s i d e    line        to no avail.              As    I hun g        the phone        up a p o l i c e w o m a n     in

the     p o li ce     r o om went          hysterical             and     I knew s o m e t h i n g was              w rong but

wha t    I didn't           know.        I proceeded              w ith    PC P a t t e r s o n    to C l a y w h e e l s     Lane

w here       I awaited            the    rest     of our          serial.         Eventually           retiring        from

dut y    at    6 . 45 p m     (1845).            On my way            back       to the car I r e m e m b e r e d            seeing

a helicopter               hovering         over      the        ground.         Once    alone     in my        car and

travelling            bac k       home     I r em e m b e r       listening           to Radio Hallam.                 My mind

is b l a n k       from     t he r e o n    till      I a rr i v e d       at B a r nsley         District           Hospital.

Not     a wa r e     how    I got        there.       Once        inside         and h e a r i n g c o m m e n t s     of

reports        I broke            down     uncontrollably                 in tears        and as a r e s u l t had             to

have     time        off work.

objections             or a d v e rse    comment     regarding       this but neither were

forthcoming             at this      time.

As    the m o r n i n g       progressed and         the   number       of fans, increased    I saw

several          fans attempt           to gain entry to the ground              via turnstiles A and

B,    only       to    be    told by the turnstile           operator      that they were at the

wr o n g    tur n s t i l e .    Th e y then had to force            their way back towards            the

other       turnstiles          on Leppings Lane           end.    Around     1.00pm    (1300)   the

number       of fans          outside     the ground had greatly             increased and we then

had to be m o r e             s e lectiv e in our searching.              A round 2. 30pm    (1430)     a    _

few fans          c i m b e d the    perimeter wall         and were stood on the           roof of the

t u r n s t i l e s A to G;         they were      instructed to get down and were ejected

from       the g r o u n d by other           officers.

At    this       time       there were several        hundred       people hanging around the

area       of the       t u r ns tiles and due to the amount               of fans now entering

the     g r o u n d were a s k e d to move from that area to allow fans                       in.

Several          peop le who        had entered the ground              complained that      people at

the     back      of the        crowd were pushing Jtowards the front,                  a nd that    the

Police       should         be awar e     of this.

At    this       I looked t h r o u g h the turnstiles towards Leppings Lane,

a l t h o u g h my      view was        restricted    I could see officers             on foot and on

h o r s e b a c k w ho a p p e a r e d to be attempting             to control    the    surge   towards

the     turnstiles.

People       were       now st r u g g l i n g to enter      the ground and       in fact were being

                                                                                                  PAGE     3
                                                                                                  R398


pushed        into    the wall and turn stile                 entrance    itself.     Many fans were

now    c o m p l a i n i n g that someone         would       be injured,    and all officers at

the    turnstiles          should go outside.                 All   fans were    informed that

officers          inside had a task to perfo rm and that officers                          outside

would        be   doing everything po ssible                  to alleviate      the problem.

Around        2.40    pm I saw that         several       fans had again climbed the outer

wall     and were        on top of the         turnstile entrance            roof,    they were

instructed           to get down.          This    they       flatly refused      to do.     I saw two

yo u t h s    on the     roof showing         their      tickets      to Police     officers      they

were     again       instructed to get            off    the roof,       but again refused.

By now many           fans had c o n g r egated          around      the turnstiles       and several

officers          including myself were                being surrounded by fans who were

being        abusive     towards us b ecause             they had been subjected            to the

crush        outsi de    the turnstiles.               Fans    were now being allowed          into the

ground        without      the ticket       stubs       being torn off (this I presumed was

to    a l l o w quicker entry)           and these        were being passed to fans on the

roof    w ho      in turn began to throw them over the wall                         to fans awaiting

entry.

It ha d       now got      to the stage        where      searching was         impossible     due    to

the    amount        of fans c o n g r e g a t i n g    inside      the turnstile     area and

together          with   several      other    officers we attempted              to clear     the

area.         This    was met with verb al              hostility      towards    the Police       and

many    fans       appeared      to be     losing       their tempers.

I formed          the opinion that b efore               too long a Police          officer would be

physically           assaulted,       and due      to the fact that only serial                14 was

deployed          in that area,        had an officer been assaulted then

assistance           would have       been very         limited and the si tu a t i o n got          out

of hand.           Tha nkfully      this    did not       occur.

Whilst        s p e a k i n g with several        fans I was approached             by a man who

stated        that    he was a M e r s e y s i d e      Police officer,         he said    that

something         had        tc        be    done       outside          or    people        would          be     injured.              He

appreciated             the          pressure           we    were       under        but    something                 had    to       be d o n e

and     fast.

I    informed         him        that        tne       officersoutside                 the       ground           would           he    doing

everything            possible.                   At    this       he      left       and    w e n t i n t o the             ground

without         formally               identifying             himself             to me.

Fans      were    still              congregating              round          the     area       inside          the       turnstiles                 and

I made        several            request           for       them       to m o v e     away       to    allow           people          to       get

through         the     turnstiles                 as    this       in     itself          was    creating             a     p r o b l e m for

fans      entering           the        ground.              I saw         fans       c l i m b i n g over the               turnstile                and

entering         £ at        a       time     but       was    unable          to     prevent           this due             to    the       number

of     fans     around           the        turnstiles.                 These       people        just       disappeared                 into

the     crowd.

Shortly         before           3 . 0 0 pro (1300)            the       main       exit     gate       situated              near       to

turnstile         G     suddenly              opened          and       fans       began     to    surge          into        the       ground,

several         officers              from        the    serial          ran       towards        the       gate       ^nd        I joined

thefii in a n         effort            to    close          the    gate       (I w a s      of    the       opinion              that       the

gate      had    been        forced           open       by    fans)           but     this       was       impossible.

As     the    fans      surged              into       the    ground,          many        chanting          as    tney           ran,       I

turnefi a n d         saw        a    gap     in       the    centre          of    the     fans       and       people           moving          to

the     left     and     right.               People          were       screaming           and       snouting,              I went             to

that     area     with           o t her      officers             and    found        that       people          were        on       the       floor

having        tripped            or     been       pushed          over       in    the     rush       to    get       into        the

ground.          These           people           were       quickly          put     on    their       feet       and       moved           away

to     the    side      walls          away        from       the       rush.         Not    one       person          complained                 to

me     about     being           injured.

invasion.                 Access                to    the       pitch        was       gained           via          the       gate       leading              from

                       Evidence concerning events of Saturday 15th April 19&9




    On the day in question I paraded for duty at Scclesfield Police station
    at 0900 hours. I was then 'transported by bus to H illsborough football
    ground where upon arrival X confirmed that I was be part of serial ^9
    pair oiling the Foxhill area of Sheffield in a Transit -van, Tango km


    Hyself and other meabers of this serial took our s.eats in the North Stand
    for the breifiag by senior sad intelligence officers before collecting our
    meals and coeencing patrol at approximately 10.50 hours*


    Our first port of call was Che Fox public house situated on Foxhill Road.
    This is a fairly large pub with a very large tarmacadam carpark and grassed
    area opening onto the above road. At about 11.05 hours myself and Inspector
    Robinson visited the Landlord in the Lounge Bar of the premises. He stated
    that he had five extra staff on duty and had retained the services of “a big
    lad" as doorman. He also said that he had.extra beer and lager on ^nd that he
    would be welc oming Liverpool.supporters . A t this time there w e r e a fewlocals
    drinking in the pub and about two '‘families" of Liverpool supporters with
    young children. These supporters were quietly minding their own business -
    The manager was advised that we would be patrolling the area and calling by
    regularly and that we should be contacted in the event of any need for assistance.


  - We then resumed patrol , checking-visually other pubs in the area. Most were
    either quiet of* closed. However during this time many supporters began to flood
    into the side streets' in this area and park their private cars and vans.


    At 11.30 hrs we again checked The Fox public house. It was stamng to fill up
    with crowds of LKJ fans standing outside drinking in      t h e   s u n s h i n e .   The surrounding
     streets in Foxhill and uptowards Grenoside were now very busy with the vehicles
     of arriving fans ; to the extent that it made maneuvering of our shortwheelbase
     transit van very difficult. We then observed that traffic            flowing freely cown
     Ea l^ax Road from the North with many supporters      arriving in private cars, vans
     and hire minibuses. These vehicles were turning off into the Foxhill and Parson

     Cross estates; presumably to park.


     At 12.10 we again during our patrols checked The Fox pub. Thecar par-
                                                                  '                            cont/—
full to capacity with people standing very close to each other, sitting
on cars and standing on the boundary vail ; all drinking alcohol.


At 12.30 we were directed by control to attend at Wilcox Road, Foxhill
where youths were reported to be acting disorderly manner end urinating
in peoples front gardens* At the scene we liaised with PCs stationed at
the bottom of the road who stated that 5 -6 liverpool fans had passed them
being abusive and throwing down beer cans. Sane of this team were observed
to go tip Wilcox Ed and urinate in gardens. We saw this group of youths
walking up that road and stopped and spoke to then. All had .been drinking -
heavily and were in a very boisterous mood. They were advised and pointed         -
inthe direction of the ground. We followed thea down the hill _and near the
bottom they all boarded a SIPTE bus bound for the town centre.


At 12,50 we again visually checked the Fox .pubilc house. By now the car park
was bursting to capacity and fans stood drinking some distance up and down
Foxhill Eoad on the Pavement on both sides drinking alcohol purchased from
The Fox. I would estimate the number in the car park and walls alone to
be in the region of jgbout 300 to kOO. With a further200f standing on the
pavement and pull-in on the opposite pavement... .Thesre was in there number
a large drunken, rowdy contingent who cat called as we passed and who         .
continued to do so when we paused for observations.          __     .


At 1300 hours we checked the White EORSS public house on Halifax/Southey green
Road. This, too, was full of LFC supporters and the scene was very similar to
that at The Fox.


At 13*05 hours we receive a message from control to attend at
newsagent, tobacconist and confectionary shop                           The
□anegeress stated that ,six drunken LFC fans had come into her shop and
acted disorderly before stealing cigarettes and sweets. She followed them
outside where they were very abusive and threatening and saw them drive off
in a White 'Renault van registered number


At ^.15 hrs I saw the van being driven on Halifax Road. We followed to the
car park of                      rfhere it parked up. After a short conversation
the six occupants of the van were arrested by me and placed in our police
van. They were then transported to EPS arriving at 13«*+0 hours.
                                                                   cant/-
 The prisoners were all Liverpool supporters ranging is. age from 18 yrs to
 3? years. They had       been drinking both in the van on the way over and
 at The Fox public house* They stated that they had arrived in planty of
 tim e at about 12.15 hours- When booking the prisoners property in it was
 found that not all of them had tickets for the natch.


It was ascertained that all six had attended Sheffield for the match with only
TWO West stand ticket between them. They had managed to swap one of these
tickets for TWO Lepping lane terrace tickets; brining the total held to THS£S
between SIX. The prisoners told me that t h e y had heard that tickets would be
on sale from touts at the ground and that last year the officials at the ground
had let some in without checking tickets owing to the rush because of the
match starting. It.was farther noted when booking in property that there was
very little cash between them. Ana certainly some of those without match tickets
did not have sufficent ftinds to purchase tickets at 2OTTS prices;' indeed they
only had loose change.


This was noted at the tine and subject of discussion between myself and the
custody officer. Obviously the full significance of this information did not
become apparent until later* but the custody records corroborating this
evidence re property are availible for examination at Ecclesfield _police station.
It appeared to me at the time that if these prisoners had insuficient funds             to
buy tickets and that they ■ere determined to get into see the match ( this was
.more than anparen by the noise and ^complaints comning from the cells when they
were detained) then they were going to attempt to gain enrty by some means. This
is again   corroborated by the fact that they had          turned      up on spec withoutmoney
but with the knowledge that people had some how            gained      enrty at the last minut
year because of the rush.


The prisoners were all held whilst      I   liaised with C I D regarding their interview.
At about   15.15 hours I was in the CID office when PC 12^2 Armitage called me
and told   me that OPERATION SDPPORT was required          at the      ground. My t r a n s i t had
departed earlier so I was driven in a police car to the ground in co PC 12k2
Arnitage, PS 2269 Strafford and Inspector Hudson.” We arrived at the L e p p i n g s
lane end at about 15-30 hours. We parked the car in a side stree t and all headed
towards the tumsiles. Fans were pouring out of the ground some confused* some
angry and others obviously distressed by something.
As I approached the gate in front       of the turnstiles, a few paces behind
Inspector Hudson, I saw a LFC       fan attack him and try to   punch him.Hudson
managed to restrain the youth       who was upset and crying,   I assistedhim and
pulled the youth off and took       him away from the scene. During the struggle
I received an injury to my       right foot; it was not serious andthe bruise
only lasted a few days.      I   tried to calm him down but he kept shouting
"There is fucking dead bodies in there".       I released the youth to the
custody of friends and returned to the main gates.


I had NO personal radio so       I was unaware of the circumstances of the
incident however I assumed       there had been some sort of crush, perhaps a wall
collapse.    A mass of people were pouring out of the gates at Leppings~Lane.
Most of them did not know what had happened either and seemed mostly
concerned with the fact that they had not gained entry or wished to know if
the match was abandoned.


However quite a few of their number informed me that some supporters had
been crushed because of a massive surge or that a gate had been opened by
the police or stewards.      I was on my own now so I tried to move fans out of
the path of     oncoming emergency vehicles; the progress of which they were
hampering.      Isensed that something very disasterous had happened from the
mood and tears of fans. I continued to try to clear the roadway but the --
mood of some fans was very aggressive fuelled by the fact that they were
heavily under     the influence of intoxicants.   I was jostled and abused by
these drunken     fans and whilst attempting to move a large congregation from
the path of     afire engine, I was punched on the right shoulder by an unknown
assailant and jeered and insulted by the rest of the group.       Some still had
beer cans in their hands.


The situation had become potentially very violent with all the violence and
abuse apparently directed at the police.       I was still in the dark about the
incident or requirements as I was on my own without a personal radio.          After
the task of keeping fans off the road became fruitless and dangerous to my
personal safety, I looked further down Leppings Lane and saw my serial in
their transit     van.   PS 2207 Shaw saw me and got me back into the van.
Crowds of LFC     fansjeered and rocked the van as they passed.    Several police
motorcyclists parked across from us became very vulnerable to attack by fans
and after a few close calls had to move on.       The fans shouted "Murderers     to
us and other officers as they walked by.


The Sgt in the van had a personal radio but the reception and communication
was very bad.     Inspector Robinson got out of the van to go to police control
                                       -5-
to find out what assistance we could render or if our vehicle could be of
any use.   We heard over a domestic pocket radio that fans had been killed.


Inspector Robinson returned and stated that our van was needed as an
ambulance and that we were needed to assist at the mortuary area, situated
in the gym.   We left the driver with the van and walked through the extreme
left hand gate at Leppings Lane and down along behind the North stand
towards the gym.


I was detailed by the Inspector to go to the gym to ask if any more numbers
were needed inside.   Luckily a Sergeant on the door stated that there was
enough help but asked that we keep fans looking for lost family/friends as
well as sightseers away.    Our serial along with some men drafted in from
Barnsley formed a cordon along a line between the corner of the North Stand
and some outbuildings parallel to the stand.


We allowed only stretchers bearing the dead and injured through as well as
Police, nurses, doctors, ambulancemen and other officials.    Some fans
carrying IPs were allowed to take them through.    Ambulances reversed up to
our cordon and IPs were taken away.    Many fans approached our line in a very
distressed state inquiring after lost party members.    Many became aggressive
and violent at not being allowed to look through the dead and injured for
them.   Again many of the most aggressive and violent fans had been drinking
and still smelled heavily of intoxicants.    At one point I received a kick
from a fan being refused access, to the back of my left knee.      He was
removed after a struggle with sober friends and other officers.


Inspector Robinson and PS Shaw then asked members of our serial to assist
with a makeshift casualty desk.    I took details and descriptions of those
missing from fans and asked them to return to their transport in case the
missing person was looking for them.    Some were bussed down to Hammerton
Road Police Station to give info to the Casualty Bureau.


At about 1800 hours, serial 49 was asked to return to their van at
Claywheels Lane, pending further assignment.   Reunited with the van, we had
to attend several times at the Northern General Hospital to deal with fans
fighting with pressmen.    Other Officers were present at the scene and we
acted as back up.   We were eventually stood down at 2000 hours.     I had a
meal at Claywheels and went off duty at Ecclesfield Police Station at 2030
                             -6 -


On return to Ecclesfield I learned that my six prisoners had all been released
at about 1 8 .1 5 nours with a warning but no further action to be taken against
them0

Continuation of statementof



At 1^50 hours I was present in Trinity Road when all the Norwich Supporters had

entered the ground and Trinity Road was clear of pedestrians. The mood of the J.orwich

Supporters was jolly and co - operative. I then ordered two of the six Officers

posted to "K" Block to patrol Aston Park and with the other 4 Officers I coved from

"K" Block to "L" Block, Where a request had been made for core Mounted Officers to

assist with the queue due to a large amount of i-verton Supporters who had just arrived

at the turnstiles at "L" Block. Upon arrival at "L" Block I found that all 10

turnstiles were being used and there was a queue some 60 yards in both directions

from the turnstiles along witton Lane. At 1500 hours when the Kick Off cor-menced

the crowd outside "L" Block surged towards the turnstiles and I ordered a wedge of

horses to be put into the crowd to relieve the pressure on the turnstiles end avoid

any injury to any person in the queue. Many of the supporters at "L" Block had been

drinking end the snell of alcohol in the air from the -crowd was strong. The Everton

Supporters at "L" Block were unco - operative but they all gained access to the

ground by 1515 hours. I then rr.ade ny way along '.-itton Lane to R&5 Block turnstiles

and saw that the last of the Lverton Supporters were just gaining access to the

ground by r£.S turnstiles, at this time it was about 1520 hours. Upon my arrival r-.t

"3L-S" Block I v;as informed by the Mounted Officer in Charge at the turnstile, Police

Sergent Dunn that the Lverton Supporters who gained access at "PicS" turnstile had all

arrived in the 20 minutes before 1500 hours.

I ___________________ born 26.11.57 and am 31 years old.             I
am a qualified ambulance man working for SYMAS, I have been
with them for nearly 9 years.



I work for Rotherham and on Saturday 15th April 1989 my tour

of duty was 1400 to 2200 hours.          I was crewed with Leading

Ambulance Man                  .   I was actually at the Rotherham

Depot at about 1510 when we received a telephone message

requested us to go at once to Hillsborough where there had
been a major incident.



______ drove and we set off at once.        Over the radio we were
told to go to the Penistone Road entrance, which we did.            We

got through the pedestrian traffic quite easily.             We were

directed by a police officer inside the perimeter of the
ground.



Inside    it   was   chaos.     People   were   milling   around   and

patients were lying all over the place, some on hoardings,
some on the floor.      I got out of the ambulance and as I did

so people were storming the vehicle; they were opening the

door and trying to take equipment out.



People came up and tried to drag me in different directions

to see injured people.        I went to e young man on a hoarding.
He seemed to be choking so I treated him.          I was then taken

to a man with ginger hair.         He was close by, he was having
breathing difficulties and I treated him.



I was        then   taken    to   a patient     who    I was    told    had    two

suspected fracture femur.                He was screaming as though in
agony.        I tried to examine him but could not get near him to

do     it    properly    because       touching   him     resulted      in    more

screams.



I noticed that both he and his                  friends around him smelt
strongly       of   alcohol.      With    help he was       put   on    the    cot

stretcher and then as we were loading him he began to shout

that he was not going without his brother.                     He grabbed the
sides of the ambulance preventing us from lifting him.                        His
brother was pulling on the stretcher, shouting and swearing

at us, saying he was going with us.



We realised he was not injured as badly as he was making

out.        He was examined again and told to seek transport in a

police vehicle as a sitting patient.                  He seemed to have only

broken his ankle.


I got a message that there was a patient in the gym being

attended       to   by   a   doctor.      The   doctor     wished      immediate

evacuation to hospital.             I went to him and after treating

him put him on a stretcher and moved him to the ambulance.

The doctor went with m^.
10.   My colleague then went to find a second patient in need of

      immediate hospital treatment, and upon his return a second

      casualty was placed in the ambulance.


11.   The    doctor    left    and   I    remained   in    the   back      with     the

      casualties.       We went      to   Northern   General        with   a   police

      motorcycle escort.


12.   At    the   hospital    the casualties    were       handed    over      to   the

      hospital staff and we returned to the               ground.     I drove this

      time, and I proceeded to the Penistone Road end again.


13.   Outside the ground I noticed a small                number of ambulances

      and I joined them.         My colleague left the vehicle in order

      to work on      foot and I was directed             to reverse into the
      ground near to the gym.



14.   I was told to take the body bag on board into the gym. Most
      of the injured seemed to have been moved by then,                         and I

      would guess the time was about 1620.



15.   I joined Mr.Hopkins in the gym and, I helped with messages

      and errands.       I then joined ambulance man                           and we

      began to place bodies into bags.           There were not enough bags

      and so we used blankets to cover the bodies.


16.   I noticed that many of the bodies had clothing torn with
      their    dress    in   disarray.         Police      were   present     and
      responsible for property and counting the bodies.


17. I was asked to move my         ambulance to the car near the back of

      the gym, where I joined others and after a while David Jones

      ascertained      who   was   on   duty   and   who    had   come   in   as
      volunteers.      Since I was on duty I was asked to return to
      the station which I did.



18.   Control had been asked us to use channel one whilst heading
      for the ground and I had done this but                 I found that no
      matter where I was transmitting from it was impossible and
      reception was very poor.



19.   I knew about the major       incident plan and -found it to bo -in

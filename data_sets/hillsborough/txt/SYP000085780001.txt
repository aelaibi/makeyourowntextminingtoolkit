During my time at these gates                   I was approached by numerous supporters

of both factions who wanted to know if there were any ti ekets on s a 1e

In addition I had to remonstrate with a number of supporters,                                          mainly
                                                                        r

Shortly after 3>OOpm              (1'z'OO) that date i. became aware ot a disturbance

taking       place on the Leppings Ln end of the ground.                               1 received this

information mainly from tannoy announcements and messages from the

radio issued by Pol P S 2i>6> J agues.                       I was not in possession O’f my ow

radio.         My initial       impression was that we were facing a serious

public order situation,               and it was not until                  some time after and the

ambulances       began to arrive that Jfte full                    picture was revealed.

disperse       the    crowd    leaving     the area.            The   only     time    I had left the

gr o u n d   prior    to going     off duty was           to a c c o m p a n y an amb u l a n c e      to the

N o rt h e r n General     Hospital.          Bot h the       crew were        in the     rear      of the

a m b u la n c e working      on victims,      and the a m b u l a n c e       was    driven     by a Polic

Constable       from out       of S h e f f i e l d who    did not know         the way.



I later attended as a serial                  to the garage at Claywheels Ln where we

received transport back to Hackenthorpe going off duty at S.0 0 pm

(2000)       that date.         At no time during the incident did I enter the

ground proper nor did I deal with any of the dead or injured.

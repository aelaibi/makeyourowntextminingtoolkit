                  Prior     to       c ommencing any           duty   I was       present          w h e n a pre m atch briefing

                  w i t n e s s e d a steady flow              of   supporters          entering          the ground.              The    general

                  mood     of these            fans were       good humoured.

                  filled        to     capacity and        the      flanking          pens was        relat i v l e y empty.             A short

                  public        order     situation.           I saw four         or five          supp o r t e r s          climbing     over
the    track       fence      from     the mi d d l e     enclosure.          I went       onto   the     track

•j.nfront        of the West S t a n d an d a t t e m p t e d           to    stop a s u p porter          running

onto     the      pitch.      I i m m e d i a t e l y saw that         he was       in some       physical

d i s c:o rfif o r t . M h e n I looked        closer at         the    front       of the    stand       I was

ho r r i f i e d to see         people      crushed a g a i n s t       the       barrier.

A number          of officers          were    now on the          track and         there was       obvious

co n f u s i o n as     to what a c t i o n        to take.

I then went            thro u g h     the   south       stand and made             my way to       the    back      of the

west     stand

As     I ran to the           rear     of the middle           enclosure           tunnel    1 saw       Ins

an d   I brie f l y e x p l a i n e d       the    problem.        I n o t i c e d that      there was         no

c o m m o t i o n at    the     rear    of the        stand.

I then went            down     the    tunnel      a nd a t t e m p t e d    to get    people       to e v a c u a t e

the     stand.

The moo d         of   the    supporters          was    extremely          host i l e and    it was       clearly

noticable          that many were             d r u n k . I e v e n t u a l l y made my wa y to the                 front

of     the stand and            saw a heap of bodies                 to the        right    of the       pen. I

noticed          that a b ar r i e r wa s b r oken a nd b en t in this area.                         I grabbed

hold     of a young           g i r l and     w ith     the a s s i s t a n c e    o f Insp Sykes

carried          her thro u g h       the   s tand to the          open e n closure at            the     rear of        the

t u n rie 1 .

As we      drag g e d this          girl    from the        stand      I was       jostled and       pushed         by

su ppo rte rs .

The y oung         girls white          top also         pulled off as             she was    carried t h r o u g h

the    crowd.

At the          rear   of the       stand     mouth      to m o u t h was a d m i n i s t e r e d     to the girl

and    the a s s i s t a n c e      of an     ambulance         crew sought.

s t a n d an d officers were                desperately' a t t e m p t i n g         to revive       t h e m . After
some     time    I a s s i s 1 1?d o f f i c e r s t o p u 1 i a sec o n d girl               t o the    pit c h i n

front     of the stand.               As   officers     dealt w i t h her           I ran to the Police

room and from the                gym area.         I took an o y g e n cy 1 i n d e r a n d rna s k I

brought        this    back      to    the girl      and attempted             to   resussitate          her w ith

it .

The     girls    father was            present a n d he        i n f ormed me          that    it was     his

daught e r ’'-/i c k y "

We     placed    the girl         in an a m b u l a n c e    together          w ith    two male        supporters.

I desperately            continued mouth             to m o u t h as we         t r a v e l l e d to the N o r t h e r n

Genearl        Hospital.

girl     was    q u i c k l y given medical            a t t e n t i o n and    I a s s i s t e d m e d 1 ca 1 staff

After     some       time a Do c t o r       told me that she was                dead.

I then took           the / b o d y    to the      temporary        mortuary           inthe hospital           and

I then s e a r c h e d and            found Mr Hicks and            told him his daughter was                     dead.

A nurse        from the         hospital,,        then a s s i s t e d Mr Hicks.              I retur n e d to        the

in the     north       stand went           off    duty.

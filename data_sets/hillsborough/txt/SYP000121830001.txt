*59   Senior officers o f th e Division have a special responsibility fo r checking th e accuracy
      o f all process m atters and reports. U niform ed and D etective Inspectors in particular
      should be encouraged to m ake recom m endations to th e S uperintendent in charge of
      th e Sub-Division and he in tu rn should be perm itted to m ake as m any decisions as
      possible w ithin th e C hief C onstable’s overall policy. The Divisional C hief Superinten­
      d ent should only have to deal w ith th e paper w ork involved in m atters o f extrem e
      im portance or o f an unusual nature, fatal accidents, com plaints, e tc., o r m atters of a
      co n ten tio u s nature w here a second opinion is required, th u s freeing him to perform
      his prim e role o f inspecting and supervising.

 AWARDS — NATIONAL AND LOCAL

 60   He will assess and subm it to th e D eputy Chief C onstable rep o rts and recom m en­
      dations fo r honours and aw ards in respect o f civilians and police officers.

 CONCLUSION

 61   The efficiency and c o n ten tm en t o f a Division o r D epartm ent reflect to a great extent
      th e leadership and personal standards set by th e C hief Superintendent. The response
      obtained from officers o f low er rank depends largely upon th e understanding and en­
      couragem ent given to them by th e officer in charge.

 62   F or these reasons th e highest qualities o f character and discretion are expected of
      officers o f th is rank, upon w hom rests to a great e x te n t th e good nam e and repu­
      ta tio n o f th e Force.

                                                28 January 1992


  Dear Mr Moore
  Hillsborough Disaster
  Disciplinary Proceedings
  My role in the above has now terminated. I should not let matters
  end without writing to express my gratitude and respect for the
  three Officers, Superintendent Fell, Inspector Ba£iter and PC
           who were assigned to assist in the preparation of the
  preservation of the disciplinary charges directed to be brought
  against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray.
  By any standards this was a complex affair with a plethorea of
  available information.
  I have had the advantage of the assistance of three very
  professional, able and conscientious Officers. It is very easy to
  let personal feelings and prejudices affect ones approach and
  judgement, however, I have at all times felt that each of the
  Officers was doing his utmost to honour the Force's obligation for a
  careful and thorough examination of the available material towards
  the goal of a fair but firm presentation. It has been my privilege
  to have known and worked with them.
  You will appreciate that considerable time had to be expended
  analysing video recorded material to establish time bases for
  various parts of the evidence, to assess the value of some evidence
  and to consider various theories. Such a process is often
  laborious, much of this fell upon PC           who undertook it with
  a conmtendably conscientious and cheerful approach. He was of course
  invaluable as a diviner of information through his personal
  knowledge and his computer skills. Because he regularly performs
  football duties, he could recognise individual Officers of all
  ranks, and representatives of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. He had
  listened to much of the evidence given and earlier public hearings
  and in his own quiet way was a very useful source of both comment
  and ideas. A reference to his rank belies his contribution.
  Inspector Barker worked like a trojan. He is patently a man with
  an acute sense of morality and a keen interest in the application of
                               -   2   -




the law. He faithfully pursued every hare set running at all times
acting with an enquiring mind identifying areas worthy of pursuit.
He had the ability to assimilate and assess the value of vast
amounts of information. He prepared various useful charts and was
responsible for many of the skeleton statements composed in
readiness for the hearing. He made many instructive observations
and contributed with a critical appraisal of the ideas of others.
You are fully aware of Superintendent Fell's attributes. His
contribution was invaluable. Never a yes man, always unfailingly
courteous and ready to proffer the benefits of his vast and
knowledgeable experience. The disciplinary proceedings were very
much a thinking man's problem and I could not have been more ably
served than I was by Superintendent Fell.
I am grateful for having had the opportunity to have played a minor
role in a major incident.
Yours sincerely

a v a ila b le   at the Penistone Road end? - A. That is right,
sir.
Those were removed for the purpose of the semi-final
because of the undesirability of minglia* Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool fans? - A. Segregation of supporters,
sir, yes.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That had happened in 1988?
- A. It had happened in 1988.
And in 1987?-A. Yes, sir.
     MR. COLLINS: So the result was that at semi-finals,
not at any other match, but at semi-finals, the whole of
the West and North sides of the ground had to go through
Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, sir.
That of course put some greater pressure on each individual
turnstile because each individual turnstile had to cater
for more people? ~ A. Yes.
Now, of course, the problem was that that happened only at
semi-finals when the capacity was going to be the greatest,
going to be a full house? - A. Virtually full, sir, yes.
rfAnd~t±us-:v o h w e r e : to r-, a-s                             ~
  making use of the turnstiles at that end than usual? - A.
  Yes, sir.
 Quite apart from the closing of the Penistone Road end
 for the North Stand? - A. Yes, sir.
 This meant, did it not, that it was essential to have
 a steady flow and the likelihood was that if you were
 not careful you were going to g 2t problems with getting
 peoole through in time? - A. It was a possibility, sir,
 but'I discussed the matter or Hr. Mole discussed the
 matter with me when the policy of closing down the
 turnstiles on Penistone Road end was adopted and we ,
 felt with the number of turnstiles we had}>with the
 flow rates that we knew we     could achieve, it    balanced
 in favour of going throughwith this scheme.
 You were looking to 800 an hour, as I understand it,
 iudging by your proof? -A. Yes, sir, I think it
 comfortably can do 800 an hour.
       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         I think it can comfortably
  take 800 an hour, sir.
       MR. COLLINS: Now, you had to get 24,000 people
  through 23 turnstiles? - A. Yes, sir.
  It was not quite as simple as that because it was
                                                G. MACKRELL

unbalanced, was not i t , assuming everyone went where they
ought to have gone? - A. Yes, sir.
And so far as the/standing was concerned you had to get
10,100 thrsagf^AfW G, seven turnstiles.? - A. Yes, but
we knew^ad the flexibility of, if necessity, being able
to u sy ll to 16 f o f standing as well because the tickets
for tie West Stapobviously checked, a secondary point,
if theNi^g^^a^rthere we could utilise those turnstiles
to take up any slack if we found A to G being ----
The problem with all this is it creates a breach, does
it not, of the safety certificate because what you have
to d o /if vou look at paragraph 28 of the safety certificate,
is to’keeo' a record, 28(1), I am sorry, it is page - dust
be about il4 or 115, condition 28. - A. Yes.
28(1) requires you to make and keep various records which
Include a record of the numbers of spectators admitted to
the stadium during a specified activity - this is the
important bit - and to each area of spectator accommodation
therein mentioned in part 1 of Schedule 3. ~ A. Yes, sir.

And if we go to part 1 of Schedule 3 we see that you have
to keep a separate record of those admitted (a) to the
West itcscse*,-  dtftj&fce4Iorfch-Hest-
West terrace was already, the configuration was - the
oro^trd was “when I ‘inherited the ground*’in 1986r ’ '
ObviousIv it was a total capacity. There was no way
of separating the North West terrace from ----
There was never any way of complying with the safety
certificate, condition 28(1), is what you are saying
in relation to separate records of the West and North
West terrace? - A. Of the West and North West terrace,
no, sir.
So you were always in breach of that condition? - A.           ■—
That would appear so. Obviously I do not know the
history of it being drafted in this way.
 Maybe. Is this not something that worried you because
 on the face of it you are committing a criminal offence
 every time you have spectators in Hillsborough? -A. I
 take vour point, sir, but obviously I had already, as I
 made the point, that the Kop had been built, the capacity
 had been extended. I obviously . felt the other items,
 the configurations of the back and in the front of the
 West Stand had been taken into consideration.             .
 I see. It had not. At least we have seen absolutely no
 record anywhere that it ever had and it does not appear
 that it had. - A. But I understand, sir, there was - for
                                                      G. MACKRELL

example, it was agreed, a letter increasing the capacity
of the Kop.
Oh, the Kop, yes. I am sorry. I an not talking about
that. I am talking about this problem of the provision
of records of the North West and the We^t terrace. - A.
Sure. sir.
But apart from that, the way you devised your ticketing,
and you talk about the possibility of other turnstiles
taking up the slack, meant that you ran into diffciulty
in recording the split between the North stand, the West
stand and the terraces, did not it? - A. Not the North
stand, sir, because the North stand would have been - it
was served by independent dedicated turnstiles.
All right. Then the West stand and the West terraces.
- A. The West stand and the West terraces ideally one
would use the A to G and the 11 to 16. If necessary
one would utilise other - would be able to use 11 to
16 for standing purposes.        >
Well, I follow all that but of course that would involve
a breach of the condition 28(1). All I am asking you is ..

Vight to say that there would be a criminal offence every
time— What i-t would-be fair to say, I-suggest?-is' that •
there was no way of their being sure that they could avoid
committing a criminal offence.
     MR.   COLLINS:    I take your point, sir.
     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Which is iust slightly
different.
     MR. COLLINS:     I was putting it too much in shorthand:
All I am really suggesting is you ought to have been very
careful to ensure that what you were doing was approved
because otherwise if you were in breach of the safety
certificate there was at least i i theory the possibility
of a prosectuion. - A. There was, sir, but it x/as a policy
which had been agreed with Chief Superintendent Mole and
if one wishes to one could have counted the tickets that
came through the other turnstiles to get the actual areas
which have gone through. I am not pretending that was
done, sir, but I am saying if one is wishing to counter
the accusation that one may be in breach of a criminal
offence one could have dealt with it in that way.
I am putting it too emotively. I should have limited it
to saying in breach of the condition. But what you are

                                                            G. MACKRELL

     saying is you had the potentiality to provide that record
     had you manually counted all the tickets? - A. Correct, sir.
Q. And split them up into the various regions or areas of
   the ground? - A. It is only into two, sir."
Q. West stand and West terraces. Did you in fact ever do
   that or not? -.A. The only time that had been done, sir,
   has been following the events of 15th of April.
Q. I see.     But notbefore? - A. No, sir.
Q. That does of course, as you rightly point out, create a
   record. Of course it also means though if you switch
   around the turnstiles that you lose any accuracy in
   your computer count, does not it? - A. One s till has
   the accuracy for the total end of the ground, sir, and
   in addition to that there is a further check, a manual
   check by stewards, for people entering into the West Stand.
Q. What I am getting at is what you do lose though is the
   reliability of the computer count when you are trying
   to assess whether you have reached capacity on the.
   terraces or nearing capacity on theterraces as opposed
   to the stand and so. on? - A. Yes, I take that point, yes, sir
q.     ' ' -L0TUTJUSTICE-TffKiOffi: ' You can'-comply -wi-cfif- 28C1T' —   -
     retrospectively by counting your tickets? A. Yes, sir.
0.. What you cannot ensure that you can do iscomply with
    Schedule 3(1) which says you shall not admit to the
    various areas because there is no means in advance of
    your saying whether more than 2,900 have gone into the
    Korth West terrace? - A. No, there is no —on the same tack,
    sir, there is no way of knowing that people who have got
    tickets for the West stand do not go and stand on the
    terraces.
Q. Unless you have separate . . . . - A. Exactly.
0.        MR. COLLINS:     Mr. Mackrell, can I ask you just to
     go to one or two other conditions? Can you look at con­
     dition 8, please? We have seen a lot about the first aid
     room in (1) but I am more concerned with (2) at the moment
     because it does appear from Dr. Purcell's evidence that
     there was not a physician employed or retained available
     to attend the first aid room if required whose where­
     abouts were known to those in the Police central control
     room at the stadium? - A. I was surprised, sir, to read
     transcripts of Dr. Purcell's evidence. It uas not as I
     understood it to be. His appointment was to be the club
     doctor, not the team doctor, and in fact his position
     was known by the Police, his whereabouts in the stadium.
Q. You had understood that Dr. Purcell fulfilled the 8(2)

      THE WITNESS:'      Th.at   is right, sir.

     MR. COLLINS:          One oth er matter that can affect, I
imagine, the d e c i s i o n  of a    spe ct a t o r to come in is the
state of the weather.          A. It can indeed, sir,yes.

We know that on April  15th   this year the weather was fine
and sunny.   A.   It was, sir, yes.

Can you remember what it was like the year before?
A.   It was a sim ilar day, I believe, but not as hot.

Because when it is bright and sunny people may be tempted
to stay out of the ground d r i n k i n g outside. A. I think
that is the case, sir.

And, indeed, we know that that hap p e n e d because there are
reports of fans on grassy v e r g e s outside supermar kets
and dotted about near the ground.       A. Yes, sir.

And in the park,       of course, w h i c h is nearby.        A.    Yes,   sir.

Is that som ethin g which you spe c i f i c a l l y took into c o n s i d e r ­
ation - the p o s s i b i l i t y that wea ther        Obv iously you
were not res ponsible, I know, in 1989, but is that something
that you do take into a c c o u n t ?        A.    I think overall in
the pla nning of any o p e r a t i o n one takes into account that
kind of facet, that if it is a rainy day or, as we wou ld
say, a p o l i c ema n's friend, then people would go very
quickly to the sta dium to seek shelter. If it is a nice
day, there is a tendency for them to be a little slower.

You are, presumably, aware of the terms of the Safety
Certific ate?  A.   In g en eral, yes, sir.

Is that a matter which you c o n s i d e r spe cifically as part
of your p la nning pro cess? A.       I do, yes, sir.      I
think if you are talking a b o u t specifics, if I get the
Cer tific ate out every time I plan an operation, I wou ld not
say I do, but cer tainly I k n o w the main content of the
certificate.

The only reason I ask is tna t it is a criminal offence,
is it not, to breach any c o n d i t i o n of the Safety C e r t i fic ate?
A.    By the Club, s i r .

That is a Police matter b e c a u s e it is an indictable offence
which carries 2 years i m p r i s o n m e n t . A. Yes, sir.

That being so, one of the c o n d i t i o n s in the Safety Cer tific at
relates to the numbers that are permitted to be on the
various parts of the ground.        A.       Yes, sir.

Are you aware whether or n o t it is divided into the pens
or whether it is relating to the terraces as a whole?

                                                      B.    L.   . MOLE



   A.        My r e c o l l e c t i o n cur rently is there has been some
   n e g o t iat ion on the Certificate, b e a r i n g in mind the
   change of the A u t h o r i t y and, in fact, there were changes
   to the o r i g i n a l Ce r t i f i c a t e which was issued in, I
   think, 1979, following the a l t e r a t i o n to the Kco.           I
   don't think the Aut ho r i t y in fact c h a n g e d that Certificate.

Q. No, you are right but I do not think we need concern
   our selves with' that aspect. What I am asking you is whether
   you are aware what the Safety C e r t i f i c a t e has to say
   about the c a p a c i t i e s for the Lep pings Lane terraces?
   A.    What I am d e v e l o p i n g to say is that there were
   changes to the Leppings Lane s t r u c t u r e and it used to
   say, " 7 , 0 0 0 - s o m e t h i n g and 3 , 0 0 0 - s o m e t h i n g " which in
   total added up to 1 0 , 1 0 0 .              It c u r r e n t l y now is divided
   into some five sections and the c a p a c i t i e s are different
   for each a r e a .

Q. Do you know when that hap pened ?             A.        I don't, sir.

Q. Did it happen before the Sem i-Fin al this year?
   A.   The d i v i s i o n ?

Q. Yes.   A.   The division hap pened fol lowing the 1981,
   when the --

Q. I know the p h y s i c a l division h a p p e n e d but did the
   conditions               What you. are telling us, and I confess
   that the afety Ce r t i f i c a t e I have seen, which is dated
   1979, does not have the division into five.                    A.   No,
   it has 7 , 0 0 0 - s o m e t h i n g and 3,0 00-so methi ng, which is the
   North West enc lo s u r e and the rest.

         LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:      You do not have a copy of
    the rel evant c e r t ific ate?

          MR. COLLINS:        It is in Mr. Gla sgow' s bundle.

         LORD JUS T I C E TAYLOR:        I t ho ught it would be.          I
    have not found it yet.

          MH. COLLINS:          It is at the beginning.

          LORD JUS T I C E TAYLOR:       What does that provide?

         MR. COLLINS:       Sir, that p r o v i d e s for the global
    figures.   If you look at page 11, you will see the
    capacity num b e r s there set out.

Q. It is right to say that if you look at the Kop end, you
   will see a figure considerably below the 21,000.           The
   reason for that being, as I u n d e r s t a n d what Mr. Mole was
   saying, that there were n e g o t iat ions with the Local
   Aut hority fol lo w i n g the roofing of the Kop in I think
   1985.    A.    That's right.
                                                              B.   L.    . MOL E



If I have got t h e . d a t e correct.                  A.      Yes.

When about 5,0 00 extra c a p a c i t y was added in.
A.   Yes, sir.
But no-one a p p e a r s to hav e got round to act ually c ha nging
the Safety C e r t i f i c a t e . A.   I don't believe any of
those a m e n d m e n t s have been changed in the Safety Certificate,
including the d i s a b l e d sec tion and the inc rease to the
Directors' Box, whi ch also aff ected the seating areas in
the North and South Stands.
     LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR: So this C e r t i fic ate is dated
December, 1979 and that is the ope rativ e one?

     MR. COL LINS:  My u n d e r s t a n d i n g is that it is the
operative one but I --
       LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR:             That it is not or that it is?

     MR. C OL LINS: • Well, that is the only Sa f e t y Cer tific ate
I have -s.een and my u n d e r s t a n d i n g is it is the ope rative
one.
       THE W IT NESS:           That is the only one I am aware of.

      MR. COL LINS:   I u n d e r s t o o d Mr. Mole to say that he
thought that there were n e g o t i a t i o n s relating to spl itting
the Leppings Lane t e r r a c i n g into five sections, i.e. the
pens.
     THE WIT N E S S :        The al t e r a t i o n s to the gr o u n d go
through the S a f e t y Meeting, which are the people who
prepare the c e r t i f i c a t e .    When they have ass e s s e d what
those c a p a c i t i e s wou ld be, then my pre sumpt ion would
be that at some stage they would amend the certificate.
They do not a pp ear to have amended the certificate.

      MR. COL LINS:    They have not got round to doing
that.    A.    Exactly.
So all I an g e t t i n g at is - and it is an obvious point -
that at that t i m e ' t h e i n d ividu al cap acities of the pens
were not c o n d i t i o n s of the Safety Certificate?
A.   That is correct, sir.
But the o v e r a l l c a p a c i t y of the ter racing was.                    A.      That's
right, s i r , yes.
One last m at ter.     You have said -"Mr. Woo d w a r d put it to
you - that you e x p e c t e d your Officers to ask people at
random as they were ap p r o a c h i n g the ground to produce
tickets.    A.     I did, sir, yes.
What is the p u r p o s e of that?              A.       T 9 i de ntify if we have
a p a r t i c u l a r l y large p r o b l e m of n o n - t i c k e t h o l d e r s a t t e n d i n g
and to e n c o u r a g e t h e m to leave the area.

An Act to make provision for safety at sports stadia and
 other sports grounds.                 [1st August 1975]
                  by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and
     e it e n a c t e d


B     with the advice and consent of the Lords Spiritual and
      Temporal, and Commons, in this present Parliament
     assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:—

   1.       (1) The Secretary of State may by order designate as a Safety
stadium requiring a certificate under this Act (in this Act certificates
referred to as a “ safety certificate ”) any sports stadium which for lar8e
in his opinion has accommodation for more than 10.000 sPorts stadia-
spectators.
   (2) The Secretary of State—
      (a) may estimate, by any means which he considers appro­
           priate, for how many spectators a sports stadium has
           accommodation; and
    (b)    may require any person concerned with the organisation
           or management of a sports stadium to furnish him
           within such reasonable time as he may specify with
           such information as he considers necessary for the
           purpose of making such an estimate.
  (3) A safety certificate may be either—
      (a) a certificate issued by the local authority for the area in
           which a stadium is situated in respect of the use of the
           stadium for an activity or a number of activities speci­

    exemption in   for exemption under this section as respects any particular
    pan>cuiar      use, grant exemption from the requirement to have a fire
    ******         certificate covering that use.
                      (2) Exemption under this section for any premises as
                    respects any use of them may be granted by the fire authority,
                    with or without the making of an application for the
                    purpose,—
                         (a) on the making of an application for a fire certificate
                              with respect to the premises covering that use; or
                         (b) at any time during the currency of a fire certificate
                              with respect to the premises which covers that use.
                      (3) In deciding whether or not to grant exemption under
                   this section for any premises the fire authority shall have
                   regard to all the circumstances of the case and in particular to
                   the degree of seriousness of the risk in case of fire to persons
                   in the premises.
                     (4) For the purpose of making that decision the fire
                   authority may—
                        (a) require the applicant or, as the case may be, the
                            occupier of the premises to give such information as
                            they require about the premises and any matter
                            connected with them; and
                         (b) cause to be carried out an inspection of the relevant

                      (5) The fire authority shall not grant exemption under this
                   section for any premises without causing an inspection to be
                   carried out under subsection (4) above unless they have
                   caused the premises to be inspected (under that or any other
                   power) within the preceding twelve months.
                     (6) The effect of the grant of exemption under this section
                   as respects any particular use of premises is that, during the
                   currency of the exemption, no fire certificate in respect of the
                   premises is required to cover that use and accordingly—

                             certificate, the grant disposes of the application or
                             o f so much of it as relates to that use; and

                     (b) where the grant is made during the currency of a fire
                         certificate, the certificate shall wholly or as respects
                         that use cease to have effect.
                  (7) On granting an exemption under this section, the fire
                authority shall, by notice to the applicant for the fire
                certificate or the occupier of the premises, as the case may be,
                inform him that they have granted exemption as respects the
                particular use or uses of the premises specified in the notice
                and of the effect of the grant.
                   (8) A notice of the grant of exemption for any premises as
                respects a particular use of them may include a statement
                specifying the greatest number of persons of a description
                specified in the statement for the purposes o f that use who, in
                the opinion of the fire authority, can safely be in the premises

       1988.                                      ------

       2.   This circular, together with Annex A, introduces the
       provisions of Part II of the 1987 Act and gives advice on the
       effects and operation of them. Advice on those provisions of
       Part I of the 1987 Act (fire safety) which are to be brought into

                                    *
       Implementation of Part II (Safety of Sports Grounds)
       3.   Part II of the 1987 Act, consisting of sections 19 - 25,
       amends the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) in
       line with the Government's proposals contained in the
       Consultative Document published in June 1986 in response to the
       safety recommendations of the Popplewell Inquiry set up following
       the fire tragedy at Valley Parade on 31 May 1985. The main
       changes effected by Part II are as follows.-
      Section 19:- removes the distinction between sports "ground" and
      sports "stadium" with consequential modifications to section 2(2)
      of the 1975 Act dealing with the contents of safety certificates.

      Section 20:- empowers the Secretary of State to vary the
      designation threshold of 10,000 under section 1 of the 1975 Act.
Section 21:- precludes conditions in safety certificates
relating to police presence unless the extent of the presence is
reserved for the Chief Officer of Police.

Section 22:-   directs appeals under section 5 of the 1975 Act to
the courts.

Sections 23 and 24:- replaces the existing emergency procedure
under section 10 by introducing prohibition notices in the case
of serious risks to spectators; and provision to appeal against
them.

Section 25:- places a duty on local authorities to enforce the
1975 Act and to arrange for annual inspections of designated
sports grounds in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of
State.

4.   Annexes A and B to Home Office circular No 7/1986 which
gives advice on the 1975 Act should be noted as necessary and
cross referenced to this circular. Particular attention is drawn
to the latest guidance on the new procedure for the issue of
prohibition notices to deal with serious risks to spectators.
Local authorities are asked to copy all such notices to the Home
Office for information until further notice. To assist local
authorities to draw up a prohibition notice a suggested format is
reproduced at Annex B to this circular.
Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1987

5.   A copy of the revised regulations is also enclosed with this
circular. The regulations reflect the changes brought about by
sections 22 and 24 of the 1987 Act and lay down time limits for
appeals. Provisions on procedures for applications for safety
certificates, their issue, amendment, transfer and replacement
are incorporated in the regulations which also authorise the
determination of fees to be charged in respect of applications
for the issue, amendment, transfer and replacement of safety
certificates.
Transitional

6.   Under the provisions of Schedule 5 of the 1987 Act any
existing court order made under section 10 of the 1975 Act
remains in force. Similarly any appeal lodged prior to 1 January
1988 and still extant on that date will remain subject to the
appeal procedures of the Safety of Sportr. Grounds Regulations
1976 (SI 1976/1263).

Resource and manpower implications

7.   The contents of this circular do not result in any cost or
manpower implications other than those arising from the
inspections to be carried out on designated sports grounds under
section 10B(1) as introduced by section 25 of the 1987 Act.
Circulation of Statutory Guidance under section 10B(2) of the
1975 Act on these inspections together with any supplementary
advice is being done separately and will cover, as nccessary, any
resource implications arising therefrom.

Supplementary

8.   The information and advice in this circular and in Annex A
on the 1987 Act are given in good faith but it should be
understood that ultimately only the courts can rule
authoritatively on points of law.

9.   Any enquiries about the contents of this circular should be
directed to Mr D Macnamara 01-213 7338.

The F.A.       Cup as it is known is a knock out competition organised

by the football         A ss oc ia ti on for both league and non-league

football       clubs.



Opp os in g    teams are decided by a draw in every round and

(Prior to the Semi Final)            the matches   are played on the

grounds of those         teams whose names are drawn first.



The major       teams i.e     those in the first and second Divisions

of the Football         League    are brought into the competi tio n only

in the    third round.           At later stages   there may be smaller

clubs    still    in the compet it io n who have survived.         The contest

between       smaller and larger clubs       is wid ely held   to be one

of the main at tractions of the FA Cup.



The final      of the compet it io n    is palyed at Wenrbly Stadium in

London.        Semi Finals are played on neutral         grounds   (i.e not

the ground of either of the contestants)



Most Cup ties are keenly followed by the fans of the clubs                 involved

and Semi      Finals    are   'Big oc cassions   in the football   year often

with a great demand           for tickets.

     faring The Venue
     21. On 2 0 March 1989. the Football A ssociation (the FA) requested that their C up sem i-final between
 Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium . T he corresponding
 actni-fwal between the sam e two team s had been held there in April 1988. T he arrangements had been
 successful in the view both o f the police and o f the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the Club) were therefore
 w illing to accom m odate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but o n ly if
 ib e ticketing arrangements were the sam e as those for 1988. Otherw ise, the FA w ould have to look elsewhere.
 Those arrangements did not please L iverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. T hey thought the ticket
 a llo ca tio n was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirem ent was
 accepted and the match was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

 T he Ground
   22. The Hillsborough Stadium is som e 2'h m iles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in the district o f
 O»1erton. T he ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river D on. T he pitch lies
 roughly east to west. A plan o f the ground and its im m ediate environs is at A ppendix 1.

   23. T h e west end. with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the L eppings Lane end. T he
 east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river D o n and to the north a residential street,
 Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and P en istone R oad North.

     24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the D irectors’ and players'
 entrances, and to the adm inistrative b lock under the stand. T he roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
 access between Penistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it o f f at each end. There
 i s s o m e car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and em ployees o f the Club. T h e south
 H an d dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8.80 0. 5 .5 0 0 o f those are
 roofed over and 3 ,300 are uncovered.

   25. T he north stand is also all seating and accom m od ates about 9.700. Behind it is a gym nasium or sports
 hall. There are also a first aid room and police room close by.

       26. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It w as enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
     now accom m odates som e 2 1 .0 0 0 standing spectators. There are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
     the goal line but no d ividing fences to prevent free m ovem ent from side to side.

    27. At the west or Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
 Hand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World C up m atches, so m e o f which were held
 at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accom m od ates 4 .4 5 6 seated spectators. T h e terracing in front o f it
 extends higher in the com ers between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10.100. At both the Kop
 end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perim eter fencing. T he fencing is about eight feet high
 m ounted upon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the top o f the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
 angle for som e 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to clim b over towards the pitch. There are gates at
 intervals along the perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. T h ese gates are less than a
 m etre w ide and were designed to be op en ed only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
 They are marked and numbered on the plan A ppendix I .

        28. U nlike the Kop end. the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
     fences at right angles to it. d ivid ing the area into pens. T his d ivision was begun after an FA C up sem i-final in
     1 9 8 1 when crushing occurred d ue to.overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It p roceeded in stages, the final
     arrangement being shown on the plan A ppendix I . T he first section o f the west terracing m oving south to north
     contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as p ens I and 2 although in fact constituting on ly o n e pen. N ext is pen 3
     with one gate: next pen 4 with on e gate; pen 5. which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
     divid e pen 4 from pen 6. T h is w as to isolate h om e and away fans on occasion s w hen both m ight be
     accom m odated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west com er. Pens 5 , 6
     and 7 cach have a perimeter gate. At the back o f the pens, under the front o f the west stand, there is a gate in
each radial fence. W hen those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to permit access from
pen to pen along the w hole west side, In practice, when substantial num bers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible. T he present layout o f the pens, fences, crush barriers and gates has resulted from a
series o f piecem eal changes. The nature and effect o f those changes m ust be considered later.

T he Turnstiles
   29. Because o f the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road N orth there are som e 4 6 turnstiles w hich usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end o f the north stand. T hey are marked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. T h e 12 num bered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters o f the
two team s as appears later. Two o f them . 77 and 78. were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south sid e o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (num bered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summary, the south and east sides o f the ground accom m od ated som e 2 9 .8 0 0 w hose access on the
day was through 6 0 turnstiles.

  32. T he other tw o sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 2 4 .2 5 6 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. M ost supporters were expected to com e by road although rail transport was available. N ottingham
supporters travelling by train w ould arrive at the m ain line Sheffield M idland Station w hence they would be
directed and escorted northwards by the police. T hey w ould arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
N ottingham supporters travelling by coach, m ini-bus or car w ould approach Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground w ould predom inantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive at Sheffield M idland Station just
like their N ottingham counterparts. T he police aim ed to segregate the rival fans and put them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. T h o se com in g from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M 62 and down the M 1 from the north or across the Pennines from the north west. All
such routes w ould bring them to the ground via o n e or other lim b o f Leppings Lane as shown on A ppendix I.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west: arrivals from N ottingham
would be from the south and east.

Allocation o f P laces and T ickets
   35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
o f rival team s. T h e need for this policy to be m aintained was endorsed and em phasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford C ity disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 sem i-final the police decided
that sections o f the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
Liverpool and N ottingham Forest fans. T he section to be granted to each was determ ined by the direction
whence each p redom inantly approached. Thus. Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides o f the ground
for which access was from L eppings Lane. N ottingham Forest were allotted the south and east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

   36. T he effect o f the d ecision was that for this all-ticket C up Tie. Liverpool were allotted on ly 2 4 .2 56 places
as against 2 9 .8 0 0 for N ottingham Forest. This, although average attendance o f supporters at hom e m atches
was substantially higher at Liverpool than at N ottingham . Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
£12, N ottingham Forest had 2 1 .0 0 0 standing places com pared with Liverpool’s 10.100. So, Liverpool’s
allocation was more exp en sive as well as smaller. Understandably. Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places and tickets. T hey sought with som e support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
1988. but the police were adam ant. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
crossing each other's paths w hen approaching the ground thereby frustrating attem pts at segregation and
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989, when the sam e plan was proposed. Liverpool again challenged it. The
police, however, m aintained their view, adding that those w ho had attended in 1988 would be familiar with the
arrangements and that any change would lead to confusion.


                                                            5
A ccess from Leppings Lane
   37. As the plan A ppendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
a bend in Leppings Lane where, co m in g from the north, it turns to the south-west and        crosses*bridge over ihc
river D on. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west o f the ground They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both lim bs o f Leppings Lane and w ould converge o n the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f double gates Inside
those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs Appendix 2 the
latter are in tw o sections d ivided by a fence. T h e northern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. N um bers 1 lo
 10 gave access to the north stand. T h u s there were 10 turnstiles for the 9 .7 0 0 w ith north stand seats. T heir
tickets were m arked “ Entrance A” and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles I to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.                       ~ -

   38. Turnstiles 1 1 to 16 were for th ose with seats in the west stand. T hus 4 ,4 5 6 were served by six turnstiles.
They were the next block to the right o f those marked A. However, instead o fth e se turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being marked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were marked C. T h eir colour-code on
tickets and boards was red.

   39. O n the other side o f the d iv id in g fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10 . 10 0 with tickets for the west terracing. T h ose seven turnstiles were labelled A to G . T his was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering con tinu ed from 19 upwards
on the south side o f the ground. W hen the num ber at Leppings Lane was brought up to 2 3 the present
arrangements o f I to 1-6, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G w as a large letter B. "Entrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. Thus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane en d read from
left to right A, C, B. T he colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was m auve.
To the right o f turnstile G is a tubulai steel barrier to divid e the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
on Appendix 1) between turnstile I and the adjacent housing.

  4 1. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate h om e and away fans at a
time when the Club intended they sh ould share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
remained. There was. however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the tw o areas. A n exit
gate (marked B on A ppendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

  42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
m entioned and on the right by the wall o f the private roadway com ing trcm the south stand to Leppings Lane.
There was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on A ppendix I ) just inside turnstile G.

  43. All three exit gates. A. B and C. w ere o f concertina design. They could be o p en ed o n ly from the inside
and were not intended for entry o f spectators into the ground.

   44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three option s once inside the ground. T hey could by
 moving to the right go round the south en d o f the west stand and gain entry into p ens 1 and 2. They could go
 through the gap in the divid ing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 1 1 to 16 and then round the north
 end o f the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there w e r e no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either o f
 those courses. T he o b v io u s way in was straight ahead o f the turnstiles where a tunnel under the m idd le o f the
 west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. A bove its entrance in large letters was the word "Standing and a large
 letter “B*\ Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

    45. The length o f the tunnel is so m e 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels o f f but finally d escends
 towards the terraces at a gradient o f 1 in 6. A s it em erges o n to the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
 fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short spur o f brick wall projects forward from each side
 o f the tunnel at its m outh. Those em erging are thus guided straight forward rather than to either side. The
 photograph at A ppendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

   46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
 them was effected by a series o f piecem eal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.
Q

    Policing Arrangements
      47. At the 1988 sem i-final, policing had been under the control o f C h ief Superintendent M ole, then
    Com m ander o f F D iv isio n w ithin w hose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
    the FA broached the 1989 sem i-final, but he was due to hand over com m and o f F D iv isio n on 27 March to
    Superintendent D uckenfield on the latter’s prom otion to C h ief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
    m eeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr M ole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. U nd er him were
    Scctor C om m anders, all Superintendents with m uch experience o f policing football m atches at Hillsborough
    and elsewhere. In particular. Superintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside the Leppings Lane
    entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent G reenw ood was in com m and inside the ground, but this
    included the area betw een the turnstiles and the perim eter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
    previous year. U nd er Mr D uckenfield’s overall com m and were som e 801 officers and m en on duty at the
    ground plus traffic officers and others from D D iv isio n to deal with the influx o f supporters into the city centre.
    In all. therefore, som e 1.122 police were deployed for this match am ounting to about 38 per cent o f the total
    South Yorkshire force. Included in the m ounted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool and N ottingham to
    assist respectively in marshalling their h om e supporters. The total at the ground was d ivid ed into serials
    consisting usually o f eight to ten C onstables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. T he serials were posted to duties
    at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the m atch. All o f this
    was provided for in an Operational Order w hich followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 sem i-final
    and took into account the force's “Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football G rounds”. T he Order
    described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplem ented by oral briefings before and on the day o f
    the match.

    Sheffield Wednesday's Arrangements
      48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatem en and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
    were briefed as to their duties on the m orning o f the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
    ground. They wore yellow tabards. T he Club's control room , situated below the south stand, could
    com m unicate by V H F radio with the stewards. C losed circuit television was installed by the Club with
    screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A com puterised counting system was
    incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed o n to a screen in the Club control room the running total o f
    spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end. there w ould be
    separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10(north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
    (west terraces). W hen the total for any section w as w ithin 15 per cent o f its permitted capacity a warning pulse
    showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning w ould occur when the num bers were within 15 per
    ccnt o f the total terrace capacity o f 10.100. W hat the system could not d o was m onitor the distribution o f fans
    on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore i f on e pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

    Police Communications
       49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west co m e r o f the
    ground between the south stand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. T i e box is elevated and reached by a num ber
    o f steps. It has w indow s com m anding views across the pitch and straight ait ng the line o f the west perimeter
    fcnce. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control o f it
    and was advisor to Mr D uckenfield as he had been to Mr M ole the year before. N ext to him sat Sergeant
    Goddard w ho operated the radios. The third seat was for Police C onstable Ryan who operated the telephone
    and public address system s. At the back o f the box stood Police C onstable Bichard w ho was in control o f the
    police closed circuit television system operated by a row o f con soles on a bench in front o f him and behind the
    three seated officers.

       50. There were five television screens showing view s o f five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
    stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
    rotation from on e cam era view to another and w hich m ade a v id eo recording. The cameras have a zoo m t w o
    facility to close in on any point o f interest. Specifically, there were good camera views o f the west terracing, o f ,) t   N$
    the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

      51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
    ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box. to relay
    music before the m atch, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
    speakers or i f appropriate to on e area only.




                                                               7
   53.     R ad io contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a W1 F U portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator's bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
C o m m u n ity C onstables on duty would already have their own. Other C onstables had no radio.
C o m m u n ica tio n w as on “talk through" i.e. any m essage from any source w ould be heard by everyone tuned in
and if m ore than o n e source spoke messages could becom e garbled. Ear pieces were issued to som e officers in
an attem pt to overcom e the loud crowd n oise w hich m ade receipt o f signals very difficult. There were other
radio ch an nels o p en to Sergeant Goddard: V H F to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
S ub -d ivisional H eadquarters at H am m erton Road and channel 19 used by C ID . There was also a sel tuned to
Sheffield W ednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                      I was           on       the           pitch after                the    g am e    w as     s t op p e d ,     from about           3.20       pm

                      At        about          vg ,Si^piTi (153Q)                   I helped            s om e    other        f an s     to   carry      one       of    the

                      casualties                    on        one       of   the        advertising              b o ar ds ,        We    picked        him    up    from a

                    pitch and             handed         h im    o ve r       to       the         police           officer     in     the       centre          c i rc l e

                    of    the       pitch.          In fact,              what         happened               was      as   we w e n t      to    t a ke        the

                    them       looked         at    the       c a s u a l t y we              h ad a n d        said,       " I t's    no      use,        he    is d e a d

i   .           Cleave          h im      there,"         so     we       just         put         the       board      down    on     the       g ro u nd .

                 ALL-SEATING POLICY AT FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS

                 Thank you for your letter of 18 May enclosing a submission on
                 All-Seated Stadia and the Taylor Report from the Parliamentary
                 All-Party Football Committee. I am grateful for the considered
                 way in which the Committee has put forward its case.

                 Later today I will be announcing that I have been re-examining
                 the Government's policy requiring all Football League grounds to
                 go all-seater in accordance with the recommendations of the
                 Taylor Report. We continue to support the principles of improved
                 spectator safety and comfort which were set out by Lord Justice
                 Taylor in his final report on the Hillsbrough Stadium disaster.

                 However, I have decided that it would be wrong to reconsider
                 either the principle or the timetable for all-seating at First
                 Division grounds in the Football League (the new Premier League)
                 WV        P I Murt rr r -'-n i u i >* i n n   g r w in r ii   ii-v 'hhn   sh   F n n th a .1 1   T .p a r m e .
                 It is essential that our top clubs meet the standards necessary
                 to compete in Europe and make full use of the resources available
                 to them to provide grounds of which we can all be proud of as we
                 enter the 21st Century. I am also fully committed to the
                 principle of all-seating for the great majority of Second
                 Division Clubs.

                 The review will therefore concentrate on whether the retention of
                 standing accommodation should be permitted at some grounds in
                 Divisions Three and Fourth, and if so whether this should be in
                 all cases (subject to the FLA determining that the terracing is
                 safe), or on the basis of a fixed capacity threshold, as you
                 suggest.
         SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NATIONAL HERITAGE




Before coining to a decision I shall be taking representations
from other interested bodies. I shall also of course consider the
arguments put forward by the Committee.

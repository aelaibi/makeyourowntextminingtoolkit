Liverpool.     Tel

At    1030 hrs on S at ur da y    15th April       1989   (150489)      I picked my two

friends    up from their       home addresses        in my    car which       is a

re gis tra tio n                  We     eventu all y     left for the match about 1100

hrs.     We tra velled from                       along   the M57 to M62

w her e we ex pe ri enc ed a t h r e e quarter       of an hour delay,          due to t h e

volume of traffic,        I think as there was            no other     obvious       reason why we

were    delayed.      On the way to the ground we didn't                 stop and did not

notice any other        support ers      consuming alcohol.

On the way to S h e f fi el d we mi s se d the turning              off the m o t o r w ay and

ended up in Sh ef fi el d town          centre,    near the end of the football                   ground

ment    for the No tt i n g h a m Forest supporter.           We    picked up directi ons               for

Liverpool     supporters,      this was about        1345 hrs to        1400 hrs.

We eve nt ua ll y    parked about a mile from the ground having                      tried to          park,

nearer and being mo ve d on by the            police and di rected to the                  car

parking area where        the Liv erpool      coaches were.           We e v ent ua lly ar riv ed

there about        1425 hrs.     As we were       late we    ran to the ground and

fo llo wed the      crowds w hi ch at this        time were    quite     considerable.                There

was a police        presence   but we     received no particular             directions          or

escort,    however     there wasn 't any      real      need as     it was    just a matter             of

following     the    crowd.    I ar ri ve d with my two friends at the turnstile

area about     1440 hrs                            split up from                      and    I as       he

was    going to the seated area.            My first      impressions        on arr iv in g at the

turnsti les was one       complete m a y h e m .     There were       thousands       of    people

trying to get        into only a few turnstiles.              The    gates    before t h e

turnstiles were        closed,    and    in front of those gates were a mass                      of

people    pushing towards        them.     The other      side of the gates was              full as

well.     Initially     I starte d to queue at the West               stand turnstile and

looking at the tickets           trying to find the          correct entrance.              The

entrance we wante d wasn't act ua ll y signed or we                   c o u l d n ’t find    it but

                                                                                                     S1622

by a process of el im i na ti o n we found the                 correct    entrance and joined

the    crowds outside       the gates         in front of the terraces               turnstiles.            The

crowd were       pushing and there was quite a crush and the gates were

being o pened and         closed by a pol iceman all owi ng a few                    in at a time           but

sometimes     the surge was           so strong the gate         c o u l d n ’t be    closed and a

po l ic em an on a horse        had to       come to his assistance.            Also      in that area

was a policewoman.            I d i d n ’t see her doing anything,              in fact            she

looked very frightened.

As the    crowd were moving            forward    I e ve ntu al ly    came to the gate whi ch

was    closed and     I was     being       pushed up against the fence w hi ch was

hurting    so as soon as         I got a bit of space            1 climbed over           the gate

with                and    into the      crowd    in front of the turnstiles.                       At this

time    it was about       1455 hrs and we         resigned ourselves           to the fact that

we w e r e n ’t going to get         in on time and moved to the               right away from

the    crowd to wait      for    it to die down.           We wai te d there for what                    seemed

a minute and then realised that the gate to the side of the turnsti les

was    open wi th   people      pointing at       it.    We    ran forward and throug h the

gate.     We were sl ig ht ly        in front of the main            crowd on going through

the gate.        I c a n ’t remember        seeing any     police officers or stewards.                       I

also    d i d n ’t see any other        gates    open or being opened.               I did see

people    climbing over the dividing               fence      betwe en the West stand seating

turnst ile s and the terraces               turnstiles.       This   d o e s n ’t allow entry              into

the ground only        into the queues           before the terrace          turnstiles.                 I also

remember    seeing the gate            in front of the turnst il es            being opened and a

surge of     people    coming        in coming through the           side gate.         I d i d n ’t hand
                                                                                      ________ r
my ticket     in and      I have     now handed that ticket            to POL P C                  ________

who att ac h e d a label        to    it and    I have   initialled that             label with

and signed       it exhibit      ref    (           >.

On going     through the gate           I came    into the area        in front of the tunnel.

To my    right    I could see the stairs            leading to the West stand seating

area.       I could see some       stewards there.           This area was        quite    empty and

people were      looking at their tickets.              In front       of me was     the tunnel

and through the tunnel            I could see the       pitch and a few football

players.       At the front of the tunnel             i.e the entrance           I c a n ’t remember

seeing any stewards         or    police officers.           I d i d n ’t look at the

di rections     or my ticket,       as far as       I was    concerned     I could see the

ground and the tunnel            leading to       it and that was where           I was going.            I

went      down the tunnel    and    inside were       other    people     but    I had a free

passage and there was            nothing to be a l ar me d about.           As    I approached

the exit of the tunnel            into    pens three and four          I could see        it was

ex t re me ly full and     I thought       it would be best to stay at the back.

Fr o m    behind us people       started    coming    in and we were        pushed forward.

There was      no way we    could have fought agains t             it.    The     pressure     began

to build up and there were times when                  I d i d n ’t even have my feet on

the ground.       We were    pushed and       crushed wi t h i n a few seconds down

toward the front fence o f pen t h r e e .             I had d i ffi cu lty       in breathing

and my reaction was         to get out.           In front of me was a gate and               I was

a bo ut   three feet aw a y fro m that gate and about               nine or ten people              in

depth.       In front of me there were            people up against         that f e n c e,

li terally squashed up again st             it.    Some with their         back a g ain st     it

wi t h their    faces towards me.          Those with their         faces towards me were

purple and with eyes         bulging.        They were       propped up by others aro un d

them and      in some   cases     their    heads were       stre tc he d backwards.

At the gate      leading on to the          pitch were       several     policemen trying           to_

get the gate o p e n .      They ap pe ar ed to have          some diffi cu lti es and then

the gate      opened and a surge of          people to our        right    pushed me to my

left.       I d i d n ’t see or know that the barrier had broken.                    I was     pushed

to the dividing fence            on our    left and    I was about        two    in depth away

from this.

At this      time a man was       rolled over the top of us,              he was    in his
                                                                                             PAGE               5
                                                                                             S1622

twenties and all         that    I can remember          is that his eyes were           closed and

his face was       purple.       He was    passed over our heads to the                 perimeter

fence.     I c o u l d n ’t a c t u a l ly get my hands         up to help.      I saw him       reach

the fence and everyone was shouting                     to    people that were a l r e a d y on the

pitch to get him over.             I saw two men run over from the                    pitch and          pull

him over    the fence onto the            pitch.        Imm ed iat el y after    that    there was a

young    boy,   about    12 - 14 y r s old,        wearin g      blue tracksuit t r o u s e r s ,

lying on top of us,          he was   partly on my shoulder and he was                    rolled and

passed forward.          I d i d n ’t see anythin g           of his face.      He was    pulled

over    the fence     in the same manner as the man before                     him.

At this    point my      cousin was       still    in front of me and his glasses                    fell

off and they were trappe d between him and the next                           person,    there

w a s n ’t anywhere     for them to fall.              I was    shouting,     "get us out."

My   hands were     pinned agains t my chest.                  I looked down at my hands and

could see that they were            purple.        I began to        panic then and feel

light    headed.      I. also    remember     seeing a press          photographer       in front of

the fence on the         pitch just standing             there taking        photographs.        I

remember    looking      to the    right and seeing             the gate open to the        pitch

but for some       reason it didn't         seem as          if anyone was     going out.

We stopped ourselves            pani cking and         resolved ourselves        to just    standing

there,    as the    pressure      sli ghtly    lessened we         climbed onto one of the

barriers    in the stand and then as               it fil tered away we made             our way to

the tunnel.        In the tunnel      people were             stood at the sides and        police

officers were       running      up and down,          some    carrying     bodies.     There were

also    supporters      doing the same.           My    cousin was still wi t h me and               I

felt    in a daze.       We w al k e d through the tunnel             and    into the area of the

turnstiles.        I d i d n ’t see anything           that was an offence        taking    place.

We sat down      inside the ground          in front of the West stand seating

turnsti les     in a daze and e v ent ua lly            left on our own acc or d out         of a

gate whi ch was open by the turnstile.                        We went to a pr e- arranged

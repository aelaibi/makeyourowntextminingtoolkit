 SUBJECT:     S1HI FINAL - D DIVISION PLANNING


Chief Inspector Bettison, who is engaged on the HQ semi final      enquiry
t e a m , has requested that I submit a report on the above subject to his
office urgently and in any event before      27 April 1989.

INTRODUCTION - D DIVISION OPERATIONS PL ANN ING

Presently   myself and PC 916 Bradley are responsible for          the  initial
planning of D1 sub divisional policing response to events which            occur
within  the   sub d i v i s i o n . Occasionally we plan the response  for   the
whole  division   when the manpower commitment is large, such as           for   a
Royal visit or major march/procession which affects D1 and D 2 .

First         knowledge        of  events    is gained        in     several    ways,    from
c o r r e s pond ence, media r e p o r t s , poster c a m p a i g n s , telephone calls   and
there        are   many which recur a n n u a l l y . Once we have         knowledge  of   an
event        which appears to require police act ion a report is made                 to   the
sub divisional commander . He then instructs the course which will                         be
taken which ranges from advising the organisers to preparation of an
operational         o r d e r . FGO and FSOs are consulted and adhered             to where
applicable,

Once   it has been decided that an order will be prepared the event             is
programmed into the D1 planning s y s t e m . A file is opened and a number
of   customised forms are c o m p l e t e d . Key da tes are entered  in the  sub
divisional diaries and the event assigned a unique event n u m b e r . It is
not   unusual  to  have several events           being   planned  simultaneously,
presently there are 8 " live" files being handled by the of fice.

Thereafter   meetings are held with all interested parties and           regular
reports   made  to     the      sub  divisional  (and  somet imes   d ivis ion a l )
commander   to keep them u p d a t e d . The usual method is for a minute      to
be  attached   to    the       event  working file  showing   the up    to date
position.We also liaise with statutory undertakers, PSV operators, and
the emergency services as a matter of course and in the week prior               to
the  event itself pro - forma letters are sent to PSV           operators    and
the emergency s e r v i c e s .

Using the directions given me in the frequent planning discussions and
minutes on file written by the sub divisional commander I then draw up
a draft operational o r d e r . Experience and divisional policy  is used
to  deploy the manpower invol v e d . The first draft is then submitted  to
the  sub divisional   commander (or divisional       command er) who  will
request amendments  or sign the o r d e r .
At that point the order is copied    and published.


The event then takes place and usua lly an officer from the office     is
involved in the actual execution.

Following the event de brief information is recorded and the  original
file along with the working papers is filed for future reference.


 1989 SEMI FINAL PLANNING

First knowledge of the event was gained from media reports on 21 March
1989. Our initial response was to open two files, one headed   manpower
and   one headed semi final. Certain customised forms were  completed
and the event given a unique number . On the face of it D Division
would   be required to mount a similar operation to the one mounted   in
1988 when (excluding traffic points in D Division) 200 men were used.

I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent King who told me to begin
planning our operation based on the 1988 operation. After that meeting
I consulted the sub divisional duty books and realised that it would
be difficult to raise the manpower wholly from D Division officers due
to annual leave and courses.

On   22 March 1989 myself, PS              and PC 916 Bradley attended    a
joint planning meeting at Hammerton Koad Police Station. Also present
were   officers   from HQ Ops, Dog/Mounted   section,  British Transport
Police,   and   representatives  from  British   Rail,  South    Yorkshire
Transport   and other organisations. Chief Superintendent Mole     chaired
the   meeting.   Basically the outcome of that meeting was    that  the   D
Division   commitment would be the same as in 1988 with the     exception
that Ops and Traffic would be accepting responsibility for all match
traffic in the South Yorkshire Police area on 15 April 1989.

At  the  meeting  I arranged further  meetings  with  South Yorkshire
Transport, British Transport Police, British Rail and Road Traffic .

On  23 March   1989 myself and PC 916 Bradley attended   the  first  of
several  meetings  we were to have with Road Traffic   to discuss   the
traffic  policing in D Division. It was agreed that Inspector   Scholey
would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions
would "second" officers to traffic on 15 April 1989.   It was estimated
that traffic would require 30+ D Division Constables on 15 April 1989.

I discussed the developments with A/Superintendent King and         informed
him of the requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic in addition
to   the 200 we   would      probably need in D Division for our operation.
also   informed     him that   raising the total    in house   was proving
difficult   and    that      cancellation  of WL might berequired.   It  was
decided   at that point - 28 March 1989 - to ask D Division      to   supply
volunteers   to   work       on WL as an   alternative tocancellation.   The
request was circulated and produced more officers.
 I had several meetings with Inspector Mabbott of the British                      Transport
  in the „??• * 1 S ° ^              f r °" B r i t i s h R a i l - The —   tings took   p u ce
 Bri t ^ Q h R « ? 8S a?2 P latf?rns a* Mid l and Station. The outcome was               that
   ri ish Rail would be using the sane tactics as in 1988 to deal                       with
                 hT      f ^ns at the station         except       that   Inspector  Mabbott
        a ly Rec li n ed      to have his nen segreg at in g Liverpool            fans   from
        irap 8 ^ nfi p V bllc on the Platf or ns prior to exit from the              South
 Luggage Exit as in the past. This task was to be left to us.( However
 two days before the operation we received the British Transport Police
 order which stated that BTP would after all segregate the fans on the
 5 i ™ ° r? Sn rJ -S - co" t^ad icted our order but the new                 information   was
 given at D Division briefing on 15 April 1989).

f , a ?;so       Mr               ^ of South Yorkshire Transport who told me
that       last   year a fleet of 35 busses transported fans     to and     from
Midland       Station.    On the outward trip 41 full   loads   of Nottingham
supporters        were   carried  and 11 full loads of Liverpool      fans   were
carried         On return 8 Liverpool loads were carried and 37 Nottingham
loads        The outward figures showed that approximately 4160        fans   had
been       taken to    the ground   and that 3600 had returned.    (It   is   not
unusual       for   fans to walk back due to congestion). The     figures    also
showed that 17 busses had managed a return trip on the outward leg and
tnat 1U had managed a return trip on the return leg.

South   Yorkshire Transport regularly transport fans to SWFC from        the
Midland    Station. Police escorts are always requested and it is      usual
to   deploy    two   officers   to a full   bus.  This  was  discussed   with
A/ Superintendent      King and he decided that two officers per bus   would
of *f®d -,5°ru ^ he °P eration bu t that if possible they were to return   to
Sheffield    Midland for a "return load". It was hoped that      this  would
save   manpower. That meant that on 1988 figures at least 104 officers
would be required for PSV escorts.

On   29 March 1989 I received a request from PC 808 Rosevear      (HQ   Ops)
for    D manpower to work at SWFC on 15 April 1989. After speaking      with
A/Superintendent      King  I informed PC Rosevear that it would    not   be
              for. ?  Division  to  supply any  staff  as we   were   having
di ffi cu lt y raising manpower for our in house needs on the day.

On the 4 April 1989 Road Traffic requested 35 Constables and 4 Traffic
wardens  from D Division. They were to report at Brightside Lane   by
0800 on the 15 April 1989. I subsequently warned 35 officers who were
all D2 Constables.

Also   by 4 April    1989 I   informed  A/Superintendent   King    that
cancellation of WL was then  needed as we were still some 40  officers
short.  He consulted with Chief Superintendent Broomhead and WL on   15
April was cancelled for D Division officers on that day

All D Division staff - with few exceptions - were now included in    the
planning.  Court   staff,   Charge  Office staff,  CID Aides  and   some
administrative   officers had been included. Cancellation of WL   raised
most of the shortfall but we were obliged to go to PC 808 Rosevear for
17  officers. Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform    for
the  day.  Given   that   they were  "strangers"  none were  eventually
deployed other than on PSV escort duties.

On 5 April 1989 I had a meeting with A/Superintendent King. I told him
that   I had raised enough manpower for the operation    envisaged which
would   take    in public order patrols on 14 and 15 April,  patrols  in
Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15 April 1989. One problem was that     we
had a surfeit of Sergeants and it was decided that two per PSV     serial
would be allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have     two
officers.    At   that  point  allocation of  responsibility  for  the D
Division senior officers involved was decided by A/Superintendent King
wh ich I noted for inclusion on the order.

On   or around the 5 April 1989 I contacted Inspector Sewell at FI        and
confirmed the unloading points for the PSVs. I also informed him that
the   escort serials would amount to 110+ and that they were        available
as a reserve dur in g the match i t s e l f . He told me to have them report
to the Gymnas iu m at SWFC and that they would be given a hot meal after
half   time.  I noted the information for inclusion         in  the draft    D
Division order. PC 916 Bradley sent a Gen 2 containing the information
to Inspector Sewell via Chief Superintendent Broomhead on 8 April 1989

By   this time serial make up and deployment had been decided. We     had
also made requests for the attendance of mounted officers ,dog section
staff   and   arranged  for a Brimac vehicle to be on   standby.  It   was
apparent that we would need extra vehicles and requests for these were
made   through   HQ Traffic Management. Also requests    for  radios   and
repeater    sets  were made. 1 radio between 2 officers was   to be    the
issue.   A   logistics  team was appointed   to  manage   all the    extra
equipment from collection to issue and return.

Meals   were ordered for all concerned and the PSV escort serials   were
to  be given a hot drink and packed meal at briefing in case they di
not   receive their hot meal at SWFC due to being utilised. Hot   drinks
were also laid on at Sheffield Midland.

On   7 April 1989 I drew up a draft operational order. I gave    it  to
A/Superintendent   King on 8 April 1989 for his amendments. On 9 April
1989   A/Superintendent King returned the order to me with some
changes. These were incorporated into the 2nd draft which I submit e
to   him on 10 April 1989. This copy was read by  Superintendent  Bates
who signed the order that day. It was then copied and distributed.

At   around that date I attended a final planning meeting at Hammerton
Road   which was chaired by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. My input
to the meeting was the arrangements made for PSV escorts.

In  the   final  days run up to the  operation  the  office    published
several   other  unconnected orders. As is common on orders    whic    us®
large   numbers  of officers changes had to be made to the    semi   final
order serials   as circumstances dictated. Consequently it was necessary
to update   the  master  serial list by hand. A copy of  that    list   is
attached and reflects the make up of the serials as they were deployed
on  15 April 1989. The new information was passed     to  the   officers
involved   both prior to and at the main briefing. Efficiency was      not
compromised.
All supervisors were sent an advance copy of the order on the 10 April
1989 as were surrounding Divisions, HQ, Specialists and B T P . In common
wit h  normal practice spare copies were available at briefing as were
displ ay ed copies of the serial lists and deployments. A pile of    SWFC
maps were also made available for those unfamiliar with the ground.

A   total  of 12 serials were sent to SWFC totaling  120  officers   of
wh ich 19 were sergeants. Inspectors Harper and Dews accompanied   them.
In D Division (excluding traffic points) 46 officers were deployed    on
pub lic order and Pond Street duties over a three day operation.

As for the order itself the main strategy and pol ic y was laid down   by
A/Superintendent King. I attended to the detail and liaison with other
divis io ns and outside organisations.  The working papers and   original
copy    of   the order is filed in E Group office  at  West  Bar   Police
Stat i o n .

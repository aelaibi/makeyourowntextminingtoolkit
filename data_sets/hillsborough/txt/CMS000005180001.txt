                     Thank you for your letter of 1 March to the Secretary of State
                     about the financing of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations on
                     football ground safety and the planning issues surrounding the
                     development of new and existing grounds.
                     The Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement in his Budget
                     Statement about the reduction of Pool Betting Duty reflects the
                     Government's concern to ensure that vital improvements to
                     football grounds are made for the safety and comfort of
                     spectators.   I have noted the remarks attributed to you in the
                     Times article of 22 March. It is most encouraging that you have
                     responded so positively and constructively to the Chancellor's
                     proposal, and that both yourselves and the FA showed such
                     willingness at the recent meeting with the Lord Ferrers to work
                     with    Government   to    implement   Lord    Justice   Taylor's
                     recommendations as quickly as possible.      Not least of these
                     improvements is of course the introduction of all-seater stadia.
                     I regret that I was unable to attend the meeting on 4 April. I
                     know that the issue of planning permission for new and
                     redeveloped grounds was raised.    My office will be getting in
                     touch with yours and with Graham Kelly's to arrange a meeting in
                     order to explore this issue further.
                 j   I am copying this letter to Graham.

 1.   As requested, in your minute of 11 April I attach an amended
 draft which takes account of the meeting held between the League,
 FA and the Home Secretary since Mr Ellingford's submission of 23
 March.
 2.   the Letter of 1 March from Arthur Sandford, Chief Executive
 of the Football League, asks the Secretary of State for a meeting
 to discuss finance for the Taylor recommendations oh football
 ground safety and planning, issues regarding hew and existing
 stadia.
 3.   Finance/ has of course been overtaken by the Chancellor's
 concession on Pool Betting Duty. The Minister will have seen the
 Times report of 22 March (attached at Flag A) which reports Mr
 Sandford's welcome for the concession.   Mr Sandford is reported
 as saying that the League will respond by 'drawing up a total
 strategy to meet the requirements of the Taylor report'.
 4.   At the meeting with the Lord Ferrers on 4 April,, the issue
 of planning permission for new and redeveloped football grounds
 was raised (paragraph 11 of minutes at Flag B). It was left that
.it would be a matter for the football authorities to pursue
 separately with the Minister.      They wirll undoubtedly want to
,discuss this issue before" the Secretary of State sees Mr Sandford
 in July., A draft Planning Policy Guidance Note on Sport and
 Recreation will, I understand, be with the Minister soon and it
 will contain advice which SARD/has contributed to on this matter.
 A meeting ;with the football authorities in early May might
 therefore be timely.

NOTE OF A MEETING HELD ON WEDNESDAY 4 APRIL WITH REPRESENTATIVES

                            Mr J Dent - Secretary           }



Lord Ferrers opened the meeting by first of all apologising on
behalf of the Home Secretary, (who the- delegation had expected to
meet with) for not being able to meet with them this afternoon.
Mr Millichip said that he and his colleagues fully appreciated the
pressures placed on the Home Secretary's diary. They were
delighted to be able to meet with Lord Ferrers.

2.   Mr Kelly referred to Mr Millichip's letter of 19 February and
said that he hoped its contents had indicated the F A 's and the
FL s joint desire to bring in the recommendations made in
kord Justice Taylor s Final Report following Hillsborough. Their
views on Lord Justice Taylor's report had been referred to in
their correspondence and it was suggested that those views should
form the agenda for today's meeting.


Football Licensing Authority (FLA) and Seating

    ^ ord.Ferrers explained that the FLA would be set up on 1 June
and that it was the intention that it would be up and running as
soon as was reasonably possible thereafter.  It would, it was
proposed, comprise of a Chairman and 4 to 8 members who would have
background in such areas as the police, the fire service and
engineering. Although it was the original intention for the FLA
to be set up by the Department of the Environment it was now
likely that it would be a Home Office responsibility.

4.   Mr Millichip said that the FA and the FL had always taken the
view that local authorities were responsible for safety
Nevertheless in the light of Lord Justice Taylor's Report the FA
and the FL felt it right that they should play a constructive role


                                             /even though
                            CONFIDENTIAL




even though they had no statutory powers.    Lord Ferrers welcomed
this responsible approach.

5.   Mr Fox was concerned that the FLA would not be in place
before 1 June and that it would not actually be up and running
immediately because fundamental decisions by the clubs had to be
taken during the close season, especially on seating. Without any
guidelines the difficulty was that the types of seats which the
clubs would be putting in place and the associated work, might be
considered unsuitable. It was, Mr Fox said, essential that clubs
got it right otherwise it could be an extremely expensive
operation to put right. He was reminded by Mr Mould that building
work would need to comply with the requirements of Building
Regulations.

6.   Mr Fox asked whether the time requirement for seating to be
implemented in the first year was to be absolutely rigid and, for
example, whether if a club were in the process of building a new
stadium, they would be expected to reduce standing in their
existing ground during, say, construction time which could take 3
years.   Mr Fox felt this would be unreasonable. Lord Ferrers, in
repiy said that clearly the existing stadiums would have to have
adequate safety measures in place, but h e felt some flexibility
might be afforded where it was clear that in building a new
stadium a club involved were achieving the objective of providing
all seated accommodation within the expected timescale. He could
not, however, give an assurance at this stage that any such
flexibility could be as wide as that suggested by Mr Fox.

7.   Mr Sandford said that the FL were not asking for any
relaxation of the schedule for implementing all seating in normal
circumstances but only in the sort of cases which Mr Fox had
raised. Mr Millichip said he did not believe all seater-stadia to
be the panacea to all the problems within football but he
appreciated why it was considered to be necessary.

New Offences

     ^    Millichip said that he would like to think it possible
to      h6 Ypes of behaviour which Lord Justice Taylor had referred
    1I?, ls reP0rt, eg, obscene chanting and racist abuse would be
 ff:S er     by the Government with a view to making it a criminal
    ence. Lord Ferrers replied that the behaviour referred to by
 or     ustice Taylor, ie, invading the pitch without reasonable
excuse and coin throwing, were already caught in general terms by
  e ublic Order Act 1986. The difficulty in charging individuals



                                           /for such offences....

                              CONFIDENTIAL




   for such offences was that when they did occur they could involve
   say 100 or so people at a time. It was therefore sometimes
   difficult for the police to make the right decision as to what to
   do. In some cases if the police did try to do something about a
   particular incident the result could be that the situation was
   exacerbated. Lord Justice Taylor's idea was entirely correct but
   the application of it was rather more difficult.
   9.   Mr Millichip mentioned that when he had been called to No 10,
   following the troubles at the European Championships, he had
   complained to the Frime Minster that young inexperienced
   prosecution barristers were not bringing to the attention of the
   magistrates, when dealing with football related offences, the
   options which were available to them when dealing with such
   offenders. The result of this was that those who had committed
   offences were leaving the courts without being punished and
   heading straight back to football.

   Financial Provision

  10. Mr Fox said that all of football were delighted with the
  Chancellor's budget announcement which reduced the pools betting
  tax. For their part the aim was to redistribute the money which
  they put into football, from television rights; to impose a 5%
  transfer levy; and to allocate the money from the FA into ground
  improvements. This information was not yet public and was given
  in confidence. Lord Ferrers congratulated them on their efforts
  in this regard.


  Planning Permission

  11. Rather than put their concerns to the Home Office on this
  issue Lord Ferrers advised the delegation that this was a matter
  which Mr Moynihan had proposed to deal with at the meeting. But
  like the Home Secretary he had been at the last minute unable to
  attend. Mr Moynihan had asked Lord Ferrers to say that his office
  would be in touch with the FA and the FL to set up a separate
  meeting. It was agreed that this would be more suitable.

  Inter-Departmental Working Group

  12. Mr Sandford asked whether it would be possible to set up an
  inter-departmental working group. The reason for this request was
  that the FL found themselves having to negotiate with different
  Departments at different buildings and it wasn't easy for them to

                                               /do this....

                                  CONFIDENTIAL



  do this. Lord Ferrers was cautious about this idea but he agreed
  to give it further thought.

  13. Lord Ferrers in concluding the meeting thanked the FA and the
  FL for having explained those matters of concern to them so
  clearly. There were one or two matters which needed further
  thought from his officials and they would be in touch about this.

implementing Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r ' s recommendations w h e r e b y ,
p r o g r e s s i v e l y , a l l c l u b s w i l l move tow ards a l l s e a t e r s t a d i a . It
s hould not go unnoticed h ow e ver that many of Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r ' s
ot h er recommendations w i l l a l s o incur c o n s i d e r a b l e e x p e n d it u r e by c l u b s .
  I know th at a f ig u re of £130M has been mentioned as t h e p r i c e for
implementing th e T aylo r recommendations regarding a l l s e a t e r s t a d i a .
T h is f ig u re was s u p p l i e d by t h e Fo otb all Leagu e's stru ctu ra l engineering
co n s u lta n ts , M e s s r s . Corduroys and r e p r e s e n t s no more than a d e s k - t o p

League grou nds, of putting seatin g on terr acin g and putting a c o v e r o v e r
that s e a tin g .           The breakdown i s £30M for t h e p r o v is io n of seatin g and
£100M for p r o v id in g c o v e r .                It must be recognised h o w e v e r , th at t h i s
w i l l do no more than turn inad equate terr a ced areas into inadequate

e s t im a t e s seem to in d ic a t e a m u lt ip l ie r of 3, 4 or 5 on t h e £130M
f ig u r e .      In or d e r to p r o v i d e a much more accurate e s t im a t e , th e
Footb all League has now commissioned M e s s r s . Corduroys to a s s i s t c l u b s
in coming to a r e a l i s t i c e s t im a te of t h e cost of implementing t h e Taylor
report.           It i s a n ticip a te d that Corduroys a n a l y s i s w i l l p ro b a b ly be
a v a i l a b l e in a p p r o x im a t e l y t h r e e months t im e . I thought h o w e v e r , that
even at t h i s e a r l y sta ge you would want to be aware of th e b a s i s of th e
£ 1 30M fig u re w hich has been mentioned.

I would a ls o draw attention to t h e announcement from t h e Football Trust
that £75M w i l l be p r o v id e d o v e r 10 y e a r s .          I would point out that
t h i s i s not new money.                  For some y e a r s now t h e Football Trust has
been p r o v id i n g a p p r o x im a te l y £2.5M per annum d i r e c t l y to Football
League c l u b s and £5M per annum i n d i r e c t l y through t h e F ootb all Ground
Improvement Trust.                    T h is la t t e r money has w h o l ly been used for ground
s a f e y measures and t h e former sum has been used for such matters as
th e introduction of c l o s e d c i r c u it t e l e v i s i o n to combat hooliganism and to
meet part of th e e s c a l a ti n g p o l i c e c h a r g e s .    Lord Ju stic T a y l o r ' s
report c a l l s for fu rth er measures to be taken on ground s a f e t y w hich
w i l l undoubtedly carr y with them a c o n s i d e r a b l e co s t and he c a l l s for a
r e a l i s t i c ch arge to be made for p o l i c e s e r v i c e s (w e are not sure
w h e t h e r a ' r e a l i s t i c ' ch arge w i l l tak e th e cost up or d ow n ).             It seem s
u n lik e ly t h e r e f o r e that t h e r e w i l l not be v e r y much le f t o v e r from th e
monies coming from t h e Football Trust in ord er to implement a l l s e a te r
s t a d i a or to p r o v i d e for th e much b e tter f a c i l i t i e s for s p e c t a t o r s for
w hich th e report c a l l s .

You w i l l be aw are that Lord J u s t i c e T aylo r i d e n t i f i e s t h r e e areas w he re
government f in an cia l a s s i s t a n c e might be made a v a i l a b l e .

      a)     from a reduction in VAT on t h e Spot t h e Ball                      competition

       b)    for a greate r part of t h e betting l e v y on t h e p ools com petitions
             being d i v e r t e d into fo o t b a ll and

       c)    for tax r e l i e f being granted on ground im pro vements.

Before making a c a s e to government in r e s p e c t of t h e s e i s s u e s , we have
thought it b etter to quantify in th e way s e t out a b o v e , t h e l i k e l y cost
to c l u b s of implementing th e Taylo r recommendations.                 I hope you would
agree that that i s a both s e n s i b l e and r e s p o n s i b l e co urse fo r us to
adop t and that t h e d e la y in p resen tin g our p r o p o s a l s would not be held
against us.

So far as planning p e r m i s s io n s ar e con cer ne d, nearly a ll c l u b s w i l l be
faced with e i t h e r major reconstruction w ork s at t h e i r e x i s t i n g grounds or
a l t e r n a t i v e l y , moving to e n t i r e l y new s i t e s w here it would be
i m p r a c ti c a b le a n d /o r uneconomic to s e e k to d e v e l o p e x i s t i n g grounds.
If Lord J u s t i c e T a y l o r ' s e x p e c t a t i o n s a re to be met, then it w i l l mean
that planning a p p l i c a t i o n s to d e v e l o p e x i s t i n g gr ounds, planning
a p p l i c a ti o n s in r e s p e c t of new grounds and planning a p p l i c a t i o n s for
a l t e r n a t i v e u se s for e x i s t i n g grounds w i l l need to be c o n s id e r e d
sym pathetically.                 We would t h e r e f o r e ask that you should d i r e c t lo cal
planning a u t h o r i t i e s that t h e r e shou ld be a presumption in favour of
planning p e r m i s s io n s in t h e s e a r e a s .           I would of co u r s e , be p lea s ed to
d i s c u s s th e d e t a i l s of t h i s with your o f f i c i a l s .

We understand that it i s th e g o v ern m en t's intention to a c ce p t t h e Taylor
recommendations that t h e standing areas in 1st and 2nd d i v i s i o n grounds
should be reduced by 20% from August next (and by a f u rth er 20% for
each of t h e next four y e a r s ) and in 3rd and 4th d i v i s i o n grounds by 10%
(w ith a fu rth er 10% in each of th e next 9 y e a r s ) .                      If t h i s i s to be
done s e n s i b l y , then c l u b s w i l l need to make t h e i r o v e r a l l plans now so
that t h e y can work out t h e incremental s t e p s w hich w i l l need to be
taken in o rd er to meet t h e s e red u c t io n s , w h i l s t at t h e same tim e making
adequate arrangements for replacement seatin g to ca ter for t h e i r current
req u ir em en ts.           We want to be in a p o sitio n to g i v e c lu b s t h e best
p o s s i b l e a d v i c e so that e x p e n d it u r e w i l l not be u n n e cesarily incurred or
wasted at a time when e v e r y penny must be made to count.

We h ave been s e e k in g a meeting with you through                       our Government Agents
M e s s r s . GJW.          I would hope that you would f e e l             that t h e r e i s
s u f f i c i e n t in th e foregoing to warrant a meeting at                an e a r l y d ate so that
we ar e in a p ositio n to a d v i s e c l u b s on how b e s t             to p r o c e e d .

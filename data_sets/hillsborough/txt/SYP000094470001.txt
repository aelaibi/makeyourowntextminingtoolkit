            HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY

            On Saturday 15th April          19S9 (150489)         I was on duty in uniform.              The

            day started with a briefing in yes't Bar at 0900 hours (0900) where                                I
                                                             i o SMI
            was deputed as part of Serial 5 with Sgt 1379 CLEMENT in command.

            We then moved to the Midland Railway Station at 0930 hours                          (0930)     to

            escort the Nottingham Forest fans to the q r o u n d by PSV. At this stage
                                          v\ blS
            I was paired up with PC 2296 MOWER and our job was to travel on the

            buses with the fans to the ground.                   Once deposited at the ground,             we

            then returned to the station to pick up more fans.                         This   carried on

            until appro;;.       1430 hrs   (1430), when we moved into the Hi 1 Isborough

            gymnasium as a reserve serial,            and we were allowed to have a meal

            break.

            At approximately        1500 hrs     (1500)    the complete serial were            informed by
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S3873

  ’       Sgt CLEMENT that there was some sort of trouble on the Leppings Lane

      *   end and that we were to be deployed in that area.         We immediately

          moved to behind the Leppings Lane goal and assisted officers already

          in attendance in trying to help people getting over the fence and then

          giving them any first aid assistance       possible.   How long this lasted I

          do not know,     until   I was ordered by an unknown officer to move back

          to the centre     line to help make a cordon across the pitch, as by now

          there was a possibility of a battle between rival fans on the pitch.

          We stayed in that position until the ground started to empty and at
                S ot 7
          ~1530 hrs (1530) we were ordered to move outside the ground to the

          Leppings Lane end to try and prevent any public order situations.

          At some unknown time       later we moved back to West Bar Police Station on

          foot as traffic was at a total standstill.

          At    1913 hrs   (1915) we were debriefed in West Bar before being    released

          from duty at 1930 hrs       (1930).

                                                                 I R SHARPE 563 SIGNED

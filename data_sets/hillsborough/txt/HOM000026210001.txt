                            WEDNESDAY, 28th JUNE. I 1989

                                (AFTERNOON SESSION)


                          INSPECTOR CLIVE CALVERT Recalled

                           Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

          Q. Mr. Calvert, throughout the time that you were involved
             in the policing of Hillsborough did you meet and get to
             know Mr. Lock? -A. Yes.

          Q. Mr. Lock fulfilled quite animportant role on many of
             the occasions that you were policing Hillsborough? - A.
             He did, sir.

          Q. And from time to time did you discussswith Mr. Lock
             points that had emerged and matters of common interest
             relating to the policing and arrangements at Hillsborough?
             -A. Frequently.

          Q. Was the question of stewarding ever anything that you
             discussed? -A. He knew my views certainly.

          Q.    Your views being? - A. That the stewards were sometimes
               remiss, the stewards were not always effective and my
               views on where the stewards should be.

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Remiss in what respect? -A.
               I used to deal with Mr. Lock directly if I had any com­
               plaints about stewards. I have complained to him about
               stewards going early, that is, with the crowds, dis?^ spfegr
               appearing from their posts. I used to after the Bradford
               fire go round on almost every match and check that the
               exit gates were covered by stewards and if I found they
               were not I would tell him directly. I would frequently
               tell him of any problems I saw with stewards. In fact I
               even did at the last semi-final at the Kop end.

          Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   On the question of the briefing of
               stewards you on occasions did that? - A. Yes, from 1985.

          Q. Would it be right to say that the primary concern when
             you were briefing stewards was in relation to emergency
             and evacuation procedures? - A. It was, sir.

          Q. Really did the purpose of the briefing of the stewards -
             did it have any other purpose than that? - A. That was
             the main purpose particularly after the 1985 Inquiry.

          Q. You said that in effect when stewarding was not done or
                                              C. CALVERT

where jobs were not done it fell to the Police and they
did those jobs? - A. Yes.

Without any agreement having been made? - A. Yes.

And without anybody having said to you you must do this,
you are the Police? - A. That is correct.

May I ask you about the Fire Service observations con­
cerning the radial gates and I will deal with this as
quickly as I can? You have been referred and there
has been referred to in the course of your evidence
a note which purports to be a written answer from
Mr. Grimshaw concerning a meeting on the 18th of
April, 1985. - A. Yes.

We find a minute of that meeting at page 211. Would you
have a look at that, please? 211 in the core bundle. -
A. Yes, sir. I have it.

Now, according to this written answer - and we have asked
for the original to be produced - it was made clear by
Divisional Officer Grimshaw that the gates at the rear
of the radial fences were required for use in case of
any emergency to allow lateral egress from the terrace
and assurance was given that the Police had and would
continue to man the existing gates and would also man
the proposed gates in the new fences. You were at the
meeting on the 18th: 6f/;April, 1985?- A. Yes.

Would you have a look? You are there in the attendance
list. During your attendance at that meeting was any
such assurance given by the Police that they would man
the existing gates? - A. I do not recall giving it. I
would not have given it. I have already explained how
it was done and the futility of putting a Police Officer
there in the crowd.

There may be reasons for not giving it. What I want to
ask you to be clear about is whether or not anything like
that was acceded to or agreed to by the Police? -A. Not
by me and I do not believe by any of the other people
there.

And if it had been would you have been aware of it?
- A. I would hope to be. I would have been the man
who arranged it.

Did you ever arrange it? - A. No, we certainly did not.

Had you in the past done it? -A. Never, apart from under
the system I have explained when the gates were closed.

May I turn now to the meeting of the 7th of August, 1985,
                             66



                                                     C. CALVERT

     the minute of which or the note of which appears at 271
     in the core bundle. This was the meeting, you will re­
     call, I think, when the new radial fence was - various
     matters were discussed including a second radial fence
     2 metres from the existing radial fence? - A. Yes.

Q. On that occasion you had the meeting at the ground? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You visited various parts of the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. The Leppings Lane end, was that included in your visit?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. On the occasion of that meeting was there any discussion
   about what the Police expected to do or in fact did in
   relation to the radial gates? -A. I believe I explained
   the situation how we normally operated at that end of
   the ground in full.

Q. In the manner that you have described to the Inquiry?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Did anybody say to you, well, that is not right, Mr.
   Calvert, you have got it wrong? - A. No.

Q. We understand differently? -A. No.

Q. May I ask you about another matter, planning the policing
   arrangements for a match? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Youwere involved in that side of matters? - A. I was.

Q. Andwere indeed involved in those matters for the      1989
   semi-final? - A. Not the 1989, The 1988.

Q. The 1988.   Mr. Sewell took over from you? - A. Yes.

Q. In 1988 did you actually police the semi-final yourself?- A.
   I worked in the control box.

Q. Didyou at any time go out to the Leppings Lane end? - A.
   No, I stopped in there the whole time.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What was your function in the
     control box? -A. Basically advising Mr. Murray who had
     only been there probably two or three weeks.
Q. So you were there advising Mr. Murray who was advising
   Mr. Mole. Is that right? -A. Mr. Mole was in charge.
   The control was a separate entity that would operate on
   Mr. Mole's overall^guidelines but would react to situations
   without consultation of Mr. Mole.
                               67



                                                        C. CALVERT

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:    Was Mr. Mole in the controlbox?
     - A. No, Mr. Mole tended not to be in the control box.
     He would pop in occasionally.

Q. When he policed in 1988 he was not in the control box
   but would visit .... - A. He would visit, yes.

Q .. and     would be in contact from time to time.  May I
    ask you about the intelligence? Did you rely in your
    planning upon intelligence coming from other Forces? - A.
   A great deal.

Q. Was it ordinarily the pattern that you would seek
   intelligence from Merseyside? - A. Yes.

Q. If it was a Liverpool game. Are you aware of any
   intelligence in relation to 1988 or 1989 to suggest
   that that which happened in 1989 was on the cards, if
   I may use that phrase? -A. No, no.

            MR. WOODWARD:   May I have a moment, sir?   Thank you,
     sir.

          MR. COLLINS:   Sir, although it is out of order I
     propose to call Mr. Mackrell now, please, for various
     reasons which I do not think it is necessary to go into.

                    GRAHAM HENRY MACKRELL Called

                      Examined by   MR. COLLINS:

Q.Graham Henry Mackrell, is that right? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. Mr. Mackrell, as with Mr. Bownes yesterday, I propose to
   treat your statement as your evidence and ask you about
   particular parts of it. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And I take it you will confirm the accuracy of the contents
   of that statement? - A. Yes, sir.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Again, that statement is ....

            MR. COLLINS:    Indeed, indeed:

Q. Mr. Mackrell, you have clearly some considerable experience
   of being involved with the management of football clubs
   having started in 1974, I think, at Bournemouth? - A.
   That is right, sir, yes.
Q.And progressed via Luton between 1981 and 1986 to Sheffield
   Wednesday in November of 1986? - A. That is correct.

Q. Now, can I ask you just to tell us a little bit more
   about the areas of responsibility and the management
                                                G. MACKRELL

of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club? It is a public
limited company, is it not? - A. It is, sir, yes. It
is a public limited company. We have a non-executive
Board with seven directors. Obviously they dictate
policy and sanction financial expenditure but, in effect,
I have a Chief Executive appointment within that company
and I am answerable to that Board of Directors.

So effectively you pee the Operational Manager, if I may
put it that way, subject of course to the Board's control
as to expenditure and as to dictation of policy, you
carry out all policy? - A. That is corrects.

Or implement all policy? -A. Implement, yes.

And under you who do you have? - A. I basically have six
departmental heads who are responsible for the individual
functions of the company which include commercial
department and lottery department, sports hall and so on.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What are the six?   Commercial,
lottery?

     MR. COLLINS:   Sir, they are set out on page 3 of
his statement.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   So they are.   Thank you.

     MR. COLLINS:   And of those effectively the
Administration Manager is Sharon Lane and she is^
responsible, broadly speaking, for what? - A. Mainly
for the staff, the ticket office and the general
office running, the ....

And the maintenance manager, Mr. Ward, he is responsible,
is he, for carrying out - keeping an eye on the state of
the ground and carrying out all works and maintenance? - A.
That is right. General husbandry round the ground and
keeping obviously the ground up to a level which we
require.

What was your understanding of the role of Eastwood &
Partners? - A. Eastwood & Partners were mainly - well,
were totally used for the actual major structural work
that was required particularly with a view to the Safety
at Sports Grounds Act and for major capital projects.
Did they have any sort of advisory role in connection
with safety? -A. Well, the advisory role in relation to
the ongoing annual inspections. For example$ the barrier
testing would be taken as a matter of course. I would be
contacted by a member of Dr. Eastwood' s staff or by
Dr. Eastwood to say when they were going to go ahead

                                                            G. MACKRELL

             with those types of works and the initial certification of
             that ....

           Q. Obviously they would report to you the results of any
              testing and if they found anything that needed doing
              you would be told? - A. Yes, sir.




                                          / Q. What I am
                                                    G. MACKRELL

What I am asking is whether you would expect of them any
unsoli c i t e d advice on any other safety matters apart from
concern with the testing or apart from when you specif ically
in st ructed them to do.     A. It was geaerally in relation to
the implic ations of any work that was undertaken.

If you wanted work done you would a p p roach East woods and
expect them to deal not only with whether the work could
be done and its cost and so on but also with any safety
im plications?      A. That is right, because virtually all
e x p e n diture bar one or two items when we extended the
ticket office, for example, they were the people who
act ually were involved and inst ructed the c ontractors on
our behalf.

You were no doubt aware that under the terms of the Safety
Ce rtif i c a t e any a lteration which might have an effect upon
safety had to be notified to the licensing authority?
A. Yes, Sir.

And you also in addition to the heads, as it were, that you
have referred to, you had Mr. Douglas Lock, as the person
re spon s i b l e for security matters. Is that right? A. That
is right.

Wh e n was he appointed? A. He was there when I joined.                   I
believe it was in the season prior to my joining.

You were no doubt aware that he had been a Police
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t who had been respon s i b l e for the policing
of the ground?               A. That is right.    He was obviously very
well versed with the actual structure of the ground and
the policing methods adopted.

One of the matters he was conc erned with was               the training
of stewards? A. That is correct.

This was an annual event, is that right?   A. It was an
annual event in relation to the meetings that were held
but obviously regular briefings were held before each
game before the individual insp ectors in the individual
parts.

Those briefings I think that we have heard were largely
in c o nnection with the e vacuation procedure, to ensure
that the stewards knew what they should do in relation to
that?    A. On the match day ones, Sir?

Yes, or did it go wider than that?   A. I think that it
really expanded into the numbers of people who they were
ex pecting in the ground on that day and obviously how
it was going to be actually stage managed in the actual
area in which they were.

I see.     That was rather      briefing    than training,      though.
                                               G.   MACKRELL

It was not strictly a training session, was it?
A. it was an up-dating of them how to do their job.

The training sessions themselves, the annual training
evening, if you like, involved, as you say on page four
of your statement, demonstrations, lectures, and a
video?  A. Yes, I think that is a fair comment.

The main thrust of this was in conne c t i o n with evacuation?
A. It was.          It was given by three g e ntlemen there, one from
the police, another from the fire service, and another one
from the St. John's Ambulance Brigade.                 The police were
predo m i n a n t l y concerned with the evacu a t i o n procedure but
also defining the r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s between stewards
and police and answering questions that any of the stewards
may have.

When you say defining r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s between stewards
and police what was that d efinition as you understood?
A. It was based particularly, Sir, in relation to where the
stewards were situated.      There were minor details in
relation to, for example, if a steward had an unruly
spectator who was sat in the incorrect seat and refused
to move, whose r e p o nsibility it was to move that spectator.

Where there was something which might have been a public
order problem or might have been a s tewarding pr oblem it was
to sort out on which side of the light it lay? A. That
is right; d emarkation probably, sort of thing.

So far as you are aware did any of these training sessions
or, indeed, any of the briefings, involve discussion as to
re s p o n s i b i l i t i e s on the Leppings Lane terrace? A. No.

When you took over at the ground obviously one of the
ma tters with which you were concerned was the Safety
Certificate. A. That is correct.

Be cause you were, of course, aware if there was a breach of
the term there was a potential criminal offence? A. That
is right, Sir.

No doubt you read the Safety Certificate, or a copy of
it? A. Yes.   I in fact found that Safety C ertificate within
my files and then I contacted Dr. Ea stwood to see if it was
still valid becaue obviously I was aware of the fact (1)
that the South York shire County Council had obviously
been abolished and its r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s taken on by
another licensing auth ority and (2) it was obvious that
ce rtain works had taken place at the ground which were
obv iously subsequent to the actual issuing of the Safety
Certificate.

I think that you a s c e r tained that the Safety Certificate
was indeed still current? A. That is right, Sir.

SBDN3                                                        G.    MACKRELL

        Q.   That it had not in any way been amended.

        Q.        LORD JU STICE TAYLOR: You say you asked Dr. Eastwood
             about that? A. I just asked if it was a valid certifica te
             on the basis that I could not find what I assumed to
             be a current c ertificate be cause obvi ously the licensing
             au tho rity was the previous licensing authority.

        Q.   I rather thought that Dr. E astwood's evidence was that he
             was not aware that it had not been up-dated so that if
             you were getting in touch with him saying is this one
             of 1979 still in op eration he should then have become
             aware that it had not been up-dated?     A. I was not sure wh ether
             Dr. E a s twood might have been given the impr ession that it
             had been up-dated in relation to the various items that
             had been added on to from the basic certificate, Sir.

«       Q.          MR. COLLINS: I think there was a request to Dr.
             Eas tw ood but before your time in relation to wh ether the
             c e r t i ficate was still — at least not to Dr. Eastwood
             h ims elf but to his firm.    You say this was just an informal
             di scu ssion? A. Informal discussion, Sir, and it was
             bla ta nt ly obvious that certain things had happened.    The
             roof on the Kop, for example, had taken place and the
             ca pac ity extended.

        Q.   Can I ask you to look at a copy of the Safety Certificate.
             It is in the core bundle at 107.     There are one or two
             con di tions that I would just like to ask you about, please.
             B ef or e I do that to follow through what you were saying
             about asking Dr. Eastwood can I ask you to look at page
             385.     This in fact is about five or six months after you
             had arrived. A. Yes, five months, Sir.

        Q.   It is a note     of a telephone conversation,        as   I unde rsta nd
              it. A . Yes.

        Q.   Be tw ee n you and Mr.   Strange.   A. Yes.

        Q.   In wh ich it appears you are saying you cannot find any
              ame nd ments to the 1979 certificate and did he, Mr. Strange,
              k now if any existed, and he tells you no, not that he
              has seen.    One was to be drawn out after me eting about
              Spion Kop but knowing the City of Sheffield they had
              not done it.    A. Yes.

        Q.   Was this your first request   or was this a follow-up?
              A. I cannot recall at this stage.

        Q.   It is just that you said that you asked Eastwood and my
             u n d e r s t a n d i n g of what you were saying is that you had a

             meant the company.              It was often dealt with by Dr. Eas twood

                but some little time afterwards.      A. That is right,    yes.

           Q.   Coming back to the Safety Ce r t i f i c a t e itself paragraph
                three condition three refers to schedule three part one,
                deals with the capacities? A. Yes, Sir.

           Q.   You make the point specifically about the Spion Kop, of
                course, in that telephone message.  The capacity was
                clearly under stated but it must as you looked at it
                have occurred to you that it did not take account of
                the pens on the Leppings Lane end. A. I did not recall
                that initially at that time, Sir.

           Q.   Did you not a p preciate that the c a pacities on the West
                terrace were capacities on the terrace as a whole?
                A . Yes, Sir.

           Q.   And that certainly on the Safety Ce r t i f i c a t e it did not
                give individual capa cities for the indi vidual pens?
                A. No, Sir, that is right.

           Q.   Is  that not something which occurred to you? A. It occurred
                to me in the sense that the work had obviously taken place.
                It had been done over a number of years and I naturally
                assumed at that stage that it had been taken into account.

       ,   Q.   If  you would be good enough, please, to look at another
                memorandum, which is page 379.   This again is a note of
                a telephone call, this time from Sharon Lane to Mr. Strange,
                page 379. A. Yes.

                                                       G. MACKRELL


     Q. Did all the standing tickets have Entrance B? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. So anyone looking at that map would have believed that they
        should go down that central tunnel if they followed the ticket
        instruction, because if they looked at Entrance B and saw on
        the back of the ticket that there were two Bs and when they
        got in they could find one B clearly was not there and the
        other B was straight ahead of then, they would go straight
        down the tunnel, would not they? - A. I take the point, sir,
        but obviously they are going through turnstiles and when they
        go through the turnstiles there are big signs that stated,
        "Leppings Lane Terrace".

     Q. What I am getting at, anyone looking at this ticket, having
        got through the turnstile, would see on it "Entrance B", and
        might look at the back of the ticket and see that apparently
        one of the Bs is the tunnel? A. One of them, yes, sir.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE  TAYLOR:  What actually do you understand
          the A, BB, C, D to refer to? - A. It is only a turnstile to
          try and get people into the right turnstiling areas, sir.

     Q.        MR. COLLINS:They don't bear any relationship to the
          actual configuration or the actual ticketing on the day, do
          they? - A. The Leppings Lane were less than desirable, sir.      I
          take the poin t.

     Q. They were inaccurate? - A. They were inaccurate, yes, sir.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:  They did not relate either to the
          turnstile layout or to the internal entrance layout once you
          got through? - A. No, sir.   It was altered in fact subsequent
          to that.   It should have been A, B, C, and it ended up A, C,
          B on the day, sir.

     Q.       MR. COLLINS:     Apart from the A, C, B outside, which in
          itself was not very desirable, I think you probably agree? -
          A. I do, sir.

     Q. What I am concerned about is inside, because what these appear
        to be, or am I wrong, is an indication of what they might be
        taken as to those who have come through the turnstile as to
        which entrances they should use in order to get on to the
        terraces? - A. With respect, sir, that is your interpretation,
        and I don’t necessarily think that would be the view taken.

     Q.   Don't you? - A. I really don’t, sir.

     Q.   Anyone who looked at the turnstiles facing      him would sayto
          himself, and if h£ was thinking logically, and I don't
          necessarily suggest he would, but he would see that A, BB, C,
          D bore no relationship whatever to what appeared on the
          turnstiles, would he? - A. No, sir, that is right.

     Q. Because the turnstiles he was after were A-G? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. And when he got in he would see on his left a wall, straight
y                                82



                                                     G. MACKRELL


         ahead of him a tunnel entrance which said "B" on it, I think?
         - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. And he has in his hand a ticket saying "Entrance B"? - A. Yes,
       sir.

    Q. So would he not think to himself, quite apart from the lack of
       any other directions, "That is the way I have got to go on to
       the terraces”? - A. I can see that argument of thought, sir,
       but my experience is that is not necessarily the case.

    Q. What else would you expect anyone who looked at those tickets
       to think? Either they are intended to help, in which case
       that surely must be what anyone would think, or if they are
       not intended to help and are a complete muddle, they are worse
       than useless? - A. I take the point, sir, that the ticketing
       is not good, sir.

    Q. It is not only not good, it is worse than useless, and as it
       has turned out thoroughly dangerous, was not it, because it
       encouraged people, quite apart from the configurations,
       everyone to go down that central tunnel? If you put
       "Entrance B" on every terrace ticket, and Entrance B is the
       tunnel straight ahead of you, you will go down it, won't you?
       - A. I take your point.  I hear what you say, sir, yes.

    Q. Forgive me, Mr. Mackrell, but what other possibility is there?
       It is true the tunnel says "B" and "A", but it certainly says
       "B". What other possibility is there from those tickets and
       the configuration that meets someone coming in through A-G? -
       A. The configuration is obviously people make their way down
       the tunnel. I take the point they go through the tunnel, but
       then people are directed into other areas.

    Q. That is the trouble.  There was no-one to direct them, because
       we know that there was no-one on the terrace.  There were no
       Police and no stewards. - A. Yes, sir, but normally the people
       are coming at a flow rate through the actual turnstiles, and
       so they are easier to direct than from having a number coming
       together.

    Q. I follow that, Mr. Mackrell, but there was not anyone
       directing them, because once they had gone down that tunnel
       on to the terraces they were on their own, were not they?

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think you are referring to
         before they get into the tunnel? - A. Yes.

              MR. COLLINS:   I am sorry:

    Q. Before they get into the tunnel, yes, of course there is a
       possibility of direction, but none was taking place, was it?
       No stewards were posted to the concourse with instructions to
       direct people who came in to either side? - A. No, sir, I take
       the point.  That is correct.

    Q. And as far as you are aware there were no Police Officers who
                              83




                                                 G. MACKRELL


     had the responsibility to direct fans to either side? - A. The
     stewarding of the Leppings Lane end, obviously one has heard
     the previous evidence, and I have read transcripts of previous
     witnesses, and it was my knowledge that the Leppings Lane end
     was stewarded by the Police.

Q. But not the concourse.  The gates were manned by your
   stewards, were not they? - A. Yes.

Q. And certainly the terraces, I entirely accept that the
   terraces themselves, the arrangements were effectively there
   was no steward on the   terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. And the Police, as I understand it, were alsohaving no-one on
   the terraces, but the  situation was supposedto bemonitored
   from the control box?   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Or possibly, depending on whose evidence one accepts of the
   Police, by one or two of the individual Officers on the
   perimeter or in the West Stand? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.    I entirely accept the club had no presence on the terraces,
     but in the concourse behind the terraces there was no reason
     as I understand it why there should not have been stewards? -
     A. There were three stewards situated on C gate and one on the
     central gate on the wall.

Q. All I am saying, and I think you have agreed with this, none
   of those had any instructions specifically to direct people.
   No doubt if someone asked they would point the way, but they
   did not have any specific instructions to direct? - A. No,
   that is right, sir.

Q.   Indeed, sadly, the only evidence we have heard of direction
     was someone being directed by a steward on the West Stand
     south stairway down the central tunnel after 3 o'clock,
     obviously ignorant of the state of affairs in the pens? - A.
     Yes, sir.

Q. So there was no system devised to ensure that anyone coming in
   through the turnstiles with a ticket for the terraces should
   be directed anywhere? Right? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. And as we have already established, I am afraid at rather too
   great length, the only way which they were likely to go was
   down that central tunnel, unless they knew the ground? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. And even if they did know the ground they might well believe
   from their ticket they had to go down that central tunnel? -
   A. They may believe that, yes, sir.

Q. You must have appreciated - I appreciate you say they could
   have spread out through those lateral gates - but once they
   get into the pens and once those pens become quite full it is
   not easy to see those lateral gates exist, is it? - A. No,
   sir, you are right.

                                                      G. MACKRELL



     Q. Because you have got to look back through a crowd of people
        who are higher than you, if you are anyway down at all. So
        the likelihood is no-one is going to appreciate the existence
        of those gates? Right? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. So it is going to be chancy, to say the least, for anyone to
        be able to get out of the central pens if they wanted to,
        other than climbing over the fence? - A. Or going back up the
        tunnel, sir.

     Q. Or going back up the tunnel, yes, but they might not
        appreciate there was any other way, and indeed, you have got
        the difficulty of forcing your way back through the crowd?
        Agreed? - A. Agreed.

     Q. And the result is that on a Semi-Final such as this, because
        of the total failure to have any arrangements to direct
        people, the natural result was those central pens became
        overcrowded.  It was inevitable they would become overcrowded,
        was not it, looking back on it? - A. Possibly, yes, sir.

     Q. Not "possibly".  It was inevitable that they would become
        overcrowded? - A. They are the natural area which does
        overcrowd, sir.

     Q. (a) it is a natural area which overcrowds and (b) your
        ticketing and your arrangements at the turnstiles and inside
        ensure that it will be overcrowded because people are directed
        down there, and sadly, that is the situation, is not it? - A.
        Yes, sir.

     Q. The evidence is perfectly clear   as you have already said,
        that the system was effectively   there should be no system of
        packing on the terrace, that is   to say the fans were left to
        find their own level. Right? -    A. Yes, sir.

     Q. Did it not occur to you, Mr. Mackrell, that was, to say the
        least, a thoroughly undesirable system? - A. The system had
        worked previously, sir, and obviously had been thought out.
        It was not just an attitude whereby it had been left, because
        the conscious effort had been changed from filling the pens.

     Q. But with respect, it had not worked before, because we have
        heard evidence in 1987 and in 1988 those central pens were
        overcrowded? - A. But one can only act on information given to
        us, and until these statements have come for this Inquiry I
        have had no notification from anyone that there were problems
        in the central pen in 1987 or 1988.

     Q. The problem I suspect is this, that the expectation of what is
        going to be tolerable for fans in the way of crowding is set
        much too high, that is to say they are expected to put up with
        a degree of crowding which is in fact intolerable, and that is
        what has been happening, that you have looked at and people
        have looked at the state of affairs on that terrace and have
        seen that the pens were full, but it has been assumed that was
                              85




                                                    G. MACKRELL


     all right? - A. I think that is a little harsh, sir. I think
     it sounds as though we are very callous. One can only act on
     information that is given to one.  If you don't receive that
     information it is hard to take action.

Q. Let me make it perfectly clear I am not suggesting in any way
   that you or indeed the Police were callous about this, simply
   that you were conditioned, all of you, to expect what in fact
   was overcrowding on terraces, and that is what has led to the
   problem, because it is very difficult if not impossible to
   monitor visually, I think you would agree with this, the
   proper capacity of the terrace as a whole, let alone the pens?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I think that may be argument, and I shall not pursue that any
   further.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    It does suggest, does not it, Mr.
     Mackrell, that simply trying to look at overcrowding by visual
     observation is unlikely to be foolproof? Either you have got
     to count people in or you rely upon people complaining that
     they can't breathe or they are being squashed intolerably.
     Simply by looking, what you are saying is, "We thought it was
     all right by looking*', even though it turns out it was not? -
     A. I hear what you say, sir, but obviously....

Q. I am looking to the future. - A. Yes.  I take the point, but
   if whilst there can be movement between pens and they are not
   totally self-contained, I think there will always be an
   element of difficulty in actually defining the numbers within
   those pens.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Incidentally, one small matter I should
     have asked you about the tickets. Some have LL1, some LL2 and
     some LL3. That I think is just security? - A. It is security
     printing.  They are printed batches of 3,600, and the Kop in
     fact had KP 1 to 6 for the same thing.

                                                           G. MACKRELL

      Q.    I thought that was so but thematter had been raised and      I
           thought I should just clear it up.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Are you leaving the ticket?

                MR. COLLINS:   Sir, yes, I was going to.

      Q.      ^ LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I just ask you about the
           advice you are requested to take up your position 15 minutes
           before kick-off? - A. Yes, sir.

      Q .What is the thinking behind that? - A. Thinking normally is
          people doubtless, normally mainly in relation to seating
          tickets, people actually down in the concourses getting
          refreshments and then pushing past people getting to their
          places.

      Q. It could easily be interpreted as having some bearing upon
         when you arrive at the ground. -A. It could do, sir, but it
         is a pretty standard thing tohave on tickets.

      Q.        MR. COLLINS:    Can I justfollowup the turnstiles a
           moment? Now, we know there was a scheme in 1985 before
           you came for a reorganisation of the Leppings Lane turn­
           stiles? - A. Yes, sir.

      Q. And the effect of the original scheme put forward by
         Dr. Eastwood in co-operation with the club was that
         there would be effective segregation of all parts and
         including the pens of the terraces, right, because you
         would have individual turnstiles and, I think, individual
         lavatories and so on for each area. That was the idea?
         - A. That is right, sir.

      Q. In the end we know that did not happen, as I understand it,
         largely because of expense.   Is that right? - A. I think
         it is the expense in relation to other items. When it
         was being considered the following weekend was the
         Bradford City fire and there was never any indication
         that the actual configuration of the turnstiles as was
         built was in any way; unsafe and obviously at that time
         in that closed season the club had, on checking from
         records, they had £243,000-worth of expenditure which
         was necessary to maintain - that obviously came about
         from Bradford and other associated matters.

      Q. That of course meant that you had a limited number of
         turnstiles available for use at that end. Right? - A.
         Yes, sir.

      Q. You had 23 in all? - A. 23.

      Q. Now, normally speaking, of course so far as the North Stand
         was concerned you would have had, I think, 12 turnstiles
                                                 G. MACKRELL

available at the Penistone Road end? - A. That is right,
sir.

Those were removed for the purpose of the semi-final
because of the undesirability of mingling Nottingham
Forest and Liverpool fans? - A/ Segregation of supporters,
sir, yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Tfrfcdt had happened in 1988?
- A. It had happened in 1988.
And in 1987?-A. Yes, sir.

     MR. COLLINS: So the result was that at semi-finals,
not at any other match, but at semi-finals, the whole of
the West and North sides of the ground had to go through
Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, sir.

That of course put some greater pressure on each individual
turnstile because each individual turnstile had to cater
for more people? - A. Yes.

Now, of course, the problem was that that happened only at
semi-finals when the capacity was going to be the greatest,
going to be a full house? - A. Virtually full, sir, yes.

And thus you were going to, as you knew, have more people
making use of the turnstiles at that end than usual? - A.
Yes, sir.

Quite apart from the closing of the Penistone Road end
for the North Stand? - A. Yes, sir.

This meant, did it not, that it was essential to have
a steady flow and the likelihood was that if you were
not careful you were going to get problems with getting
people through in time? - A. It was a possibility, sir,
but I discussed the matter or Mr. Mole discussed the
matter with me when the policye off closing down the
turnstiles on Penistone Road end was adopted and we
felt with the number of turnstiles we had, with the
flow rates that we knew we could achieve, it balanced
in favour of going through with this scheme.

You were looking to 800 an hour, as I understand it,
judging by your proof? -A. Yes, sir, I think it
comfortably cans do 800 an hour.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think it can comfortably
take 800 an hour, sir.

     MR. COLLINS: Now, you had to get 24,000 people
through 23 turnstiles? - A. Yes, sir.

It was not quite as simple as that because it was
                          88




                                                  G. MACKRELL

   unbalanced, was not it, assuming everyone went where they
   ought to have gone? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And so far as the standing was concerned you had to get
   10,100 through A to G, seven turnstiles? - A. Yes, but
   we knew had the flexibility of, if necessity, being able
   to use 11 to 16 for standing as well because the tickets
   for the West Stand, obviously checked, a secondary point,
   if the need was there we could utilise those turnstiles
   to take up any slack if we found A to G being ....

Q. The problem with all this is it creates a breach, does
   it not, of the safety certificate because what you ha^e
   to do, if y®i look at paragraph 28 of the safety certificate,
   is to keep a record, 28(1), I am sorry, it is page - must
   be about 114 or 115, condition 28. - A. Yes.

Q. 28(1) requires you to make and keep various records which
   include a record of the numbers of spectators admitted to
   the stadium during a specified activity - this is the
   important bit - and to each area of spectator accommodation
   therein mentioned in part 1 of Schedule 3. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And if we go to part 1 of Schedule 3 we see that you have
   to keep a separate record of those admitted (a) to the
   West terrace, (b) to the North West terrace, (c) to the
   West stand and (d) to the North stand? - A. The North
   West terrace was already, the configuration was - the
   ground was when I inherited the ground in 1986.
   Obviously it was a total capacity. There was no way
   of separating the North West terrace from ....

Q. There was never any way of complying with the safety
   certificate, condition 28(1), is what you are saying
   in relation to separate records of the West and North
   West terrace? - A. Of the West and North West terrace,
   no, sir.

Q. So you were always in breach of that condition? - A.
   That would appear so. Obviously I do not know the
   historywf it being drafted in this way.

Q. Maybe. Is this not something that worried you because
   on the face of it you are committing a criminal offence
   every time you have spectators in Hillsborough? -A. I
   take your point, sir, but obviously I had already, as I
   made the point, that the Kop had been built, the capacity
   had been extended. I obviously Sr#e!fc£ the other items,
   the configurations of the back and in the front of the
   West Stand had been taken into consideration.

Q. I see. It had not. At least we have seen absolutely no
   record anywhere that it ever had and it does not appear
   that it had. - A. But I understand, sir, there was - for
                                                G. MACKRELL

example, it was agreed, a letter increasing the capacity
of the^Kop.

Oh, the Kop, yes. I a m sorry. I am not talking about
that. I am talking about this problem of the provision
of records of the North West and the West terrace - A
Sure, sir.

But apart from that, the way you devised your ticketing
and you talk about the possibility of other turnstiles ’
taking up the slack, meant that you ran into diffciulty
in recording the split between the North stand, the West
stand and the terraces, did not it? - A. Not the North
stand, sir, because the North stand would have be&n — it
was served by independent dedicated turnstiles.

All right. Then the West stand and the West terraces.
- A. The West stand and the West terraces ideally one
would use the A to G and the 11 to 16. If necessary
one would utilise other - wokMdbe able to use 11 to
16 for standing purposes.

Well, I follow all that but of course that would involve
a breach of the condition 28(1). All I am asking you is ..

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, Mr. Collins, just to be
fair, as we are talking about criminal offences, it is not
right to say that there would be a criminal offence every
time. What it would be fair to say, I suggest, is that
there was no way of their being sure that they could avoid
committing a criminal offence.

     MR. COLLINS:    I take your point, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Which is just slightly
different.

     MR. COLLINS:   I was putting it too much in shorthand:

All I am really suggesting is you ought to have been very
careful to ensure that what you were doing was approved
because otherwise if you were in breach of the safety
certificate there was at least in theory the possibility
of a prosectuion; - A. There was, sir, but it was a policy
which had been agreed with Chief Superintendent Mole and
if one wishes to one could have counted the tickets that
came through the other turnstiles to get the actual areas
which have gone through. I am not pretending that was
done, sir, but I am saying if one is wishing to counter
the accusation that one may be in breach of a criminal
offence one could have dealt with it in that way.

I am putting it too emotively. I should have limited it
to saying in breach of the condition. Bui what you are
                                               G. MACKRELL

saying is you had the potentiality to provide that record
had you manually counted all the tickets? - A. Correct, sir

And split them up into the various regions or areas of
the ground? - A. II is only into two, sir.

West stand and West terraces. Did you in fact ever do
that or not? - A. The only time that had been done, sir,
has been following the events of 15th of April.

I see.   But not before? - A. No, sir.

That does of course, as you rightly point out, create a
record. Of course it also means though if you switch
aroand the turnstiles that you lose any accuracy in
your computer count, does not it? - A. One still has
the accuracy for the total end of the ground, sir, and
in addition to that there is a further check, a manual
check by stewards, for people entering into the West Stand.

What I am getting at is what you do lose though is the
reliability of the computer count when you are trying
to assess whether you have reached capacity on the
terraces or nearing capacity on theterraces as opposed
to the stand and so on? - A. Yes, I take that point, yes, s

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You can comply with 28(1)
retrospectively by counting your tickets? - A. Yes, sir.

What you cannot ensure that you can do is comply with
Schedule 3(1) which says you shall not admit to the
various areas because there is noimeans in advance of
your saying whether more than 2,900 have gone into the
North West terrace? - A. NS>, there is no - on the same tack
sir, there is no way of knowing that people who have got
tickets for the West stand do not go and stand on the
terraces.

Unless you have separate .... - A. Ikactly.

     MR. COLLINS:     Mr. Mackrell, can I ask you just to
go to one or two other conditions? Can you look at con­
dition 8, please? We have seen a lot about the first aid
room in (1) but I am more concerned with (2) at the moment
because it does appear from Dr. Purcell's evidence that
there was not a physician employed or retained available
to attend the first aid room if required whose where­
abouts were known to those in the Police central control
room at the stadium? - A. I was surprised, sir, to read
transcripts of Dr. Purcell’s evidence. It was not as I
understood it to be. His appodmfcftent was to be the club
doctor, not the team doctor, and in fact his position
was known by the Police, his whereabouts in the stadium.

You had understood that Dr. Purcell Ifulfilled the 8(2)
                              91


                                                    G. MACKRELL

   role.     Is that right? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. It appears that he did not appreciate that and it looks
   as if there may hive been some failure of communication?
   - A. I think it is a failure in communication between
   possibly the club and Dr. Purcell on this matter, sir,
   but he was present at each of the matches and the Police
   were - they knew his whereabouts within the ground.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   1 have said that I would not
  raise any question of something not being put in this
  Inquiry but I do not recall there being any cross-
  examination of Dr. Purcell about this, was there, that
  he had misunderstood his position.

       MR. GLASGOW:   It was not put on that basis, sir, no.
  I simply rely on the documents, if I may, without challenging
  the doctor. You have a record of it at 185. It is his
  formal appointment. I am in no position to take it further
  than that because of course these events are seme ten
  years before Mr. Mackrell’s appointment. Perhaps it is
  fair since he is here and he has the records he inherits
  the club record.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    185?

       MR. GLASGOW: 185 of the club bundle, sir, a formal
  Board minute appointing him as the honorary medical
  officer to the club and perhaps it is understandable
  that the secretary appointed ten years later did not
  ask the club doctor whether or not he knew he was the
  club doctor for ten years.
           MR. COLLINS:   Depends what you mean by club doctor:

Q. Obviously Dr. Purcell understood something by that which
   was not what you assumed? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I am not suggesting you were unreasonable in assuming he
   was there intended to comply with 8(2). I am simply
   asking what the situation was and if Dr. Purcell did not
   think he was fulfilling that role it looks as if there
   was a failure to make his position absolutely clear to
   him? - A. I can assure you, sir, the matter will be
   clarified.

Q. Can I ask you to look at 9(2), please? We have had a bit
   about this. Did you apply your mind, Mr. Mackrell, at
   any stage before these events as to what was meant by
   control and direction of spectators entering, using or
   leaving the stadium as to what that extended to? - A.
   I think I understood it to be actually as it says, sir,
   people actually coming into the ground and leaving the
   ground.
                                                G.   MACKRELL

I think Mr. W o o dward has emph asized the word using from
time to time.     I am not asking with hi n d s i g h t now, I
am simply asking whether you ever applied your mind before
these events to what was involved in the word using. A. I
cannot say that I read any more into it than that.

It would seem you certainly did not think that it would
involve overriding the arrang e m e n t with the police about
what actually happened so far as the West terrace was concerned
and semi-finals. A. No, Sir, that is right.

You did not think that it in itself required stewards to
be monit o r i n g capacities and whether there was over crowding
in those pens? A. No, Sir.

Can I ask over the page at the top, there is a reference
to training exercis es relating to the action to be taken in
the event of an emergency being held at least once every
three months. A. Yes.

Was   that in fact done?     A. By and large yes,      Sir.

What form did these training exercises take?       A. The
t raining exercises was e v acuation p r ocedures were set up
and carried out during actual matches.

The only other thing perhaps is a small matter, 11(1)
"Provision and m a i n t enance of exit signs over all exits
from the from the stadium and all exits from spectator
a c c o m m o d a t i o n therein, which should be illium inated
if necessary".              I do not think ac tually there were such
exit signs provided, were there?               A. I cannot say off my
head.         I u n derstood that the Fire Officer had inspected.
I know that we had done certain exit signs because prior
to the c o m m e ncement of the last season I was not actually
sure where certain ones should be situ ation and a g e n t l e ­
man from the fire office came and assisted us in placing
these signs.

It may be said that that c o ndition was not a necessary one,
I do not know.  The fact is that it does not seem to have
been complied with.  I do not think, certainly looking at
these photographs, that there were any exit signs anywhere.
A. No.

W ould this be fair, Mr. Mackrell, that it seems to have
been assumed on all sides that the system in operation
was a system that could continue and no-one applied their
minds specifically to the problem, or the possible problem,
of over crowding in those central pens and how that might
be met. A. There was a system in o p e ration when I joined
the company, yes, and that system carried on.

Can you recall anything abut the shutting off of the
tunnel in 1988? A. No, Sir, I only learned of that after
 the event from a member of my s t a f f .

SDR3                                                         G.   MACKRELL

           Q.             You mean back in 1988? A. No, Sir,        as a result
                of this Inquiry i nformation has come to m e .

           Q.   Can I ask you to look at page 8 of your statement. You
                refer there to your dealings with the police and the
                function of stewards. A. Yes.

           Q.   It is the   second full   paragraph on that page.   A. Yes.

           Q.   You say: "I would say   that they have made it plain that
                they regarded the function of stewards from the club as
                di recting people to their seats, and manning gates
                around the ground". A. Yes.

           Q.   "They very much regarded the Police being in charge of
                crowd control generally, both inside and outside the
                ground, and indeed the writ t e n i n s t ructions to stewards
                which we issue every year take these factors into account".
                And you point out they were drafted by Mr. Lock. A. Yes.

           Q.   You assume, therefore, having regard to his past experience
                as a Police Superin t e n d e n t he would have borne that in
                mind. A. That is right and they were circu l a t e d each year
                to the police for any comment they wished to make on them.

           Q.   When you say that they had made it plain that they regarded
                the function of the stewards as you set out are there any
                specific meetings or discussions that you are thinking
                about when you say that?  A. Yes, that comes about form
                the annual meeting of stewards when the re s p o n s i b i l i t y
                between stewards and Police is made clear.

           Q. Were you aware of what is in fact ap pendix 'L' I think to
               the Police standing orders, which appears at our page 329,
               the relevant part of it being at 336.        I am not suggesting
               that this was a document that you n e c e s s a r i l y saw because
               this was a copy that was sent not to you but to the
               ambulance service.  I had not ac tually seen this doucment
               until I had it supplied in the bundle.

           Q.   That makes it plain, does it not, on the face of it, that
                the police are viewing internally the role of stewards
                as including the prev ention of over crowding and ensuring
                that crowd limits in various parts of the ground were
                complied with. A. Yes, Sir, that is what it says.

           Q.   Do I u n derstand you to be saying that in your dealings
                 with the police in conn e c t i o n with semi-finals that was never
                 anything that they had said to you? A. The police have
                 never since I have been at the club sought to change the
                 actual system of the stewarding as it has been.

           Q.   They recognized     or accepted the fact that your stewards
                 would not be on   the terraces. A. On the Leppings Lane
                 terraces.

SBDR4                                                      G.   MACKRELL

        Q.   The point has been made, I think this morning, if they
             are on the Kop why not on the Leppings Lane. A. There is
             only a very small number on the Kop and they are p r e d o m ­
             inantly there to keep the gangways clear, which obviously
             there are not any gangways on the Le ppings Lane terrace.

        Q.   If we look at page 451 in this bundle we see your i n s t r u c t ­
             ions to stewards, this is the instructions to match day
             staff.  It is perfectly plain that there is no reference
             in it to stewards on the terraces at all. A. Yes, Sir.

        Q.   And 455, that is your standing i n s t r uctions to stewards
             which is transformed into a little booklet or fold up piece
             of paper which each steward has? A. Yes.

        Q.   Again,   there is nothing in there, is there, which       specif ically
             refers   to stewarding of the terraces? A. No, Sir.

        Q.   456 at the top we see the reference to —  and I think that
             this is a matter that you were telling me about earlier,
             stewards not to become involved with crowd misbehaviour .
             A. That is correct, Sir.

        Q.   As far as the tannoy is c o ncerned have there ever been
              d i f f iculties about the tannoy and hear i n g it in any parts
              of the ground? A. Yes, Sir.

        Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I have got the figure of 376
             in my head somewhere.   Is that correct for the day?
             A. Yes, that includes gate men.

        Q.   That includes gate men but not turnstile operators?
             A. Yes, gate men and turn stile operators, it is the same
             term, I am sorry, Sir.

        Q.       MR. COLLINS: That is all your staff, if I may put it
             that way, I know they are not strictly staff but including
             all part-timers, stewards, gate men, etc. A. That is right.

        Q.   I was coming to the tannoy and asking you whether you had
              had diffic ulties about a u dibility in any parts of the
              ground. A. We had a slight problem in an evac uation test
              with the audi bility  in the c o ncourses under the North and
              South Stands.

        Q.   That was back in 1987, I think. A. Yes, it was as a result
              of an e v acuation test during a match.     As a result of
              this work was u nder taken at the end of that season.      I
              think that it was e x p e n diture of somewhere in the region
              of £9,000, £10,000, and the matter remedied.

        Q.   Since then have you been aware of any problems about
              audibility of the tannoy? A. No, Sir, I have not.   It is
              always a difficult thing in relation to the audi bility
              of the tannoy with regard to balance within grounds because
                                      95



SDR5                                             G.   MACKRELL

            one has a situation with regards to balance within grounds.
            One has a situation, for example, whereby on a semi-final
            when you have a full end on one end of the ground, and you
            have another situation where you may only have two hundred
            people at that end of the ground.   I think that does affect
            the balance, so the sound engineer has assured me but it
            was in fact tested prior to the semi-final.

       Q.   Had you ever come across any difficulties with the police
            override as opposed to the tannoy from the disc jockeys
            op erating room or what ever? A. No, Sir.

       Q.   The reason that I ask that is that        there is some evidence
            that is available that the anno u n c e m e n t by Mr.Dalglish,
            you will remember, on the a f ternoon in question, he started
            off in the control box.   It was indicated by some spectators

 •          that they could not hear him, and so he went down to the
            disc jockey room and made his anno u n c e m e n t from there.
            A. I was not aware of that, Sir.

       Q.   So far as you are aware there were not    and have not been
            any audi bility problems in re lation to the tannoy other than,
            of course, of audi b ility over noise. A. Exactly, Sir.

       Q.   Sometimes you can hear something is being anno unced but
            you cannot always hear what it is. A. The problem is
            obviously when one tests and has the engineers in usually
            the ground is empty, Sir.

       Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       The police overrides   the club.
            A. That is right.

       Q.   But what is it overriding?  Something that is normally
            operated from the club control room or the disc jockey
            place? A. Which is in the same box, Sir, it is underneath.
            The police control box, the disc jockey is u n derneath
            h i m , Sir .

       Q.   That is nothing to do with the club's control room? A. The
            club system is there and the police cut into the club
            system.  They have an override on for that.

       Q.   The control room I had in mind is the one where all the
            screens are. A. No, Sir, that is the t elevision room.          If
            you go into the police control box where the CCTV cameras
            are, in the corner of the terrace, u n d e r n e a t h there is the
            disc jockey box.

       Q.   I see.   Thank you.    A. On the ground     floor.

       Q.       MR. COLLINS: It would have just been a question
            of going down the stairs? A. He can override on a switch.

       Q.   If Mr. Dalglish ------ A. Mr. Da lglish only has to go

       Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Can we look at phot o g r a p h 47,
            perhaps, in the West Midlands.   Whilst it is being found
            is what is called the club's tannoy solely for the purpose
            of the disc jockey or have you got any capacity from the
            control room, the club's control room, to issue a messa ge?
            A. No, Sir.   Any messages that are issued are issued via
            the police.

       Q.   I see.  Can we see it on 47? A. Yes, Sir.          It is unde rneath
            where you see the telephone numbers there.          It is exactly
            underneath.

       Q.   I see,   thank you.

       Q.        MR. COLLINS: Was there any d i scussion between you and
            the police about the possibility of non ticket holders
            a rriving at the semi-final?   A. N o t as such. One is always
            conscious of the fact that a number of people do try to
            arrive without tickets.

       Q.   You would not have been surprised if a number of non ticket
             ho lders had turned up, would you? A. One always gets a
             number .

       Q.   Clearly this being an all ticket capacity match none of
            them ought to have been allowed to get in. A. That is
            right, Sir.

       Q.   Were you aware of any contingency plans that the police had
             to deal with people who turned up with o u t tickets? Had
             there been any discussions with you? A.There had not been
             any d iscussions with me, Sir, no.

       Q.   Had any discussions been held with you about contingenc y
             plans if there was a build-up and a crush at Leppings
             Lane? A. No.

       Q.   That was not apparently    forseen by anyone?      A.   It was not
             discussed with me.

       Q.   Did you have in mind the p ossibility that there might be
            a build up of people there?           A. I had no reason to expect
            there to be an una c c e p t a b l e build up, Sir, no, bearing in
            mind the record of the two previous semi-finals.

       Q.   Your recollection, as you say, of the 1988 semi-final
             is that everything went very smoothly? A. Yes, Sir.

       Q.   I think that there was a small pitch invasion at the end
             of the match but apart from that no apparent trouble.
             A . N o , Sir.

       Q.   I just want to ask you a little bit about the day of
             the match itself, the day of the semi-final.  I am not,
             as I say, going to go in any detail through your statement
                                            G.   MACKRELL

because it is already there but I think I should ask you
one or two things.  We have heard some evidence, I think
that it was Mr. Kirton,

                                                           G. MACKRELL


                       Cross-Examined bv MR. MAXWELL:

    Q. Mr. Mackrell, I only want to ask you something afcout tickets
       again. LL1, 2 and 3, I think you accepted that these related
       to soffle form of security coding? - A. No, sir, it is a batch
       printing system.

    Q. I want to suggest to you something that has been put to me as
       the explanation of LL1, 2 and 3, and it is a code which the
       spectator might in years gone by have been able to break and
       to know where to go to on the terraces, and that the numbers
       correspond to the numbers which appear over the entrances, the
       tunnels leading into the terraces.   Can you look at West
       Midlands 2, a volume of photographs there? Photograph 17 for
       example. - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. You see there is a big "2" over the tunnelentrance? -             A. Yes,
       sir.

    Q. As well as "A" and "B". What is suggested to me is that an
       earlier stage in the history of this ground, if you look back
       at photograph 14 on the right-hand concrete pillar there used
       to be a sign there with a number on it immediately above what
       can hardly be read, but it is a sign which says "Standing” on
       that pillar, and there used to be a number there, either "I"
       or "3", and on the equivalent position on the north end of
       this back side of the West Stand there was a No. 3?

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Is that we we see on photograph 4?

              MR. MAXWELL:   Thank you, sir, yes:

    Q. The numbers which appear on the terrace tickets, LL1, 2 and 3,
       correspond to numbers which used to appear over the tunnel
       entrances that lead on to the terraces.  - A. Tickets have not
       been printed with that during my period at the club, I can
       assure you.  They have not been printed with that
       configuration in mind whilst I have been at the club.

    Q. What configuration? - A. Splitting the tickets into individual
       pens.

    Q.   But in years gone by. - A.That may have been the case.

    Q.    It may be nothing to do with some printing batch numbering. -
         A. It may have been, sir.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         "LL3" means Leppings Lane 3?

              MR. MAXWELL:   An entrance into the terraces, LL3
         entrance:

    Q. Because when the fan has given up the left-hand portion of the
       ticket, looking at page 163 of your club bundle, all he is
       left with on the right-hand portion as a clue where to go is
       the information "LL3", a number, and the word "Leppings Lane
       Standing"? - A. Yes.
                               107



                                                   G. MACKRELL



Q. That is right? - A. That is right, sir, but I can say it was
   not done for that purpose.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE  TAYLOR: I have not actually taken up the
     point when the ticket is split the man released through the
     turnstile has got nothing left in his hand to tell him where
     to go, unless the ”LL3” means something. That is what it
     comes to, is not it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.       MR. MAXWELL:     If he   has retained in his mind....

Q.        LORD JUSTICE  TAYLOR: It is the right-hand bit he
     retains? - A. Yes, sir.   I have already said to Mr. Collins,
     sir, that I think the ticket is not the best, and i take that
     point.

Q. That is   very fair of you, but I want to be sure I have got ir
   right.    It says, "This portion to be retained” , and it has not
   got any   direction on it. - A. No, there is no direction on it.
   That is   right, sir.

Q. Other than "LL3” , if that means anything. - A. Yes, sir.

Q.        MR. MAXWELL:Assuming it was a very intelligent fan      who
     retained the information on the left-hand portion after he had
     given it up, but thought to himself as he approached the
     tunnel, "Ah, I have got to go through B” , when he gets into
     the tunnel he will find another "B” sign inside it, won’t
     he? Would you look at photographs 19 and 20. You see in the
     roof of the tunnel in photograph 20 for example, that B and A
     are repeated? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. So they are all going to pen 4, if he is going to be confused
   at all by the information ”B”? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. In fact, does it seem more likely that LL1, 2 and 3 relates to
   the entrances to the terraces? - A. I hear what you say, sir,
   but I can assure you that was not the interpretation of the
   ticket.

Q. I merely put to you what has been suggested to me, and
   as to which there may not be any evidence unless Mr.
   Lock, for example, can remember it.

Q.        MR. JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am bound to say I had not seen
     the "A” and ”B” on photograph 20 until now, but from the
     front of the turnstiles right to when you get in it is a
     package of disinformation, is not it? - A. Yes, sir.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT:

Q.   One matter, Mr. Mackrell, the advertising of pre-match
     entertainment for this Semi-Final, perhaps we had better have
     this in evidence, is it right that there was advertised in one
     or more Liverpool League programmes in the weeks before this
     Semi-Final that there would be pre-match entertainment

                                                        G. MACKRELL


           before this Semi-Final?   I think you are aware of that? - A.
           Yes, sir.

        Q. So that if any Liverpool fan coming to the Semi-Final was
           influenced in his proposed time of arrival by whether that
           would happen or not, he would come believing there would be
           pre-match entertainment, if he had read his programme? - A. If
           he had read his programme, yes, sir.

        Q. Quite so. We all know it was not your fault that pre-match
           entertainment did not take place. I want to make that clear.
           - A. Thank you.

                        Cross-Examined bv MR. KALLIPETIS:

        Q. Mr. Mackrell, when you arrived at Sheffield Wednesday Football
           Club did you become aware that SYMAS officers attended each
           home match courtesy of complementary tickets in the South
           Stand? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. And following investigations I think you have carried out
           since this Inquiry began are you satisfied there was a
           breakdown in communication within your office which
           resulted in the liaison officers from SYMAS not being
           given that facility for the Semi-Final matches? - A.
           Yes, sir, I do take that.

        Q. Do I understand that you would take steps to ensure that does
           not happen in the future? - A. I am sure those steps will be
           taken, sir, yes.

        Q. Prior to 1989, Mr. Mackrell, would it be right to say the club
           was content with the first-aid facility provided by St. John
           Ambulance, and content to rely on a 999 call if they required
           SYMAS? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. Does it follow from that that prior to 1989 the club did not
           perceive there would be any necessity for attendance at large
           games of a SYMAS ambulance and Officers? - A. That is right,
           sir.

        Q. Would it follow from that, therefore, that the club would not
           consider making an extra payment for a a requirement they did
           not perceive to be necessary? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. As far as the future is concerned, Mr. Mackrell, is it right
           to say the club will continue to use the excellent services
           provided by St. John's, but also for the larger matches will
           consider having a permanent attendance of a SYMAS ambulance
           and the necessary Officers to give support? - A. Correct, sir.
           Consideration will definitely be given to that.

        Q. That will be for matches where either the expected attendance
           or previous previous history or other circumstances dictate
           that such a requirement is prudent? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. Perhaps I should emphasise, Mr. Mackrell, that contrary to
                              109



                                                  G. MACKRELL


     what some Ambulance Officers thought, there was infact no
     financial benefit to the club by the withdrawal ofthe tickets
     which they had previously enjoyed and might have enjoyed but
     for a Cup Semi-Final? - A. Thank you.

Q.   Canyou help me on another matter,   please.  Is it right after
     the 1988 Semi-Final some of the fencing behind the goal at
     pens 3 or 4 was torn down? - A. No, not torn down. It
     needed an element of re-welding.

Q.   Why was that? - A. I don’t know, sir. There is always damage
     at large games in a number of seats damaged and damage to the
     rear of the West Stand is a common thing

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Damage to the wire is rather
     different, is not it? - A. Yes.

Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:   Was not it the wiring had in fact been
     -    perhaps "torn down” is putting it in more graphic terms than
     is accurate - had not there been a hole turn in the fencing
     behind the goal? - A. As I understood it it was that the mesh
     had sprung in certain areas away from the actual side
     supporters.

Q. Do you understand how that occurred? - A. I don’t, sir, no.

Q.   Are     you able to    tell me whether or not when there-welding
     was carried out some element of reinforcement was also put in
     place? - A. I can’t sir. From checking the invoice of the
     work that was done it was in the region of £500.   It does not
     indicate to me there was a massive amount of work taking
     place.

Q.   Depends on the area they are working on, does not it? - A.
     Yes, sir.

Q. But you can’t help the Inquiry any further about that? - A. I
   can’t, sir.  In fact, I had not recalled it until the matter
   had been raised the other day, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAH.OR:   There is nothing to say whether it
     was deliberate damage or pressure? - A. from that point of
     view, no, sir.

Q.       MR. KALLIPETIS:    The first-aid facilities, you have been
     asked about this, and you know the requirements, and I think
     at some stage you would have been aware of the list of
     equipment that Sheffield City Council had specified as being
     the basic requirements for the first-aid room? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did the club take any steps to try and fulfil that basic
   requirement? - A. The steps I took, sir, was consequential to
   a visit of an annual inspection, I had a meeting.  The comment
   was raised that the first-aid room should be given the
   equipment as necessary.   I contacted the then duty officer, a
   Mr. Peter Wells, of the St. John’s Ambulance Brigade, and
   asked him what he required. He gave me a list of equipment

                                                G. MACKRELL


   which was required, which our physiotherapist, Alan Smith,
   obtained for him and we gave to him prior to the commencement
   of the season.

Q. Does that mean there   was a variation of the written condition
   which we find at our   page 96 in the core bundle? You remember
   that sets out a list   of the equipment, including a Minuteman
   resuscitator? - A. I   was never asked for a Minuteman
   resuscitator, no.

Q. The core bundle page 96.   It accompanies the letter of 8th
   June, 1979, which went to your predecessor, and which enclosed
   the detailed comments of all the disciplines represented on
   the working party, and it is headed, ’’South Yorkshire County
   Council” , page 91, and refers to the 1975 Act, and then
   describes them as ’’Matters requiring attention at the club” .
   On page 96 in paragraph (R) subparagraph (8) there is
   ’’Equipment: the following is a minimum list to provide a
   basic service” . - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Were you aware of that? - A. I was not, sir, because I must
   say I did not go further back initially until the events of
   this Inquiry, rather than the issuing of the safety
   certificate.

Q. When then this annual inspection took place you referred to
   earlier, how did the question of first-aid equipment arise? -
   A. It was raised by the representative from the Health &
   Consumer Department of the local authority.

Q. Did not they refer to this list which had been sent to the
   club in 1979? - A. No, sir.

Q. And so as far as the club or as far as you were aware, the
   only requirement from Sheffield City Council via the Health &
   Safety people were there was that you should contact the St.
   John Ambulance Brigade and ask them what they required? - A.
   The onus was put on myself to actually make sure there was
   suitable equipment provided for the first-aid room, and I
   then went to the duty officer of the St. John’s Ambulance
   Brigade and asked him what equipment he required.

Q. Are you saying they did not say to you, ’’This is what we
   consider to be the basic requirements” . They simply said to
   you, "You have to make sure you have the basic requirements
   there"? - A. Yes, I was not given a list, sir, no.

Q. Page 7 of your statement, Mr. Mackrell, you referred to
   arrangements for keeping fans who are expected to arrive
   without tickets or who want to pay cash at the turnstile in a
   place where they can be contained. On my copy the numbering
   does not always appear.   I think it is the bottom of page 8.
   There are contingency plans agreed with the Police to deal
   with an emergency situation at the ground.   The page after
   that:  "Contingency plans for coping with spectators to come
   into the ground” . - A. Yes.

                                                  G. MACKRELL


Q. The bottom of that you refer to arrangements made to remove
   spectators without tickets from the vicinity of the ground,
   and you say that happened at the recent Middlesbrough game
   where the space available was severely restricted due to the
   closure of the West Stand area? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. Prior to this Semi-Final did you receive any information from
   the Police at all that their previous experience of Liverpool
   attending throughout the country from other Forces would
   indicate a large number tended to arrive without tickets
   hoping to be let in on the day? - A. No, sir, I did not
   receive - we did not draw up that contingency plan.

Q. Over the page of your statement at the top, you refer to the
   Middlesbrough match again, the Police anticipating there
   might be a lot of Middlesbrough supporters, and that they had
   contingency plans in place, to your knowledge, to hold
   spectators arriving without tickets at a nearby Police sports
   ground? - A. yes, sir.

Q. You are personally aware they had such plans? - A. Yes, sir,
   the local Police sports ground is almost adjacent to
   Hillsborough.

Q. And thus the Police considered that whatever civil liberties
   might say, they did have power to hold people in a place who
   did not have tickets who intended to go to a football match? -
   A. I did not debate the matter at length with them, sir, but I
   was aware of the fact they intended to keep people there, yes,
   sir.

Q. Photograph 47 of West Midlands 2, bundle B, which you looked
   at before, which shows where the disc jockey sat beneath the
   Police control box. Above the Police control box there is a
   panel there which appears to have a bulb on it. Is that one
   of these panels which has the facility for moving messages? -
   A. Yes, it is a one line message centre.

Q. Is that visible from the Kop end? - A. It      is visible from   the
   Kop end, yes, sir.

Q. Would it have been possible to have put a message out on that
   indicator to the effect, "Please, we have an accident. People
   are injured.  Please be quiet", something   to that effect, if
   it was thought the Tannoy could not have got over the
   chanting? - A. I don't think it would have been effective,
   sir.  It is not the best system in the world, and there are
   only 32 digits that can go up into it to get any significant
   message.  It becomes a rolling message which you usually find
   loses its impact.




                         /Q. I see.   You can't

       Q. I see. You cannot transmit messages of any length? - A.
          No, sir, not without them rolling on like ....

       Q. That is what I meant, a continuous message being broadcast?
          - A. Yes, it can be done in certain circumstances, sir, but
          it is a very slow - it is a very old system. It is
          something we do not actually use for public address
          announcements.

       Q. Lastly this, please, Mr. Mackrell. In the club bundle
          there are copies of the statements^receipts and
          payments for various matters. There is not a copy
          for the 1989 semi-final. — A. That is correct, sir.

       Q. Is there a particular reason for that? - A. Yes, sir.
          It has not been concluded as yet, sir.

       Q. I understand you are awaiting the bill for the Police
          services. Is that right? - A. I am awaiting lots of
          things in relation to that, sir, actually. The Police
          account is one of them.

               MR. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you.

                      Cross-examined by MR. TOULSON:

       Q. Two very brief matters, if I may, Mr. Mackrell.  The first
          concerns your enquiry of Eastwoods about if they had any
          amendment to the safety certificate. Is the position this,
          that on the day I think Mr. Strange noted, April, 1987,
          you rang him and enquired if Eastwoods had got any
          amendment to the safety certificate? - A. That is right, sir.

       Q. His response was they did not but there certainly should be
          because most recently there had just been an approval of
          an increase of the Spion Kop capacity up to 21,000
          spectators? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q.So there certainly should be but not in their hands? -A.
          No, sir. At that stage I was not quite sure obviously
          whether a new certificate had been issufd^which was
          subsequent to the one issued by South Yorkshire.

       Q. Then he made some unflattering remarkabout the speed
          of the Licensing Authority?- A. Yes, sir.

       Q. The other matter is this.    So far as Eastwoods are
          concerned, is this the position, they would carry ©ut
          an annual inspection and testing of barriers and would
          report to the club following that? They would also
          normally be present on the two-yearly or yearly as the
          case might be inspection of the ground by the members;
          of thee officer working party? - A . Yes, sir.

       Q. Other than that they would act or advise on any matter

                                                         G. MACKRELL

          on which they were asked to do so? - A. That is right, as
          and when.

        Q. Is that an accurate summary? -A. Yes, sir.

                       Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

        Q. Mr. Mackrell, just one or two matters to begin with.
           Did you have a portable personal radio on the day of
           this match? - A. I had one of the club ones, yes, sir.

        Q. One of the club radios. So that would enable you to hear
           all the conversations because it was working on a talk-
           through basis with all the stewards who were using it?
           - A.Yes, sir.
        Q. And also you would know what Mr. Lock was talking about?
           - A. Yes, sir.
        Q. Were you using your radio on the occasion of this match?
           -a. I used it to a limited degree, sir, yes. I do not
           have normally a great use for it. I retain one but on
           a normal match I do not actually get very many messages
           which relate to myself.
        Q. But you would have the radio on? - A. Oh, yes, sir.

        Q. And you would be, as it were, listening to it just in
           casethere was anything of importance? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. Because, your role, you were in fact the Safety Officer,
           were not you?- A. Correct, yes, sir.
        Q.IThat was something you made clear to the Council in your
           letter which is at the core bundle at page 422? - A. Yes,
           sir.
        Q. Is it also correct that you had a television monitor
           availableeto you apart from the one in the club control
           room?- A. Yes, sir, two monitors available to us.

        Q. So you were able to observe whatever -were you able to
           switch in to any of the Police cameras from that? - A. No,
           sir, no, sir. The only monitor that is in my own office
           and Sharon LanecS office is one ....

        Q. Is that two monitors or ___ - A. Yes, there are two
           monitors.   I did make that point, sir. There are two
           monitors,  one in her office and one inmine.

        Q. And one in the club control room, so there are three?
           - A. Yes, sir. The two that afreeinrcthe offices are
           just offshoots of the main one and that shows the

                                                            G. MACKRELL

            actual breakdown of the individual turnstiles and the
            numbers coming through the turnstiles.

       Q. Did not you have a monitor enabling youto see what was
          coming through on the television cameras? - A. Only the
          fixed camera, sir, not the Police cameras.

       Q. And where was that that was available^to you? - A. That
          was in my office.

       Q.    So you have a bank of monitors enabling you to see what
            was on the fixed cameras? -A. Yes. Theones on the
            fixed cameras, I inherited that in my office, sir. It
            is one which actually is of limited use actually.

       Q. Which camera did it show? -A. It switches round.

       Q.   You can select? - A. I can select.

       Q.    Very well^, You did not have a facility, do we understand,
            to view any of the Police cameras? - A. That is correct.
            That can be dealt with in the club control room but that
            is by arrangement with the Police.

       Q. Very well. Mr. Mackrell, is this the understanding that
          we should have from your evidence, that in effect the club
          took no steps whatsoever once the spectators had entered
          the enclosure and gone to the terrace to ensure their
          safety in 1989? - A. In what way, sir?

       Q.    Well, did they take any steps fco ensure the safety of the
            spectators on the terrace? -A. The stewarding of the
            terraces had already been agreed, sir. It was a matter
            dealt with by the Police.

       Q.   Now yduusaythat. - A. Yes, sir.
       Q.    You are not identifying any agreement, are you? - A. I am
            identifying the situation which I inherited back when I
            joined the club and I discussed with my security officer,
            Mr. Lock, and I discussed and was agreed with Mr. Mole.

       Q. This date - well, first of all, may we have an answer to
          the question? Is the answer that the club took no steps
          to ensure the safety of the spectators on the terrace?

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     On the Leppings Lane ___

                 MR. WOODWARD:   On the Leppings Lane terrace.

                 THE WITNESS:   No steps on the basis I knew the
            arrangement there with the Police.

       Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   You say an arrangement. - A. Yes, sir.

             Q. Now, there was nothing in writing, was there, to say
                that the Police accepted the responsibility of ensuring
                the safety of spectators on the terrace? - A. But that
                matter had already been discussed by myself on a previous
                occasion with Mr. Mole, sir.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I just ask, Mr. Woodward?
                Are you putting a case that the club stewards had a duty
                to control the crowd on the Leppings Lane terrace?

                     MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, I am putting a case ....

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Because I would like to know
                upon the basis of what evidence if you are.

                     MR. WOODWARD:   Well, sir, the case that I seek to
                put in relation to the club's responsibility,,the res­
                ponsibility of the club for the safety of those persons
                on the terrace was something of which the club were
                never relieved.

                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Well, that is argument, is
               not it?

                     MR. WOODWARD:   Well.

                    LORD; JUSTICE TAYLOR:  The Green Guide no doubt you
               will refer me to but so far as the evidence is concerned
               I think every single Police Officer who had had anything
               to do with it has said they did not exypct the stewards
               to do anything about controlling the crowd on the terraces.

                    MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, we are mindful of the evidence.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Well, am I wrong about that?

                     MR. WOODWARD:   Well, the Officers have given their
                evidence about it, sir.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes.

                    MR. WOODWARD:    It is clearly there in the record:

             Q. Mr. Mackrell, you did read the Green Guide and were
                fully familiar with it? - A. Yes, sir.

             Q. You made the point to the Council in 1987 when they
                wrote to you in October that you had had it in your
                possession for some months and were aware of its
                contents? - A. Yes, sir.
             Q, Now, this understanding that you had with Mr. Mole, was
                it before or after you had read theCrGreen Guide? - A.
                Before the Green Guide I had read the previous Green
                Guide and this Green Guide, yes.
             Q. So your understanding with Mr. Mole or that you had in
                relation to the Police was before you read the Green
                Guide in 1986? -A. Yes, sir. 1986. I joined the company

                                                        G. MACKRELL

              in December, 1986. I had the conversation with Mr. Mole
              and ascertained this around the period of the beginning
              of 1987, sir;

           Q. The position is this, that your understanding that you
              received was before you read the Green Guide of 1986.
              Is that right? - A. On or about the same time, sir, yes.

           Q. Well, when you read the Green Guide did you observe
              what it said about management responsibility? - A.
              I noted what it said but I also noted the system that
              was in operation at Sheffield Wednesday.

           Q. Didyou then take that up with any of the Police Officers
              just tocheck whether what you read in the Green Guide
              was accurate? -A. I knew the system that operated at
              Sheffield Wednesday. The c<ro^d was stewarded. The
              fact they were stewarded by the Police I felt was
              aeceptable. It was acceptable to the club. It was
              acceptable to the Police.
           Q. What did you expect the Police to do in relatione,<to
              the persons on the terrace to ensure their safety?
              - A. I expected the Police - the system was in operation.
              The Police were operating the system themselves. The
              Police had never come back to me at any time and said
              hang on? the Green Guide says you have got to do the
              stewarding. We are not going to do it any more.

           Q, Didyou havea steward appointed to be in   charge of
              the terrace? - A. No, sir.

           Q. Did you appoint any steward w|b had any responsibility
              for the terrace, for the Leppings Lane terrace? - A. I
              had a steward who had overall responsibility for the
              exit gates goittg away from the terraces, yes.

           Q. For the exit gates only? - A. For the exit gates, yes.

           Q. Do you remember, and this is a document that was
              produced to Mr. Maxwell earlier this week or a late
              stage of the Inquiry in relation to ....
                  MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, it is not in the bundle. You
             will recall it perhaps. It was produced, I think, by
             my learned friend Mr. Gibson-Watt from the depths of
             his files :

           Q. You wrote onthe 10th of March, 1987, to Dr. Eastwood
              saying"flease find enclosed a copy of the Football
              League's proposals as to the implementation of member­
              ship schemes for clubs within the Football League.

          course"?- A. Yes, sir.

       Q. You enclose the 5th;6f :March, 1987, letter and part of
          that letter at page 2 was a requirement that the clubs
          should submit a plan? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. And the local plan there ....

               MR. WOODWARD:   I beg your pardon, sir. The letter
          is the 10th of March, 1987, from Mr. Mackrell, the first
          in the bundle:

       Q. It encloses the letter of the 5th of March, 1987, which
          in turn enclosed the F.A.'s requirements or .... -GA.
          Yes, sir.

       Q. Local plans.   And at Question 2 ....

               MR. WOODWARD:    Sir, is yours a back to front one?

               1©RD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes.

               MR. WOODWARD:    Forgive me.     Sir, I am looking at
          a document ....

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Which bit do you want me to
          tune into?

               MR. WOODWARD:   Sheet that is headed local plans.
          That was enclosed to the club from the F.A. and that
         was forwarded by the club to Dr. Eastwood, I think,
          according to the letter:

       Q. On the first page of that one of the sections is stadium
          operation. Do you see? - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. You are aware of what it says and the club is asked to
          indicate and take account of the following points.
          Stadium operation. Determine policy for policing and
          stewarding. - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. And there was a section there at Section 4 in relation

       Q. And the club's reply was the document that came into
          Mr. Maxwell's hands and then permeated through to the
          rest of us here.
               MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, I am not sure whether that
          is with the bundle.  Page 5 of the bundle.Thank you.
          Entitled Sheffield Wednesday F.C. local plan.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes.   Is there a   letter
                              118



                                                       G. MACKRELL

     with that?

            MR. COLLINS:    Yes, sir.   In front of it, sir.
            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Dated?

            MR; COLLINS:    6th of May, 1987.

          MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, the document I am inviting your
     attention to is that which is entitled Sheffield Wednesday
     Football Club local plan.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes. Does not seem to have
     much to doswith that letter unless I misunderstood it,
     but never mind. I have got the document here.

            MR. WOODWARD:   This is what the club sent   to the
     F.A.

          MR. COLLINS:   It is the last line of the letter,
     second page, a copy of the local plan is attached.
            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I see.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   Under stewarding in the local plan
     it says at Section 1 "Sheffield Wednesday employ a retired
     Police Superintendent, Mr. D. Lock, as their safety and
     security consultant"? - A. Yes.

Q.    2. The ground is subdivided into its component stands
     and terraces and a steward is appointed to be in charge
     of each area. - A. Yes.

Q. Now, did that mean what it says, that there was a steward
   to be in charge of each area? - A . I have already said,
   sir, there was not a steward appointed for the Leppings
   Lane terrace.

Q. Why did it say on this document that there was? - A.
   Because that area was stewarded by the Police. I sent
   a copy of that document and request in relation to the
   local plan to Mr. Mole for his comments and he did not
   refer back in any shape or form.




                                    / Q. You sent a

SDV1                                                             G.   MACKRELL

       Q.   You sent a copy of the local plan for Mr. Mo le's
            approval, did you?     A. Mr. H o l e had a copy of the local
            plan.  Mr. Mol e had a copy of the letter from the Fotball
            League requ es ti ng details about propo se d m e m b e r s h i p scheme
            and I did have a rsponse back from Mr. Mole.

       Q.   Did the club ever go to th,e police and say, did you ever
            go to the police and say: "We know what has been done in
            the past, or we think we know what has been done in the
            past. Lord Ju stice P o pplewell has repo rt ed and we see
            what he says there about stewards and policing.          We have
            got the Green Guide, the new one, and we see what it says
            there about m a nagement respo ns ib il it y, whe re do we stand?"
            Was any th in g like that done? A. I never put it in those
            words to Mr. Mole.     He was aware of the situation.       I
            was app ra is ed of the si tuation when I joined the company
            and he never at any time indi ca te d that he wi shed to be
            removed from that responsibi li ty .

       Q.   Are you saying in terms that in some man ne r you had an
             a gre em en t where the re s p o n s i b i l i t y of the club for ensur in g
             the p revention of o v e r c rowding on the terrace s was not the
             club's res po ns ib il it y, that it had been tr an sferred in
             some manner to the police. A. No, Sir, I am saying that
             the ma tter of stew ar di ng upon the Lep pi ng s Lane terrace
             was carried out by the police.                 It was accepte d by the
             police that they took that re s p o n s i b i l i t y and Mr. Mole
             and no other police officer has at any time, at the annual
             inspection, sought to have that s i tuation altered.

       Q.   May I ask about the con v e r s a t i o n w hich you had      with
            Mr. Lock that led to you going to look at gate                'c'.
             A . Yes, Sir.

       Q.   What did Mr. Lock say to you?   A. He basi ca ll y said              that
             the gate has either broken or been opened. We were                  not
             in a positio n to say.

       Q.   Did you just have the one con v e r s a t i o n with him        or were
             there two? A. There was one conversation, Sir.

       Q.   Did he tell you that he was conce rn ed as to what was
             h a ppening at gate 'c'? A. No, Sir.

       Q.   You said: "Leave it to me", and then you go off? A. Yes,
             that is right.  I went down to ap praise the situation.

       Q.   You went to find out what had hapepned,             did you- A.      Yes,
             Sir.

       Q.   Did you examine      the gate?    A. No,   Sir.

       .Q. Did you talk to anyone there to find out what had happe ne d?
            A. No, Sir. I have al ready made that point.       I was already
            on my way to the police control to asc e r t a i n what had
            happened.
                                               G.   MACKRELL

But you went to the gate to find out what had ha ppened?
A. No, I had to go through the gate to  get to the police
control.

Whi ch gate are you talking about?  A. Gate ' c ' . I went
throu gh there to have a look and go back that way on my
way back to the police control.

The c o n v e rsation you had wi th Mr. Lock was by the players
tunnel, was it not? A. Near to the players tunnel, yes.

On the pitch side? A. yes,      Sir.

You then went off to gate    'c'? A. Yes,    Sir.

You went    to gate ' c ' to asc ertain what had happened.
A. I went throu gh gate 'c'.      By the time I got to gate
' c ' it was orderly and there was a police officer there
acc epting tickets.     I a scertained the steward was pretty
shake n up and I was then on to go to the police c o n t r o l .

But you do not need to go throu gh gate 'c' to get to the police
control box. A. I could have gone throu gh gate 'e', Sir.

You would not go through gate 'c' to get to the police
control box, would you? A. I can do.  I can go throu gh gate
'c ' or gate 'e ' .

What     re ason did you go by gate ' c ' for? A. I wa nted to
a s c ertain on the way what had happened.     It is only a
matter of a few yards additional.

I thought that was why you had gone to gate 'c', in order
to as c e r t a i n what had happened. A. There was nothi ng to
s e e , Sir .

How could you asce rt ai n wi thout lo oking or talking to
people? A. Becau se I really felt that the person who was
likely to give me the information wo uld be the senior
police officer who was in the police control box.

Why not ask someone at gate 'c ' : "What is happ en in g?   What
has gone off?" A. I felt the situ at io n wa rranted me d i s c u s s ­
ing the matte r with the senior police officer.

Since you did go to gate 'c ' why did you not enq ui re what
had happe ne d? A. Becau se once I got there I was in a hurry.
It was not a matte r of sitting round ha ving a debate
with people there.

Your   purpose was one of enquriy,     was   it not? A. Yes.

The first place you came to was the actual          location
of the trouble. A. Yes.

SDV3                                                           G.   MACKRELL

       Q.   And you made no enquiry?      A. Only to ask if the steward
            was all right, Sir.

       Q.   You   made no enquiry about       gate   'c' at all?    A. No.

       Q.   You   then went off to the control        box? A. Yes.

       Q.   Acc ording to Mr. Lock's state me nt he saw you again.
            A. Yes.   I have read Mr. Lock's sta te me nt and I think that
            his state me nt and I are at var ia nc e on that point.

       Q.   It is plain that they are di ff erent but do you remem be r a
            co n v e rsation with Mr. Lock when he told you that the police
            had opened the gates? A. No, I cannot recall that c o n v e r ­
            sation and that is why it is not in my statement.

       Q.   You  do not recall the c o n v ersation with Mr. Lock, nor do
             you recall the conversation with Mr. Kirton? A. That is
             correct.

       Q.   Acc ording to Mr. Lock's stat em en t not only did he tell you
            that the police had opened the gate but you replied,
            saying: "Can we get them in?" or words to that effect.
            A. That is where I think that pos si bl y the stat em en ts are
            at variance.   The "Can we get them in?" was in rela ti on
            to the initial opening of the gates . That is my u n d e r ­
            st anding of the matter, the three or four hundred persons
            going throu gh the gate.

       Q.         LORD JUST I C E TAYLOR: I am sorry, I am not following.
            A. I am sorry, Sir.        I only had one conversation, as I
            u n derstand it, with Mr. Lock, Sir, when he advised me
            that the gate had been broken or opened and some three to
            four hund re d gained admittance.

       Q.   Who were you re ferring to when you said: "Can              we get them
             in?" A. Mean i n g can the club get them in.

       Q.   I am sorry, who were you re fe rring to ge tting   in?
             A. The three to four hundred, me aning can we ac co mmodate
             them.

       Q.       MR. WOODWARD: You do recall the conv e r s a t i o n about
            getting them in, do you? A. The initial conversation, yes,
            Sir, as per my statement.

       Q.   By the time that you went up to          the police control box       you
             had been to gate 'c'? A. Yes.

       Q.   You had had a c o n v e rsation with     Mr. Lock.   Had you also  had
             a conv e r s a t i o n with Mr. Kirton? A. No, no t at that time.
             I was speaking with Mr. Kirt on whe n Mr. Lock came to see
             me on the pitch.

       Q.   May we examine what you say about          your con v e r s a t i o n with
                                                     G.    MACKRELL

Mr.   Kirton?   A. Yes,   Sir.

You were here when he gave his evide nc e about it? A. Yes,
Sir .

Are you saying that that con v e r s a t i o n did not take place?
A. Yes, Sir, I think Mr. Kir to n is in correct in that matter.

He is not confused, he is ut terly m i s t a k e n about it?
A. He is mist ak en in re lation to the timings, yes.          I
am   not saying I did not have some casual conv e r s a t i o n with
him at an earlier time.

To   the best of your rec o l l e c t i o n his error is in relat io n
to   the time, is it?   A. It is in r e l ation to the time
possibly, Sir.    I do not recall the actual conversation
but it cannot possibly have been at the time which
Mr. Kirton states.

You see if Mr. Kirto n is right there was a di sc ussion at
the time with you when the qu estion of delayin g the game
was discussed. A. There was_never any d i s c u s s i o n rega rd in g
delaying the game and there was never any re quest made to
del ay in g the game.

Or was it a co nfusion about numbers             rather    than time?
A. I do not think so, Sir.

What do you recall being said by Mr. Ki rton and you?
A. I recall speak in g to Mr. Ki rton at approx i m a t e l y round
about the ten to three situation.         It was a matter r e g a r d ­
ing the press cover ag e of the N o t t i n g h a m Fo rest mana ge r
taking his place in his seat.

That was it? A. T h a t was basi ca ll y the co nv er sation. I
was spe ak in g to Mr. Kirto n when Mr. Lock came      toadvise
me about the gate.

What did he tell you about the gate?             A. That    the gate had
been opened or broken.

Did it occur to you as you went thro ug h gate               'c'   to see
wh ether it had been broken? A. No, Sir.

If what you say is right it would seem to have been a
rather point le ss journey to have gone via gate 'c' at
all.   It told you no thing and you sought no inf or ma ti on ?
A. No.

Do you know Mr.     Cannon?      A. No,   Sir.

 David Alex an de r Cannon.           There were ph otographers
 around. A. Th ere were many photo g r a p h e r s around, that is
w h a t the con v e r s a t i o n was with Mr. Kirton, Sir.

            with him at all about the situ at io n at Le ppings Lane

       Q.   Yes, the situ at io n out at Le ppings Lane. A. No, Sir.      The
            only c o n v e rsation we had was in relat i o n that there was
            still people to get in.

       Q.   What time was that?          A.   It was vary in g th ro ughout      the
            afternoon, Sir.

       Q.   What was the latest you had con v e r s a t i o n with Mr. Lock
            about still a few people to get in? A. I cannot recall,
            Sir, but it would have been after half past two.

       Q.   Would   it be about twenty        two? A.    I cannot recall.

       Q.   You had c o n v e rsation with Mr. Lock earlier about people
            coming in? A. We have c o n v ersations wi th Mr. Lock
            regula rl y throughout.

       Q.   You wou ld have expected him to keep you infor me d and he
            did keep you informed. A. We keep each other informed.
            If I have i nformation I would pass it to him.

       Q.   Did he at any time observe to you that there was all
            hell out there on Lep pi ng s Lane? A. No, Sir.

       Q.   Nothin g   like that?   A.   No,Sir.

                                               MR. COLLINS


Q. I rather fired that perhaps unexpectedly.  Would it be
   possible for you to research it and let me know, and it night
   be helpful to know since 1985 is when we were talking about
   for expenditure, what the balance sheet in terms of buying and
   selling players has been from 1985 to date? - A. Yes, sir.  In
   fact the Treasury Solicitors are in possession of copies of
   our accounts which do actually give that.

Q. Do they identify this clearly?   Perhaps it would be simpler
   if we could have it on one sheet of paper? - A. Yes, I will
   provide it on a piece of paper, of course, sir.

Q. Thank you very much, indeed.

        MR. COLLINS:   Sir, I assume it would be foolish to start
   on another witness this evening. There are one or two matters
   I can usefully mention before the adjournment, as we are
   clearly drawing near a close, and that is to try and tie up
   one or two loose ends with matters that are not going to be
   the subject of live evidence but can, I think, be the form of
   reports or documents put before the Inquiry.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That would be helpful, yes.   Have
   counsel had notice of this?

        MR. COLLINS:   Not specifically, but I think it is
   convenient I make this announcement, and then if there are any
   queries they can be dealt with overnight.

         There are a number of statements that have been
   circulated on various days, and witnesses have not been
   called, sometimes because the witnesses have not been reached
   and it has been agreed that their statements should be treated
   and such weight attached to them as is considered appropriate,
   and sometimes because the witnesses are not available.   I
   don't expect everyone to recall precisely which those are, but
   I think a list has been prepared or if it has not will be
   prepared which will set out the names of those and indicate
   which are those statements that clearly will be referred to.
   I do n 't propose to read any of them out. We read M r .
   Grobbelaar's exceptionally because at the time the matter
   arose cross-examination was being put based upon it. They can
   be taken as part of the Inquiry evidence.

        Sir, then there are a number of reports which have been
   provided to us by the investigating team. Most of them have,
   I think, been circulated, but without promising this is
   exhaustive, and the final list again will be given overnight,
   they include the following:

        First of all there is a report on the position so far as
   we have been able to ascertain it to date of the dead in the
   pens. There is a chart with a number of coloured dots on
   which I think and hope most, if not all, parties have seen,
   and you I know have seen, sir, which indicates that the
   majority of dead who have been located were in pen 3, but that
   some have been located in pen 4, and in pen 3 and I think also
                            130




                                                  MR. COLLINS


in pen 4 some appear to have died not at the front of the pens
but some way up the pens.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         I think the majority in 3, but at
least 5 in pen 4.

     MR. COLLINS:   That is correct.  I eiap&asise that, of
course, is not final, and we have had to put in the position
so far as we know it to date.

     In addition to that there is an indication and indeed a
list of names of 20 of the dead who died having come in gate C
after it was opened at 2.52. Twenty of the 95 have been
identified. Many have been identified from statements of
friends or relations who say they came in through the gate
with the deceased at the relevant time.

     There is then, sir, a weather report, which is a
comparison of the weather in 1988 and 1989. The effect of it
is that both were fine days but 1988 was 5 degrees colder than
1989, or thereabouts.

     There is a report from the West Midlands Police from a
Superintendent of the West Midlands Police on what happened at
the Everton-Norwich Semi-Final at Villa Park on the same day,
15th April.

     There will be - that I think may not yet have been
circulated - there will be an indication of the blood alcohol
levels of all the deceased, in the form of a list and the
relevant levels, together with covering statements from the
analyst, because there are minor qualifications that it is
right all those who are involved should see. Essentially, it
gives a picture of the blood alcohol levels.  If it helps,
sir, broadly, one-third had no alcohol at all, one-third have
under 80 - between 0 and 80 - and one-third have over 80, with
I think, speaking entirely from memory now, a maximum of 172.
The only reason one refers to 80 is that one knows that that
is the level for driving, and so it is the sort of level that
people have in mind.

     Sir, Mr. Woodward has produced a bundle which looks like
this. the yellow book I will call it, which contains a number
of appendices. Sir, Appendix A is a series of Police reports
of matches involving Liverpool supporters, and reports on
those matches. It is convenient that those should be before
the Inquiry, and it is equally convenient as they are together
in Mr. Woodward's bundle they can be put in in that.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         I have not had that yet.

     MR. COLLINS:   I don't think you have had that yet, sir,
no. This also includes as Appendix C a number of statements
of Police Officers which refer to seeing - witnesses, not only
Police Officers - regarding Liverpool fans attending without
tickets.  I am content that all those statements go in in the
same way as the statements I have referred to in the course of
                                             MR. COLLINS


my opening remarks.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You look worried, Mr. Woodward?

     MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, I am worried that you have not had
it, sir.  It has been available for many days.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Don't get excited, Mr. Woodward.
I have had plenty to read, and I am well aware of its
existence, and I will read it.

     MR. WOODWARD:    Thank you, sir.

     MR. COLLINS:    I take the responsibility for depriving
my Lord of that for the time being.

     Appendix D is a report of the Norwich-Everton match at
Villa Park, but that simply duplicates the report we have
already got.

     The only thing that is left from this is Appendix B.
That contains a number of statements, four in all, dealing
with a question of overheard conversations by Liverpool fans,
the inference which could be drawn ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Overheard conversations between?

     MR. COLLINS:   Between Liverpool fans, the inference to
be drawn from which could involve some support for a
suggestion that there was a possible number of fans who were
inclined or intended to get into the ground without tickets,
willy-nilly.  That is a matter which at the moment we are
still investigating, and we hope to be in a position to call
some evidence about that either tomorrow, or if that proves
impossible it may be necessary to call about half-an-hour's
worth of evidence on the day that we adjourn to for final oral
submissions.  I hope that won't be necessary, but it is
obviously right that should be left in the air, and we should
do as much as we can to tie up that particular loose end.
Sir, that is a matter which at the moment we would leave open,
and although the whole of the yellow document will be before
you, Appendix B is at the moment not to be treated as evidence
which is put in in any form, as it were.

     Sir, I think and hope, unless I am prompted from behind,
that covers all the reports I can think of at the moment we ,
would want to put in. I don't promise that there are not
others, and I will check overnight and a full list will be
produced.

     MR. HYTNER:   Sir, is it a reasonable inference from Mr.
Collins' last remarks that there is no intention of sitting on
Friday, but we are going to sit tomorrow to finish?

     MR. COLLINS:   Well, I did not say that. What I said was
that I believe the witnesses left, given reasonable length of
examination and cross-examination, should not extend beyond
                                             MR. COLLINS


lunchtime, because effectively we have got Mr. Sewell and Mr.
Lock, and possibly Mr. Taylor who is the witness in connection
with the tickets, and Mr. Waugh, who was in the control box
who is very short.  I think that is all. And Mr. Stewart.
That, I suspect is all.

  I hear mutterings, but I am not going to be diverted by
mutterings.  That as my present intention is will be all, as
far as live witnesses are concerned.  There nay be other
statements that can be put in if people request then to be.

     MR. TOULSON:   Sir, may I raise one very small point.
You have heard evidence from a number of people now about what
was said at that inspection meeting in August, 1986. Mr.
Bownes can remember effectively nothing and Mr. Calvert can
remember a certain amount, and you have heard from Dr.
Eastwood, the report to him.  I rise only because I trust and
take it that nobody will be taking any point against me that
my evidence on that subject has been hearsay. Strange is
around and available.  I am not seeking to prolong the course
of this Inquiry.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   No, before you arrived it was made
clear that the hearsay rule had no application in this
Inquiry.

     MR. TOULSON: Then I an grateful and apologise for
wasting two minutes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.   We will sit then at 10
tomorrow and see where we get to.


         (The Inquiry was adjourned until 10 a.m.
                  the following morning)

            At     about       12.00          we     stopped            at    a    pub       outside             Sheffield              for

            something           to       eat       and       a    drink.           We       stayed          in      t hjp/p^b        for       about           an    hour

            After        about         another            five          minutes          I got           through        the        outer        gates         and

            nearer          to      the      turnstiles.                     Behind        me,       as    more        people           were      being

            allowed           into          the    turnstile                 area,       the       crowd        was     becoming            more         intense.

            By     this       time          the    queue           had       actually             spread        back        as     far     as     t he

            perimeter               gates.

            It     was      really           hot     and       because             the     crowd          was     so    tight           I decided             to    move

            over       to     the      right         hand          side       of     the      queue        where        I     could        see      there          was

            some       space.               I went        across             towards          a    mesh      fence          by     the     embankment               at

gown       in    the       area?        this     seemed               to    be       the    first          time       I had       seen        any

proper          medical          facilities.                     I have          no    idea          what       time       this       was.         It

brother          was       and     we    found          a    phone          to       call    home          and    tell          mum    and     dad

that       we    were       alright.             Eventually?                     we    went          home.

               I think          that        the    disaster          at     Hillsborough              could       have       beers a v o i d e d      if     a

               tunnel        off       or    at    least       have       had     police         officers         or    stewards          directing

      *        people        away       from       the      tunnel.          The    game         could      have       been       delayed       for     a

               few     minutes          which         would        have     calmed         the    crowd      down       outside          who    were

               The     police          reaction          during       the       events       of      the    day    were       really       slow,.

               but     they       d i d n ’t      react       to    it.     The     police           didn't       seem       to    be    getting

           PC 78 BARNSLEY DIVISION



           1' am a Police Constable,     number 78,    of the South Yorkshire Police,

           currently stationed at Penistone Police Station, which is part of

           Barnsley Division.



           At 8.30am on Saturday 15 April      1989,    I paraded for duty at Penistone

           Police Station as part of a serial for duties at the F.A. Semi-Final

           between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool             due to be held at Sheffield

           Wednesday's ground,      Hillsborough.



           Police transport then conveyed myself and others to Wombwell Police

           Station where we later liaised with other B2 officers and boarded a

           Police Transit Van and were then conveyed to Hillsborough Stadium.

           After an in-depth,      initial briefing on the logistics and strategy to

           be implemented on the day,      given by both uniform and CID Senior

           Officers, all      serials then took a small snack type meal          in the North

           Stand, where the previous briefing had been held.
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         R23

At approximately 11.30am after a further briefing by Inspector

I was deployed, together with the rest of my serial, inside the
                                     )
ground, at the Leppings Lane end, behind turnstiles numbered 9 - 16.

The serial Sergeant was PS 1757 Burns.       He informed us that we

should work    in pairs behind the turnstiles with female officers

deployed behind the majority of males,      on searching duties   in

accordance with the Inspector's previous briefing.



From roughly 11.30am until      14.15 or thereabouts,   the passage of

individuals    into the ground was sparce with very few people coming

into the ground.       The ones that did come into the ground between

these times, appeared to be family types       in good jovial mood.



As   I say, there continued to be a steady flow, albeit, sporadic, of
people through the turnstiles      into the Leppings Lane Enclosure.

However, at roughly H.15pm that same date,      there began a profuse

build up of people outside the ground entrances to the Leppings Lane

end.   Through the activated turnstiles,     I could see a large gathering

of people outside the ground who were very tightly packed against

each other.



I as an individual member of my serial,      continued with searching

duties at this time.      Presently, as more and more people filed in

through the busy turnstiles,      I was approached by several Liverpool

supporters who claimed that the situation outside was becoming           rough

and unruly, with people starting to push and shove each other outside,

This situation continued for some minutes, and I remember stating to

a colleague,    that   I knew something was about to happen,   that we would

be having some trouble of same kind.       I could instinctively sense

this feeling,    one of malevolance and awe.

                                                                                             r\CLvj



              At approximately 1430 that same date I saw that several young men had

              started to enter the ground by scaling the outer perimeter wall and

              the roofs of the nearby turnstiles.



              They were repeatedly told by myself and other officers to refrain

              from climbing    in this way.    The Liverpool   supporters declined to take

              heed and regardless of care,      continued to enter the ground in this way.

              It was seen by myself that a vast majority of these persons together

              with others,    that had entered by the more conventional means of the

              turnstile,   were smelling heavily of intoxicants.             I saw several

              attempts by officers to eject or arrest these persons,              result in

              failure,   due to the vast numbers     congregating at the time.         Officers

              were trying to control    the whole situation, which by now was becoming

              chaotic and, as a result,       persons without tickets may have entered

              on to the terracing.



              At approximately 1450 I saw to my left,       in the Leppings Lane

              enclosure,   to the rear of the West Stand and Leppings Lane Terracing,

              a man whom I now know to be                      years,    b

              unemployed of                            Liverpool   14.       He was involved in
~f§OK
              an argument with WPC Pearson about whether or not he had got a ticket

 f a 0 f*     He became agitated and started abusing the WPC and so I intervened.

              As a result of          conduct and his ability to produce a valid

              ticket of any kind,    he was escorted towards the Police           room, with the

              intention of expelling him from the ground.



 A            During this time I was joined by PC 853 Burke who assisted me due to

                                                                           R23

         disposition,    that meaning that he was struggling,



At one stage,           struggled violently and as a result I was thrown to

the floor and           was heard to say "Come on lads,     come on", with the

intention of inciting other Liverpool fans into a fight with myself

and PC Burke.



Eventually,    after getting myself off the floor,            [was placed in the

Police room.     I remember at the time of falling to the ground,          that

I ¥d better get up or else I *d be trampled to death or at best,           badly

kicked.



After lodging            my prisoner,   in the Police detention room,     the

normal    procedure for prisoners was followed, with regards to

documentation and searching.



I then took        to the Police cell bus which was parked outside, and

it was then,    that I realised that some form of disaster had occurred,

due to the vast number of bodies and injured laid outside the Police

room inside the ground.



Myself and PC Burke then tried to locate our S ^ i a l ^ e r g e a n t ^ 7 5 7

Burns.     We were unable to do so, and now in retrospect this was

probably due to the chaos caused inside the ground on the Leppings

Lane end.



After trying to gain access to the pitch/terracing areas via the

Leppings Lane, North West Stand area, PC Burke and myself             returned to

the rear of the West Stand.

                                                                                     R23

               It was here that I was approached by a doctor, who stated he wanted

               to know where all the injured were.      I escorted him to the rear of

               the North Stand outside the gymnasium area, where I then assisted in

               the treatment of casualties.



               At 1610 or thereabouts,     I left   the gymnasium area due to all of the

               casualties having been conveyed to      hospital.



               I then returned to the rear of       the Leppings Lane area and    tried to
G onw f ^
               console members of the public.       At this time, most people     were though
f
               distraught,   nevertheless understanding of the Police situation.
    R??cATf«/f*S Others however,   some smelling of drink, were more abusive,    stating
O*     ftr'CGS# the cause of the disaster to be the Police action,     or in~action as

               the case may have been.



               At roughly 1700 all Police personnel were mustered in the North Stand

               where Serial Sergeants after debriefing could stand their respective

               serials down.



               At 1830 my serial was stood down and I returned to Barnsley.

           I am a Police Constable of the South                          £shi re#Police

           stationed at Penistone Police Station,                      which is part of Barnsley

           Division.

           On Saturday,       9.4.88      (Q90488)     I paraded at Wombwell Police Station as

           part of a serial        bound^fo> public ord er/ footbal1 duty at Hillsborough

           football ground for the 1988 FA Cup Semi-Final                       between Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forest.

        ^/J^fter a briefing in the North Stand inside Hillsborough football

           ground, my serial was deployed outside the turnstiles to the Leppings
                                       '■'v.



           Lane end of the ground, .pn searching duties.

           All     people entering the ground through the Leppings Lane turnstiles

           were searched.         Most people accepted this as the "norm" and were

           happy to oblige.

           After the kick off my serial was further deployed to the rear of the

           standing area behind the Leppings Lane goal,                       to where the Liverpool

           fans were located.

           Individuals,       nominated by the serial sergeant,                 whose     identity I

           cannot recall,        were detailed to stand on the rear step of the

           terracing,     to assist            in any possible evacuation and to keep an

                                                                                  RE3A

overall eye on things     inside the enclosure.

This enclosure,    immediately situated behind the Leppings Lane end

goal, was very full and as a result,          the officers detailed,         had to

stand at the entrance to the enclosure,           with the rest of us, as it

was impossible due to the immense congestion of people within the

enclosure.

I /for my part,   stood at the end of the tunned.which feeds the terrace

from^the rear of the LeppiVigs Lane turnstile anea,              remaininCKhere for

most of the first half of' the game.

It struck me at the time that the design of the security fencing was

inhibiting the movement           of persons within the enclosure.

By this I mean that the           end of the tunnel opens out onto          the

terracing immediately behind the Leppings                Lane goal, and      only a

matter of approximately           six feet is faced with a steel       railing fence,

which transcends the terracing          right to the front wall.          This would

mean that    persons entering onto the Leppings Lane terrace, would have

to turn sharply,   almost immediately,        on their exit from the tunnel

either to the right or to the left.

After a snack meal    in the gymnasium at around the half-time mark,                  I

together with other members of my serial           returned to the Leppings

Lane terracing area.

This time I took up a position at the rear of the Leppings Lane

terracing,   underneath the North Side of the West Stand,              just to the

south of the uncovered standing/quadrangle terracing area.

I again saw that the place was full though a little better than the

area behind the goal.

I can finally state,      that I law nor heard of any problem^ in relation

to either problems with the tunnel,          tu nne l,g a t e s , or; any ott^er part

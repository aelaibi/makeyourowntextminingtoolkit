Dear Mrs Knapman

Judicial Review
South Yorkshire Police Authority - David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray

We act on behalf of Mr David Duckenfield, who is a defendant in a private criminal
prosecution brought by the Hillsborough Family Support Group arising out of the events of
the Hillsborough Stadium disaster in 1989.

As a result of a resolution passed in 1998, the South Yorkshire Police Authority have
provided financial assistance in respect of our legal costs associated with defending the
criminal prosecution until the receipt of submissions late in 1998 by the Hillsborough
Family Support Group. By a letter dated 12 January 1998 the Authority advised that all
further funding was suspended subject to review, and at a meeting on 5 February 1998 the
Authority resolved to discontinue that funding, on the basis of legal advice received, having
heard submissions from the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, the Hillsborough
Family Support Group and solicitors on behalf of the two Defendants.

We are aware that it is the intention of the Chief Constable to make application for leave to
move for judicial review of this decision at the earliest opportunity. If it were not for the
Chief Constable’s decision, clearly this would be a matter that would require our earliest
consideration with a view to taking a similar step. We are therefore pleased to advise the
Court that, being aware of the application, we approve of same, and consent to all necessary
abridgements of time to allow for this matter to be dealt with at the earliest opportunity.

We anticipate that we will be served with papers as “persons interested” and it is our present
intention to take part in the proceedings, file an Affidavit in regard to our client’s interest,
and to attend at any subsequent hearing.

It may assist the Court to know that the committal hearing of the criminal prosecution has
been set down to commence at the Leeds Magistrates Court on 19 April 1999 with a 4 week
estimate. This is subject to the Defendants taking separate proceedings by way of judicial
review, in regard to a decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions, advised on 18
December 1998, not to intervene and discontinue those proceedings. We are presently
preparing the documentation in regard to the judicial review, and hope to lodge that

documentation within the next 2 weeks. The progress of the criminal prosecution will
largely depend upon initially the application for leave to move for judicial review, and any
consequential grant of a stay of proceedings.

We hope the above information assists the Court in dealing with the present matter, and if
we can assist further by providing more information please do not hesitate to contact Simon
Eastwood of our office.

Dear Sirs,

   Re R v. SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY and others ex parte CHIEF CONSTABLE OF
                             SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE .


The above matter has been listed for hearing on 22/03/1999, a time estimate of 3 days having been given.

You should therefore instruct counsel to attend. It is your responsibility to notify the respondent
and all interested parties of this date. A copy of this letter should be served by you upon the
respondent and upon any interested party as soon as possible.

Papers for the Court

You are reminded of the need to comply with the Practice Note issued by the Lord Chief Justice on 21 July
1983 and reported at [1983] 3 All E.R. 33 and the Practice Direction issued by the Lord Chief Justice on 25
October 1994 in relation to the composition and pagination of bundles of documents.

The paginated bundle prepared for the use of the Court must be lodged with the Crown Office at least five
clear working days before the date fixed for hearing.

Advocates are required to lodge skeleton arguments in the Crown Office. Advocates for the applicant must
lodge, and serve, two copies of their skeleton arguments at least five clear working days before the hearing
date. Advocates for the respondent or other party wishing to be heard must lodge, and serve, two copies of
their skeleton arguments at least three clear working days before the hearing date. The skeleton argument
must quote the Crown Office reference number and the hearing date and must contain

     (a)     the time estimate for the complete hearing, including delivery of judgment (whether or not an
              estimate has been given earlier);

     (b)     a list of issues;
     (c)    a list of propositions of law to be advanced (together with the authorities relied upon in support,
            with page references to passages relied upon);

     (d)    a chronology of events (with reference to the paginated bundle prepared for the court);

     (e)    a list of the essential documents for advance reading by the Court, with page references to
            passages relied upon;

     (f)    a list of dramatis personae where the number of people who feature in the documents warrants
            it.

The above time limits must be strictly observed. Failure to do so may result in adjournment and may be
penalised in costs. Advocates may, however, supplement their skeleton arguments up to one working day
before the hearing.

All copy documents in this case will be destroyed (as confidential waste) two working days after the final
decision of the High Court unless a written request for the documents is received by the Crown Office
before the expiry of that period.

Withdrawal or Settlement

Should it be your client's intention not to proceed with this matter, you should obtain the consent of all
parties to the matter being withdrawn. Such consent should indicate the terms of any agreed order that the
parties would wish the Court to make and in any event should deal with the question of costs. The case will
only be taken out of the list when a notice of withdrawal / consent order with a provision for costs signed by
all parties has been received in this office.

If there is a possibility that the case will settle, but no final agreement has been reached, you should apply
by summons, forthwith, to the Master of the Crown Office to have the case stood out into Part C of the
Crown Office List (see the Practice Direction issued by the Lord Chief Justice on 3rd February 1987 and
reported at [1987] 1 W.L.R. 232 and [1987] 1 All E.R. 368).

        Dear Sirs

        R - v - South Yorkshire Police Authority Ex Parte The Chief Constable for South Yorkshire
        Police

        We understand that your client wishes to be heard on the Chief Constable's application for judicial
        review of the Authority's decision of 5 February 1999.

        We would not oppose your client being represented at the substantive hearing which is due to
        commence on 22 March 1999. Indeed, we think it would be sensible and helpful for the former
        officers to be represented since they are directly connected with the decision under challenge. This
        is particularly so as Miss Adlington has disputed Ihe Chief Constable's standing to bring the
        application. We do not think that submission is right

        It is ii\ the public interest that this case is heard and we would not want a technical point on
        standing to prevent the court from considering the substantive issue.

        We understand that the clerk to Counsel for your client was represented at the meeting at court to
        agree a time estimate and fix a date for the substantive hearing. Therefore, we do not think that
        representations by your client should upset the time estimate.


        Yours faithfully

Dear Madam

R - v - The South Yorkshire Police Authority ex parte The Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire Police

We write further to our previous letter of today's date, in which we mentioned that we considered
that the Court might be assisted by submissions on behalf of the Home Office at any substantive
hearing.

We should have brought to your attention that the Home Office, in its letter to us, stated that it did
not wish to be involved in any proceedings.

Yours faithfully
                                                                                                                                                                              (pJUtZ

           Dear Sirs

          R \>South Yorkshire Police A uthority, ex parte Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire Police

           I am a Respondent in this action, pursuant to the Order o f Latham J on Friday 12,h February
           1999. You will know that the application was lodged on behalf o f the Chief Constable on
           1 1 and a letter was sent to you on the same day by the clerk to leading counsel instructed by
           me, Alun Jones QC, indicating our interest,

           I write now on the question o f the length o f the hearing. I regret to say that I think you
           should allow three days. On Monday 15* February, I sent a note o f submissions in relation to
           the grant of leave, drafted by leading counsel. We had seen none of the materials relied on by
           the Applicant until late on Friday afternoon, and even those were incomplete. Counsel’s note
           was written in the light o f those documents and others we received only on the morning of
            15"'. I attach a copy of the note for convenience.

           I now learn from counsel’s chambers that a junior counsel is instructed for the Chief
           Constable, leading and junior counsel for the Police Authority, and leading and junior counsel
           for each of the two defendants, as well as leading and junior counsel for me. There is also
           some suggestion from Garretts, for the Police Authority, that they have suggested that the
           Secretary o f State for the Home Department might be represented. In spite o f this long list, it
           has been suggested by the clerk to counsel for the Applicant that the hearing is to be fixed for
           one day.

           You will see from counsel’s submissions of 15th February that it is our case that the legal issue
           has been severed artificially from its factual base. J have asked the Police Authority to make
           findings on the facts which might easily simplify the issues, or obviate the need for a hearing
           altogether. I have written both before and after the lodging of the papers asking Hammond
           Suddards (for the Applicant) and Garretts (for the Police Authority) to agree to this, but I
           have had no substantial response. 1 do not expect that they will agree.

                                                          -   1

            Only if the Applicant is wrong in his pure point of law will the application take only a day. If
            he succeeds, the question whether relief should in fact be granted, and other considerations
            relevant to the court’s discretion, will entail a hearing o f about three days.

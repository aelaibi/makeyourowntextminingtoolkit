             present radial fence separating Pens 3 and A.

^,3(ii)      For reasons that are net to be found in the files
              these plans were never imp1©mented but a much smaller
              schcmc, resulting in the present layout, completed.
              This involved the moving of turnstiles, 17 and 18
              backwards and into the smaller block known as A - G
              and the building of the lateral wall from the
              turnstiles to the rear or the stand. These alterations)
              did not alter the turnstile capacity or segregate
              supporters effectively.

4.4.       THE SPlON KOP EXTENSION

4.4(1)       In the surater of 1986 the Spion Kop terracing was            1641
              substantially extended backwards and upwards and the
              whole terrace covered. The plans pr-cposed an
              increase of 5,9&i spectators on the Kop from the then
              certificated ceiling of 16,650 to ov«r 2?,000.

4,4(ii)      On 21 Aufcust 1936, the General Purposes .Pawl                1642
             approved a new capacity for the Kop of 21,000 with
             three pxuvidos, one being the provision of extra
             si awarding to the satisfaction of the Police and Fire
             Service for the next two matches.

4.4{>vi)     Tne origi na l Safety C e r t i f i c a t e has never been
              formally amended in terms of the additional crowd
              capacity or need for extra stew-v'ding.

4 .4(iv)     Despite the decision of the General Purposes Panel in
              August 19S6, Sheffield City Council wrote to                577/579
              Sneffisld Wednesday two months later in October 1986,       580.
              to the efrtct that the Licensing Authority for the
              stadium had not received plans of the spinn Kop
              development. It wuc pointed out to the ix>cal
              Authority that plans had been submitted almost ayear
              earlier. On 21 October 1986, copies of the plans            58*/565
              were forwarded by the Local Authority to their cwn          586/587.

    6.   CONCLUSIONS


         6 .1 ,   Since 1979 there nas beer, much discussion end
                  correspondence on the question of the safety of the
                  Hillsborough Sr,fidium. There have been significant
                  alterations to the West Terraco in 1961 (radial fences)
                  and the Spion Kop m 1986 (extensions) but on neither
                  occasion has Schedule 3 of the General Safety
                  Certificate beer, amended in terms of Crowd Capacity or,
                  arguably more Important, Stewarding Levels.

         6.2      Tne present General Safety Certificate is inaccurate In
                  that it dees not relate to the stadium as it is today.
                  The Inaccuracy concerning the Spien Kop was pointed Out       1736/1737
                  to Sheffiftld City Council in a letter from Assistant
                  Chief CoriHlfihle Mr, J. M. JONBS, West. Midlands Police on   1738
                  A May 19^9- The Local Authority replied in letter* on
                  12 May and-15 way# the contents of which are
                  inconclusive.

         6.3      During the examination of Sheffield Wednesday’s General
                  Safety Certificate it has come to notice, albeit
                  unconfirmed by documentation, that it is doubtful if
                  there is a General Safety Certificate in force for
                  Sheffield United Football Club's stadium at Bramall
                  Lane, Sheffield.

        Sir,
        The two copy tapes KWP30/15/17/B and KWP30/15/18/B cover the period between
        1449 and 1609 from South Yorkshire Police Control Room on channcl 15. This
        channcl has been transcribed between 1409 and 1809 but is not yet fully
        typed.

        It is apparent that the first request for ambulanccs by the Ground Control
        was at 1517 hrs. There is some conversation at 1508 where Force Control
        query on the telephone as to whether any ambulances are needed but at that
        stage they are just asked to monitor and standby - no reports of any
        injuries. Conversations relating to the ambulance go on until at least
        1627.
        Could you please advise us in due course as to whether and if copies are
        required for further than that originally requested.

     2.4      Reduction in Inspector Rank
              The reduction in Inspectors was achieved by reducing the number of
              Serials by two, removing the ro]e of Liaison Inspector in each of
              the Serials and additionally reducing the number of Officers in
              many of the Serials.   The most significant reduction in relation
              to the number of Inspectors engaged outside the ground on public
              order duties was a reduction of 7.        This must be taken context in
              that this further reJates to a reduction of 11 Sergeants and 72
              Constables on the same duty from the 1988 deployment.

Specific Policing Deployment
It is necessary to examine the specific policing deployment

in detail:
Sector 1 - Ground
Commanded by Superintendent Greenwood
 This Sector was split into Sector 1A and IB, each under the
 supervision of a Chief Inspector.


 Serials 1 - 1 0 came under Sector 1A
 Serials 1 1 - 2 1 came under Sector ID


 The postings for these Serials are identical to those in 1988
 but with a reduction in man power of 4 Sergeants and 19
 Constables.     This was achieved by the removal of 1 Serial,
 for example, Serial 22 was included in this Sector and posted
 to stand-by duties along with Serials 20 and 21.     Therefore
 in 1989 there was one Serial less on stand-by duties.


 Serials 1 3 - 1 9 inclusive, had duties in relation to the west
 stand and the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

                        prior to the match, but staggered times, all other Serials
                        were to take refreshments during the match in the gymiasium.


            8 .5        Sector 2 Liverpool
                        Commander Superintendent Marshall
                        As in 1988 this Sector was split into two, Sector 2A and
                         Sector 2B, each being commanded by Chief Inspector.


                         Serials 2? - 33 inclusive and 44, 46, 47 and 48 came under 2A,
                         Serials 34 - 51 excluding 44, 46, 47 and 48 came under 2B.


                         Again the postings are identical with 1988 but with a
             8.6
                         reduction in manpower by removing 1 Serial, and reducing
                         Officers on the other four Serials who were posted to

                         Middlewood Road.


                         in 1988    Serials were posted to Mlddlewod Road and in 1989 3.

               3B, each having a Chief Inspector In charge.     Superintendent
               Chapman was the commander for this Sector in 1988.


      8.12     Serials   55 - 56 formed Sector 3A
               Serials 57 - 64 formed Sector 3B
               Postings were as the 1988 order but with a reduction in nanpower
               of 5 Sergeants and 17 Constables.


      8 13     Serials 52 - 56 were posted to coach and bus reception

       9.1      C.I.D. DUTIES

                C.I.D. Duties were altered from the previous year and a
                reduction in manpower made.


                Appendix F on both orders shows the duties of C.I.D. Officers

Mounted Section
Appendix H on both orders shows identical deployment.
6 horses were deployed at the Lepping Lane end of the ground.


Traffic Points
Appendix J on both orders deals with this.             The 1989 order
does not show the nominated Officer or traffic warden for
each point, which was the point in the 1988 order.


Trains
Appendix K on both orders.    The only difference being an
additional special train with a capacity of 550 was expected
in 1989 this meant a total of 3 trains whereas in 1988 there

were 2.


Transit Vans - Liverpool Fans
Appendix N deals with this on both orders.             The only
 difference being that in 1988   a d h e s i v e   stickers were to be
 placed on vehicles that were checked i.e. on the windscreens
 _ this was omitted in the 1989 order.


 Transit Vans - Nottingham Fang
 Appendix N for both orders. Similar to the Liverpool fans
 the adhesive stickers policy was omitted from the 198? order.


 Parking Restrictions
 The 1989 order had two additional locaLions for such parking
 restrictions. Appendix P.


  Route Signing

     18.1    Maps
             Same maps used on both orders.


             General Observations
     19*1
             It is quite apparent that order 1/89 was a redraft of 2/08.
             The same format, wording and postings wore used.


^    19>J?   a    very limited number of additions were made to the order,
             and in the main only concerncd Phase 3 {After the Match)
             these were postings where some Serials were directed to the
             perimeter track to prevent a pitch invasion.


             There were some details omitted from the 1989 order which
      19.3
              were included in the previous year, for example no fixed wing
              aircraft for traffic information and no adhesive stickers for
              mini buses which had been checked by the Police.


              There was a significant cut-back in manpower in the 1989
      19*4
              order which have been dealt with in depth in Paragraph 4-


                 The reduction in Police Personnel did have a direct affect on
      19.5
                 Sector 2 who’s responsibility was the Policing of the

                 Liverpool supporters.


                 This Scctor was reduced by*
                 3 inspectors
                 5 Sergeants
                 58 Constables
      TEL N o .0742720013               17 Jun 89 15:48 No.001




                       -   8   -




The total number of Constables reduced from the 1988 figures is
135, of which 123 would have been operations) on Serials.
Therefore, as Scctor ? (Liverpool Supporters) was reduced by
58 Constables, this relates to 53% of the saving being made
from one Sector.


The match order in relation to duties of Officers outside the
ground at the Lappings Lane end is identical to that of 1980,
including the checking of fans at barriers, prior to the
turnstiles, in order to ensure that they had tickets.




Officers posted to the perimeter track were under specific
instructions to prevent people climbing the fence and
additionally to keeping the gates locked.   The only exception
being for a person requiring medical attention.


The order clearly states "These Gates will only be opened if
 a specific message to evacuate is given on the Public Address

 Systcn".

 It i s quite clear due to the events of Hillsborough on the
 15th April 1989 that fans entering the West stand had not
 been checked at the advanced filter barriers, to ascertain if
 they were in possession of tickets.   This system is referred
 to in both 1988 and 89 orders, the significant difference
 being the reduction in man power in the 1989 order.

      1.        This paper deals with the subject of ticket allocation at the
                semi-finals between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at the
                Hillsborough Stadium in 1988 and 1989, i.e., 1-he distribute
                supporters from each club around the ground. There is a direct
                connection between the events or 1988 and 1989.

      2   .     At both serai-Finals Liverpool were allocated the North a n d W«st
                Stands and the West (Leppings Lane) terrace. Nottingham Forest
                were allocated the South Stand and the Spxon Kop.

                The manner In which the allocations for 1988 and 1989 were decided
      3.
                is described in the written submissions by the following witnesses

                      Graham KELLY                       Football Association
                      Adrian Richard TITCOMBE            Football Association

                                                         South Yorkshire Police.

                The Secretary of Liverpool F.C., Mr. Peter ROBINSON, is ^ k i n g
                a submission through his solicitor and this will no doubt also
                make reference to this subject.

                Mr. KELLY will say that the "the a l l o c a t i o n ^ competing clubs is
       4.
                now dictated by the need for segregation and the capacity or the
                sections of the ground to each club’s supporters ... -.....^ Both
                at Hillsborough and at Villa Park this results in an ^balance of
                about A,000 tickets between the two clubs'*. He later says, On
                matters like this (ticket allocation) the
                 F.A. are really bound to accept the view of the Police .

                 At Hillsborough the allocation resulted in Nottingham Forest
          5.
                 receiving 4,000 more tickets than Liverpool.

                 Prior to the 1988 semi-final Mr. TITCOMBE and Mr. MACKRELL were
          6.
                 present at a meeting at Hillsborough attended by representatives
                 of the two clubs and the Police. There was an application by
                 Liverpool for the allocation of the ends of the        t*>
                 swapped in order to give Liverpool the majority ticket share, The
                 unidentified Police Officer present objected to any change of
                 ticket allocation and none was made.

                 Chief superintendent MOLE refers to the planning of the 1987 and
           7.
                 1988 semi-finals, but does not mention the meeting in
                 referred to above, or identify the Officer whom, it appears,
                 dictated the 1988 ticket allocation on the geographical approach
                 to the ground by the two sets of supporters.

                            that if the Nottingham Forest v Liverpool match was to be Pl&ye<J at
                            Hillsborough, could the ends of the ground be swapped, as he had
                            unsuccessfully requested in 1988.

                9.          The sequence of events following Mr. TOBl" ^ ' a_rcQJ?*8tf.,1Jltlt SDoke
                            generally agreed by the witnesses at paragraph 3. Mr. LLAKK spoke
                            to Mr. MACKREM. who, in torn, discussed the question with Chier
                            Superintendent MOLE. This Officer says he confirmed with
                            Assistant Chief constable Mr. JACKSON that if the fixture was to
                            be held at Hillsborough, the Police would insist on the same
                            allocation as 1988. This decision was relayed back along tne Jine
                            to Mr. ROBINSON.

                10   .      At 11.30 a.m. on ?0 March the Football Association Challenge Cup
                            Committee approved Hillsborough as the venue, a decision^
                            apparently greatly influenced by the outcome of the identical
                            match at the same venue in 1988.

                            The overriding necessity to segregate supporters of the two clubs
                11
                            has resulted in the situation whereby both the Football
                            Association and Sheffield Wednesday F.C. allowed the South
                            Yorkshire Police to effectively dictate allocation of tickets in
                            both 1988 and 1989-

                12      .    In 1988 it is not clear which Police Officer decided the Liverpool       -
                             allocation but in 1989 the previous year's decision was rcafTnned by Chief
                             Superintendent MOLE and Assistant Chief Constable Mr. JACKSON.

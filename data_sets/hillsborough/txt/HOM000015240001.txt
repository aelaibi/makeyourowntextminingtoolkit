HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM : INTERIM ADVICE

1.   At the meeting on 24 April the Home Secretary asked us to
consider issuing some kind of interim guidance to cover the
period until the Taylor Inquiry reports. The attached draft
circular is a first attempt at such guidance. The wide
circulation is the minimum possible.

2.   Ministers are already aware of the difficulties in issuing
any sort of guidance which is liable to trespass into the
territory of the Inquiry and might be seen to prejudge the
Inquiry's findings.  Equally, it might be interpreted by the
press or others as a premature judgement by the Home Office of
what went wrong.

3.   We have not thought it right to suggest restrictions on the
numbers permitted to occupy the football terraces despite
possible higher crowds at end of season crucial games.    Not only
would this prejudge the Inquiry but our published guidance
already quotes such figures; restrictions might be regarded as
•unreasonable' and subjected to legal challenge; and it is the
distribution as well as the number of spectators which is
integral to their safety.

4.   The advice of which local authorities might be reminded is
summarised below:

     a. ingress arrangements (turnsides and contingency
     planning), paragraphs 44 and 46 of the guide;

     b.   unobstructed gangways (paragraph 96) ;

     c.   sub-division of terraces (paragraph 102);

     d.   siting of crush barriers (paragraphs 112 - 114);
     e.   communications (paragraph 194(i)(ii));

     f. stewarding for control and direction (paragraph
     195(a)(c));

     g.   advance planning (paragraph 205)

     h. exit gates or access points in pitch fencing (paragraph
     215) .

5.   In the draft circular we do not evaluate the advice in the
Guide but merely draw attention to these particular passages.
Even then there is a real risk of encroaching into the work of
the Inquiry, especially items (b), (c), and (d) above; these are
square bracketted in the draft circular.

6. Whilst recognising that there might be expectations for some
Government advice, for the reasons in paragraphs 2 and 3 I doubt
if the circular is a sensible proposition even though Sir Peter
Taylor has not dissented. To select any portion of the Guide
devalues the rest of it, and another incident could, of course,
arise from completely different circumstances from those at
Hillsborough.  If the Home Secretary feels that somethitng must
issue then I suggest a short circular reminding the same wide
circulation of the existence of the Guide and advising them to
review the terms and conditions of existing safety certificates.

Dear Sir/Madam


SAFETY OF SPORT GROUNDS ACT 1975 - HILLSBOROUGH
Introduction
1.    The Home Secretary announced in the House of Commons on 17
April that he had set up an Inquiry under Lord Justice Taylor to
look into the tragic events which occurred at Hillsborough on
15th April.


The Incruirv
2.    It is not known at this stage whether it will be possible
for Lord Justice Taylor to produce any report with
recommendations which can be implemented in the short term before
the next football season.   If such a report is produced details
of the recommendations will, of course, be circulated.


Action
3.    Given the wide remit of the Inquiry it would be clearly
wrong to pre-determine its findings (whether or not produced in
the form of interim measures) including any recommendations on
the 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds'.   Even so, local
authorities will probably have already begun reviewing terms and
conditions at designated sports grounds in conjunction with the
police, fire authority and ground operators.


5.    The advice in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds set out
below may therefore be of particular assistance.   The general
advice in the Guide on the importance of the inter-relation of
components (see paragraph 4 of the Guide) should not be
overlooked.

             44. W h e r e admission to a ground or parts of itJs controlled by
             turnstiles, these, by th eir num ber and location, control not only the
           rate of adm ission but, to a large extent, th e dispersal of spectators
           w ith in a ground to their particular sections. Turnstiles should be of
           such n u m b ers as to adm it spectators at a rate w h e re b y no unduly
           large cro w d s are kept w aiting for adm ission and yet at no faster
           rate th a n th e arran g em en ts for distributing spectators w ith in the
           ground permit.

1 1 3 - 1 1 9 b e lo w give recom m endations for the spacing and
strength of crush barriers.

113.    Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along th e full
w id th of a terrace, w ith gaps only at the radial gangways.

1 1 4 . W h e r e barriers are not continuous b e tw e e n radial gangw ays,
th e a lig n m e n t of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a te rra ce
sh ou ld form an angle of less than 6 0 ° to th e barriers. T h e re should
be no m ore th a n 2 consecutive gaps in a n y line of gaps. (See
 Figure 3 overleaf).

         194. A t larger grounds the following a rran g e m en ts are likely to
         be needed:

                 i.     T h ere should be in ter-co m m u n icatio n         b e tw e e n the
                         central control and all turnstiles or banks of turnstiles
                         and all en try and exit gates used by the public.

                 ii.    M e te r in g systems to record all adm issions should be
                        installed at turnstiles and, to en sure th at ground
                        capacities are not exceeded in any section, a rra n g e ­
                        m en ts should be m ade for central control to be
                        inform ed im m ed iately a p red eterm in ed n u m b e r of
                        spectators has been adm itted through each turnstile.

1 9 5 . M a n n in g levels and stew arding req u irem en ts w ill vary
d epending upon th e size and configuration of th e ground, the
n a tu re of th e even t and crowd levels, but th e re are five basic
duties w h ic h stew ards are called upon to carry out. These are:

        a.      controlling or directing m e m b ers of th e public w h o are
                e n te ring or leaving th e ground, to help ac h ieve an even
                flo w of people to the view ing areas and safe dispersal
                of spectators on th e terraces or v iew in g slopes.


       c.      m an n in g entrances, exits and oth er strategic points,
               especially exit doors and gates w h ic h are not
               continuously open w h ilst th e ground is in use;




    W h e r e th e re is a d is o rd e rly e le m e n t a m o n g th e c r o w d in te n t on
    v io le n c e , a d d itio n a l s a fe ty m e a s u re s are n e e d e d to c o n ta in an d

    a n d re m o v e th e o ffe n d e rs and to p re v e n t th e ir re -e n try on
    fu tu r e o ccasions.




 2 0 5 Proper advance planning w ith th e police is essential to
 c o u n ter potential crowd disorder. T h e re m u st be an effective
 liaison b e tw e e n club and police for this purpose to including not
 ju st th e arran g em en ts inside the ground but also th e escort of
 visiting supporters, their likely num bers, th eir separate en try to the
 g ro u n d and their departure at the end of th e m atch. T h ere should
 be debriefing meetings as necessary to evalu a te existing
  a rra n g e m e n ts and provide th e flexibility necessary to deal w ith
 d iffe ren t circumstances.

                 215.   For most m ajor stadia, w h e th e r used for association football
                or oth er sports, th e pitch p erim eter fence w ill be required either to
                prevent access to the pitch as m en tion ed above, or at least to
                discourage attem pts by spectators to e n te r th e playing area. Gates
                or other access points (m in im u m w id th 1.1 m etres) should
                nonetheless be provided for use in an em e rg e n c y and, at those
                grounds w h e re a p erim eter track is used as part of the exit system,
                for th e departure of spectators at th e en d of an event. Provision of
                such gates or access points is particularly im portant to allo w full
                access to th e playing area (or track) w h e r e it is likely to be used as a
                place of safety in an em ergency. Such gates or access points should
                be properly stew arded and clearly marked so th at im m ediate access
                to th e playing area or p erim eter track can be ensured.

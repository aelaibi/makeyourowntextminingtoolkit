 Dear Doctor Popper

 I am writing on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group,
 We are at present compiling a library consisting of transcripts videos
 etc,for families reference in the future.

 It would be very helpful if the collection of photographs plans etc
 could be made available to ue.We would be very grateful and would of
 course incur any costs involved.

Yours, sincerely




P.Hammond.
Secretary

                            C /V " I
           I have been a Liverpool Football supporter for at least 20 years                    I go

           to all the home matches and when I can afford it I go to the away

           matches as well.



           On Saturday 15th A p > » l , 1989 <150489) I left my house a \ a p p r o x i m a t e l y

           9.00am <0900 hrs), I was going to meet a friend called

           at the garage his mother owns in                             next door to the

                                    We left the garage at approximately 11.00 am to 11.

           15 am <1100 to 1115 hrs) and travelled down the M57 onto the M62 and

           then on the M 1 .       We stopped off for about half an hour on the Ml just
                                                                    ^ 3 i o /4           PAGE     2
                                                                                         S 1637

                to get a drink and go to the toilet.



                We arrived in Sheffield at approximately 2.20 pm <1420 hrs) and parked

                at the top of a steep hill at the bottom^tais^a railway bridge.              We

                ther»\both walked towards the ground.        We arrived at the ground at

 5.0'£.,        about 2.35 p>e {1435 hrs) and it was utter chaos then.           There was
 L    L    -
                hundreds of people trying to get into the gates.           I had a 'B * ticket

                and was trying to head for the 'B* gate.         There was such a crush

                because there were that many people that I said to               that I was

                going to try and make     it to the front,    if I do not see you I will see

                you back at the car after the match.         I then left



                I eventually got to the middle gate and pehekole were becoming very

                squashed.      Sttme were becoming distressed.    TheTe were about three

                Police Qf f i ce r s'Ncfln Police horses t^lijpig people to get back but we

                could not, as you could not move due to the amount of pressure that
 U - t_- .
                was on u s .



                One of ttie mounted Police Officers was hitting people with his hands
ID   'S& +4     --------------                    — -------------------------------------
                saying people are getting squashed at the front get back.     Then they

                just started pushing people with the horses.



 M41*A          I managed to get through the turnstile and into the yard,           I gave my

                ticket in as I went through the turnstile.         There were no Police

                  officers oX^ptewards in the yard directing people where to go, so I
                                T O anJin/^L
               N j u s t headed down to the tunnel and onto the terraces. I went straight

                int?o Pen 3, that is the middle pen right behind the goal.           I moved

                over to the right hand side, and moved down to the front where the

                front railings meet the side railings of the pen on my left hand side.

                At the front there is what I can only explain as a large concrete step
                                                                                                        PAGE         3
                                                                                                        S1637

             in between the railings.                    I put my right foot on it and held onto the

             spikes on the fence dividing the two pens.                    The only reason in

             doing this was so that I coubd see the rest of the crowd and could see

             the match.           This being about 2.5 ^ p m (1453 hrs).
                                             ---------------------------         M U L .\^ {£ £ >       n        3


             At this point I thought the pen was full then and that no more                             could

             fit in,      people were being squashed,              some people were being lifted out

             over the front railings and other people were screaming for the gates

             to be opened.             This was about 3.00 pm (1500 hrs).



             Some people were climbing oveV^^the^ side railings and some were being

             helped over the front ra'is^ings.                  I would say it took the Police              10 to
  'Y T
             15 minutes to open the front gate and to start taking people out one

             by one.

             At about 3.0^-pm                (1505 hrs) There was a large surge in the crowd.                    I

             fell from w h ^                I was standing to the floor but my leg was still on

             the r a i U n ^ .         As I hit the floor I felt this terrific pain in my leg

             then my leg went down.

             I was helped up by a man who put his hands                   in the middle of my back

             and another man helped me up.'Nsjv leg went dead and I could not feel

             it.       I somehow managed t o ^ w t           over the top of the railings and threw

             myself onto the pitch just betiTb<)d the goal.                 ^Aa/C5>                          ^

             One of the men who had helped me up shouted over to give him a hand

             getting his young lad out.                    I stood on the advertising boards at the

             side of the fence and leaned over and managed to get the young lad

             out.       I then put him down on the pitch as far as I can remember he was

             fully conscious just very upset.                    I do not know now and I do not think
                                                                             PAGE    4

         I will ever know if his father got out.



         I got down and sat on the pitch behind the goal, when some first

         aiders moved me over to the goal and made me sit leaning against the

         upright goal post.     They then splinted my right leg.   All around there

         I sat up and looked around me and I was sitting on the floor for about

         20 minutes,    I was the only injured person down this end of the pitch,

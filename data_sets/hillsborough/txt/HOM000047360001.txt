        I am trying to trace all the video material obtained by the South Yorkshire Police on the day
of the disaster and I am also anxious to know precisely what material was supplied by the South
Yorkshire Police to Yorkshire Television.

        I have already been provided with two tapes TB1 and TB2 together with a schedule o f the
contents of the tapes, which I understand was provided to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry and the Coroner.
Please confirm that this is correct. TB1 finished at 15.04 and TB2 at 15.34. M r Hicks, who has
provided me with a copy of some of the material said to have been provided by you to Yorkshire
Television, told me that there are tapes which go on till 17.22. I assume that these are those which
were inserted in the monitors in the control room at about 15.34. I would be grateful if you would
send me the original of these tapes (you should retain a copy).

        O n one of the copy tapes that Mr Hicks has provided to me there are views from cameras
other than those at fixed points around the ground, for example there are views into pen 6, scenes in
the mortuary and views from the N orth Stand after the disaster. I believe these were taken b y the
police underwater team. I have seen part of the film taken in the mortuary when I came up to
Sheffield on 24 September.

      Would you also please be kind enough to supply me with correspondence passing between
Yorkshire TV and South Yorkshire Police.

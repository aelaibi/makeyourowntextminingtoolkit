             A p p r o x i m a t e 1y 15.40 hours             on S a t u r d a y     15 April        "1989 ( 150489) , I was

             in the      goa l m o u t h of the L e p p i n g s Lane                 end of H i l l s b o r o u g h w h e n    I saw

             the      body of a young man                 laid face        upwards          on an a d v e r t i s i n g    board.

             Around      the       board were about              6 or 7 football               s u pporters        just about       to

             lift      it.

             I a p p r o a c h e d them and spoke                to them,           I said,      "l's he      injured or       dead'?

             One      of the       supporters         replied,        'He's         dead,    h e ’s been brought            off    dead',,

             I assisted            in removing          the    d e c eased       body to the gym n a s i u m w h i c h was

             being      used a t em po r a r y morgue.

             Once      inside       the g y m n as iu m the         body was          removed        from the a d v e r t i s i n g

             board and            laid on the         floor      of the gym.

             I was ak.sed by a senior                    officer        to remain w ith the                 body.

            At     16.10 hours            on the same          day Dr BULL            of the Royal           Hallamshire

             At    16.13 hours         I s e a r ch ed     the     clothing         of the    d e c eased for any

             I took all         his    property and              placed it into a bag.

              like       to    add          the    following             detailss-

             At    approximately                       15.05       hours       (1505)       on    Staurday                     15th       April      1989

              <150489)             I entered             the       Hillsborough             Stadium               via          the       Leppings         Lane

             entrance              and          made    my    way       onto   the     pitch,            I saw                 that       there      were

             supporters                    and    Police          congregated         behind           the         goal             at    the    Leppings          Lane


             end        of    the          ground.           I ran       straight          to    the     perimeter                       fencing,         I could

             see        two    young             boys    with       their      faces        pressed               up       tight          against         the

             fencing.                  I    pulled       on       the    fencing      directly            in           front             of    the   two    young

             boys,           in a n         attempt          to    relieve       some       of    the         pressure                   but    this      had    no

             effect.               I       climbed       up       the    fencing      and        shouted               for          the       fans   to    turn

             around           and          get    back       but    their       response          was     aggressive,                          shouting         that

             there           were          dead    people          at    their    feet.

                    that       there       were          people          lying       at       their       feet.          I shouted              for       fans       to    try

                    and     make      space.              They          managed          to    move       back      and     a    small          gap       was    formed

                    revive          the    two       casualties                but       was    unsuccessful.

                    The     officer         looked             at       me    and    said       " I t ’ s/lno       good,        they're             dead       we'll

                    have       to     get    them         out."

                    At     this       point       I saw            P C lVt31 J ACKj 8t)N a l o n g                with      three         or     four          fans

                    the     fencing         started                to g i ve,       the        top     half being               pulled           t o w a r d s the

                    A    gap    was       created             in    the       fence and             one     of    the      bodies          was       pa ssed

                    onto       the    pitch          and       then          placed       it    onto        an    advertising                  hoarding.

                    mortuary          had       been          set       up.     One       of    the       offV&ers          was       instructed                to

                    remain          with    the          body.           PC    JACKSON          did       not     assist         in       carrying             this       body

                    across          the    pitch.              I d o n ’t       know          what     he    did        once     he       had       assisted          in

carrying             the       body    from       the    terrace          onto    the        pitch.

I    returned             to    the    Leppings          Lane       end    of    the     ground.              An    ambulance        was

in       the       goal    mouth       and    there          were    fireman          assisting             the     Police.      I

ass isted            3    Police       officers          and    a    couple       of     fans          to   carry     another        dead

body       across          the     pitch      to    the       gyffsnasium.            Once        inside       an    officer     was

instructed                to    remain       with       the    body.           I cannot           describe          this   person         at

all       and       would       not    be    able       to    identify          him.         I    cannot       recall      exactly

where          I    came       into    contact          with    this       body.         The       only       thing    I atri s u r e      is

that       it w a s        at    the       Leppings          Lane    end    of    the        ground.

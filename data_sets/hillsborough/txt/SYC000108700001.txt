                        TWENTY FOURTH D A Y â€™S PROCEEDINGS

                              MONDAY. 7th JANUARY 1991

                   THE CORONER:   Good morning everybody, welcome
      B      back.   I am sorry about the delay but a couple of the
             witnesses, we have checked, they have left but they
             must be held up somewhere so that has caused some
             delay.   We are going to start with Mr. Mark Dawson.

                             MARK DAWSON Called (Sworn)

                                   By THE CORONER

          Q. Good morning,    You are Mark Dawson, is that right? - A.
             Yes.

          Q. Your address, Mr. Dawson? - A.
                                                    Sheffield,

          Q. You are, in fact, a Sheffield Wednesday supporter,
             aren't you? - A. That is right, yes.

          Q. You live at the                   , but I think your job
             is a warehouse and stock controller? - A. That is
             right, yes.

          Q. You went tothis match in    1989, the semi-final, that is
             right, isn't   it? - A. That is right, yes.

          Q. Did you have     tickets? - A. Yes.

          Q. Which end? -     A. I had them for the South Stand, the old
             stand.

          Q. I think you went with a couple of friends and you
             parked in Middlewood Road, or near Middlewood Road
             somewhere? - A. That is right, yes.

          Q- It was about what time when you parked? - A. We parked
             at about 2.30.

          Q. In Middlewood Road did you see fans of Liverpool or
             Nottingham Forest persuasion? - A. Not on Middlewood
             Road, no, when we entered Leppings Lane.

          Q. What did you see there? - A. We walked down Leppings
             Lane and there were a lot of supporters in the road,
             drinking, and a lot of scuffling going on between fans.

          Q. Were they drinking out of cans, bottles, pop, soft
             drinks? - A. Out of cans mainly.




      H
                                          M. DAWSON




    Q. Did you see what sort of cans? - A. Beer cans and
       lager.

    Q. Obviously you can't tell me how many fans you saw
       because you wouldn't have stood and counted, but were
B      there a lot of fans? - A. There were, yes.  I would say
       a couple of thousand.

    Q. Of those total number that  you saw how many would you
       describe as drinking from cans, percentage wise? - A. I
       would say about 20 percent on the road.

    Q. One final question on the cans, did they   generally just
       have one can, or did they have two cans,   or did they
       have four or twelve or how many cans did   they have? -
       A. They had a couple of cans each. They    were carrying
       some.

    Q. On average.  Obviously there will be variance but I am
       trying to get an average.  When you say there was a bit
       of scuffling going on, are   you talking of one
       particular group or was it general?

    Q. Generally on the road, there were lots   ofdifferent
       groups scuffling.

    Q. Were they all Liverpool fans or were there some
       Nottingham supporters there? - A. No, they were all
       Liverpool.

    Q. As far as you can say they were all Liverpool? - A. As
       far as we could tell, yes.

    Q. I think you were approached by one or two people for
       tickets, but that was not a big problem as far as you
       were concerned, would that be about right? - A. There
       were one or two coming up to us as we were walking
       down, asking if we had any tickets.

    Q. Are you a regular supporter, by the way? - A. Yes, of
       Sheffield Wednesday.

    Q. Yes, you do go to football matches? - A. Yes, I go
       every game.

    Q. The numbers who approached you for tickets, was that
       very unusual? - A. Unusual.

    Q. Why did you come down Leppings Lane, as a matter of
       interest? - A. We parked on Meadowhead Road and the two
       people I went with had tickets for the North Stand.

    Q. Were they Liverpool supporter? - A. No, one of them is
       a shareholder at Hillsborough and his son.

                                    M. DAWSON




Their entrance was Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, they got in
through the North Stand at Leppings Lane.

You were going to go round to Penistone Road in due
course presumably? - A. Yes, I presumed like anyother
match day that would be open behind the Stand.

So that is how it happened that you were there? - A.
Yes.

When you approached Leppings Lane turnstile area about
what time would you say you were approaching that area?
- A. It would be about 20-to-3, something like that.

What did you see there? - A. When I got down there,
there were a lot of people at the turnstiles and a lot
on the road trying to get near the turnstiles.  I
walked down to try and get past the South Stand, that
way.

Did you go in through the perimeter gates, the railing
gates? - A. Yes, I went past there.

You got through? - A. I got through them, yes, and    to
the right-hand side.

So you were walking along the roadway with the River
Don on one side? - A. That is right, yes.

Then there is a turnstile area with a little bar at the
side, and you weren't actually trying to get in there?
- A . No, I was trying to get down to the South Stand.

How did you manage to get through the perimeter gates?
There are three sets of perimeter gates - do you know
which ones you went through? - A. I went through the
top side, near the river.

Near the river? - A. Yes.

Was it open or shut? - A. Open.

Did you see any of those gates shut when you went
through? - A. No.

They were all open? - A. Yes.

Did you see any Police horses? - A. Yes, I did.

Where were they? - A. They were this side, the road
side.

Which way on were they to the gates? Were they across
or facing the crowd? - A. They were across.
                                    M. DAWSON




Did you have any problems getting from Leppings Lane
road through the perimeter gates? - A. Oh, yes, I had
to struggle to get through, trying to get past people.

Why was that? - A. Because there were a load of people
there, that was the main thing.

Did you have to push yourself to get through? - A. Yes,
I had to push people to one side.

Were other people doing that as well? - A. Oh yes.

This sounds a slightly critical question of you and I
don't want you to take offence at it, but why did you
decide to push you way through? What was the reason
that you decided to push through and not stand to one
side and wait for the crowds to clear? - A. The main
thing is I tried to get down that side, that is all,
because I did not want to get involved.

So what you are saying is that you weren't actually
aiming for the turnstiles? - A. That is right, yes.

You thought once you were past them ...? - A. Once I
was past them I thought I would be all right.

Did you notice any Officers either on foot or mounted
who appeared to be trying to stop people pushing? - A.
Yes, I did.

What were they doing? - A. They were trying to tell
people to get back and trying to move people back.

How were they doing that? - A. Just by shouting at
people and trying to tell them.

You were able to understand what they were trying to
do? - A. Yes.

The people around you, were they able to respond or
were they in such a crush that they could not have
responded even if they had wished? - A. The people
nearest the turnstiles, I don't think they could have
responded in any way because there were too many people
behind them.

I am trying to find out if the people who you were
close by - could you have responded? - A. No, by the
time I turned round there was no way I could have got
back through those gates.

So at what point did you hear the Officers shouting, or
doing whatever they were doing? Where were you when
you first noticed the Police Officers trying to prevent
                                                                5

A

       the â€¢ â€¢â€¢? - A. I was just through the gates and nearly
       in line with the turnstiles.

    Q. Not on the roadway side? - A. No.

B   Q. Except for the mounted Officers? - A. Yes.

    Q. Are you then telling me that at that point it was too
       late to tell people to stop pushing? - A. Yes.

    Q. It was? - A. It was, yes.

    Q. Did you see Gate C being opened, as a matter of
       interest - the big concertina gate? - A. Yes.

    Q. You saw that? - A. Yes.

    Q. You did not go in that way, did you? - A. No.

    Q. Because it was not of any interest to you? - A. No.

    Q. Can you remember if it was fully opened or not? - A.
       No, it wasn't.  When I saw it, it was only open a bit
       and there were Police Officers inside and outside it.

    Q. That eased the problem, did it? - A. It eased the
       problem at the turnstile.

    Q. At the turnstile? - A. Yes, the people at the
       turnstile.

    Q. Then did you see the gate shut again? - A. Yes, I did.

    Q. What sort of entry did people make through the gate? -
       A. Just walking through steadily.

    Q. Steadily? - A. Yes.




                      /Q. You I think then ....

Q. You I think then carried on and eventually you did
   manage to get into the ground.  I am not sure which
   entrance and it does not really matter? - A. Yes, I
   went in the South Stand.

Q. I think you took your place just after the match had
   kicked off, is that right? - A. Yes, a couple of
   minutes after.

Q. You were in the South Stand.  You have already told
   me that and was it at the Leppings Lane end or the
   Kop end? - A. Leppings Lane end.  The last entrance
   gate on the South that I went through.

Q. The game was definitely in play at that point? - A.
   Y e s , it w a s .

Q. What did you see then? - A. All I saw was that I sat
   down, the game was in play and then I saw fans trying
   to get over the fence and that.

Q. What I am interested in is that when you first sat
   down did you look towards Leppings Lane at all? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. What was happening at Leppings Lane when you first
   glanced over? - A. People in the middle section were
   trying to get over the fence and things like that.

Q. So there were already people trying to get over the
   fence when you first took a peep so to speak? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Were you concerned about it at that point in time? -
   A. Yes, I could tell something was going wrong like.

Q. What was it that gave you that clue? - A. Through
   what I saw outside and like with all the amount of
   people in that middle section.

Q. Are you saying that because you had seen so many
   people outside you thought that something was
   happening on the inside as well? - A. Yes.

Q. In fact, you had thought somebody had been injured
   outside, had you not? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. You also went to the same match in 1988, is that
   right? - A. That is right, yes.

                                                    M. DAWSON


Q. Did you take the same position more or less? - A.
   Yes, I was in that side.

Q. What differences did you notice between 1988 and
   1989? What time did you arrive in 1988 I should have
   asked you? - A. In 1988? About the same time.

Q. Did you notice any differences first of all with
   regard to the policing? - A. Not really, no.

Q. Did you notice any difference with regard to fans in
   any way? - A. Only that I saw a lot more people
   outside who were drinking and things like that.

Q. When, in 1988? - A. No, in 1989.

Q. Can you remember whether the volume of people in 1988
   and 1989 when you were outside was the same or was it
   different? - A. It was different.

Q. In what way? - A. There weren't as many people
   outside the ground at that time.

Q. What I am interested in is that if you have got a lot
   of people there and you say there are more people
   drinking, if the percentage of people who are
   drinking is the same, but you have only got 10 or you
   have got 100, it would look as if there are more
   people drinking because there are more people.   Do
   you understand what I am saying? Have you
   understood? - A. Yes.

Q. What I want to try and find out is whether
   proportionally you thought there were more people
   drinking in 1989 as opposed to 1988? - A. Yes, there
   was.

Q. There was in your opinion? - A. Yes.

Q. Not the total numbers? - A. No.

Q. But the proportion.  One final question, when you
   were pushing your way through to get from Leppings
   Lane to where you were wanting to go, did you
   actually have to do any pushing in the area outside
   the perimeter gates? - A. Not really, not the side I
   went in, not the top side.

Q. It was relatively quiet there? - A. Yes, and it was
   mainly the middle section.
                                                                 8




                                                         M. DAWSON


Q. In that section could you see what was happening or
   not? Not the section you were in but the section to
   your left? - A. Yes, there were like Police on horses
   across the gate trying to get people back on to the
   main road.

                   Cross-Examined bv MR. K I N G ;

Q. Mr. Dawson, I was interested in your observations
   when you got into the ground and you say you saw
   people trying to get over the fence and you were
   concerned.     Did I make a correct note of your
   evidence at that stage when you said, "Because of the
   amount of people in the middle section"? - A. That is
   right, y e s .

Q. What was your impression about that? - A. I looked at
   the Leppings Lane side on where we were and this
   first section did not seem to be that full and I
   thought that people could have got into that side.

Q. So you are looking at the terraces. We know it is
   divided into sections and the sections nearest to you
   seemed to have plenty of room for people? - A. Yes,
   plenty of room for people to stand.

Q.   The middle   section where the    trouble was,            use your
     own words again, how packed would you say? - A.
     Solid.

Q. Such that you were concerned? - A. Yes.

Q. Just an aspect about people drinking outside, you
   very helpfully gave an opinion as to the percentage
   of people who you saw drinking and you put it at 20
   per cent? - A. Of the people outside.

Q.   Yes, which   you think is about right? - A. Yes.

Q.    It follows from that that 80 per cent you      thought
     were not drinking? - A. Yes.

Q. So, in other words, the vast majority of people were
   not drinking? - A. No.

Q. That is correct, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q. As far as the general scuffling goes which you have
   described, clearly you are not talking about fighting
   or rioting or anything like that, are you ? - A.

                                                    M. DAWSON


     There were fans fighting, yes.   We saw some being put
     into the back of a Police van.

Q. By the Police? - A. By the Police, yes.

Q. That is interesting.    You see... - A. As we walked
   down the road.

Q. Which road are you in now? - A. On Leppings Lane, off
   the Middlewood Road.

Q.   I say this because there is a video of Leppings Lane
     which we can all see and so I am interested in your
     observations? - A. We saw Police Officers grab people
     as they were walking down.

Q. How many did you see grabbed? - A. Only a few.

Q. How many roughly? - A. Two or three.

Q. How many people were there? - A. On the road there, a
   couple of hundred people at least just sat about on
   the side of the road.

Q. So the picture you paint is two or three people out
   of the hundred being grabbed by the Police? - A. Yes.

Q.    You yourself, Mr. Dawson, I am sure would have coÂ­
     operated with the Police if you could have done so? -
     A. Yes, that is right.

Q. The position you found yourself in when people said,
   "try and get back" is that you could not get back
   because of the pressure behind you? - A. Yes.

Q. Everybody around you would be in a similar situation,
   were they not? - A. Yes.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL:

Q. You have described that you were aware of Police
   Officers trying to get people to move back at a stage
   I think when you said you were level with the
   turnstiles? - A. Yes, that is right, on the road
   though, on the perimeter road not actually outside
   the turnstile.

Q. Where were the Police Officers who were trying to
   encourage the people to move back? - A. They were
   just round the turnstiles and trying to move people
   back just in front of the gates, the main gates.

Q. The Police Officers just in front of the gates? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You have also said there were mounted Policemen on
   horses trying to move people back? - A. They were on
   the other side of the gates I think trying to get
   across the entrances to stop people getting in.

Q. As you made your way passed that line of Police
   horses you could see what the people on the Police
   horses were trying to do? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q. It was clear to you what they were trying to do? - A.
   Yes, they were leaning over.

Q. Trying to get people to move back? - A. Yes, they
   were leaning over on their horses and trying to move
   them back, yes.

Q. Did you understand what they were trying to do by
   what you could hear or by gesticulations, by what you
   could see or both? - A. Both.

                  Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. Those people, I know you did not yourself because you
   had a different plan, outside the gates were not at
   that point under any pressure so far as you could
   see, is that right? - A. Outside the gates?

Q. Outside the gates where the mounted Police Officers
   were? - A. No.

Q. Where the mounted Officers were shouting and
   gesticulating? - A. No, only the people near the
   turnstiles.

     THE CORONER:   Now I do not know who we have got next.
The next two witnesses have only just arrived and I would
prefer to start with them rather than anybody else because
we might keep them waiting and so I think, ladies and
gentlemen, let us rise for five or six minutes, or ten say,
to give them a chance to get their breath.

                                                      A. M. GRIER


Q. Anyway, you were in Sheffield by 13.30, half past one? -
   A. Yes.

Q. In fact I think you had a puncture? - A. Yes, we had a
   blow out on the motorway.

Q. Was that the reason why you were delayed, in fact? - A.
   Well, that was only about fifteen or twenty minutes.

Q. Having got in at half past one what did you then do,
   briefly? - A. Half past one we walked down to the ground
   and met the other group of lads from the other car we
   travelled down with, because there were two sets .of us in
   cars. We just stood outside the shop on the corner of
   Leppings Lane, just talking and waiting to go in.

Q.    That was you, Stuart and Simon, I think you were with? -
     A. Yes.    I was everyone at that stage.

Q.   There was a whole big crowd of you? - A. Yes.

Q.    At that point it was fairly quiet, I presume,outside
     Leppings Lane, or was it busy? - A. It was getting busy
     but nothing like it was later.     There were people
     milling round but it was not really chocka.

Q.   When    you parked where did you park? -        A. It was just ina
     side street about fifteen minutes' walk.

Q. Did you see Liverpool supporters either walking towards
   the ground or away from the ground, as you were going
   towards it? - A. Walking towards the ground.

Q.    Did you see any or all of them or none drinking alcohol
     out of cans? - A. I saw a few people drinking out of
     cans, yes.

Q.    What percentage would you say you saw out of the crowd?
     Just visualise the crowd the then put a percentage of the
     number of people who you think were drinking out of cans?
     - A. A small percent, 5%/10%.

Q.    That did not seem to you unusual for a football   crowd? -
     A. No, not at all.

Q. Quite acceptable as far as you were concerned? - A. Yes.

Q. I take it that you found their behaviour perfectly
   satisfactory? - A. Yes.

Q. You had no complaints? - A. No.

Q. You then entered the ground through a turnstile? - A.
   Yes.
                                                      A. M. GRIER


Q.   You    went down the tunnel, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.   You entered I think it was pen 3? - A. Yes, the middle
     pen.

Q. At that point, this would be what time, about? - A. We
   probably got in the pen about twenty past two.

Q. Was it turnstile, tunnel, pen in one go or? - A. Yes, it
   was easy to get in.   There was no problem getting in.

Q. So it would be about quarter past when you went through
   the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q.   You    were in the pen about twenty past?    -      A.    Yes.

Q.   Did you know it was divided into pens? - A. Yes, I have
     been there a few times.

Q. So you knew that? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you know how you could move from one pen to another?
   - A. Yes, only from...    Obviously you had to go back
   down the tunnel.   There were usually gates at the top,
   but you had to go out of the tunnel and go round the
   sides to get back.

Q. So you knew that? - A. Yes, I knew that.

Q. Did you know about the gates at the back of the
   railings?- A. Yes.

Q. You knew that was an alternative way? - A. Yes.

Q. Or you could climb over, of course? - A. Yes.

Q. That wasn't the authorised way but one could do it. - A.
   Yes.

Q. I take it you and all your friends you were with at that
   point were happy because you were looking forward to the
   match? - A. Yes.

Q. Who were you with at that particular point in time? - A.
   Simon Hughes and Stuart Thompson.

Q. People were singing and cheering and... - A. It was
   fairly quiet in the terrace at that time.

Q. That was in fact my next question.   At twenty past what
   state was that pen in? - A. It wasn't full.   It was easy
   to move around, easy to pick your spot.   No problem.
                                                A. M. GRIER


Which spot did you pick? - A. I would say about half way
up the terracing.

We will show you a little plan in a few minutes.   Did
you remain at that spot throughout or did you move? - A.
My and Stuart remained at that spot.

Who was the third one? - A. Simon.

Was there a barrier near there? - A. Yes,   there was a
barrier right in front of us.

Tell me what you, Stuart and Simon did.   Just tell me in
your own words. - A. Just singing and me and Stuart were
standing on the bar singing.   Just generally being happy
and singing Liverpool songs.

At about 2.35 or so, you   looked across and you could see
a friend of yours called   Kevin? - A. Yes, Kevin Williams.

Where was he, was he further forward? - A. Yes, he was to
my right, further forward.   About four feet from the
front.

I think you shouted to him? - A. Yes.

At that time everything was still fine? - A. Yes.

I think the team then came out and did a bit of kicking
around? - A. Yes.

What was the position then?   Still perfectly OK? - A.
Yes.   It was filling up, obviously, but there was no
problem still.

Simon I think at one point left you? - A. Yes, he said it
was getting a bit full for him.    He left and went
towards the back of the terracing.

You and Stuart stayed? - A. Yes.

You were quite content? - A. Yes.

Can you remember the team coming out?   Not the kick-off,
prior to kick-off? - A. Yes, I can remember them coming
out about five to three.

At that point were you on top of the barrier? - A. I
wasn't at the time but when the teams came out me and
Stuart got on top of the barriers.

You both of you got up? - A. Yes, both of us.
                                                              15

Q. What was the pen like at that point? - A. It was full.
   It was chocka but I had been there the year before and
   it did not seem any worse than that at     the time.

Q. It did not seem any worse? - A. Than the year before and
   it was full then.

Q. So you would say full but not worryingly full, you were
   not concerned? - A. No, I was not concerned at that time,
   no.

Q. And you and Stuart were still able      to climb up on to the
   barrier at that point? - A. Yes.

Q. I can guess what one does on the barrier, you jump around
   and you wave and you shout.  Do you jump off as well and
   then climb back up or what do you do? - A. No, you fall
   off generally.

Q. Is that in fact what happened? - A. We went on a couple
   of times and we both fell, last time we both fell forward
   into the crowd and landed on the crowd in front.

Q.   This was after the team had come out? - A. Yes.

Q. So you managed to get up twice after the team and then the
   last time both of you fell .... A. Well we got up there
   I think it was twice before the team came out and then
   once when the team came out and that is when we fell
   forward.

Q. That was the time you then fell off? - A. Yes, we fell
   off then.

Q. Having fallen off did you fall upright? - A. Well you
   just fall into the crowd.  You just fall on to the heads
   of the people in front.

Q.   I see. Just describe to me what then happened as far   as
     you were concerned? - A. Well we both fell forward. We
     both landed on our feet, generally got ourselves on our
     feet.  I moved myself back to put my back against the
     barrier so I would not get crushed from behind and
     Stuart came towards me and he went under the barrier and
     I said to him:  "Don't go under the barrier because you
     are going to get crushed against the barrier" and he said:
     "No, I will be all right" and he went under.

Q.   He went under? - A. Yes.

Q.   So he would have been with the barrier towards    his front?
     - A. Yes.

Q. You had the barrier ....     A. Towards my back.

Q. To your back? - A. Yes.

Q. Does that mean at that point you still had freedom of
   movement? - A. It was chocka by then, it was full.

Q. Had you been in any terrace which had been as full as
   that before? - A. At that stage, yes, only at big games.

Q. So it would be fair to say at that point still nothing
   had happened which caused you .... A. I would not think
   anything untoward concerning the year before.

Q. Can you recollect whether the teams were already playing
   at that point or were they still kicking about? - A. No,
   I think they were just kicking about.

Q. And what happened then? - A. Stuart went under the bar.
   I turned and I could see him, he was just behind me and
   he had worked his way back a bit, he was not right
   behind me but he worked his way back.

Q. Dp the terrace? - A. Yes, not far but he looked okay and
   then I carried on to watch the game.

Q. It had started by then? - A. No, the game was just kicking
   off then. The game kicked off and obviously a big roar
   goes up as the game kicks off. With the roar, I just got
   turned round with the crowd and I was facing totally the
   wrong way.  I was actually facing Stuart.  Then I pulled
   myself round and I settled down to watch the match.

Q. So you then turned round and you were watching the match?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Does it mean that you yourself were at that point not too
   uncomfortable? - A. No, I was not bad at the time.  It
   was full, very full.

Q. Could you see Kevin? - A. No, I lost sight of him.

Q. You weren't of course looking? - A. No, the only time I
   could see Kevin was when I was actually standing on the
   bar.

Q . What happened then? Did you see anything that made you ...
    - A. No, I just settled down and tried to settle down and
    watch the game. For a minute or so I thought to myself
    it is full but you are not going to get any better so I
    just convinced myself it was okay and settled down to
    watch the gaqt^ but then it just seemed to get worse. It
    was not one big surge it just seemed to get generally
    worse and worse the crush.
               y :
Q. That is what I am trying to find out. Did you perceive
   - you have already given me the timings and you have been

                                       A.M. GRIER



  very accurate as far as I can tell - was there just a
  general build-up of pressure which got worse and worse
  and worse or was there a surge and then a build-up
  or were there surges.  What was it that you perceived?
  - A. I just perceived one big, gradually built itself
  up.

Q. A gradual build-up, yes.  Did you see Beardsley hit the
   cross bar at all? - A. No, I didn't. Actually I had
   been turned around at that stage as well because the
   only thing I knew about hitting the cross bar was the
   lads in the Stands went up.

Q. I see, you heard a loud roar? - A. Yes, and I was looking
   actually the wrong way.  I was looking the opposite way
   to the pitch at that time.

Q. Was there any movement in the crowd when that happened,
   around where you were? - A. Not where I was, not much.

Q. Did you notice anybody become distressed around you? -
   A. Yes.  I don't know, it was a couple of minutes later
   than that then but there was a young lad about 25/26
   I would say, a tall lad, he fainted not far from me; a
   girl directly behind me started screaming getting a bit
   hysterical, getting a bit claustrophobic and we all put
   our heads forward and she climbed out and the lad he got
   carried out over the barriers. That is the first lad I
   saw go over.

Q. You actually saw him being taken over. Who assisted him
   over, can you remember? - A. Well everyone around him.

Q. And what happened   when he got to the barrier, was he helped
   over or not? - A.    Yes, everyone just pushed him over with
   their hands.   He was riding on people's heads. You get
   them down.   Someone helped him over the barrier.

Q. Did you   see the gate in the pen at all? - A. Yes,   I could
   see the gate.

Q. The one in the front? - A. Yes, I did not notice it until
   later really.

Q. So you don't know what was happening at the gate? - A. No.

Q. Can you tell me -   well we will hear from Simon - but did
   Simon once he had   left you come back to you again or did
   he stay   away? -A. No, he stayed away.

Q. And you   I think eventually left through the tunnel. Is
   that right? - A. No, I got lifted up into the Stands.

Q. Well tell me about that.   Tell me what happened? - A. Well

  there was a gradual crush and no one could move so for a
  minute or so you could not move.  It was like being inside
  concrete, you could not move anywhere, but then people
  started, obviously people were screaming and getting
  distressed so people started to pull them out; people were
  starting to go back up the tunnel; the terraces were
  getting empty all the time which means you have got more
  movement and at that stage people could move and they
  were trying to get out, they were panicking.  That stage
  is probably worse than the crush. Obviously people were
  getting trampled and things like that.  I knew at the time
  if you had gone over, if you fell over in that terrace there
  was no way you were going to get back up.  I worked my way
  down to the gate where I saw the gate open ....

Q. The front gate? - A. Yes.

Q. Yes? - A. When I got down there, which was not far for me
   to go, I got down there, it took me quite a while to get
   down there but there was just like a pile of bodies at
   the gate, a rather large pile of bodies, I would say
   about 10/12 people there.  There was one lad just lying
   on top. He had his Liverpool top on.   It was all ripped
   and his face was very blue, very purple looking, you know
   what I mean. There was people trampling all over the bodies
   so I thought I didn't want to go out that way so I turned
   round and went, tried to make my way back up the terrace.
   Obviously it was mayhem like, it was panic and in the end
   they got me back up into the terrace.  There is a little
   wall where you go into the tunnel, two walls either side
   of the tunnel which help as a stepping stone into the Stands.

Q. I am not criticising you in any way, don't get me wrong
   about it, but what interests me you must have been very
   close to the tunnel from what you say? - A. Yes.

Q. Why did you not go out of the tunnel rather than be pulled
   out? I am just interested to know what it was that made
   you choose that? - A. At the first stage a Policeman said
   to me:  "Go down the tunnel".   Obviously I did not know
   what was going on.  I said:   "No, I am not going down the
   tunnel." He said:   "Why?"  I said:   "If the game does
   kick off you won't let me back in again, I won't get in."

Q. So you were concerned once you had gone out you would not
   be able to get back in? - A. Yes, I would be locked out.

Q. Did you have the impression that other people in the
   terrace where you were had the same sort of concern as
   that? - A. May be, I don't really know.  I could not say.

Q. It is not a fair question actually, I should not have asked.
   Did you see people using, you know the gates at the rear

     of the radial fences, did you see people trying to use
     those to go into the adjoining .... A. No.

Q. They didn't? - A. I didn't see anyone anyway, I can't
   recall.

Q. When you say a Policeman told you to go down the tunnel,
   was that Policeman at the tunnel entrance or was he at
   the gate. Where was that Policeman? - A. He was at the
   top of the tunnel entrance, the top of the terracing, yes.

Q. So it would be fair to say, wouldn't it, that at that
   point you had not realised the severity of the situation?
   - A. No, not at all.

Q. Even though you were right in the middle of it, so to
   speak? - A. No, not at all.

Q. And of course unfortunately you lost your friend Stuart,
   didn't you, and Kevin as well? - A. Yes.

Q. We will show you a plan and I want you to put a cross
   where you were when you were near the barrier which you
   were climbing up.

           MR. BEECHEY:   335 sir.

Q.         THE CORONER: When you took up your position at
     the barrier where you were jumping up and down, put a
     cross? - A. This barrier there to start with.

Q. Before you go, can you see those dotted lines?   Can you
   see them on the plan? - A. Yes.

Q. That is a barrier which broke, I will tell you that. -
   A. Yes.

Q. Did you see that barrier at all as far as you remember?
   - A. Did I see the barrier?

Q. Yes. - A. I probably saw the barrier but I did not see
   it break.

Q. You didn't see it break? - A. No.

Q. Did you hear people behind you - I am not talking about
   the ones in front at the moment - the ones behind you
   in the terrace, what were they doing at the time when
   the game was in play, when the players came out and the
   game was in play until about the point when Beardsley
   hit the crossbar, which I know you didn't see but you
   said you realised because of the shouting - what was
   happening behind you from the people in the terraces? -
   A. At the time when the game kicked off there were just
   people still trying to get in. You could see that, you
   could feel obviously the shoving forward.  That is
   where the crush came from.

Q. Did you hear any shouting or chanting, singing? - A.
   Yes, there were obviously people coming in, trying to
   get in, shouting.

Q. Did you hear any people - you have mentioned the girl
   who was screaming behind you and the lad who lost
   consciousness.  Did you hear any other shouts at all? -
   A. Yes, at the time of the crush there were a lot of
   distressed people screaming and shouting, crying,
   things like that.

Q. Were these people around you or further forward? - A. I
   would say not so many behind me, obviously, but a lot
   in front.

Q. I just want to ask you about your time of arrival.  I
   think on both occasions it was pretty early, wasn't it?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And you gave an estimate of the people who you thought
   were drinking.  Am I right, that also was very early
   on? - A. Yes, that was early on.

Q. So you have no idea of how many people were drinking
   among those who came quite late? - A. After quarter-

                 Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

Q. Where you have put that cross on the diagram, does that
   show the place where you stood up onto the railing? -
   A. Where we fell off, yes.

Q. Did you say that you did that after the teams came out
   onto the field? - A. As they came out onto the field.
   We were singing as they came on the pitch.

Q. Did you climb up onto the railing as they came out? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Did you do that once or more than once? - A. We did it
   a few times before the teams came out, when it was
   empty, when it was fairly empty anyway, but that was
   the last time we did it, as the teams came out.

Q. The   last time was   as the teams came out? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that when you     fell forward onto the crowd in   front?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Onto their heads in front? - A. Yes.

Q. Did that have any effect on the crowd in front of you
   when you did that? - A. Not particularly.  Obviously
   they are breaking your fall but I don't think anybody
   was seriously injured by that, no.

Q. You don't think anybody was seriously injured? - A. No,
   not at all.

Q. How tall are you?     - A. 6.3, 6.3 and a bit.

Q. Do you know what you weigh? - A. 15 stone.

Q. From the point of view of anybody watching from the
   outside, anybody who was not in the pen and looking in,
   when they saw you doing that, is that the normal kind
   of thing that they would expect to see at a football
   match? - A. Well, I would.

Q. You would not? - A. I would.  I have seen that many a
   time. You are not actually diving on the people in
   front of you.  You don't dive on them.  Obviously you
   fall in, and your feet go in first, you don't dive off
   head first. You fall into a space, you are not jumping
   on people's heads.

Q. So from the point of view, for example, of the Police
   trying to police the crowd, that would   be quite a
   normal thing to see? - A. Yes, I would   say yes. Ihave
   seen that many a time.

               Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Q. Mr. Grier, when you did that there was a space for you
   to fall into? - A. The space is made by you going into
   it. Your feet fall into that space.

Q. So people were able to move slightly out of the way   for
   you to fall into that space? - A. Yes.

Q. That was at a time which was just before the kick-off,
   after the teams had come out? - A. Just as they were
   coming out.

Q. Could I ask you about something else? The Coroner
   asked you about the occasion when Peter Beardsley hit
   the crossbar.  You say you didn't see that, you were
   turned round? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you able therefore to see towards the tunnel? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Could you turn round now and look at the plan? - A.
   Yes.

Q. This was therefore, it goes without saying, after the
   kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q. Crowded between you where you were standing and the
   tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. Reasonably well packed in? - A. Yes.

Q. But no more than you would expect or was it worse than
   you would expect? - A. I don't usually get turned round
   at a game.

Q. But you were able to turn yourself back again at that
   time? - A. Yes, at that time.

Q. When you looked backwards towards the tunnel people
   were still coming in? - A. Yes.  I couldn't see them
   coming in. You can't really see them coming in, it is
   just a mass of heads.  You can just feel it, you see,
   you obviously feel people squirming in, things like
   that.

Q. I think the point is this, that there were people
   packed in, as you would expect them to be, between
   yourself and the tunnel, that you could see? - A. Yes.
                                                              23

                                                 A. M. GRIER




Q. But you could feel people coming in all the time on top
   of those people?  I don't mean on top of their heads
   but behind them? - A. Pushing, yes, pushing to squeeze
   themselves in.

Q. Could you see as far back as into the tunnel? - A. No
   way, no. You could probably see the top of the tunnel,
   but obviously no one coming in from the tunnel.

Q. Can you ask this, and you may not be able to judge it,
   but how obvious would it have been for people coming
   down the tunnel that there was very little room for
   them to come in? - A. Very obvious.

Q. It would have been very obvious, you would say?    Thank
   you very much indeed.

                  Cross-Examined by MR KING

Q. Mr. Grier, you have obviously been to many football
   matches? - A. Yes.

Q. You are an experienced person on the terraces.   I
   wonder if you can help, because I think a lot of people
   here may not have your experience, a terrace can
   contain people who are used to being on the terrace
   like yourself, and people for whom it is a new
   experience? - A. Of course, yes.

Q.   I suspect over the years you have got well used to
     being packed on the terrace, would that be fair? - A.
     Yes .

Q. At the time Simon said he wanted to leave because he
   thought it was getting a bit full, could you understand
   what he meant by that for him? - A. Yes, of course.

Q.    What was it like, could you put it in your own words,
     when he said he thought it was getting a bit full? - A.
     What was it like? It was full.

Q.    In terms of the people around you, the space you had,
     could you describe it a bit? - A. Yes, at semi-finals,
     especially the year before, at that stage it was no
     worse than the year before.

Q. I understand that.  I am just trying to get a picture,
   because you are a man of experience, of what is meant
   by full, not so full, not so bad, you see, because what
   is to you something you can put up with might be very
   different for somebody else? - A. Yes, of course.

Q.   When he said he thought it was getting a bit full could
     you tell us how much room there was around you and
                                                              24

     Simon at the time? - A. Not much, not much at all.   I
     would say you would be standing like that.

Q. You would be standing shoulder to shoulder? - A. Yes,
   you would probably have your hands on someone else's
   back, resting.  That is what I do.

Q. So the time when you say it was getting a bit full, in
   your experience, you were shoulder to shoulder? - A.
   Yes.

Q. You had your fists in front of you on the man in front?
   - A. Yes.

Q.    That was something to you which was no worse than usual
     to you? - A. No.   It is generally known that directly
     behind the goal in the terracing is a lot fuller than
     at the sides.

Q. I am   just trying to get the picture for someone who
   does   not go to the terraces, you see, so the picture we
   have   even when Simon left was shoulder to shoulder and
   then   the fists in front? - A. Yes.

Q. Then of course it was after that the team came out? -
   A. Yes.

Q.    You said by then the pen was "choc-a", which is a
     marvellous expression, I know what you mean. It
     obviously had got worse from when Simon had left? - A.
     Yes.

Q. So how was it now, at that stage? - A. It was the same
   but just tighter.  You couldn't move.

Q. But you didn't think there was anything wrong in that?
   - A. No, not for a while, then you realised.

Q. You are someone giving your experiences and we are very
   grateful for it. You are not in charge of looking at
   people and making judgments, that is not your role at
   all, but at that stage, when you thought it was no
   worse than usual, none-the-less you really could not
   move at all? - A. No, not really, not freely.

Q. Then of course it got worse and worse until it was just
   like concrete, you have described it as? - A. Yes.

Q. You are, looking at the plan, somewhere in the middle
   of the terrace.  Before the kick-off were you conscious
   of people ahead of you climbing out of the pen at the
   front? - A. Yes.

Q. Could you see that? - A. Yes.

Q. This was before the kick-off.  What were they doing
   when they had got out? - A. The first lad I saw, they
   were warming up, the teams were out and it was after
   that. The teams were out and they had kicked off and
   that, but one of the lads, one of the first lads out, I
   saw him run over to the keeper, shake him and point at
   the terrace, saying, "There is something going on in
   there", and he just shoved him off the pitch and the
   Police escorted him away.

Q. Was this before the kick-off? - A. No, this was
   actually when the game was going on.

Q. I understand that. You may not have been able to see
   any of this, you see, because you are in the middle but
   did you see anybody, any numbers of people, climbing
   over the front of the fences at the front of the pens,
   the middle pen, over the top onto the perimeter track
   before the kick-off? Did you see that? - A. I saw the
   lad faint, I think that was before the game kicked off.

Q. We have got photographs of what it looked like before
   the kick-off and immediately afterwards so we know what
   was happening but I am interested in what you could see
   in the middle, because you are not necessarily in a
   good position to see the front.   Before kick-off were
   you aware that there was difficulty at the front of the
   terrace? - A. I would   say so at kick-off, but at kick-
   off myself I realised   there was difficulty     for ladswho
   weren't experienced on the terrace.   I realised there
   would be difficulty for people who aren't used to going
   on the terracing, but   I settled down and I     remember
   thinking to myself, "If this is all you've       got you
   might as well put up with it".

Q. What would have been difficult for people who weren't
   experienced on the terraces? - A. Exactly that.

Q. What? - A. The amount it was full, at that time, the
   same as the year before.

Q. I am not trying to be awkward, I am just interested.
   How would that cause difficulty? What would be the
   difficulty they would be in? - A. It would be a bit too
   full, especially for young ladies, women, too full.

Q. On any view what was happening before it became like
   concrete was that more and more people were adding
   themselves to this pen which you described as "choc-a"?
   - A. Yes.

              Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL

Q. I am interested in the number of people there were at
   certain stages.  Simon left you to go somewhere else at
   a time before the teams were announced? - A. I don't
   know about announced but they were not out.

Q. Do you remember the teams being announced that day? -
   A. No, not really.

Q. You told us that you are a very experienced visitor to
   football matches.  Is it right that when teams are
   announced it is the habit for the supporters on the
   terraces to punch the air in response to each member of
   the team they support being called out over the tannoy?
   - A. I would say cheer.

Q. A cheer? - A. A cheer, definitely, yes.

Q. And with a cheer a punch into the air to salute the
   name - have you ever seen that happen? - A. I have seen
   it a few times, yes.  I have seen it but I don't do it
   myself.

Q. That would be entirely normal? - A. Oh, yes.

Q. In your experience? - A. Yes.

Q. For people within the terraces, equally for people
   looking into the terraces? - A. Yes, in the stands.

Q. At this time you don't remember the teams being
   announced, as I understand it? - A. No.

Q. But at about the times the teams would have been
   announced you were in the stage of getting onto and
   jumping off, falling off the barrier? - A. As the teams
   came out?

Q. As the teams come out? - A. I did that for the third
   time.

Q. That was the last time you did it, when the teams came
   out.  How many times had you done it before? - A.
   Twice.

Q. In the preceding few minutes before the teams came
   out? - A. The first time we did it was twenty past
   two when we got in there.  That would be the first
   time we did it then and maybe ten or fifteen minutes
   after that.

Q. And finally when the teams came out on to the
   pitch? - A. Yes.

                   Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. Perhaps I could just ask you one more question about
   that.  You have told us about yourselves climbing on
   to the barrier.  Did other people climb on the
   barrier as well around you or were you the only two,
   you and Stuart who were doing it, in that location? -
   A. No, I think a couple of other lads standing near
   us who were doing it.

Q. Do you remember whether you were the last one to
   climb over the barrier or did anybody follow you? -
   A. I can't really remember.  I don't think so, no.

Q. You were pulled up actually well after the match was
   finished? - A. After the teams were taken off, yes.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Grier, you have got Maxwell as a
middle name, is that right?

     MR. GRIER:    Yes, it is just a coincidence.

Q.      THE CORONER:    Are you related? - A. No.

Q. Of                      r   Liverpool, is that right? -
   A. no.

Q. You came with various people, including Stuart
   Thompson, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Anthony we have just heard, is that right? - A. No,
   he was in a different car.

Q. You met up at the football ground I think that is
   right, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q. You entered the ground, would you agree, at about
   quarter past two? - A. About that time, yes.

Q. Through the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. You met a few of your friends inside but eventually,
   and it did not take long, you got down on to the
   terraces, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Had you been there in 1988? - A. Yes.

Q. So you knew the terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you know about the exits at the back of the
   radial fences? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you know about getting round to the side pens
   around the sides of the ground? - A. Through the
   tunnel again and round the back.

Q. Through the tunnel and around the back of the radial
   fences? - A. Yes.

Q. Of course, that is not where you wanted to be.  You
   wanted to be behind the goal, is that right? - A.
   That is right, yes.

Q. What was your impression of the pen when you got in
   in 1989? When you first got in? - A. No, different
   than a normal match.

Q. Was it crowded at that point or empty? - A. No, there
   was room to move.

Q. Can you sit right forward?    What were you saying? -
   A. There was room to move.

Q. There may have been others but were there the three
   of you, Anthony, you and Stuart? - A. Yes.

Q.   Where did you position yourself? - A. Behind the
     goal.

Q. How far up or down the terrace? - A. About halfway.

Q.    Do you want to just go and mark a plan for us and let
     us get it over and done with? It will be 336? - A. I
     was about the barrier there ( indicating1.

Q. Actually before we get on to the terraces, there is
   one other question I want to ask you; before you
   entered the turnstiles were you searched by any
   Police Officers outside the turnstiles? - A. Just as
   we went into the turnstiles.

Q. Can you remember whether it was just you or all of
   you? - A. All of us.

Q. When you got through did you meet another reception
   committee who searched you again or not? - A. No.

Q. Just one search was enough.  I have not asked you but
   tell me what time you think you got on to the
   terraces? - A. About twenty past, twenty five past.

Q. Initially you stayed with your two friends.  Did you
   see them climb up on to the barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you   climb up as well? - A. No.

Q. Tell me then what happened to the build up of people
   in the terraces as you noticed it. Anthony has told
   us what he felt and I want you to tell me how you
   felt? - A. It gradually built up as the match came
   closer to kick-off.  I would say about twenty to
   three it was getting quite full at that time and I
   had seen Adrian Clarkson at the back of the terraces.

Q. Is that another friend? -A. That is another friend,
   yes.  I moved to the back to talk to him and then I
   went back.  It was getting really full then which is
   when I said to Tony I wasn't going to stay in that
   position and I moved to the back.

Q. I want to make sure I have this right. At about
   twenty to three it was getting full but there was a
   friend you had noticed who induced you to go back? -
   A. Yes.

Q. You were able to get back relatively easily at that
   time? - A. At twenty to three, yes.

Q. You then spoke to him for about how long, would you
   say? - A. Five, maybe a few more minutes.  About
   five.

Q. About five minutes you would think or five seconds? -
   A. Five minutes.
                                         S. M. HUGHES


Then did you come forward again towards Anthony and
Stuart? - A. I came back down to where they were
standing.

You came back down again.  How easy was it to make
that journey? - A. Not much different than when I
went to the back.

Then how long would you say you stayed before you
decided to go back again? - A. I stayed a few more
minutes with them and said I was going to move to the
back with Adrian.

I could not hear you? - A. I said that I stayed a few
more minutes with them and then I said to them that I
would move to the back with Adey.

What made you decide that you wanted to move back at
that point? - A. Because I didn't want to stand down
there where it was too full.

It was too full so far as you were concerned? - A.
Yes.

Are you a regular football goer as well? - A. Yes.

Had you been on a terrace which had been as full as
that before? - A. More than likely, yes.

Were you worried about the conditions at that
point? - A. I wasn't worried, no.

It was just that you felt more comfortable there? -
A. Yes.

Was it right on the back? - A. Right at the back.
There is a little wall by the tunnel and it is about
six feet high.  I got pushed up on to that wall and I
sat on there.

You were on the wall? - A. Yes.

You would have had a good view from there if all had
gone well? - A. Yes.

Can you recollect what, if anything, was happening on
the pitch when you decided to go back and join your
friend the second time? - A. I hadn't been looking at
the pitch.  The only time I had looked at the pitch
was when the teams first came out to warm up.

Q.   It was quite early on? - A. Yes.

Q.   Well before this time? -     A. Yes.

Q.   Did you hear the names announced?   - A. No.

Q.   You did     not hear? - A. No.

Q. Can you remember when people were cheering at all
   when the names were announced?  Is that the normal
   thing? - A. It is the normal thing but I don't
   remember them on that day, no.

Q. You do not remember? - A. No.

Q. If your timings are right this would be about a
   quarter to two, would it not? - A. When I moved back?

Q.   When you went back? - A. For the second   time?

Q. Yes. - A. Maybe a little bit later, yes.

Q. What time would you have put on that? - A. Ten to.

Q. Then describe to me in your words what you saw or
   heard? - A. I got pushed up on to the wall.   Someone
   gave me a lift on to that wall ,at the side of the
   tunnel.

Q. When you say that you got pushed up, you do not mean
   involuntarily.  They actually helped you to get on
   it? - A. They helped me to get on it, yes.

Q. Carry on? - A. Then I stayed on the wall and I was
   talking to Adrian, the lad who was at the back.   The
   teams were ready to kick-off at this time.   It was
   coming up to the kick-off then.  I could see a little
   bit down the tunnel then.  The match had kicked off
   now and I hadn't even seen any of the match.   I
   wasn't looking at the pitch because there were people
   pushing me off the wall I was on. There was a crowd
   there which I fell into and two fellows pushed me up
   into the West Stand then.  I got pushed up into the
   West Stand.

Q. You say you could see a little way into the tunnel? -
   A. Yes.

Q. You were standing... - A. I was sitting on the wall.

Q. Can we put the appropriate picture up and let us make
   sure we have the right one? Perhaps it would be best
   if you actually look at the plan.  Can you see the
   plan up there? - A. Yes.

Q. Show me on the plan where the wall is? - A. It was
   that wall there I indicating\.

Q. That is the little wall that juts out, so to speak,
   from the tunnel, is it not? - A. Yes.

Q.   You    were sitting on top of it, you say?- A. Yes.

Q.   How     far up the tunnel could you see then? - A. About
     ten feet back from where you first go into the
     terraces.

Q. You say by this time the match had kicked off, is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Were you actually looking at the tunnel or were you
   looking at the pitch? - A. I was looking into the
   tunnel.

Q. Why were you doing that? - A. Because I was getting
   pushed off the wall myself.  I was looking below me.
   I was getting forced off the wall I was sitting on.

Q.   But     who was pushing you off? - A. I had my legs
     either side of the wall and the crowd who were
     pushing in through the tunnel were knocking my legs
     and so I was getting pushed along.

Q. They were catching your legs? - A. Yes.

Q. Describe the crowd that you saw coming through the
   tunnel? - A. There was no room to move in the tunnel.
   The tunnel was full. They were pushing in really
   slowly.

Q. Were they actually attempting to get in? - A. Yes.

Q. Could you see from where you were that the pen you
   were in was full? - A. Yes.

Q. You could see that? - A. Yes.

Q. Could the people - and I do not mean the people at
   the back but those at the front - at the front see
   that that was happening as well? - A. Probably not,
   no.
                                                              33




                                                 S. M. HUGHES



    Q. Why was that? - A. Because there were people in front
       of them as well.
B   Q. Did you hear any shouts about pushing at all, either
       "push" or "don't push"? - A. Yes.

    Q. What did you hear? - A. I heard people saying to the
       people in the tunnel "don't be pushing".

    Q. "Don't be pushing"? - A. Yes.

    Q. Could you also hear cheering and chanting? People
       cheering the team? - A. I can't really remember, no.

    Q. You cannot remember? - A. No.

    Q. Did you at any point look forward at the terrace
       itself? - A. Occasionally, yes.

    Q. Did you see what was happening further forward near
       the front? - A. Some of it, yes.
D
    Q. What time was it that you actually saw anything
       significant happening towards the front? - A. Just
       after the kick-off I would say.

    Q. What did you see? - A. I saw a lad in a Liverpool top
       getting passed over everyone's heads and then there
       was a girl as well who got passed over.

    Q. Did passed or towards the perimeter fence, is that
       right? - A. Did I what?

    Q. Where were they being passed to? - A. Getting passed
       down to the front and over the fences.

                                                    S. M. HUGHES


Q. They managed to get over all right? - A. People helped
   them get over.

Q. I think you said you were eventually pulled up into the
   West Stand? - A. That's right.

Q.    Had the match finished by the timethat   had happened? -
     A. I think it had stopped playing.

Q.   I want to try and get this timing a little bit more
     accurate.   When you first went back and met Adrian
     Clarkson, what time are you telling me this was? - A.
     About twenty to.

Q. The reason why I ask you, and as I have explained to
   other witnesses, I am only concerned to try and be
   accurate and get it right.   In your statement you seemed
   to indicate it was a little bit later than that because
   you referred to the teams being out.   Can you remember?
   - A. It might have been a bit later.   I wasn't looking
   at the time.

Q. What I am trying to find out - I am not expecting you to
   stand there with you stopwatch - what I am trying to do
   is to relate when you first went back to what was
   happening on the pitch.   Can you now confirm that the
   players were on the pitch when you first went back to see
   Adrian? - A. They might have just been coming out on to
   the pitch, yes.

Q. Would it then be right that having got there you then reÂ­
   joined Stuart? - A. I re-joined Tony.   I went back
   towards Tony.

Q. Yes, that's right.   Did you in fact then move back to
   your friend just as kick-off occurred, or before, or just
   after? - A. Before the kick-off.

Q. You are sure about that? - A. Yes.

Q. How much before?   Were the players lined up to kick-off
   or were they... - A. No, I think they were still knocking
   the ball around.

Q. We know that Anthony climbed up and down on the barrier
   and he has told us that Stuart did as well.   Did you see
   both of them jump up and down? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you recollect which was the last one to jump up and
   down? - A. No.

Q. You can't? - A. No.

Q. Did you see Stuart fall off the barrier? - A. Yes.
                                                     S. M. HUGHES


Q.    Was that the last visual image you have of him jumping
     off that barrier? - A. No. When I was sitting on the
     wall before the kick-off I could see Tony because he is a
     tall lad, obviously and Stuart was still not far from
     Tony then.    He was, well, say, five people away.

Q.   You saw him after he had come off the barrier? - A. Yes.

Q.    It isn't that once he came off the   barrier you lost sight
     of him? - A. No.

Q. One final question:  when these people were coming
   through the tunnel, was it just a steady push in or was
   there a surge? - A. Just surges every now and then.

Q. So it wasn't completely steady, it was pulsed? - A. Yes.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

Q. You were going to stand behind the goal? - A. Yes.

Q. I think Tony told us that it is generally known that
   behind the goal it is going to be far more crowded than
   it is on the sides of the terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. That is a matter of personal choice as to whether you
   want to stand there and be more crowded or not? - A. Yes.

Q. You told us that you went to speak to your pal, Adey,
   further back? - A. At the back.

Q. Was he already sitting or standing on one of these little
   walls when you went to speak to him for the first time? -
   A. He was standing just to the side of the wall.

Q. When you went to speak to him that first time, was there
   a discussion between the two of you that you might be
   able to get on the wall to get a better view? - A. Yes.

Q. That was one of the reasons you went back? - A. Yes.

Q. If he had not been there and you hadn't have had that
   discussion about getting on to the wall and getting a
   better view, you would have stayed with your other pal? -
   A. That's right.

Q. Because you are not as tall as him? - A. No.

Q. So you were looking for a better view rather than being
   worried too much about it being crowded? - A. Yes.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. Simon, I am not dealing now with your personal choice
   about being on a terrace, which you were asked about.
   People put up with an awful lot of things.    I want you
   to give a factual description, if you will, of what it
   was like on the terrace at various stages.    I am going
   to take you through various stages.    I am not going to
   ask you your opinion about whether you thought it was
   safe or unsafe or you were worried or not, I just want to
   know what it factually was like.    When you saw your
   friend Adrian the first time and you went back to speak
   to him, whenever that was - you originally told us it was
   twenty to three - you said it was getting quite full by
   then.   What does that mean? - A. About three-quarters
   full, I would say.

Q. I want to put it in terms of my being on the terrace.
   What does that mean in terms of the room I have got,
   about people around me? - A. It means you are shoulder to .
   shoulder.

Q. Even at that stage you are shoulder to shoulder? - A.
   More or less.

Q. You as an experienced football fan, you say that is
   getting quite full? - A. Yes.

Q. Fair enough.   You went to Adrian, you spoke to him and
   you came back again.   By that time your words to us were
   that you didn't want to stand down with your friend, that
   is, Tony where he was because by that time, although you
   weren't worried, it was too full? - A. Yes.

Q. Now again, never mind about whether you were worried or
   not, or whether you thought it was safe or not safe, I
   want to know what it was like factually.   Before people
   were shoulder to shoulder - what was it like then where
   Tony was? - A. It was really crowded.    You are shoulder
   to shoulder like that with your arms in front of you on
   to the person in front.

Q.        THE CORONER:   I just couldn't hear that reply. - A.
     You are shoulder to shoulder and you have got your arms
     in front of you on the person in front of you.

Q.        MR. KING:   Such that you couldn't move? - A. Not
     much, no.

Q. We get a lot of descriptions here from people well used
   to being on a football terrace.   It may not mean
   anything to the rest of us. What does not being able to
   move much mean?   How much room in fact do you have in
                                                            37




                                                    S. M. HUGHES


     that situation? - A. You don't have any room at all.
     You have got to push if you want to move.

Q. Then you went back to where Adrian was and you got on
   the... - A. Yes.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL:

Q. I wonder if you would be good enough to turn to a
   photograph in a bundle which I expect to be before you,
   C.269? - A. Yes.

Q. We can see on the right hand of that picture the wall you
   have been talking about? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember where your friend Adey was standing in
   relation to that wall when you first went to speak to
   him? - A. On the left hand side of the wall, just inside
   it.

Q. Just to the left of the wall? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you also see on that photograph the position that you
   were first of all with Stuart and Anthony on the barrier?
   - A. Where the two fellows are standing at that barrier,
   I was just a bit further to the right.

Q.   To the right of the people standing in  the middle of that
     photograph as we look at them? - A. Yes, maybe a little
     bit further back as well.

Q. Before the kick-off you were able to make three journeys
   between that position and the wall we can see in that
   photograph? - A. Yes.

Q. Once to the wall, thete for five minutes, back to the
   barrier, there for a few minutes more and then back to
   the wall? - A. Yes.

Q. I am not going to try and pin you down as to precisely
   when you made these three journeys, but I want to ask you
   just this: at any time were you deterred - prevented -
   from making any of those three journeys by the^flood or
   the pressure of people coming into that terracing? - A.
   You had to push your way forward.

Q.   But you were able to make your way on each   ofthose three
     journeys? - A. Yes.

                     Further bv THE CORONER:

Q. I think what you are saying is that when you went back to
   Adrian, both times, you weren't walking through an open
   space? - A. No.
                                                             38

Q. You had to push your way through? - A. Push my way
   through people.

Q.   However, you were able to do it? - A. Yes.

Q.   A bit ofa struggle I think is how you put it? - A. Yes.

          THE CORONER:   Mr. Russell, did you want to say
     anything because I just followed up on your question?

          MR.   RUSSELL:   Sir, no.

          MR. MANNING:    I had a matter for clarification,
     sir.   You asked the witness whether in fact it might
     have been a little later than 2.40 when he went to the
     back for the first time.

          THE CORONER:     Yes, I did.

          MR. MANNING:    I think the witness said it probably
     was just as the teams were coming out on to the pitch
     that he went to the back to that wall for the first time.

          THE WITNESS:     I am not sure of the time I went to
     the back at all.      It was around that time.

Q.        MR.  MANNING:  It was around that time that you
     would say it was three-quarters full on the terrace? - A.
     The first time I went back, yes.

          MR.   MANNING:   Thank you, because we do know the
     time the   teams cam out which of course is rather later
     than the   2.40.

          THE CORONER:   Yes.     Does Mr. King or anybody else
     have any other questions?

          MR. PAYNE:   Sir, in view of the questions asked by
     Mr. King about the fullness of the terrace, I wonder if
     you thought it would be appropriate to ask Mr. Hughes
     about the other occasions when he had been on a terrace?
     He told you he had been on a terrace as full as that
     before, more than likely, and he wasn't worried.   Now
     what we didn't find out was when those previous occasions
     were and whereabouts.

                      Further by THE CORONER:

Q.     In 1988, when you came to the semi-final, were you in the
     same location? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember what the terrace was like that year? -
   A. It was more or less the same.

Q. It was more or less the same? - A. Yes.

Q. Have you been in other grounds where... - A. Other big
   matches, mostly the big matches where a lot of Liverpool
   supporters travel away to.

Q. Whether it is a good thing or a bad thing we are not
   concerned about.   What I am trying to find out about is
   whether at that time this was not an unusual experience
   for you? - A. Not really, no.

        THE CORONER:   Mr. King?




                MR. KING:   Sir, if I might

                                    - S.M. HUGHES   â€¢ ;;


      MR. KING:  Sir, if I might just intervene. My
questions were directed to the factual state of affairs
and I was stressing that, not opinion evidence sir.

       THE CORONER:   I was not asking.

      MR. KING:  Sir, I know you weren't sir, but my
learned friend was raising to his feet about my asking
questions about fullness, whether it was three-quarters
full, half full.   I was not interested in this witness's
opinion as to ....

      THE CORONER: But Mr. Payne did not ask any questions.
He drew a point to my attention.   I asked questions.
Obviously my questions may not be right but that is a
matter of opinion and you are entitled to say:    "Dr. Popper
you have made a mistake, you should not have asked the
question that way."   I am not going to take offence so
don't worry about that, but what I am saying is he did not
actually ask any questions.   Forgive me, Mr. Payne did
not ask any questions on this.

      MR. KING:  Sir, I know what I am talking about and
I won't take it any further.

       THE CORONER:   Do you wish to follow it up in any
way?

      MR. KING:  Sir, Mr. Manning asked a question about
it being "three-quarters" full and used the word "three-
quarters". My learned friend Mr. Payne when I was on my
feet in the middle of my cross-examination made it
sufficiently loud for me to hear the stressed "three-
quarters" and I really wish to make clear sir that through
this witness what I have been interested in is what it was
factually like because opinions of whether it is full or
not full, safe or unsafe, certainly should not be left to
individual football supporters.

      THE CORONER:    The question of safety may not be a
matter for him.

      MR. KING: Even what is full or not full sir is a
matter of opinion. It is fact we should be dealing with
at this stage sir.

      THE CORONER: Well, Mr. King, if a witness says
it was full or if he says it was very full or it was
uncomfortably full then we would accept it.  If he says
it was empty, only partially full, or not that full, then
we don't.  We either listen to what the witness says with
regard to his perception of fullness or otherwise or we
don't and if we wish to take the view, and this may be a
possibility that it does not make tuppence difference what
                                                                41

any supporter says as to the state of the pens, then by
all means that would be a point of view, but if we don't
then we must listen to the witnesses.  There will no doubt
be others who will say it was unbearably full.

      MR. KING:  Sir, I don't disagree with that at all
sir and if I am not making myself clear it is my fault
sir and it is probably because it is the beginning of the
term and I am not doing as well as perhaps when one gets
into it. My concern was simply to make clear that I was
directing questions to what it was factually like and not
assessments as to whether or not it was over full, too
full or what have you, because at the end of the day that
is for inferences to be drawn from the facts. That is all
I wish to say.

      THE CORONER: That is right, but the inferences
from the facts have got to be based on the perceptions
of the individuals.  Whether his perception is right,
whether it is justified, whether it ought to be as it
was or as it wasn't, those are issues I agree and those he
can't answer, but he can say:  "I was comfortable" or
he was not.

      MR. KING: What I am concerned about is simply we
hear the expression "three-quarters".  I appreciate it
came from the witness sir and I am not blaming the witness,
but three-quarters of what is the big question, because
it is a meaningless concept sir three-quarters.  If you
have a tin of sardines it depends how many sardines you
want to put in the tin before you decide whether it is
full or only three-quarters full sir. That is the only
point I say about stressing ....

      THE CORONER:   I take your point on that, certainly.

      MR. ISAACS:  Sir, may I just say this, perhaps on
behalf of Mr. Payne.  I don't think in any way he was
criticising my learned friend Mr. King and of course it
is important that when a witness who is an experienced
football supporter gives evidence to this jury as to what
he felt it was like, then there should be some evidence
as to how he compares that experience to other experiences
that he has had.  It is only on that basis that the jury
can then assess what is usual or unusual in the context
of the Inquiry they have.

      THE CORONER:  I agree. Was there something else
from behind you at all, Mr. King, because I noticed a
communication.  I don't want it missed.

      MR. KING:  Sir, I was not aware of anything behind
me but I will take some instructions.
                                                             42

      Sir, I think it all stems from my learned friend
Mr. Payne what was misinterpreted as an interruption
which no doubt was helpful, but was misinterpreted
perhaps when I was questioning sir and if it all flows
from that, so be it.

      THE CORONER:   Have we finished with this witness?
(No response)

      Thank you very much indeed and I am sorry about
your journey as well because you had just as bad as your
friends.

      Ladies and gentlemen, we won't start the next
witness, we will have lunch instead.  Shall we start at
2 o'clock.

      Can I just say this please:  I know how difficult
this is for everybody because - when I say "everybody"
I mean particularly the legal advisers - because a lot
hinges or turns on the way the evidence is presented.

      Do please be careful about interruptions.  I mean I
interrupt you as well occasionally and sometimes I have
to because I just have not heard the witness, but it is
important that we minimise any unnecessary stress on each
other because we are all under stress and that is why it
happens, so if we can avoid that we will all be better
off.

         ALBERT RONALD MARSH Called (Sworn)

                   By THE CORONER

Good afternoon. - A. Good Afternoon.

You are Albert Ronald Marsh? - A. Yes.

Is it still
Sheffield? - A. Yes.

You have been a part-time steward at Sheffield
Wednesday, in 1989 it was 16 years, wasn't it, or
thereabouts? - A. Yes.

The last six seasons prior to that you had been what I
think is known as assistant chief steward? - A. Yes.

Your particular responsibility was what bit, Gates B
and C? - A. Yes and the compound.

We call the compound the concourse.  Do you mean the
area between the turnstiles and the back of the stand?
- A. Yes.

That is your patch? - A. Yes.

Can you remember whether in fact you were doing the
same job in 1988? - A. Yes.

I will deal with 1989 first.  It is normal practice
isn't it, fairly early on in the day when it is a semiÂ­
final, to unlock the gates? - A. Yes.

Then you have got various gatemen whose job it is to
actually be on the gates? - A. That is right.

As far as you are concerned they report to you so to
speak? They are responsible to you? - A. Yes.

We have already heard from several of them. Was
Malcolm Bain, Richard Beardsley and your son Ian Marsh,
the gatemen on Gate C? - A. On C gate, yes.

How do you occupy your time? You have got three
gatemen on the gate, I think. What do you yourself
actually do? - A. More or less just check the gates,
chat to the chaps on the gates and make sure that there
are stewards at the bottom of the stairs.

That was my next question.  Apart from the chaps on the
gates where else do you position stewards? - A. On the
bottom of the stairs.
                                                             44

                                                  A. R. MARSH




Q. What is their task as far as you are concerned? - A. On
   the stairs?

Q. On the stairs. - A. Their task is to take the tickets
   off the people who have come through the turnstiles.

Q. Who have come through the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

Q. They are actually checking whether they are entitled to
   go into the seated area, that is right, isn't it? - A.
   Well they are not checking, because they know full well
   the people who are going into the seated area are the
   only ones who have tickets.  No one else has them.  On
   a semi-final ticket they could have been, yes, because
   they do have tickets for the compound.

Q. The people in the compound could either go to the
   terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. Which is standing? - A. Yes.

Q. Or they could go to the seated area? - A. Yes.

Q. How do you distinguish between those who go to the
   seated area from those who go to the terraces? - A. The
   tickets are a different colour.

Q. So you look at the different coloured tickets? - A.
   Yes.

Q. So they are making sure that the people who are going
   upstairs have got the right coloured tickets? - A. Yes.

Q. Apart from that function do they have any
   responsibility or functions in relation to the people
   who are going down onto the terracing? - A. No.

Q.   Did you have any stewards who have any responsibility
     for people going down to the terracing? - A. No.

Q.    Did you yourself have any duties or responsibilities
     with regard to the stewarding of the terraces? - A.
     Never have had.,

Q. You know what the terraces are, the standing bit? - A.
   Yes, we have never done that.

Q. You have never, ever ...? - A. Never ever done that,
   no.

Q. Until about 2.30 what was the situation like in 1989? -
   A. 2.30?

Q. If you like 2 o'clock.  Pick any time you like when you
   noticed a change. - A. The main change that I found was
   that I went up the stairs into the stand itself,
   roughly about half-past-1 time, and it was very
   peculiar because there were very, very few people in
   the stand.  Normally it would have been probably three-
   quarters full and I don't think it was a quarter full.
   I was chatting to one of the stewards and I said to
   him, "I don't like this at all, it seems rather
   peculiar".  Normally, on the last semi-final, this
   would have been three-quarters full, which it wasn't on
   that day, and then I came downstairs, it would probably
   be about 20-past, half-past-2 time, and then I could
   hear quite a few bangings on the C gate and on the A
   gate.

Q. Is the A gate your responsibility? - A. And C - it was
   then - B gate, I am sorry.  B gate and C gate.

Q.   What time was that? - A. That   was about 20-past-2 time.

Q. At that time you could hear people banging on the
   gates? - A. Yes.

Q. Is that usual or unusual? - A. Unusual.

Q. Did it happen in 1988? - A. Not to my knowledge.

Q.    What did you do then? - A. I went down to C gate and
     with the banging being on the gate I asked the gatemen
     not to open the doors at that period, because I
     wondered whether the people was trying to get in
     through the gate, and then I think it was about half-
     past-2 time, that is when we saw the fans coming over
     the top of the turnstiles.

Q. You did not look at your watch, of course? - A. No.

Q. You saw fans coming over the top? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see a Police Officer up at the top as well? -
   A. No.

Q. You just saw the   fans.  Can you remember whether the
   fans were turfed   out or were they allowed through? - A.
   Yes, apparently,   I didn't realise at the time I was
   told afterwards,   but some of the fans ....

Q. Never mind, if you didn't see it. - A. What it was, I
   saw the fans, some had tickets and those with tickets
   apparently was let into the ground, but the fans
   without tickets were ejected.

                                               A. R. MARSH




Q. I see, and you actually saw them being ejected? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Were there Police Officers in the concourse area? - A.
   Yes.

Q. In usual numbers for a semi-final, or more, or less? -
   A. I would think there would be a few more than what
   there would be for a normal match.




                   /Q. For a normal match
                                                            47


                                                      A. R. MARSH


    Q. For a normal match? - A. Yes.

    Q. A normal match you would call a League match, would
       you? - A. Yes.

B   Q. Did you recognise any of those Officers? - A. No.

    Q. You did not? - A. No.

    Q. Did you recognise the man in charge, the Inspector? -
       A. No, I didn't.

    Q. Somebody called Captain Birdseye, does that ring a
       bell? - A. Yes, that is Inspector White.  He was in
       charge of the stand, whether he was in charge of the
       concourse I don't know.

    Q. You do not know that? - A. No, but he was in charge
       of the stands.

    Q. Did you see Gate C opened at all? - A. Yes.

    Q. Tell me how long for? I do not mean for simple
       ejections but when fans came in? - A. Yes.
D
    Q. How many times did you see it opened? - A. Twice.

    Q. Could you describe the first time? - A. The first
       time it was opened I imagine about roughly
       fifty/sixty fans came bursting through the door.

    Q. Tell me how it opened on that occasion? - A. M y own
       opinion w a s ....

    Q. No, what did you see? - A. The fans being ejected.

    Q. You saw a fan being ejected? - A. The door suddenly
       burst open and then these people came in.

    Q. Did you see how it was closed? - A. No.

    Q. You do not know the time when that happened? - A.
       Twenty to three time, somewhere about there.

    Q. How long was it opened for? - A. Oh dear.

    Q. About? - A. A minute to two minutes.

    Q. What happened the second time? - A. The second time I
       heard someone - I assumed it was the Police - say,
       "open the gates" because I had already told the

                                                 A. R. MARSH


   stewards not to open the gates and the word came,
   "open the gates".  The gates were then opened and it
   was just like a flood tide.

Q. When this second time it opened, and you heard the
   instruction, do you remember whether the gate - it
   has two leaves has it not? - A. Yes, it opens like
   that, y e s .

Q. Were both concertina halves opened or not, can you
   remember? - A. The second time?

Q. Yes? - A. Both were open wide.

Q. Both were open wide? - A. Yes.

Q. Do you know about how long it stayed open on that
   occasion? - A. I don't think it was closed again.

Q. You do not remember it closing? - A. No, I don't
   remember it closing.

Q. This second time did a lot of people come through? -
   A. Oh yes.

Q. Did you notice anything about them at all? - A. The
   only thing I did notice was that as the search came
   through they all made towards the tunnel.

Q. Were you yourself knocked over or anything like that?
   - A. Yes, when they came through.

Q. On the second time or the first time? - A. Not the
   first time because I was at the back but on the
   second time I was more or less in line and I got
   knocked down.

Q. You were not particularly hurt or anything like that?
   - A. No, no.

Q. This is the group that came through who went through
   the tunnel, that is right? - A. Yes.

Q. Above the tunnel there is the word "Standing", is
   that right? - A. Yes.

Q. Did any of these people ask you, or did you see them
   ask anybody else for any directions? - A. There was
   no time.  There was no time at all. Apparently in my
   opinion they just saw the gate, the tunnel and the
                                                           49

     pitch, and they made for that.   There was no asking
     questions at all they just went.

Q. They just made straight for it? - A. Yes.

Q.    Of course, there is a big sign over it saying
     "Standing"? - A.  Yes. I don't think they would have
     had time to see that.

Q.    You I think were more concerned about the people
     getting up into the stands infact and you tried to
     sort that side of things out? - A. Yes.

Q.    Had you ever seen that happen before? - A. No.

Q.    At Sheffield Wednesday? - A. No, not in my years
     there.

Q. Are you a football fan yourself as a matter of
   interest? - A. Yes.

Q. Which team do you support? Perhaps we had better not
   ask you if you work for Sheffield Wednesday? - A. No,
   it is the one I work for, or the one that I did work
   for.

Q. Had you ever seen gates open like this in any other
   ground as a matter of interest? - A. No, no. The
   only time I have ever seen the gates open is for
   ejecting someone.

Q. For ejecting somebody but not for anything like this?
   - A. No.

Q. This was unique in your experience? - A. Oh yes.

Q. Did you hear anybody say anything when they came
   through or before they came through? - A. The
   supporters?

Q. Yes? - A. No, not at all.

Q.    Did you hear any employees of the club express
     disapproval of the opening of the gates? - A. No.

Q.   You    did not? - A. No, no.

Q.   The     entrance to the tunnel in1989 and the concourse
     end has got blue gates to it, has it not? - A. Yes.

Q. Those were open or shut? - A. Open.
                                                                50

         Q. Did you notice whether there was any attempt made by
            anybody to block the tunnel off and divert the fans
     B      in 1989? - A. The second time they came through?

         Q. Or at any time that day? - A. No, the second time it
            would have been impossible, absolutely impossible.
            They couldn't have turned.  As the gates opened there
            was a flood tide came in. You couldn't stop them.

         Q. You are saying even if you had tried it would not
            have worked? - A. Oh no.
     C   Q. You did not see anybody actually attempt it? - A. No.

         Q. Did you see anybody try and divert people earlier or
            later for that matter in the tunnel? - A. No, I did
            not.

         Q. Had you ever at any Semi Final at Hillsborough or at
            any other Semi Final seen the tunnel blocked off? -
            A. No, I haven't, personally I haven't.
     D
         Q. What about League matches? - A. No, no.

         Q. What happens when there is a small gate expected?
            How is it controlled? Say it is a League match? - A.
            Yes.

         Q. Is the whole of the terrace used or only part of the
            terrace? - A. In League matches?
     E
         Q. Yes. - A. Before the disaster?

         Q. Yes, before the disaster. - A. Before the disaster
            normally what happened was that the supporters just
            come to the turnstiles and they were directed down
â€¢â€¢          the tunnel into the middle compounds and then when
            they got full the outside compounds were filled up
            then.
     F   Q. Are you then saying that at League matches they used
            to block off the outside? - A. I don't know how I can
            describe this but from the gates with the turnstiles
            there was a wall dividing the concourse with a gate
            in it.  Then at the other end there were railings
            across which the Police manned to stop the supporters
            going round there until they had got the middle and
            then the other concourse.

                                                           A. R. MARSH


    Q. What you   are saying   is that in a League match the
       plan, so   far as you   could see, was to fill the middle
       pens and   then to go   to the outer edges, is that
B      right? -   A. Yes.

    Q. When the middle pens were full in a League match and
       the outer ones were going to be used, who stopped the
       people going down towards the middle? - A. The Police
       because they were monitoring it from their outpost.

    Q. I eun trying to find out, did you ever see the middle
       pens, namely the tunnel, monitored and people
       prevented from going down it during League matches? -
       A. Yes, in that case.

    Q. Describe to me now how that was done?  I want you to
       tell me how it was done? - A. When it was full the
       Police then notified them to use the outer pens.

    Q. How did they do that? Did they close the blue doors?
       - A. I cannot remember the doors being closed, no,
       but it was just by word of mouth.

    Q. By word of mouth you would put Officers there? - A.
       Yes, go that way down.

    Q. Just to be quite sure now that we know what we are
       talking about, have you ever seen that done, the
       Police diverting people at Semi Finals? - A. No, I
       don't think I have.

    Q. Apart from the big sign which says "Standing" over
       the tunnel would I be right in saying that there was
       no sign pointing people towards that gate in the
       wall? - A. No, no.

    Q. There was I think a very small sign, or a relatively
       small sign, on a pillar going round by the South
       Stand? - A. That is right.

    Q.    But that is all the signs there were for standing?   -
         A. Yes.

    Q.   The big main one was over the tunnel? - A. Yes.

    Q.    You   have already    told me you had no responsibilities
         whatever for the terracing? - A. None whatsoever.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. PAYNE:

Q. Mr. Marsh, on this occasion as a steward were you
   wearing anything by which people would have known you
   were a steward? - A. Yes, I was wearing a tabard.

Q. What was that? - A. A tabard, a jacket.     It is an
   orange coloured jacket.

Q. Now dealing with the second occasion when the gates
   were opened, Gate C, at the moment it was opened
   whereabouts were you? - A. At the side.  How can I
   describe it? That was the gate, then there was the
   wall.

Q. I am just trying to track down the diagram of the
   layout of the ground, 274.  In the bundle in front of
   you there you will find C.274 quite near to the front
   of the bundle.  If you look at the left end of the
   ground you can see Gate C? - A. Yes.

Q. Whereabouts were you then when Gate C was opened for
   the second time? There is a projection of this on
   the screen. Would you be able to point to that if
   you went up there? - A. I was there ( indicating).

Q. Just to the right, inside the gate, as you go in? -
   A. Yes, there.

Q. We know that the other gatemen were Richard Beadsley?
   - A. Yes.

Q. We have heard from him. Also Ian Marsh and am I
   right in thinking that the third one was Malcolm
   Bain? - A. Yes.

Q. Were these gatemen also nearby at the time when it
   was opened? - A. They were in the position where I
   was.

Q. Where you were? - A. Yes.

Q. What happened to cause you to be knocked over? - A.
   Because of the flood of supporters coming in. At the
   side of the concertina gate, I wasn't stood at the
   side of the wall but I was stood away from the wall,
   and came through and that is when I was knocked over.

Q. Apart from you wearing the tabard the other gatemen
   we know were also wearing their tabards? - A. Yes,
   everyone was wearing tabards.  There was an occasion
                                                        53




                                                 A. R. MARSH


   afterwards when we were told by the Police to take
   the tabards off.

Q. You were then asked about the entrance to the tunnel
   where all these people went? - A. Yes.

Q. You were reminded that there are two big doors at the
   end of the tunnel by the concourse? - A. Yes.

Q. Which can, in fact, be closed? - A. Yes.

Q. You were asked to consider whether they could have
   been closed? - A. Yes.

Q. And you said it was impossible? - A. Yes.

Q. In your own words, and taking your time, I want you
   to put the Jury in the picture and explain why that
   was? - A. When the gates opened, when there were
   probably an estimated 150, 100/150, supporters just
   making their way towards that tunnel, no one would
   have stopped them.

Q. What? - A. No one would have stopped them.

Q. No one would have stopped them? - A. Not at all, no.

Q. Suppose there had been some Policeman standing across
   the entrance to that tunnel? - A. They may have done
   but they would have had difficulties.

Q. If there had been some stewards standing there across
   the entrance to the tunnel? - A. The same thing
   applies.

Q. They may have been able to? - A. They may have been
   able to but with difficulties.

Q. Why would it be impossible to shut the gates? - A.
   Because it would have meant going inside the tunnel
   because the gates close in towards the tunnel.  It
   would mean going inside the tunnel to get the gates
   opened and in my opinion there would have been no
   chance of getting those gates closed at all.

Q. There has been a noise outside. Why would there have
   been no chance? - A. Because the surge was that quick
   you wouldn't have time to get there.  You have got to
   appreciate that the Police had been searching all the
   supporters as they came through the turnstiles and so
   they were there at the turnstiles.

Q.       THE CORONER:  You did not see any of that, did
     you? - A. Pardon?

Q. You did not see any searches, did you? - A .   I saw
   people being searched, yes.

Q. Outside the turnstiles? - A. At the turnstiles but
   that was prior to it.

Q. Only tell us what you yourself saw or heard and not
   what would normally happen? - A. Yes.

Q.        MR. PAYNE:   What were you trying to explain
     then? Whereabouts were the Police when the people
     came through the gate? - A. They were at the side of
     the turnstiles.

Q. What were you trying to explain about them? What was
   it? - A. They couldn't have possibly got to the
   tunnel in time to divert the fans from the tunnel.
   Once that gate had been opened the search came to an
   end and that was it.




                             /Q.   Now with regard to the.
                                                                   55

    Q.   Now with regard to the police generally, you have
         estimated there were a few more policemen onduty that          at
         a normal league match? - A. Yes.
B   Q.   That was just a matter of impression for you? - A.      Can I
         make comparisons?

    Q. It would be helpful if you would. - A. On Saturday I
       would say there was not quite half of the amount of
       police on duty on Saturday as what there was on the day
       of the semi-final.

    Q.   Do you   mean this last Saturday past? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Was that a normal league match? - A. That was the normal
         match.    Well, it was only Portsmouth who don't bring a
         lot of away supporters with them.

    Q.    Now be careful what you say about Portsmouth! - A. I'm
         sorry about that!      But they don't bring many supporters
         with them.    Consequently, whether the police presence is
         allowed for that, but normal matches, there were quite a
         few more policeman on for the semi-final than what there
         was for a normal match.

    Q. You have been there for many years in this job? - A. Yes.

    Q. So you have been there for a number of big occasions like
       this, other semi-finals? - A. Yes.

    Q. Now from what you saw did it seem to you that the way the
       police were doing their work was in any way different
       from the way they have done it on other semi-finals? - A.
       Not at all, not inside the ground, no.

    Q. In line with what you had seen before was it? - A. No,
       they were doing   the job as they    had  alwaysdone.

              MR. PAYNE:    Thank you.

                       Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

    Q. A piece of information I have been given which may be
       right or may be   wrong, Mr. Marsh. Are theLeppings Lane
       terraces now in   1991 being used    for   people to stand on?-
       A. Not at all.   They are closed.

    Q. In fact on Saturday no-one was going on the terraces? -
       A. No.

    Q. Let me go back to the beginning of your evidence, near
       the beginning.   You have told us very clearly that you
       had no responsibility for the stewarding of the terraces?
       - A. That's right.

                                                   A. R. MARSH


Q. As far as you are aware no club steward had such
   responsibility? - A. That's right.

Q. Did you understand that anybody had responsibility for
   controlling the numbers going on to the terraces?   Did
   anybody have such responsibility? - A. We accepted that
   the police did that.

Q. You would accept, as a steward, that the terraces like
   other parts of the ground, had certain capacities which
   should not be exceeded? - A. Yes.

Q. You would agree that someone had to have responsibility
   for seeing those numbers didn't get exceeded? - A. Yes.

Q. You understood that was the police responsibility as far
   as the terracing at Leppings Lane was concerned? - A.
   Yes.

Q.   Let me deal then with what the police used to do on a
     league game on the filling of pens.   As I understand it
     they had a system for filling certain of the pens on the
     Leppings Lane terraces first? - A. Yes.

Q.   Whichever ones they selected? - A. Yes.

0.   If they did that they had first to close off the pens
     which weren't going to be used before they let anybody
     into the ground? - A. Yes.

Q. That would be the start?   Before you let anybody in you
   close off the pens you want to close off? - A. Yes.

Q. To close a pen off you have in some way to close off the
   means of access to that pen? - A. That's right.

Q. As far as the side pens go it seems from your evidence
   that what they used to do was to put barriers across at
   the side as you came through the turnstile? - A. Only one
   side because there was a wall on the other side.

Q. The wall was one barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. And they put barriers up on the other side? - A. That's
   right.

Q. Then they allowed, in the example you gave of a normal
   league match where they wanted to do this, the middle
   sections to be filled first? - A. Yes.

Q. Who would decide - I don't mean the name, but what sort
   of person, when it was a normal game like this, would
   decide when the middle pens had become full and so they
                                                               57




                                                        A. R. MARSH


     were going to open the other pens?   Who decided? - A.
     The police from their vantage point.

Q. Which vantage point are you talking about?   Inside the
   ground itself, looking on to the pitch? - A. Oh, yes, I
   never went outside the ground.

Q. But the vantage point which the police used to decide
   whether or not the centre pens were full, is that the
   vantage point actually inside the ground looking at the
   pitch? - A. That's right.   It is the one in between the
   South Stand and the West Stand.

Q. I think we all know the one you are referring to.    I
   can't remember the photograph which shows it, just off
   the top of my head, but I don't think there is much
   dispute about it.    In case any member of the jury isn't
   certain...

          THE CORONER:   You know which one it is, don't you?
     It is the police control box he is talking about.

          MR. KING:     It is 272, sir.

         THE CORONER:      I   don't think we need to   look it up.

Q.        MR. KING:   That is actually inside the ground
     overlooking the pitch? - A. Yes.   That's the one.

Q. You yourself didn't man that? - A. That was the police.

Q. That was a police function? - A. Yes.

Q. Hence you relied on the police to be looking and to be
   making whatever decision they thought was necessary as
   into the fullness of the pens? - A. Yes.

Q. When they decided the    centre pens were full,         theyhad to
   take some measures to    stop people going into       the centre
   pens? - A. That's right.

Q. You would agree    with me that the tunnel, if you were
   somebody coming    into the ground through the Leppings Lane
   turnstiles, was    the obvious way of getting on to the
   terraces as far    as you were concerned as a spectator? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Obvious because you could see the pitch, it was the
   obvious way to go? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you ever see police standing as a group across the
   front of the tunnel to divert fans away from it at a time
   when the middle sections were full? - A. I can't
   remember, not there, no.
                                                            58




                                                     A. R. MARSH


Q. You can't remember? - A. No, I can't remember - not being
   across the tunnel, but I can remember police being in
   front of the tunnel diverting the fans into that area
   where the police observe...

0. If we just have a little look at... - A. You see,
   bringing in this business about the doors on the tunnel
   being closed, if we closed those doors on that tunnel,
   then the two middle pens, there is no exit for the
   people.   That is why they were left open.

Q. I understand that.   You would not have it closed for the
   whole of the game because people couldn't get out. We
   understand that.   Look at C.263. - A. Yes.

Q. That shows the entrance to the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Q. You would agree with me that one way of preventing
   anybody going down the tunnel was simply to put a cordon
   of policemen across the front of it? - A. That's right.

Q. That is a way of doing it? - A. Yes.

Q.   You yourself gave evidence to the learned Coroner that in
     your opinion once C Gate was opened there wasno way
     anybody could have organised getting a cordon across the
     tunnel, or closing the gates, or anything like that, once
     Gate C was opened? - A. No.

Q. That was once Gate C was opened? - A. Yes.

Q. You yourself was not responsible for the decision to open
   Gate C? - A. No.

Q. Who did you understand the order had come from? - A. The
   police.

Q. You were given no warning? - A. No.

Q. Of course, whoever was responsible for deciding to open
   Gate C, they would know it was about to be opened because
   they were about to give the order, you understand that? -
   A. Yes.

Q.   You can only tell us your opinion of what was   the
     position once the gate was opened? - A. Yes.

Q. Of course, you can't help us on what might have been if
   steps had been taken to put a cordon in front of the
   tunnel, or something like that, before Gate C was opened?
   - A. No.

Q. You understand what I am saying? - A. Yes.
                                                 A. R. MARSH


We have heard that Gate A was opened.      You know Gate A?
- A . That's right, yes.

And that a cordon of police officers or a serial number
of police officers were sent to divert people entering
Gate A into the compound area you are talking about.   Did
you see that serial of police officers? - A. Will you...

I had better explain what I mean. - A. No way can anyone
get from A Gate into the West Stand.

     MR. KING:      If I have got it wrong, sir, you will
stop me.

     THE CORONER:      I think you have got it wrong,
actually.

     THE WITNESS:      Is   it B Gate?

     THE CORONER:   He had nothing to do with A Gate.           A
Gate is round the corner.   He can't see it.

     THE WITNESS:     You can't get into the West Stand
from A Gate.

     MR. KING:      Sir, have I got it wrong in raising...

     THE CORONER:   I think you have, actually.         I was
just on the point of stopping you.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I am not asking whether I was wrong
in asking this witness - I may be - but,  sir, for my own
benefit am I wrong in remember evidence that a serial of
officers was sent down at a time when Gate A was opened?

     THE CORONER:   You are right in remembering that,
except that the serial may have been requested by
Inspector Bennett rather than from Control.

     MR. KING:      I am really interested in whether...

     THE CORONER:      There were officers sent to A Gate,
you are right.

     MR. KING:      You weren't in a position to see Gate A?
- A. No.

So be it.     The point I really want to establish with you
is this:    as far as you understood it was a police
decision to open Gate C? - A. Yes.

If anybody was going to take steps before Gate C was
opened to   divert people one way or the other, that would
be a police responsibility? - A. Yes.
                                                              60

                  Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Mr. Marsh, you said you didn't hear anyone express
   disapproval of the opening of the gates because this was
   a police decision and you would expect the police to know
   what they were doing, wouldn't you? - A. Yes.

0. You say the police were doing their job in 1989 as they
   usually did, but would you say they don't normally let
   fans in through a large exit gate in very large numbers
   all at once? - A. They don't let them in?   No, the
   police never let them in.   In fact, C Gate, there are no
   supporters come through C Gate.

                      Further by THE CORONER:

Q. Just one thing just to clarify this point.   You have,
   because you were asked and because I didn't stop you,
   explained what your understanding is of the control of
   the terracing? - A. Yes.

Q. Would I be right in thinking that that is your opinion?
   You are not involved with that control yourself? - A. As
   far as the terracing is concerned we have never been
   involved.

Q.   You are   not involved with the terracing either? - A. No.

Q.    All you know is that the police put up the barriers, they
     take them down, they put people to direct to the side? -
     A. If I can enlighten you.    The only duties that the
     stewards perform in the West Stand are B and C Gate;
     C Gate more than B Gate to be opened for the ejection of
     fans and the admittance of police.    Then at the bottom
     of the stairs leading up into the West Stand there are
     six stewards on there and their job is to take tickets.
     Apart from that we have no other duties.

          THE CORONER:    Thank you.

                       DAVID BUTLER Sworn

                         BV THE CORONER:

Q.   You are David Butler. Is that right? - A.   It is sir,   yes.

Q.   Is it P.C. 2806? - A. P.C. 2806, yes sir.

Q.   Were you on duty as part     of Serial 14 on the 15th April 1989
     at the Leppings Lane end of the ground? - A. That is correct
     sir, yes.

Q. Were you inside or outside the turnstile area? - A. I was
   inside the turnstile area.

Q. Had you ever been on duty in that area before? - A. No sir,
   never.

Q. That was your first? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. I think initially things were fairly quiet and in fact you
   were instructed to search people who were coming through,
   the turnstiles? - A. We were sir, yes.

Q. And the fact that they had already been searched outside
   you were told to do it again anyway? - A. We were told to
   duplicate that, certainly.

Q. And presumably you did do that? - A. We did do, yes.

Q. By and large did you in the initial stages manage to search
   most people or were you selective you yourself? - A. Well
   we were selective to start with and then we were instructed
   to search everybody that was coming through.regardless of
   whether they had been searched before or not.   I think in
   the early stages everybody was searched.

Q. Did that totality of searching diminish at some point?
   - A. Yes sir.

Q. I hope you understood what I said? - A. Yes, I know what
   you mean. As it got busier in the later stages the searching
   of everyone obviously became impossible and it became more
   selective.

Q. Tell me when you had to become more selective again, give
   me a time? - A. I should say from 2 o'clock onwards.

Q. It was just getting busier then? - A. That is when it
   started to get busy.

Q. Up to 2 o'clock then. What were the supporters like who
   were coming through? - A. Very good humoured. They were
   presenting themselves to be searched.  It was a very good
   atmosphere.

                                        D. BUTLER



Q. After 2 o'clock was there any change? - A. Yes, from
   2 o'clock onwards when it started to get busier the
   atmosphere changed dramatically.

Q.   What time did you actually notice the atmosphere changing?
     - A. As I say from 2 to 2.15 perhaps.

Q. And in what way did it alter? - A. The people coming
   through were being more aggressive or being aggressive.
   There was an element of drink, people had been drinking.

Q.   How could you tell that because presumably they had   been
     searched, they did not have cans in their hands did   they?
     - A. You could smell it on their breath.

Q. Carry on. Anything else? - A. As I say they were more
   aggressive generally.

Q. That is okay, if there is nothing else nothing else.
   Did most of the people who came through, as far as you
   could tell, come through having presented tickets? - A.
   Most.  It was a ticket only match so most people should
   have had tickets.  However, there were several persons
   that did not have tickets.

Q. How many did you yourself deal with? - A. How many did I
   deal with?

Q. Ticketless ones, how many? - A. About a dozen.

Q. Did you notice any build-up in crowd pressure outside
   the turnstiles? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Could you see that? - A. We could see through the turnÂ­
   stiles that the crowd was building up.

Q. And what happened then? - A. As I say round about 2.15 the
   Officers that were outside the turnstiles were forced to
   come inside.  People were being forced against the turnstiles.
   They were climbing over the actual turnstiles themselves
   and over the top of the turnstile building. When people
   were coming in some were suffering from crushing.  They
   could not get their breath etc. They were frustrated at
   us, I think.  Some were being aggressive towards us as a
   result of that.

Q. When you say "aggressive" what does it mean, what do you
   understand by it, that is what I am trying to find out?
   - A. Well I personally was kicked on the shins by one
   person; pushed; manhandled, that sort of thing.

Q. Okay carry on, sorry, I interrupted you? - A. As I say it
   started to get busy and the pressure of the crowd, the
   concourse itself filled up with people and as time went on
   the gates that we have been referring to, the concertina
   gates were open.
                                                        63

                                       D. BUTLER



Q. How many openings did you yourself see? - A. I saw two.

Q. Which two were they, can you just describe them very
   briefly the first one? - A. The first one I did not see
   the gates actually open but I became aware that they had
   been opened.  I made my way over there.  There were about
   100 people, 150 entered at that point.  I assumed because
   persons had been ejected through these gates ....

Q. But you didn't see it, you never actually saw them opened,
   you merely saw about 100 people? - A. I became aware that
   they had been opened, yes.

Q. And then they were shut again? - A. Then they were closed.

Q. Then the second opening as far as you were concerned? -
   A. The second opening, again I did not see who opened
   them, I did not actually see the opening but I became
   aware that they were open and there was a massive influx
   of people.

Q. Do I deduce from that that you did not hear any orders
   for opening the gates? - A. No sir.

Q. Do I also   deduce correctly that you heard nobody, no
   turnstile    operator, Steward, or anybody else protest
   about the   opening? - A. No sir but at that stage the noise
   level you   have got to appreciate was so great that it was
   difficult   to hear individual voices anyway.

Q. Within the concourse area? - A. Within the concourse
   itself.

Q. Because you had noise from all over the place, didn't
   you? - A. Yes.

Q. You saw the people come in? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Where did they go as far as you can remember? -A.Well
   they just filled the concourse area initially.

Q. And did they go around the side, down the tunnels,
   through the walls, the hole in the wall? - A. They just
   came in   a big crowd.  They just followed the person in
   front.  I am not sure exactly where they went.

Q. You did not know the ground, I think you have already
   told me that? - A. I don't know the ground very well at
   all no.

Q. Had you experience of football crowds before? - A. Oh yes.
   I am stationed at Barnsley so I have worked at Oakwell
   which is a much smaller ground, Second/Third Division.

                                      D. BUTLER



Q. So this was a rather big occasion? - A. I had worked the
   previous year but I had not worked at the Leppings Lane
   turnstiles, I had worked in the North Stand.

Q. What happened then? What further observations did you
   make? - A. Once the gates had been opened a second time
   we had lost control of the situation on the concourse
   really to a degree.  Obviously we could not search anybody.
   The thing I noticed there were Programme Sellers.  There
   was a large group gathering around them and obviously they
   had got large amounts of money, so I thought it best to
   go and stand near them.  The situation was it was like a
   tinder box, it could explode at any time. As I say everyÂ­
   body was very mad, aggressive.  There was a strong smell
   of beer. Men were urinating all over.

Q. In the toilets you mean or outside? - A. No, just against
   the wall.

Q. Did anybody say anything to you about what had happened
   outside.  Can you remember? - A. Oh as fans were coming
   in they were complaining about being crushed outside, yes.

Q. So what you then did was position yourself near these
   Programme Sellers as a protection for them? - A. As a
   protection for the sellers, yes sir.

Q. What happened after that? - A. I think at that point
   obviously they had kicked off and the ringing going through
   the crowd that they had kicked off and I think the main
   intention of everybody was to get in and go and see the
   kick-off. A few minutes after that there was a large
   number of Officers who came from the North Stand end of
   the West Stand, if you know what I mean, and obviously
   something had happened on the pitch, so myself and the
   other Officers in my Serial tagged on. We assumed it had
   been a pitch invasion or something of that order, followed
   them down towards the South Stand and over on to the pitch.

Q. When you got on to the pitch, first moment when you got
   a view, did you see whether there were any players still
   on the pitch? - A. No, the players had left the pitch
   at that time.

Q. Definitely had left by the time you got on? - A. Definitely.

Q. You were not given any instructions, you merely followed ...
   - A. No specific instructions.  I was beckoned by the
   Officers that were already moving and me and the rest of
   the Serial just joined on.

Q. What did you do having got on the- pitch, did you go towards
   the Leppings Lane end or not? - A. Yes, when we got on the
                                                          65

                                       D. BUTLER



  pitch there were several persons, supporters on the pitch.
  Still thinking it had been a pitch invasion I made my way
  over towards them in order to ask them to move back and
  then obviously I could see they were in a distressed state,
  they weren't breathing properly and from what they told me
  I looked over and could see that persons were being crushed
  against the barriers.

Q. When you first got on to the ....   A. Playing area.

Q. I don't mean the playing area, I mean the area enclosed by
   the Stands, were there people already on the playing area,
   supporters? - A. Oh yes.

Q. So your first objective was to aim for those? - A. Yes.

Q. Because you thought it was a pitch invasion and you thought
   you had better get them off? - A. That is right sir, yes.

Q. And it was only when you spoke to them or looked at them
   and you realised that they weren't well, that you realised
   this could be something different? - A. I realised what was
   happening, y e s .

Q. Did you actually enter the pen at all, any pens or not?
   - A. Yes sir, I made my way over to behind the nets, to the
   right of the nets where there is a gate.

Q. That is Pen 4 is it? Do you want to have a look at the
   picture? Put the plan on would you? Sergeant Griffiths,
   can you point to the Police Control Box first of all just
   so that we know where it is about.  That is I think where
   you entered, isn't it? - A. That is the point where I entered
   sir, yes.

Q. And you then made your way on to the playing area, right?
   - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Then you went towards one of the central pens. Is that right?
   - A. Initially I went towards the centre of the pitch because
   that is where the people were.

Q. And then? - A. And then I moved back towards the nets to the
   right-hand one.

Q. That is Pen 4? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. I think you then assisted with getting various people out.
   Is that right? - A. That is right sir, yes.

Q. Because by then you had realised that this was a terrible ...
   - A. What was happening, yes.

   remove bodies.

Q. Officer, I think during the course of your duties as a
   whole, you have told us how you were kicked and
   manhandled and pushed? - A. Yes.

Q. I don't want you to go into details that might be
   distressing.  Later on did you have contact with
   supporters as well, during the rescue operation? - A.
   Yes, sir, I did.

Q. Did you find them reasonable and co-operative or not? -
   A. I would say it was half and half.  The people who
   had probably experienced the crushing were obviously
   co-operative, but I think there was still a large
   element that didn't realise what was happening, and
   they were still continuing to be abusive to us
   throughout the rescue operation.

Q. Is it your experience that to combat large crowds, or
   to deal with large crowds of people, that you need to
   have them co-operative? - A. Yes, sir.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Q. Just one point, Police Constable Butler.  You say you
   were given no specific instructions once things became
   difficult.  Do I understand the position to be that you
   had no personal radio? - A. That is correct, sir, I
   didn't have any personal radio myself.

Q. So you could not tell what was going on through
   anything that was being said over the airwaves, you had
   to be given some instruction by somebody? - A. That is
   right, sir. We had a Sergeant in charge of the serial
   who was the only one with a   radio,and any instructions
   for the Police would come via him.

Q. At the time when Gate C was   opened for the second time
   and people came in, just so   we get the right impression
   of what was happening, people were still coming in
   through the turnstiles? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   So, you and your colleagues were still required in your
     original capacity? - A. That is right, sir, yes.

Q. At that time the concourse outside Gate C and behind
   the turnstiles was very crowded? - A. Very crowded,
   yes.

Q.    Is it right that so far as you could see all the Police
     Officers in that area were being fully used in their
     duties as originally designated? - A. We were all very
     busy, yes, sir.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q. Were you aware that Gate C the second time stayed open
   for quite a few minutes? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. How long did it seem to you, the second time? - A. I
   thought it remained open but I can't say for definite.

Q. We know that it was at least about five minutes.
   During that period people were continually coming
   through the open Gate C, weren't they? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And we are talking probably of a good few thousand
     people, aren't we? - A. Yes, at least that.

Q. This was very close to kick-off, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. So they were making their way to get into the ground to
   see the match? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. If anybody had asked you, "Please, Officer, how do I
   get onto the terraces?", would you have been able to
   answer that question? - A. I would have directed them
   to any of the entrances.

Q. Which entrances did you know about? - A. The tunnel at
   the centre.

Q.   Yes. - A. The entrance at the left.

Q.   Yes. - A. And the walkway up onto the top.

Q.   I am sorry, which is the walkway onto the top? - A. I
     believe there is a gangway which leads onto the
     terracing above.

Q. I am a bit puzzled ....

          THE CORONER:   I think he means the stairs up to
     the stand.

Q.        MR. KING:   Imagine the stick is a spectator
     coming through the turnstiles at A-G, and I have a
     terrace ticket so I am standing to watch the game,
     which did you understand were the means of getting onto
     the terraces to actually stand, not sit, and watch the
     game? - A. Just to stand?

Q. Yes. - A. Through the tunnel or the entrance to the
   left.

Q. To the left - through that little entrance there - that
   little gateway in the wall, is that what you are
   referring to? - A. I believe so, yes.

                                                             D. BUTLER




            Q. Where did you get that information from, that that was
               the way onto the terraces to stand? - A. Just by my own
               observations.

        H   Q. On the day or from what someone had told you? - A.   I
        "      believe it was my observations on the day.

            Q. What were your observations on the day which enabled
               you to know that if you went through the gate in the
               wall to the left that you would get onto the standing
                terraces? - A. Just by looking at the entrances.

            Q. Yes, but I am sorry Officer, all that shows is a
               gateway, an open gateway, into another part of the
               concourse, doesn't it? How does that help you know
                that that is a way onto the standing terraces?   If we
               could borrow the stick again, that gateway leads, if we
               could go with the stick through the gateway, into the
               other concourse, doesn't it? How would one know that
                that led to a standing part of the terraces?   - A. I
               just assumed it did.

            Q. You just assumed it did? - A. I just assumed it did,
               yes.

            Q. Did you know any other way onto the terrace? You have
               given us two ways. - A. Just by looking at that model,
               sir, I am afraid I can't recall.

            Q. I don't want you to use the model so much as your own
               memory.  From your memory and recollection the only way
               you know was to the left and down the tunnel? - A. That
               is right, sir.

            Q. You obviously did not know that there was a way round
               to the right? You obviously didn't know that?   I am
               not criticising you, you just didn't know? - A. I am
               sorry, sir, but I have had a look at the model and
               using my memory, I can remember there were two ways in.
               I can't remember whether it was left or right.  I am
               confused now, but it could have been I meant towards
               the ....

            Q. I am not trying to trap you at all, I am trying to know
               what you understood because you are an Officer, you had
               an opportunity to be there quite a long time while you
               were on duty, and it is helpful evidence.

            Q. During the five minutes or so when Gate C was opened
               for a long time - you thought it was opened
               continuously - all these people came in. You are not
               suggesting, are you, that each and everyone of those
               few thousand people were aggressive, are you? - A. Not
               each and everyone, no, but there was an element, yes.

                                               D. BUTLER




An element.  There is a video which everybody has seen
and no doubt we may see again and we will be able to
look at it, so we can look out for that which you are
talking about, or that five minutes.  What is it we
should be looking out for when we view the video again,
if we do, of that five minute period? What is the
conduct of the people we are going to look for which
you say is aggressive during that five minute? - A.
Pointing, shoving, shouting.  Obviously you won't be
able to hear the shouting.

No.  Pointing at what or at whom? - A. Police Officers
mainly.

When pointing, what were they saying to the Officers,
if anything? - A. Do something.

Do something about what? - A. About the crushing
outside.

So their aggression, if that is aggression, was as a
result of apparently the crushing outside? - A. I would
assume so, yes.

What else should we be looking for apart from the
pointing? You say shoving, pushing did you say? - A.
Pushing and shoving Officers, yes.

Officers or people, or other fans? - A. I can only
speak from my own experience.  I was certainly pushed
and I saw other Officers get pushed.

Let's deal with you.   You were pushed? - A. Yes.

How many times were you pushed? - A. Several times.

Are we talking about 100 times, six times? - A. Two
dozen times, somewhere in between that.

Over a five minute period? - A. No, over a longer
period than that.

Over a longer period than that, I beg your pardon. - A.
Are you talking about when the gates were opened?

Yes, I am talking about this what I have said is five
minutes, what you have said was a longer period.   The
main opening of Gate C is what I am talking about. - A.
Once the gates were opened there was a massive influx
of fans.   Obviously everyone was getting pushed at the
same time.

Q. But you see you have evidence, I may have been mistaken
   .... - A. Individuals were approaching me and acting in
   a very aggressive manner towards me.

Q. What were they being aggressive about? - A. I don't
   know. When you asked them to explain it they refused.

Q. Did it look as if they were angry about something which
   had been going on outside? - A. Obviously in hindsight
   I know that that was probably it.

Q. So when we look at the video again we have got the
   pointing, we have got the pushing, anything else we
   should be looking for to explain this aggressiveness,
   as you have described it? - A. Kicking.

Q. Kicking at you? - A. Kicking me, yes.

Q. How many times were you kicked? - A. I can remember at
   least one person who kicked me.

Q. One person?   - A. Yes.

Q. When, after the kick-off, you, tagged on tothis other
   group of Officers you assumed it was a pitch invasion.
   On what did you personally base that assumption? - A.
   The fact that the other Officers were going onto the
   pitch.

Q. Just simply that? - A. And the word of mouth.

Q. What was the word of mouth? - A. That there had been a
   pitch invasion.

Q.   Was this when you were still on the concourse, this
     word of mouth came to you? - A. I was beckoned to join
     the Officers.   When I did so, as we were filtering
     through the tunnel single file there was obviously
     speculation as to what was happening.

Q. And you were on the concourse side of the stand still?
   - A. No, I was making my way through onto the pitch.

Q.   When you tagged on to the Officers .... - A. Are you
     asking me what made me tag on?

Q. Let's go back to the beginning.  You were originally on
   the concourse, that is where you had been originally,
   right? - A. Yes.

Q. Everybody had gone or most people had gone into the
   ground to watch the game, all right, and then take it
   from there.  You saw a group of Officers arrive on the
   concourse? - A. There were still large numbers,
                                                D. BUTLER




thousands of people still on the concourse.  The job of
searching, which was what we were supposed to be doing,
searching people as they entered, obviously we could
not do that, so I was stood with the programme sellers.
As time went by a group of Officers made their way
towards the pitch.  Obviously there was some urgency
about it.

Where you were standing you could not see the pitch,
could you? - A. No.

Because you were on the concourse, so this group of
Officers, first of all where were this group of
Officers when you first saw them? - A. Can I use the
pointer?

Of course you can. - A. Officers made their way from
this point here , down here , followed by myself and the
rest of the serial.

The starting point you are pointing to was the gateway
entrance in the wall dividing the concourse? - A. I
can't say whether they came through the gateway
obviously, but they did come from that direction.

Were they walking, running, or what? - A. Running.

At that stage, as far as you were aware, had the game
started? - A. Yes, the game had kicked off.

Were there still thousands of people in the concourse
at that point? - A. Still large numbers, yes.

Still large numbers, so these Officers were running
through large numbers of people? - A. Yes.

All right, you can come back. What made you tag onto
those Officers? - A. The fact that they were urgent, I
was beckoned to join them, the fact that my Sergeant
and rest of the serial joined them.

I have forgotten, who was your Sergeant? - A. Sergeant
Crawford.

You joined them and it was word of mouth as you were
going with them round the corner, was it, that there
had been a pitch invasion? - A. Mmm, speculation.

In other words, a problem to deal with law and order,
if I can put it that way? - A. That is right, yes, sir.

Indeed to be fair to you, once you had made that
assumption, seeing people on the pitch made you decide
I   " /
                                                                  D. BUTLER   73




                   that that was what it as all about? - A. That is right,
                   sir.

              Q. Tell me, when you got onto the pitch and you were
                 helping yourself - and we wouldn't want you to relive
                 that because it must have been an excruciating
                 experience, but you gave evidence that some people were
          B      not helping you in some way.  Are you saying that
                 people were being aggressive to you when you were
                 helping people on the pitch?  I wasn't sure I
                 understood what you were saying. - A. Yes, sir, they
                 were.

              Q. What were they being aggressive about, because
                 obviously you would be helping somebody at the time? -
                 A. I have no idea.

              Q.    Were they communicating an anger about what had
                   happened? - A. They were just being aggressive towards
                   us.

              Q.   What were they saying or doing to make youconclude
                   .... - A. They were swearing at us.

               . And what were they swearing about? - A. They were just
                 generally swearing.

              Q. As an example what would you be doing at the time these
                 other people were swearing at you? - A. For example,
                 there were a pile of bodies in front of the gate when I
                 went to it, and there were other people standing on
                 them. When I asked them to step back to enable us to
                 get the bodies out, they were refusing, and that is
                 when they were shouting, swearing, etc.

              Q. And you can't help us whether or not it was anger about
                 what was going on or not? - A. I don't know what it
                 was.  For another example, some fans were removing
                 hoardings to use as stretchers.

              Q. Indeed. - A. Other people were jumping onto these
                 hoardings and breaking them up.

              Q. Can I go back to something very early on in your
                 evidence? How many people did you eject from the
                 ground? - A. I should say about four, four or five.

              Q. Were they people who had not got any tickets? - A. Yes,
                 all of them did not have tickets.

                   I think you said you yourself, from your knowledge,
                   said there were about a dozen people who you said you
                   dealt with who did not have tickets? - A. Yes, about
                   that, about six.

Q. So what happened to the other eight? You ejected four
   .... - A. Sorry, did I say a dozen or half a dozen?

Q. I thought you said a dozen but I may be wrong.

Q.       THE CORONER:    I thought you said a dozen.

Q.        MR. KING:    You did say a dozen.  What happened to
     the other eight people who did not have tickets? - A. I
     ejected them all. When I made the statement was a long
     time ago ....

                                                  D. BUTLER


Q.               I have not got a statement.  This is
     probably my inadequate note of your evidence.

     THE CORONER:   I do not think it is in the statement.
It is a question I asked.

       MR. KING:   I have not got a statement.      I am just
trying to see how accurate the evidence is.

       THE CORONER:   Yes.

Q.       MR. KING: Obviously it is a long time ago and
     again I am not trying to trap you but it is important
     that we know how accurate evidence is on any
     matter? - A. Every person I dealt with who did not
     have a ticket, I ejected.

Q. Your recollection was that you ejected about four
   people? - A. Yes.

                Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Officer, at an all-ticket match do you normally find
   ticketless fans inside the stadium?

       THE CORONER:   I could not hear you.

Q.         MRS. McBRIEN: At an all-ticket match, do you
     normally find ticketless fans inside the stadium? -
     A. We do sometimes, yes.

Q. Should there not be a system dealing with them so
   that they do not get in there?

     THE CORONER:   I am a bit reluctant to let this
Officer who has not dealt with that answer the question.
It is not really for him, is it?

     THE WITNESS:  There are various systems in operation
for that once they are inside.

Q.         MRS. McBRIEN:  I am just wondering how they
     ever get there.   Surely the Police are there to keep
     law and order and one thing is to keep the ticketless
     fans out? - A. You cannot determine whether anybody
     has got tickets until they get to the turnstile
     really.

Q. But this was inside the ground, wasn't it, and you
   ejected them from inside the ground you said? - A.
   Yes, that is right.

Q. So they had got through the turnstiles? - A. Yes,
   they climbed either over the top or once they got to
                                                   D. BUTLER


     the turnstiles, because of the pressure of people,
     there was no sending them back.

Q. I have heard Police Officers saying that the fans
   were aggressive.  Surely there should be more
   aggressive policing to stop this happening?

     THE CORONER:    No, that is a policy decision which may
not be popular with everybody but it is not for this
Officer anyway.   He cannot tell you whether Policemen
should be more aggressive or less.   He can just tell you
what he did and what he saw.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:   You were at the 1988 match,
     weren't you? - A. I was, sir, yes.

Q. Did you see any ticketless fans inside the ground
   that year? - A. I didn't personally, no, but I was
   working a different duty.

Q. It is possible that in 1988 that that question had
   been adopted?

     THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, this Officer has just
told me that he was doing a different duty to that he did
in 1988.  How can you possibly draw a conclusion as to what
happened in 1988 at Leppings Lane with regard to his
evidence? You cannot.

      MRS. McBRIEN:    I am sorry, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Even if you could you certainly cannot
draw it from his answer.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:   Did you hear    any message from
     ground control giving the fans in    the ground
     information of any kind? - A. No,    I didn't but the
     noise was so loud I doubt if they    had been able to
     hear it in the later stages.

Q. Over the tannoy system, would they have heard that?

     THE CORONER:   He said he did not hear and besides        I
do not think it is terribly relevant to the     Inquest.

      MRS. McBRIEN:    Thank you, Officer.

         MR. KING: There is one question I have been asked
to ask    by those behind     me and I had forgotten to, sir.It
is the    obvious concern of some relatives of timing.

       THE CORONER:   Yes, of course.

     MR. KING:    It may be relevant as it is to do with
timing.
                                                 D. BUTLER



     THE CORONER:   Yes, certainly.

            Further Cross-Examined bv MR. K I N G :

Q. You arrived, Officer, ultimately at the gate to one
   of the pens in the middle.  You have told us in
   evidence of that? - A. I did, sir, yes.

Q. I think we have identified it as Pen 4, as we call
   it, and it is the furthest one from where I am
   standing, looking at the model, is it not, of the two
   centre pens? - A. Yes, it is the one I indicated
   earlier just to the right.

Q. It is Pen 4 and it is to the right as you are looking
   at the terraces and to your left as you are entering
   it from the tunnel? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. Can you help at all as to what time it was when you
   first entered that pen? - A. All I can say is that
   the players had left the pitch and it was perhaps -
   all I can say is that it was perhaps two or three
   minutes after I had got on to the playing area.

Q. If one has to try and reconstruct we know from your
   earlier evidence that when you entered the playing
   area for the first time there were people already on
   the playing area? - A. Yes, that is right.  If the
   kick-off was three o'clock it was probably seven or
   eight minutes past.

Q. We can probably work it out from when people get into
   various parts.  That is why I was asking that, thank
   you.

      MR. MANNING:   Sir, could I seek clarification of
something if I can just relate it to you?

     THE CORONER:   You   just go ahead.    I will    stop you if
I disagree.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:

Q. There seemed, when I took m y note, to be a clear
   piece of evidence given by you about the aggression
   that was being shown to you when you were stood at
   the turnstiles and people were either coming over the
   turnstiles, coming through the turnstiles, without
   tickets or just generally aggressive towards you.   In
   answer to my learned   friend, Mr. King, then   you
   talked about the aggression after Gate C was opened
   and a torrent of people then came through Gate C.
   The question I want to ask you is whether in fact
   there were two separate pieces of aggression being
                                              D. BUTLER


   shown to you as a Police Officer or is that just the
   one at Gate C or just the one at the turnstiles? Do
   you understand the question? - A. Not really.

Q. Then I will have to go a little more slowly.  You
   were originally posted as duty to search people
   having come through the turnstiles in the turnstile
   block? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. As I have understood your evidence - and tell me if
   this is not right - you have said that you have had
   to deal with a number of instances of aggression by
   people either climbing over the turnstile block,
   trying to get in without tickets or even, having come
   through the turnstiles, being aggressive towards you
   at that time, is that correct? - A. That is correct,
   yes.

Q. Is there a later incident when Gate C is opened and
   amongst the people who were coming through were a
   number of people who were also aggressive towards
   you? - A. That is right.

Q. So there were two separate incidents of aggression
   towards you? - A. The aggression was continuing
   towards, shall I say, the latter stages.

Q. At two different places? - A. At two different
   places, y e s .

     MR. HALE:   Sir, I hesitated to pursue the matter but
Mr. King gave me a lead in to pursue the matter now and as
it is if it is left it would give an incomplete picture.   I
would like to pursue what happened during the rescue.

     THE CORONERS   Yes.
         Further Cross-Examined by MR. HALE:
Qâ€¢      MK7â€œH5LE!   You nave given one example of
   aggression towards you during the rescue but do you
   recall any other incidents from supporters towards
   you whilst you were trying to carry out a rescue? -
   A. One that does stick out was one of the bodies was
   that of a young female.

Q. Speak towards the microphone? - A. One of the bodies
   was that of a young female and several of the
   supporters were shouting out obscenities.  Her
   clothing had become dishevelled.  That was the thing
   that stuck out.

Q. Do you recall a large male supporter that you had to
   help? - A. There were several that I had to help.
   One large supporter was actually standing on a head
   if you are referring to that.

                                              K. A. SMALLMAN


Q. Yes. - A. He was standing on the head of one of the
   bodies and refused to move backwards.  He had to be
   physically pushed back to retrieve the body.

Q. What sort of condition was that man in, the
   supporter? - A. The one that?

Q. The one standing on the head? - A. The one standing
   on the head had been drinking.

Q. How did he speak to you? - A. Well, just a series of
   obscenities.

Q. Do you remember anything coming from the crowd
   towards you? - A. Yes, sir.  There was an angle
   plate, a metal angle plate, was hurled from the crowd
   at Police Officers and it embedded in the turf near
   to where I was standing.

Q. Is that while you were attempting to carry out the
   rescue? - A. That was into the later stages of the
   rescue.

Q. You remember another man coming towards you giving
   any sort of gesture or salute? - A. Yes, again in the
   later stages of the rescue one man came down from the
   terracing giving a Nazi-style salute and shouting
   something about Thatcher, "Thatcher's lads".

Q. Were those three or four things you have mentioned,
   just isolated items or were there other similar
   incidents? - A. There were several similar incidents
   from a minority.

Q. That was after everybody had got into the ground and
   that was while you were trying to carry out the
   rescue? - A. That is right, sir, yes.

               KEVIN ANTHONY SMALLMAN Sworn

                      Bv THE CORONERS

Q. Are you Kevin Anthony Smallman? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. PC 136 I think? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Am I right in thinking that you too were part of
   Serial 14? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. So you were on the inside of Turnstiles A to G? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. Your job, amongst others, was to search fans as they
   came through, is that right? - A. That is what the
   duties were for our serial, yes.
                                          K. A. SMALLMAN



Until what time would you say that things were
reasonably okay? - A. Up to the point of 2 pm to
2.15.

Until that time would I be right in saying that you
had no problems, the fans were co-operative, they
were pleasant and everything went smoothly? - A.
Exactly that, sir.  I think I had been there from
about eleven o'clock in the morning.

Was this the first time you had done a duty at the
Leppings Lane end? - A. It was, yes, in that
particular ar e a .

Then from 2.15 onwards or thereabouts was there a
build up of fans? - A. From what I could see, yes.

What effect, if any, did this have on your work? - A.
We got progressively busier and, as I say, initially
we were able to search people as they were coining
through the turnstiles into the concourse area and
then after that we had to be more selective as other
Officers have said.

Did you have occasion to eject anybody for not having
a ticket? - A. No, sir. As things did get more busy
I was deputed to the area where the selling of
programmes were.

What was your job there? - A. Just to maintain order
and have regard for public safety and protective
presence there, yes.

Were you able to see the concertina gate from there,
Gate C? - A. From a side view.

Presumably you were just standing there really to
stop people doing something which they should not do?
~ A . Most of the time, yes. I was called to
different areas of the concourse.

Did fans speak to you at all? - A. Quite a few, yes,
from the time we are talking about, yes, after two
o'clock.

From 2.15 onwards I am talking about? - A. Yes.

What, if anything, did they say to you or complain
about? - A. I was surrounded by quite a few
supporters and they were telling me about the
situation outside.

They were not happy with it? - A. Not at all, no.
They were very angry.

                                                 K. A. SMALLMAN


Q. In fact, I think...   How many years' service had you
   done? - A. At that point ten years.

Q. I think your impression was that these people were
   angrier than you had seen people in that situation ever
   before, would that be right? - A. That's right, sir.    I
   have seen quite a few angry men in my service, but not as
   angry as that before.

Q. Was it anger directed at you personally or anger directed
   at the fact they had been squashed, hurt, distressed,
   inconvenienced - I don't know - whatever word you wish to
   use? - A. Yes.   I believe the anger wasn't directed at
   me.   Their frustration was vented towards me as a police
   officer, but their main anger was because of the
   situation outside, what they had experienced.

Q. You happened to be conveniently situated for them to
   express it? - A. I was near to the turnstile and gate
   entrances and obviously wearing uniform they came to me
   as a matter of course.

Q. Would you say the atmosphere had changed as far as you
   were concerned? - A. Dramatically, yes.

Q. Do you remember the concertina gate being opened? - A. I
   noticed it had been opened on a couple of occasions.

Q.   But you didn't actually see it open? - A. I didn't see     it
     open.   I don't know why.

Q. We have already heard that lots of fans came in. Would
   you agree with that? - A. I would agree with that.

Q.   When they came through, where did they go, as far as you
     remember? - A. The majority obviously headed for the
     central tunnel area.

Q. This was your first time at this end, is that right? - A.
   It is the first time on the concourse area, inside the
   turnstiles, but I have worked duties on the terraces
   itself, Leppings Lane and also the seating area.

Q. Do you mean the terraces or the seating area? - A. Both,
   over previous years.   Not obviously at the same time but
   over the previous years that I have worked matches at
   Sheffield Wednesday.   I have been in different parts of
   the ground, even outside and on the train station areas.

Q. Were you there in 1988? - A. I wasn't, sir, no.

Q. Have you ever been there at the semi-final? - A. Once
   before but it was quite a few years ago.   It was a
   Liverpool/Arsenal one, I believe, in the early eighties.

Q. You weren't on Leppings Lane then? - A. No, ray duties
   were outside the ground altogether.

Q. Once the gate was open, the fans were coming through and
   streaming towards the tunnel.   What, if anything,
   happened as far as you were concerned? - A. Initially the
   concertina gates were closed again and things got back to
   the stage as to what it was before - people climbing over
   the walls, coming through the turnstiles, general mayhem,
   really, inside the area where we were.   People were
   still coming up to me, grabbing hold of me, trying to
   tell me about the situation outside.

Q. How was that relieved, or changed? - A. How was what
   relieved?

Q. That situation which you have just described. - A. People
   coming up to me?   Once they had said their piece they
   seemed to go away.   It was just constant.   Once one
   moved away another person would take his place.

Q. Did the area clear in due course? - A. Eventually, yes,
   after the gates had been opened again.

Q. Did you get a message to go on to the pitch? - A. Only by
   word of mouth.   It wasn't a direct order from my
   Supervisory Officer.   It was only by word of mouth from
   other Police Officers, that on the grapevine there had
   been a pitch invasion.

Q. Which way did you enter on to the pitch? - A. Via the
   South Stand end.

Q. When you got on to it, was play still in being? - A. No,
   sir.    I believe there were no footballers on the pitch
   at all.

Q. Having looked round where did you head for? - A.
   Initially, although they said there had been a pitch
   invasion, I formed the opinion it wasn't a pitch invasion
   as such although I couldn't comprehend as to what was
   quite going on.    What I did, I made my way on to the
   playing area near to a corner flag and was asking people
   who were wandering about what the situation was.    I
   didn't get much response because they appeared numb,
   shocked and dazed.   I saw a little girl about eight
   years old.   I asked her what she was doing and she
   didn't really give me an answer but pointed out as to
   where the people were who she came with, so I directed
   her back into the corner end of the stand to where
   relatives were waving to us.   Then I started to make my
   way over to the particular areas behind the goals where
   most of the action, for want of a better way of putting
   it, seemed to be taking place.
                                                               83




                                                    K. A. SMALLMAN


Q. Although you entered the area thinking it might be a
   pitch invasion, it didn't take you very long to realise
   this was something different? - A. That's right.   I have
   seen pitch invasions before...

Q. But you can't put into words what it was that told you? -
   A. No.   Something was obviously amiss but I could not
   tell from the position I was exactly what was amiss.

Q. Is it right you actually entered the terracing in due
   course? - A. Eventually, yes.    I made my way to the
   central part of the pens and as  soon as I realised what
   that situation was, and how serious it was, I did enter
   via Gate 1 I believe.

Q. By which gate? - A. Gate 1.

0.    How did you   get towards the centre? - A.   I just made my
     way through    the    pens. The side areas, towards the
     corner flag    behind the goal, were relatively empty.     It
     was easy to    get through them.

Q. Did you have to climb the fencing? - A. I did, sir, yes.

Q. So that is how you got over? - A. Eventually, climbed
   over the fencing that runs...

Q. By the time you got to the central areas can you remember
   whether an ambulance was already there or not? - A. I
   don't recall one being there.    There was that much to
   do.   I didn't stand around to look for other people
   doing other duties.

Q.   I am going back outside now for a moment into the
     concourse area.The tunnel itself, you      didn't, and you
     didn't see anybody else, trying to divert fans away from
     it, did you? - A. No, sir, I didn't.    As I say, as
     things started getting busy I didn't realise what anybody
     else - police officer-wise - was doing.    I had
     sufficient to try and cope with at the time myself.

Q. Just two more questions.  Did you hear the order given to
   open the gate? - A. No, sir.

Q. You heard no other comment about the opening of the gate?
   - A. I didn't, sir, not from the position I was in.

Q. I think you have already described the situation in the
   concourse area as mayhem? - A. Yes, sir.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

0. Officer, you have been very fair.   In the light of the
   evidence we heard from the officer immediately before
   you, I just want to ask you this:  the aggression you saw
   on the concourse, in your view, was born of the
   frustration of what had been happening to people outside
   the ground? - A. That is the conclusion I came to on a
   personal basis, from what they were saying and they way
   they were going off towards me, personally.

Q. You have had experiences of pitch invasions, obviously,
   from past experiences at football grounds? - A. At other
   matches, not at Sheffield Wednesday.

Q. Can you help me on this:   in a pitch invasion is it
   right that fans clamber over from the terraces and run on
   to the playing area? - A. Normally towards where other
   rival supporters...

Q. On to the playing area? - A. On to the pitch playing
   area, yes.

Q. A pitch invasion is invading the playing area? - A. That
   is right, sir, or any part of the track as well.

Q. I am going to ask you about that.   If a fan climbed over
   the fencing and went onto the perimeter track around the
   pitch? - A. Yes, sir.

0. But made no attempt to enter the playing area, didn't
   interfere with play, was just stopped on the track, you
   couldn't possibly call that a pitch invasion, could you?
   - A. This is normally covered by the respective club
   ground rules and even if they are on the track - it is
   not a pitch invasion as what you would normally class it â€¢
   as, but they shouldn't be there.   They are stopped and
   dealt with.

Q. I can understand people...    You are saying they
   shouldn't be there, but the quality of a pitch invasion
   is of a lot of people running on to the playing area
   interfering with play,   isn't it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. It was obvious to you that as soon as you got round the
   corner that whatever was happening it wasn t that sort of
   pitch invasion? - A. That's right.   There were people on
   the playing area but not running around aggressively like
   you were saying.

              Cross-Examined by MISS ADDLEMAN:

Q. You have told us about entering the pens via gate 1? - A.
   It is one of the gates near to the corner flag.   I
   believe it is gate 1.

Q. What I would like to ask you about is just prior to doing
   that, did you notice either gate 3 or 4? - A. I believe
   those gates would have been covered by police officers,
   fans, etc. who were obstructing my view of the gates at
   that time when I entered the pitch.   There were people
   stood round them.

Q. So you have no recollection of what was happening at
   those gates? - A. Not initially until I made my way to
   that area.

0. Then you could see? - A. Then I could see what was going
   off and then I realised the graveness of the situation.
   Realising I couldn't get into the pens to try and help
   people at gates 3 and 4, that is why I went in via gate 1
   where the crowd was less on the terracing at that point.

Q. When you did get through and was able to see gates 3 and
   4, can you give us an idea of what time that was? - A.
   Approximately round about quarter past three, give or
   take a few minutes either way.   Obviously I didn't stand
   around looking at my watch.

0. At that time there were police officers around those
   gates? - A. Quite a few police officers, yes.

Q. Can you tell us in your own words what you saw at that
   time? - A. The ones around the gate were trying to pull
   people through the gate itself.   That seemed to be
   having no effect with the amount of people it was just
   bottle necking.   Other officers, other people including
   fans, were stood on the fencing itself trying to pull
   people over the fence as well.   When they weren't doing
   that, when there was nobody within reach they were trying
   direct people to try and move back as best they could,
   ushering them back with their hands.

       MR. ISAACS:   A supplementary question, if I may,
  sir, arising out of a question asked by my learned friend
  Mr. King.

               Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS;

Q. You said very fairly, officer, that you felt the
   aggression that was shown towards you and your brother
   officers may have been born out of what was happening
   outside.   That was the impression you got.   Did you
   form any view as to the part that may have been played by
                                                        86




                                              K. A. SMALLMAN


  alcohol in that aggression? - A. There was some...   I do
  believe that certain people had been drinking, although
  you couldn't pick out individuals, as such.   There was a
  smell of beer in the air around about this time when
  things started getting a little bit out of order.

Q. When you say there was a smell of beer in the air, do you
   mean that literally? - A. I do, sir, yes.   Initially in
   the early stages when you were dealing with people on a
   one to one basis when it was fairly steady I couldn't
   smell any alcohol on people's breath, but as things got a
   little bit more busy as time went by, rather than
   smelling it on people's breath it was in the atmosphere.
   There was a stench in the air.

Q. There was a stench of alcohol as the place became more
   crowded? - A. Yes, sir, that is right.

                     Further Examined by MR. KING:

Q. You were asked about what various Officers were doing and
   what you saw.  Do I understand this to be the case, though,
   you were acting throughout on your own initiative, as I
   understand it? - A. Almost throughout after 2, quarter-past-2
   sir, yes.

Q. I am talking now during the period when you went on to help
   and rescue, during that period? - A. Yes sir, totally.

Q. You weren't receiving instructions from anybody? - A. Nobody
   at all.  I was acting on my own initiative.

Q. Do I get the impression then from that and from what yÂ©Â« describ
   you saw by the gates, that there was nobody apparently in
   charge of you, giving you orders, controlling you, telling
   you what to do. You were just left very properly, as far as
   you were concerned, but you were left to do what you thought
   was best? - A. I was not aware that there was anybody taking
   charge but that is not to say there was at that point.

Q. You can only say what you saw and what you heard and from
   your point of view no one was acting in charge of you,
   directing you at the stage of the rescue? - A. As myself and
   the rest of my Serial came round on to the pitch we seem to
   have got disbanded and at that point I was acting on my own
   initiative.

Q. Could you give me your first name please? - A. Robert Malcolm.

Q. Washington, isn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. And you are P.C. 975.     Is that right? - A. That is right sir.

Q. And you too belong to Serial 14 or belonged to Serial 14
   on the 15th April 1989? - A. That is right sir.

Q. Were you also deployed within the turnstile area? - A. Yes
   sir that is right, on the concourse.

Q. Had you been in that area before? - A. No sir, not at all.

                                      R.M. WASHINGTON-


Q. And your job, you were instructed to search fans, amongst
   other things? - A. That is right sir, yes.

Q. In fact you did, as one of your colleagues said, do a certain
   amount of what I would call double searching? - A. That is
   right sir. The fans were searched as they came through the
   turnstile and as they got through the turnstile on to the
   concourse they were searched again.

Q. initially that went off fairly smoothly? - A. Yes, no problems
   at all.

Q. Up to what time do you put it that you had no difficulties?
   - A. I would put it around 2 o'clock/2.15.

Q. Describe to me then what happened after that time? - A. As
   more fans came through there seemed to be a build-up in the
   concourse.  Fans were coming through the turnstiles and they
   did not appear to be moving off into whatever area they were
   going to, whether it be a seating area or a standing area.
   Some fans were coming up to the turnstile, obviously they
   had got the wrong place, showed the tickets to the turnstile
   operator and then had to force their way back through again
   through the crowd.  One or two people were coming through
   and complaining that there appeared to be a crush on the
   outside and they were getting a bit upset about it and they
   wanted our Serial inside the concourse to go out there and
   assist which ....

Q. The people did? - A. Yes, the fans coming through, they
   wanted all our   Serial outside.  I explained to them that
   we had a job to do, we had a task to do inside there       and
   that Officers on the outside would be doing their best to
   control the situation out there.

Q. How long did that go on for? - A. Until around 2.40, somewhere
   around that, 2.40/2.45.

Q. What happened then? - A. Quite a number of people were now
   coming through saying something had to be done outside, there
   was a definite   crush. One or two people had climbed      up on
   to the roof of   the turnstiles and they were asked to     get down.
   They got down and they were ejected by other Officers.

Q. Did you have to eject anybody? - A. No, I didn't eject any
   fan at all.

Q. Does that mean that you did not find any ticketless ones
   either? - A. I never found anyone without a ticket.

Q. Did you see a Police Officer up on the roof as a matter of
   interest? - A. No I didn't, no.

                                      R.M. WASHINGTON



Q. So explain to me then what happened after that? There
   were people coming down off the roof.  You say they
   were complaining and said you had got to do something.
   What happened then, did you see a gate open or not?
   - A. No, I didn't see a gate open, no.  I was approached
   by a person that said he was a Police Officer from
   Merseyside.  He told me that something had to be done
   outside or else someone was going to get injured.   I
   told him that we could not move out of our position and
   that Officers outside would be doing all they could to
   get the thing under control because I could see, I had
   a limited view through Turnstile B which I was on that
   there was a crush at that turnstile. You could see
   people being squeezed round into the turnstile and
   people being squashed up behind them.

Q. Did you try and communicate - this sounds slightly
   critical and I don't mean it to be - but did you try and
   communicate what the Officer was saying to your senior
   Officers or to anybody? - A. I could not communicate
   other than verbally.  I was not in possession of a radio.

Q. Was there anybody around who you could communicate to
   who could have used the radio for instance? - A. The
   Serial Sergeant I believe was down near Gate C.

Q. Where were you actually? I assumed that you were in the
   Gate C area but where were you actually positioned? -
   A. I was about 20' away at Turnstile B.

Q. I see, yes. But you did not have an opportunity to
   communicate with him? - A. No, no, it was very busy on
   the concourse.

Q. Did things appear to settle down after a while or did
   they get worse or did they stay the same? - A. It seemed,
   well it did get a lot worse. As fans were coming through
   they were obviously very agitated at what was going off
   outside. They were getting pushed and shoved and squashed.
   They were coming up to several Officers, myself included,
   and verbally remonstrating with us saying that something
   had got to be done.

Q. Were you eventually asked to go on to the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. Perhaps before we deal with that, all these fans who
   were coming in, you said you did not see the gate open
   at all? - A. No, I did not see it open but I was aware
   of a large surge coming through on to the concourse from
   my left.

Q. But are you saying you never saw the gate open? I am not
   saying did you see it opened? - A. The gate was open but
   I did not see it opened.

                                        R.M. WASHINGTON


Q. I misunderstood you, I thought you said you had not seen
   it? - A. No, the gate was open but I did not see it
   opened.

Q.   But you did not see the activity? - A. No.

Q.   The people who were coming through were they all going
     towards the tunnel as far as you could see? - A. They were
     all heading in that general direction but as the beginning
     of the surge came through they got through perhaps 10' and
     there seemed to be a gap appear at the front and I went
     straight up into that area with a couple of other Officers
     and we found three or four people were actually laid on
     the floor and we had to get them up, pull them out of the
     way to the side and all the fans continued to surge up
     towards the tunnel area.

Q. So this was right at the beginning .... A. At the beginning
   when the gates had opened and the fans had come in.

Q.   Did the ingress then calm down after that? Were people
     racing, running, walking, hurrying. What was the word
     that you would use? - A. I would say they were running.
     They were running as they came in and continued to run in
     the direction of the tunnel.   That is the main area they
     went to.   I did see one or two or several in fact move
     to the left and right to go to the north side and south
     side.




                             Q. But relatively speaking
                                         R. M. WASHINGTON




But relatively speaking few? - A. Very few.     The
majority went for the centre tunnel.

Did you finish up on the pitch as well? - A. That is
right, sir, I did.

How did you get there?    I mean, you got there with your
feet, but what I mean    is what induced you to go? - A. I
heard Inspector White say there had been a pitch
invasion and all our serial were to go in that
direction to the pitch.

Did you go onto it via the South Stand? - A. Via the
South Stand, that is right, sir.

By the time you got there were the players on or off
the pitch? - A. They were off the pitch.

You are sure? - A. Yes.

Were there people on the pitch that you could see,
fans? - A. Yes, there were fans on the pitch.

What impression did you form of the situation as you
saw it when you first   emerged? - A. I took it as a very
small pitch invasion.    Initially when we got the report
that there had been a pitch invasion I expected quite a
few hundred to be on the playing area, but there
weren't that many.

How long did it take you before you realised that this
was something a bit different? - A. I realised there
was something different - as I came onto the South
Stand I made my way down one of the gangways onto the
pitch on the south side, and I could see other Officers
around the centre north, centre south stands, and I
made my way up into that area.

Was it then that you realised .... - A. It was then
that I realised that something was totally wrong.

And I think you attempted to assist? - A. That is
right, assisting people getting over the fence.

Did you at any point in that afternoon take up a
position at or in or around the tunnel entrance, or
indeed the tunnel which leads onto the terrace? - A.
No, sir, I didn't.

            Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Officer, just one or two points if I may.  After about
2.15 things in the concourse area got very difficult as
                                                          92



                                              R. M. WASHINGTON




       I understand your evidence? - A. Yes, that is right,
       sir.
B
    Q. A lot of people congregating there? - A. Yes, that is
       right.

    Q. Who had come through the turnstiles and did not move
       on? - A. Yes, that is right.

    Q. A lot of people coming through the turnstiles at a
       rapid rate? - A. Yes, they were coming through rather
       fast.

    Q. Then there came a time later on when we know that Gate
       C opened? - A. Yes.

    Q. From your evidence it does not appear that you were
       aware that there were two openings when people came
       through or am I wrong about that? - A. You are quite
       right, sir.  I was only aware of the third opening as I
       now know it to be.

    Q. Just so that we get the right impression, Officer,
       during this period, from about 2.15, 2.30 and then
       onwards to kick-off time, what were you spending your
       time doing? - A. I was spending my time searching fans
       coming through Gate B.

    Q. You were not able to search every fan who came through?
       - A. No, we had to be very selective.  As you can
       appreciate, there is quite a number of people coming
       through the turnstiles and to stop everyone that came
       through, we would be adding to the problem outside.
       You would just block everything off.

    Q. And as you searched one person, there would be
       countless fans coming through the turnstiles and going
       past you? - A. Yes, that is right.

    Q. You would not therefore be in a position any longer to
       be able to check upon the people who were coming
       through one way or another without tickets? - A. No, I
       would not.

    Q. Lots of people then in the concourse area. You up to
       your eyes in work. We know that people come through
       Gate C. Can you help us as to what you saw your
       brother Officers doing at this time, or were you so
       busy you could not say what they.were doing? - A. I
       could not say what they were doing, sir, not down at
       the bottom end towards Gate C.

    Q. But all seemed to be, as far as you could tell .... -
       A. Every Officer, to the best of my knowledge, was

   looking after something, whether it be searching or
   looking after stewards with cash, programme sellers,
   things like that.

Q. And the area swarming with people? - A. Yes, it was
   absolutely packed with people.

              Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING

Q. At the same sort of time that Mr. Isaacs was talking
   about, you said the time came that you could not
   possibly check on people coming through without
   tickets, but you were aware of something that did cause
   you disquiet as to people who apparently originally had
   had tickets, and were seeking then to pass them on
   somewhere? - A. Yes, that is right, sir. As the gate
   had opened I was aware that there were people on the
   roof of the turnstiles, and fans down below who had
   already entered via Gate C were throwing tickets onto
   the roof, to the people on the roof, and they in turn
   were throwing them over the roof to the fans outside
   the ground in front of the turnstiles A-G.

Q. And just this, Officer.  You talked about the gathering
   of people in the concourse area itself, and attempts
   being made to persuade that gathering of people to
   disperse and to move onto the next stage in wherever
   they were going to take up position? - A. Yes, that is
   right, sir. We tried to move them off so that we could
   search fans coming in, more quickly, and get them away
   from the turnstiles.

Q. And were you not getting a great deal of co-operation
   there? - A. No, people just stood around.  They did not
   turn round and flatly refuse, they just moved a few
   feet and it did not alleviate the problem at all.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q. Officer, can I investigate the chain of command which
   was from you upwards as you understood it? You were
   part of a serial. Who was your immediate senior
   Officer? - A. My immediate senior Officer was Sergeant
   Crawford, the serial Sergeant.

Q. From whom had you received, if from anybody, your
   initial briefing at the beginning of the day? - A. We
   got an overall briefing from senior Officers.  I think
   it was the Assistant Chief Constable Officer,
   Operations, but I can't swear to that.  After the main
   briefing we were then briefed by Inspector White as to
   our Serial 1 4 's duties for that day.

Q. To whom did you understand you would have to
   communicate, or could communicate, if you had a
   problem, an emergency to deal with, or a matter which
   you wanted to draw to the attention of a senior
   Officer? Who whom did you understand you would have to
   communicate? - A. The serial Sergeant.

Q. Officer, can I make clear in all these questions they
   are not designed as a criticism of you, because you
   have to deal with the system as you have, all right,
   but I want to investigate this a bit further if I can?
   Did you understand who was above that serial Sergeant?
   - A. It would be what I would call the Sector
   Commander, which would be Inspector White.

Q. You may not have known - did you know who was above
   him? - A. No, sir, I don't.

Q. You didn't have a radio, did you? - A. No.

Q. Within your serial, apart from the serial Sergeant, did
   you know if any of your colleagues in the serial had a
   radio? - A. To the best of my knowledge there was only
   the serial Sergeant had a radio.

Q. So if you were given a piece of information which was
   something which you wanted to draw to the attention of
   a senior Officer, a serial Sergeant, the only means
   available to you in the system which was being
   operated, was by word of mouth?  It was the only way
   you could do it if you wanted to? - A. Yes, to a
   supervisory Officer.

Q. Had you been given any specific standing orders or
   instructions as to what to do with a piece of
   information which you wanted to draw to more senior
   people to deal with? - A. I would take it to the serial
   Sergeant, always.

Q. Can I say first of all you are entitled anyway to not
   answer any questions I am giving you which you feel are
   critical of you. They are not meant to be, I am trying
   to get at the system, but you were approached by a
   number of people while you were on duty inside the
   concourse area - this is before Gate C was opened -
   over a period of time, people saying, "Look, something
   has got to be done, there is crushing outside, somebody
   is going to be injured", and that was over a period of
   time, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. Could you estimate the period of time that had been
   going on before you were conscious that Gate C was
   opened? - A. We are talking about 45 minutes.
                                       R. M. WASHINGTON




Right, and indeed at one stage you were approached by
somebody who apparently appeared to be, from what he
was saying, a Merseyside Police Officer in plain
clothes? - A. He said he was a Merseyside Officer.

He seemed to be somebody who was genuinely concerned
about the situation? - A. Yes.




               /Q. Again, it was information
                                                        96



                                        R. M. WASHINGTON


Q. Again it was information, was it not, that only
   senior people could deal with.  You were not in a
   position to deal with crushing outside, were you? -
   A. No, I had no access to the outside at all.

Q. You were not anyway in control of operations.  You
   were just one of the Officers - and I do not mean
   this rudely - in the system doing your particular
   job, that is right, is it not? - A. Yes, that is
   right.

Q. That information, it must have crossed your mind, was
   important information to try and communicate to more
   senior people? - A. I would have thought - and this
   is purely an assumption - that all Officers working
   the turnstiles were aware that there was a crush
   outside.  Every Officer working on the Turnstiles A
   to G could see outside that there was a crush on
   every turnstile including the Serial Sergeant who was
   working a turnstile.

Q. So the Serial Sergeant, who had the radio, you
   understood was working the turnstile? - A. Yes, he
   was in immediate supervision watching every
   turnstile.

Q. Because as you understood it, the only people who
   could deal with the crushing would be, I assume, even
   people above the Serial Sergeant and you are talking
   about Officers in overall control of the Control Room
   I assume? - A. No, the Officers outside on turnstile
   duty outside the ground, I could see that there were
   several Officers outside covering the turnstiles.   I
   could also see through from the inside to the outside
   mounted Officers who were performing their duty.

Q. If steps were going to be taken, an overall view of a
   problem outside, if manpower outside had proved
   inadequate because of the crushing because, of
   course, you were inside, that had to be dealt with by
   somebody way above you? - A. A decision would be made
   beyond me.

Q.   Way above you? - A. Yes.

Q.   I come back to the point that, as I understand it,
     you had no means of communication, if you had found
     time, other than by word of mouth? That was the only
     system that you had? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. After this 45 minutes period had been getting worse
   and worse, this information that you were getting,
   and you were conscious that Gate C was opened, were
   you then conscious of Gate C staying open for quite a
                                                        97



                                       R. M. WASHINGTON


   long period of time? - A. I would say no more than
   ten minutes.

Q. Ten minutes is a reasonably long time in the context
   of what we are talking about.  You are not talking
   about seconds, you are talking about ten minutes? -
   A. Yes, somewhere in that region.

Q. Again we have a video which you may or may not know
   of in that period so that we can again look for
   things which you tell us about when we look at a
   video of the people coming through Gate C at that
   period. Are you suggesting that throughout that ten
   minutes period everybody was running and persistently
   running? - A. I would say they might not have been
   running.  Initially, the initial burst through the
   gate, everybody was running.

Q. We can actually look for it, Officer, and so you can
   help us when we look at it again? - A. As to later
   on, probably moving fast.  I wouldn't say running.

Q. On your evidence what we should be looking for, when
   we see Gate C being opened on the video, is people
   running for how long. How long do you say for the
   ten minutes that people were persistently running? -
   A. Probably for a couple of minutes the initial surge
   coming through.

Q. Leaving aside time for the moment, is your
   recollection really this that initially the people
   who came through were running but after that people
   calmed down and were just walking through - that
   might not be your recollection? - A. As you can
   appreciate, prior to the gate being opened we had
   still got a large amount of people on the concourse
   and that concourse is then filled with a few hundred
   or possibly thousands more and to keep that amount of
   people running they would have had to have gone
   straight through on to the pitch and everybody keep
   moving and moving and moving.  At some stage we have
   got to get some sort of bottleneck or stoppage and
   everything gradually slows down.

Q. We can look at the video, Officer, and assess what we
   see but I wanted to hear what you said.  Is the
   picture then that it really is not the whole period
   of people running continually over ten minutes? - A.
   Oh n o , n o .

Q. When you said that you heard Sergeant White say there
   had been a pitch invasion was that an order directed
   to you or was it something that you just heard? How
   are you... - A. I am sorry, sir, it was Inspector
   White.

Q. I am sorry, that is my fault.  How did you know it
   was Inspector White saying that there was a pitch
   invasion? - A. I saw Inspector White come from the
   area.  I believe it would be the Gate B area behind
   the wall.  He came through and said, "There's a pitch
   invasion".  I saw him and heard him say it.

Q. To whom was he saying this? - A. Presumably to our
   Serial.

Q. But you were scattered about somewhat? - A. Yes.

Q. Then you came together and off you went? - A. We came
   together and everybody moved off.

Q. Were you yourself, when you were participating in
   helping to assist people over the fence and so forth,
   aware of anybody giving you orders as to how to
   operate, what to do in the rescue operation, how to
   go about things? - A. Not immediately, no.

               Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:

Q. Officer, are you sure that you have got the time
   right when you said that problems started to arise at
   two o'clock to 2.15.  Could it possibly have been
   later, even 2.35? - A. No, I would estimate my
   timing, give or take a few minutes, is right, 2 to
   2.15.

Q. The reason I say that is because we have heard a lot
   of evidence here and we have heard fans that day
   arrived later that usual.  Fans arrived later and two
   o'clock seems quite early? - A. I cannot say how many
   fans arrived later. As you can appreciate, I am
   inside the turnstiles dealing with fans already
   coming through and so I cannot say who arrived late.

Q. You do seem to tie that up with the crushing outside.
   When you said that problems arose you then go on
   immediately to mention the crushing outside and we
   know that that was later than 2 to 2.15? - A. There
   is that possibility that I might have got the time
   wrong but 2 to 2.15 there is a distinct build up of
   fans coming through the turnstiles.

Q. But you could be wrong? - A. It may be, yes, I might
   be fifteen minutes out.

Q. You are the third Officer today who has mentioned
   that time.    I did not question the other two but may
   be they have the time wrong as well.    I do not know.

     MR. KING:  Sir, there is a matter I want to raise with
you.  It does not concern the Jury but could I ask the
Police Officers who have already given evidence to just
wait until I have spoken to you, sir?

     THE CORONER:   Certainly, that is Butler, Smallman and
Washington.  Do you want them in or out of Court?

     MR. KING:  Sir, I do not want to say anything more
while the Jury are present.

       THE CORONER:   Very well.  Ladies and gentlemen, you
may.    We will see you at ten o'clock in the morning.

                  (The Jury retired from Courts

     THE CORONER:   I have made up my mind, the Officers
will leave the Court.

                 (The witnesses left the Courts

     MR. KING:    Sir, I am grateful. In fact, it only
concerns PC Butler but Idid not want to identify him so
that there would be no speculation.   I have been given a
series of instructions which I have to digest but it
concerns PC Butler's evidence when he was answering
questions from my learned friend, Mr. Hale, and it
specifically concerned his evidence relating to a young
female body.   You will recall the evidence, sir.

       THE CORONER:   Yes, I remember it.

     MR. KING:  I can understand the questions that are on
my piece of paper.   They are directed    in part not simply to
the generic part of this evidence but who    it is. Sir, I
say this openly, I have not digested all my instructions on
it but what I am anxious for is an opportunity to seek the
recall of PC Butler to deal with these matters.   They may
direct themselves to the generic issues as well and I
cannot say they do not but I did not want the Officer to
disappear without checking whether he was available at some
stage and secondly to put you on notice immediately, sir,
of the position I am in.  If it were not the end of the day
I would simply have the opportunity during the course of
the day to take instructions. I want to sort it o u t .

     THE CORONER:   I was a little unhappy about that part
of the Inquiry because I have his statement in front of me.
On the whole I felt it was wiser to avoid going into it
because the difficulty is that if we start going into what
he said and what she said we are running into the danger of
slanging matches and goodness knows what.  I do not mean
amongst ourselves but with other people.  Once it was
raised I felt I had to let it go but I prefer not to deal
with it.  I have got a feeling that we never found out who
                                                     100



this person was and I think it is also right to say that I
am almost certain if he was, as I think he said, in Pen 4
then I do not think there were any females in Pen 4 at all.

      MR. KING: Sir, exactly, and as it was not only
evidence which, of course, one pricks one's ears up at but
in many ways it was offensive evidence to certain of those
who have a natural interest in this.  I do not mean
offensive in the sense that if it is right it is right but
it is certainly hurtful evidence and if it be wrong in fact
and the Officer is wrong about it then it is again only
right and proper that that should be rectified at the
earliest opportunity because it is the sort of evidence
which could be given a sensationalised feature to it in
many ways totally irrelevant to the main issues in the
case.

     THE CORONER:   That is right.

     MR. KING:  Sir, until I have taken my further
instructions I am not in a position to ask the questions
but it is an answer I submit we are going to have to reÂ­
open in order to put the matter.  Part of my instructions
relates to the question you raised that there was not a
female in that pen.

     THE CORONER:    I can tell you this, and perhaps it
will help you, that it is not my intention to deal with
this. A cut off point in many ways is helpful because it
does enable us on the whole to stop at this sort of thing
as well but there are certainly other people who have
referred to remarks about females. I want to avoid calling
that evidence because it does not advance the Inquest. All
it does, as you say, it produces good copy if one can use
that expression.   What is it that you really want with
regard to this Officer because it seems to me that it is
either true he dealt with a female and there was a comment
made or it is not.   If we recall him - I am not saying I
will not recall him - what do we achieve apart from him
confirming probably that that is precisely what happened '
and that is the bit I am worried about.

    MR. KING:  Sir, if he confirms two matters (1) the pen
he was at and (2) if he gives a description of the alleged
female to which he refers then it will be open when that
information is extracted to know whether or not it is
evidence upon which from his lips any credence can come.
If, in fact, he does confirm the pen he says he was in and
if he gives a description which does not fit in any way
with the matters to which you know I refer, sir, then it
must follow either he is recalling something which he has
been told about which is one of the dangers always of
evidence being given in the way that it is given or it just
is not true for whatever reason.  It would be wrong for the
evidence having come out from that witness for it to be
left in the way that it is credible evidence.

     THE CORONER:   I can't remember whether he said it,
without looking at the transcript, but I don't think he
actually said it was in the pen, this lady.   Did he or
didn't he?

     MR. ISAACS:   He didn't, sir.

      THE CORONER:   If you feel you would like to re-
explore this point I am not going to stop you because we
have raised this and if you think it would help, I don't
mind.    I am fearful it is simply going to compound the
problem.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I am well aware of that.    The
evidence is totally unhelpful from the word go as far as
the Inquest is concerned, but it having been raised and I
know it will have caused the hurt and very obviously will
have caused the hurt of those who have lost loved one,
that it is a matter which, to be left in the way it is,
may be the worst of two evils.   The only reason I raise
it now, sir, because I was conscious of all those
matters, I need time to consider it.

     THE CORONER:   Yes. indeed, and I am quite happy for
you to do that.   I don t think it is quite right to say
it is totally unhelpful because I could argue that it is
all terribly, terribly relevant because it tells us
something about people.   However, as I say, I am
inclined to think that we can learn enough about people
by looking at the events up to 3.15, rather than hunting
around for activities after.   I hope that most of us
will agree with that because there is no point in just
upsetting people unless it is absolutely vital.     Would
you like me to recall Mr. Butler for tomorrow morning or
would you rather call him for tomorrow after or some
other day?

     MR. KING:   Sir, I invite you to recall him for some
time tomorrow...

     THE CORONER:    Well, when it would be more
convenient for you because you have raised it.    You have
got your instructions.    How much time do you want?   I
am actually putting the ball into your court.    How much
time would you like?

     MR. KING:    Sir, I am content - I am all for
grasping nettles and not having them in the air for ages
- that's a mixed metaphor!   Sir, if you ask the officer
to return tomorrow, in the morning I will be in a
position to either say we don't need him, or to...

     THE CORONER:   Very well.   Mr. Hale?    I know what
you are going to say - at least I think I do!
                                                      102




     MR. HALE:   I must say it is extremely difficult for
people here because if one seeks to criticise some
drunken fan who is acting in a way that is not at all
surprising - it would be quite extraordinary, really, if
drunken fans were to pass by an opportunity of commenting
on something that they would normally comment upon.
However, as soon as we criticise that drunken fan it is
taken as a personal insult by the deceased and there is
no warrant for that whatsoever.   There is nothing in
what was said about some drunken fan either wolf
whistling or making some sort of comment that can have
the slightest criticism of the person who was injured or
of their family.   It is quite extraordinary that these
steps should be taken.

     You will have been aware, and the transcript will
have shown, like yourself you steered clear of this
because this was a delicate area, I myself steered clear
of it respecting the view I knew you would hold.
Mr. King himself, quite properly he sees it as his job,
went at this witness hammer and tongues for a long
period.

     THE CORONER:   Don't criticise Mr. King.

     MR. HALE:   I am not criticising Mr. King, I am
explaining, sir, that he went at this man to show the man
was mistaken and that there was no evidence whatever of
any abhorrent behaviour by fans as a whole.   It was
Mr. King himself who led into, "What happened while you
were carrying out the rescue?"    Now to have left it
there, with only one answer that one incident happened,
would have presented a totally false picture.
Therefore, I felt it was absolutely essential there to
present the entire picture.

     THE CORONER:   That is why I allowed you to do it,
Mr. Hale.

     MR. HALE:   I was grateful for that, sir.   I
respectfully agree with you again, if my learned friend,
or those who are behind him, want to start pretending
that things are not as they were, then we shall have to
call more evidence.

     THE CORONER:   No, we won't do either of those
things and I don't think Mr. King is pretending.

     May I say this:  I agree with you, I think Mr. King,
I don't know, you may have been injudicious in that.
You did, I think, open the door and that is why I allowed
Mr. Hale to proceed.   That was my perception of it
anyway.
                                                       103




     Although it is arguable that the conduct of fans
throughout the thing from A to Z, right until it is all
over, has a relevance, I prefer to deal with the conduct
of fans preferably only up to 3.15 and ideally after the
disaster happens, if you like, in a "complementary way".
That is my personal preference, but if need be one has to
say a few things which may   not be  palatable to everybody.

     I agree with you that    the mere fact that a fan or a
dozen fans or even a hundred fans make derogatory
remarks, rude remarks, obscene remarks about any of the
deceased does not reflect on the deceased, because
whatever is the truth of the matter, they didn't do it.
Somebody else did it. Even if the person isn't dead,
because it is quite possible this lady whom we are
talking about may not in fact be a deceased person, she
may just be a girl who was injured for all I know, it
does not reflect on her.   Mr. Hale is right, we have to
be absolutely clear about this, that the mere fact there
are some people who may say things which we do not like
and who may say nasty things about people who have been
hurt or injured, does not reflect on the hurt, the
injured or the dead.

     I can you there is plenty of    stuff in these files
about what people have said and what they haven't said.
In the interests of propriety, shall we say, and to avoid
unnecessary hurt I don't want to deal with it, but don't
think that there isn't plenty of information in the files
about what people have said and haven't said.

     As I have said all along, I want to give a properly
rounded, fair, comprehensive picture, but with the
minimum amount of pain and anguish to everybody who was
involved in this very sad episode.

     Does that help in any way?

     MR. KING:   Sir, it may be after I have taken
instructions and the matters are clarified that what I
might be suggesting to you, sir, that rather than my
asking any questions of PC Butler, that if you could say
something on the lines you have iust said in the presence
of the jury.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, I can certainly do that.   I
will warn him to be back so that you can think about it
and so that you can form as reasoned a judgment as you
are able.    However, I am quite happy to say something
like this if it will be helpful because the last thing I
want is that we hurt people unnecessarily.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I don't want to get into a
competition about who opened the door to what, because I
                                                     104




don't object to my learned friends' and my friend's
questioning.   My note is that the issue as to the
behaviour of the fans in the rescue and of the hindrances
he had received had already been raised before I
questioned him because I could not have had the notes I
had and the instructions I had as to that.

     Sir, I don't want to get into that because I was not
objecting to the right to ask the question, but certainly
that evidence had already emerged before any questioning
started.

     THE CORONER:   We will look at the transcript and it
is possible I raised something, but I don't think so - at
least I tried not to, shall we put it that way?

     Let's not argue about it.

     MR. KING:    I don't want to get into that. Sir, all
I am concerned about is, believe it or not, getting on
with the issueswhich are important but also, as far as I
can, to protect the feelings and interests of those
behind me.   If we can have the balance between the two
everybody will be satisfied.

     THE CORONER:   What we will do is ask him to be back
in the morning.   You can send me a message before we
begin so I know whether I want to call him or not and
then we will deal with it as properly as we can.

     Yes, Mr. Hale?

     MR. HALE:   I am only concerned with this.   As you
know, from the way I developed it, I was following your
lead and I would have been happy to do so.   When a false
picture is presented by severe and strong and long cross-
examination to try to suggest, sir, which is his
prerogative, that there was no abnormal behaviour by any
of the fans or by a totally insignificant number, and
that therefore the police are either making it up or
their recollection is so faulty that they cannot be
trusted on anything, then it is quite improper for us to
be gagged here and to be not allowed to bring out other
matters.

     I certainly don't want to do so.   All I would ask
is that my learned friend uses some moderation.    He
knows that certain things are beyond dispute, but if he
continues to try to impress the jury that these things
are still open to question, and that it is still open to
suggest there was no alcohol and that there was no
abnormal behaviour and that sort of thing, then we have
to respond.   If we don't it is a totally one-sided
picture presented to the jury.
                                                       105




     Similarly, if anything is said to the jury tomorrow
to suggest that they should disregard the behaviour of
fans in the way it came out, then I would hope that
something will also be said to them as to the reasons
why.   That it is to avoid distress, which I am in entire
agreement with, but that nevertheless there are things
that could be said if we were not trying to avoid
distress.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Hale, what I said - I made it
clear but I will repeat it - what I am quite happy to say
to the jury and what I think is the heart of what we are
talking about is this:  that merely because you have a
fan, a dozen fans, a hundred fans, a thousand fans - it
doesn't matter how many fans - who are either drunk,
obscene, misbehaving, whatever word you wish to use, it
does not reflect on the person about whom they are
talking or making comments about.   That person, that
girl, or woman or man, for that matter, was lying on the
floor, as far as that incident is concerned, totally
innocent.   That is the point.

     I think that is really what the family wants to
hear, isn't it, Mr. King?   Would that be right?

     MR. KING:   Certainly that is part of what they want
to hear. Whether that is all they want to hear, sir, I
wouldn't want to commit myself sitting here.

     THE CORONER:   What I would not be prepared to do,
just so we get this absolutely right as well, I would not
be prepared to go along and say there is no evidence that
fans didn't misbehave, because there obviously is.

     Insofar as that is concerned, I can only go so far.

      MR. KING:    Sir, I could not invite you to do that.
I am referring only to whether or not there are issues as
to the credibility of the witness which could not
possibly be dealt with by you, sir, in an address to the
jury.    That could only be dealt with by recalling the
witness and that is what I...

      THE CORONER:    Yes, I am quite happy with that and
as    I have said to you, I want to be helpful to you in
this.     My main concern is the danger, if you like, of
taking it and blowing it out...

     MR. KING:   I am very aware of that, sir.
                                                          106




     THE CORONER:   Bearing in mind that we are talking
about a particular incident, as opposed to the sum total
of incidents, but I am sure you will give it thought and
I will do my best to be helpful.

     Anybody else on anything else?   No?   Good.   Ten
o'clock then tomorrow.

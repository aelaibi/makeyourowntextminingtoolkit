    Initially only a few football               fans were present who seemed well

    behaved and mostly in search of fast food shops.



    Part of our brief was to direct fans arriving by car to park in s id s

    streets off Middlewood R d .           This we did only once or twice.



    Numerous       fans approached me and asked where they could get a drink.

    Wads ley Ln.        W h e n a \k e d I passed this   information on.   At that time

    I was not aware of any public houses which were open to the supporte

    or chanting and seemed Jin S}j»45d mous'd".          Fans were by this time making

    their way across the juNqctio>*s of Middlewood Rd and Leppings Ln to the

Leppings Ln entrance gate

Between 2 pm (1400) and,3pm (1500) the number of fans approaching the
                       y
ground from the Wa cHs 1 e y ;L n area and Middlewood Rd increased still

more.     Toward J3pn\ (        st of the fans appeared to be drunk some

bo r de r i ng lEHlarunk c^ffid incapaBTe were being he 1 ped to the ground by

fellow f a n s .



Whilst    in that area I noticed that the tops of the walls,       the pavement

and flower beds were heavily littered with beer          cans, wine bottles as

well as   cider and beer   party bottles.



I warned one youth who     I saw place an empty beer bottle beneath the

wheel of a parked car.



Numerous youths/fans had been in the area of the shop fronts and

telephone kiosk, at the junction of Wads ley Ln and Middlewood Rd,            the

whole afternoon drinking beer etc.          These   people did not seem to be

in a hurry to go anywhere.



Throughout the afternoon we were visited on the ground b^'           Senior

Officer, whom I subsequently found out was S u p t . harsj/ayl^:      He seemed

to be keeping an eye on all areas where fans were present.



Just before 3pm (1500)     the flow of spectators to the Leppings Ln

entrance began moving with greater urgency.



At about 3pm (1500)    the junction/^? Middlewood Rd and Wadsley Ln

became much quieter.       POL PS j^odgfrttyand) I walked along Middlewood

POL PS Hodgetts was the only member of my serial to be issued a radio.

This was one of the Old Burndept type.            I was not able to understand

much of what was said      over the radio.



We located our serial      at the junction on Leppings Ln where the Gas

showroom is situated,      some   100 yards from the L eppings Ln   e nt r a n c e .

We could see that the      entrance area was crowded with fans      who were

spilling onto the roadway.         The radio traffic became excited.            The

voice was distorted by the radio and I could not tell most of what was

being said.



I heard an order or request for some gates         to be opened and the word

*catast rophe* used.



We went to the entrance way to the Lepping           yf entrance by which time

the area was almost empty of people of flee          pii horseback were

clearing supporters away from the gates              ds the roadway.



My serial was directed to remain in/the en/rance way and to prevent

further supporters from enter i4ig ^      Fans (mere still arriving      in one's

and t w o ’s.   They were drunk and argumentative.        They were turned

away.



By this time word had reached us that something had occurred             inside

the ground involving the crowd.         Initial   rumour was that five or six

people were believed dead.



Spectators began to leave the ground past our         position.     All appeared

to be in various stages of distress and shock,         most were upset and

angry.      Whilst   leaving the ground many of the fans swore and spat at
                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                      S3099

         us, accusing us of murdering their friends          inside the ground,



         About this time the first ambulances arrived at the Leppings Ln

         entrance escorted by police motorcyclists.              In order to allow the

         ambulances access   into the ground myself and other officers formed a
                                                    /                          *
         cordon along half of the entrance ,^ay.          Due to the large numbers

         leaving the ground we r e m a i n e d / n this/'pojy^ion whilst the ambulance*
                                       /       /'
         were arriving and the ground"''was ennSj^ing.

         At about 5.30pm   ( "17 3 0 ) / 1 went with my serial   to the North Stand inside

         the ground where wjk regrouped and were stood down at 6.15pm              (1815).

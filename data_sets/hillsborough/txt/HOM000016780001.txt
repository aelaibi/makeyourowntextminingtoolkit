You wrote to the Home Secretary on 21 April 1989 enclosing one
from Mr                   about the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster. Miss Bannister, in her letter of 25 April 1989,
mentioned that your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the Inquiry.
I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice Taylor who has
noted it.                              v.

 Qkof
      The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you
for your letter of 21 April, with which you
enclosed a copy of a letter from Mr               ~
          of                        Southport, who
was present in the disaster area at Hillsborough.

      Clearly his evidence needs to be passed on
to the inquiry set up under the chairmanship of
Lord Justice Taylor to investigate the tragic
events at Hillsborough and make recommendations.
I have accordingly forwarded your correspondence
and your    constituent's to Mr Robert Whalley,
Secretary to the inquiry, who can be contacted at
this address.

                                  EVIDENCE HILBOROUGH DISASTER


                    I attach most useful evidence from Mr j___________________ of
                             |Southport., who was present in the disaster area
        (two persons from the fence) and with a dead man in front of him.

                     His   statement   of   timing   must   be   very   relevant   to   the
        enquiry.

                    I shall be pleased if this evidence could be passed to the
        enquiry and acknowledged to myself and to Mr            1, who luckily
        escaped with broken ribs.

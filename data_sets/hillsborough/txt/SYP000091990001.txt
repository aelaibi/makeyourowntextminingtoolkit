Our      duty was     to supervise         the Liver pojirf: s u p p o r t e r s      who we re to arrive

at    the M i d l a n i s ^ ^ a H w a y S t a t i o n ^ S S h e f f i e l d and ensure   that    they were

w ou ld    travel w it h the supporters on each bus                        from the      railway station

to the ground,           and then       return with            the empty bus       to the    station.

Once      the serial       had   conveyed all            the Liverpool          fans from the station

we were      to go to H i l l s b o r o u g h and         report      to the g y m n as iu m as a

reserve       serial.

      O G    ----------
B A T ES and A cting Su^t KING,                  I made my way on foot wit h oU'fer officers

from my s e r i a l / w "t-he M i d l a n d Rai 1way Station,                   to await    the arrival         of

the Liverpool          supporters.



T rains a r r i v e d at      specific       intervals          enabling    the fans       to be e scorted

wi th ou t    s ig nificant      delay to the awaiting                 buses.      I could see that

some of the fans            resented having              to board the       buses      saying    that    they

had come early           in order      to go       into S h e f f i e l d City Centre,          but on the

other      hand,    some    fans a p p r e c i a t e d    the    buses    being    provided      for them,

On boarding         the buses,        fans were a sk ed to pay £.1 for the jour ne y to

the ground and           return journey from the ground back to the station.
                                                                                                   PAGE          3
                                                                                                   S3625

Some of the fans              could not      pay the £1        saying   that    they did not       have

the   cash on them,            therefore       having    to borrow that amount            of money from

their fellow supporters.



At this       time    it was obvious           that aiBtff^fams had been          consuming

a lc oh ol ic     drinks      due to t h e > < a c t i o n s   and mannerisms.         Sp on ta ne ou s

checks were made on t^r                  Pans boarding         the PSVs,    their      hand   luggage

being      checked,        awfany      alc oh ol ic   drink was      confiscated.         In all    I made

a bout     fifteen such          checks on the fans.



Due to my         limited knowledge            of S h e f f i e l d at the time     I cannot      describe

the   route taken by the               buses    from the       railway station to H i l l s b o r o u g h

football         ground.



Wh il st     en route       to the ground from the              station    I was a s k e d on a number

of o ccasions         by the fans          if the bus       could be stopped        in order for          some

of them to use the toilet,                   the fans asking         had been consuming

a lc o ho l ic    drinks as you         could smell         it on their breath.           T hey became

f r us t ra t ed when       I told them that          they would have          to wait    until    they

reached the football                ground.      On the whole        the fans were        in general        of

a high spirit and              looking     forward to the FA Cup Semi Final.



An ot he r    thing    that      became a pp arent was          the number of fans who            had made

the   journey to Sheffield,                  not having an official          ticket     in their

possession.           W hen    I asked them a bout          it they said        that    there w ou ld be

tickets ava il ab le           outside       the ground on the black            market.



It had been a r r a n g e d         that     the PSVs w o ul d drop the fans outside               the

L ep pi n gs Lane end of the ground,                  and they w o ul d then be e sc orted            into

the ground.           As    lunchtime a p p r o a c h e d      I could see that a large           number
                                                                                                        PAGE.        4


of fans had not gone            into the ground and^Jlad in fact                        gone    into the

public h o u s es     close    to the ground.           J r k ns were standing on the pavement

with glasses of beer            in their       hafnds.          Some were     standing         in the    road

causing an o b st r u c t i o n      to Wfe m o t o ri st s using          that    road.



After    dropping      the -fens off at the ground we                     returned to the          railway

s ta ti o n via a different           route    to the one we            took t ravelling          to the

ground.      The     route we took        back     to the station took us                 past Sout^i

Y or ks hi re Police HQ,        Snig Hill and the                "Whole    in the Road"          roundabout.

Due to the heavy traffic               in S h e f f i e l d     city   centre,     the PS V      I was

trav el ling    on was      dela ye d some       time     returning        to the station.              In all

I made about         two to three       journeys        to the ground from the                  station,        on

each occ asion escorting a p p r o x i m a t e l y seventy fans.



About S . 30    pm    (1430)    there were only               police officers           remaining at the

station,     so we were        therefore       instructed to board an a wa iting PSV and

travel     to the ground,         where we were           to     report S \    the gym na si um on our

arrival.       We a r r i v e d at    the gym      inside Hills^rorough at about 2.5 3                        pm

(1455)     and were a l l o c a t e d a meal        for hal^r time.           We then went          for a

hot drink a n d sat down at the tabl e*r laid out                          in the gym.



We had been        in the gym f or /only a matter                  of minutes when a senior

o fficer    came     in a sking      f/6 r extra officers to be made a v a i l a b l e to

attend     inside     the   stadium at the trackside                   of the L ep pi ng s Lane          end of

the ground.



At about 3.05         pm    (1505)    t-'walked down the jxfncrete                 ramp at the          corner

of the ground an d           into the stadium, j^'Xhen made my w a y a long                        the       side

of the     pitch towards        the L e p p i n g ^ l L a n e    terraces.        The    game was       in

progress.       I could see a number of fans on the                         pitch who had come from
                                                                                                  PAGE          5
                                                                                                  S3625

the L ep pi ngs Lane        terraces.



I saw a senior officer             run onto      the      pitch towards        the    referee and

point towards        the goal at L ep pings Lane.



By this time we were a p p r o ac hi ng             the   terraces and so            I ran across       the

corner of the        pitch from the t racks i de towards                  the goal .       More   fans

had   come onto      the    pitch from the          terracing and were walk in g around

looking     confused,       some were       crying.       As   I got to the wire           fencing      I

could see     people       had been    crushed up against              it,    the expres si on s       on

their   faces o b v i ou sl y meant        that a l a r g ^ f m m b e r      of them were       dead.       I

saw one girl who was            dead but had jfTot fallen to the ground a n d was

still   pressed a g a in st      the wi rjrfenc i ng due to the                pressure     of the      fans

pushing     behind     her,    her h^nds had been forced up above                      her h e a d .    A

number of the fans at tine front                 of the terrace had been sick                   over one

another.



The   fans towards         the front       of the    terracing were shouting               that   they

could not move and that             they were being            crushed.        I went    up to the

wire fencing and shou te d to the fans                    to stop      pushing,      and made

g estures    to the fans        to move      back,     but they took          no notice,       there was

too much     panic     in them.       As    I was at the        fgjcKfrng^"I tried       to puli at

it,   but   it would       not give.        I could^See        people     close      to me on the

other side     of the wire         f encimj/who were           blue    in the face and were

o bv io us l y dead.       The f a n s / in their a tt empts           to climb to safety over

the fencing were           cl imjn ng on and over          the de>nl and injured.



I helped fans over            the top of t h e / f e n c i n g , the spikes           on the    top of

the fence were         tearing     their><fiothing and some               of the fans       became

fastened,     but    I pulled tb^m over.               A number       of fans had       received       cuts
                                                                                                   P AGb.      £j

w hilst      climbing     the fence but were            just     relieved that        they had reached

safety.        Once   the fans      had   climbed the fence             I told them to get onto

the    pitch,    but a number        kept walking         up to the fence and try an d get

their       friends   out.



B y now I noticed          that a small        access      gate had been opened           leading from

the    terrace     onto the trackside,            fans were         beginning     to use this as an

a cc e ss    to the   pitch    instead of trying               to   climb the fencing.       I     then

began to help         people      out and        onto   the pitch.  I c o n c en tr at ed on trying
                                                             S
to get the       badly     injured out           onto the jSKfTch.I could see that           some

had stoppejjL b r e a t h i n g , thair

B ec au se    of my a t te mp ts     in trying      to help the         injured a lot of events

w h ic h took     place    inside     the ground were            not observed by me,         I saw

these at a later           time     on the     news.      One    example     of this was     the       line

of officers a cross           the    centre of the         pitch.



Fans were w alking a ro u n d          clutching        their       chests   saying    they had been

crushed a nd were          struggling        to breathe         normally.      I told these           to sit

down and not to keep moving around.



A lot of fans and a number                of     police    officers were walking a ro u n d or

just    standing,       looking as        though they did not know what                 to do.



The    p hotographers        present were         getting       in the way of those        trying to

help.        They were s tepping          over    the dead and         injured,    showing       no

               W hilst       giving        first aid on the                 pitch       I could        hear      fans who were            still

               I cannot           remember        in detail           all    the     people        I helped,          either       over       the

               fencing        or by g iving             them the kiss              of     life,      but       one   boy    I can     remember

               due    to the fact             I st ay ed wit h          him for          some      time.



               The boy was a g e d a bout                  14 years and w e a r i n g a home jcf'ive r pool                         shirt

gym na s iu m where       the     injured were       being treated.          On arrival     at the      gym

I saw that half of              it had been turned              into a m or tu ar y and that there

were a large number               of bodies       laid out.



After     putting the boy down              I told the          supporters who    had helped me to

leave and thanked them for                  their    help.        I then    called a fireman over

to me who was           carrying an oxygen           cylinder,       the boy then       received some

more air.



At this       point a man         came    over    to me and       introduced himself as being a

Doctor.          He   e xa mined the boy and         told me that he needed to go to

hospital         immediately.          I left the boy with the Doctor                and went   to    look

for an ambulance,              after     finding    one    I returned to the         gym with the

a mb u la n ce    crew and the boy was             then    placed onto a stretcher and

carried to the ambulance.                   He was       then    conveyed to hospital.



I returned to            inside    the ground via the             concrete    ramp an d went    over       to

the Le pp ings Lane            terrace,     on arrival          I saw that the vast m a j o r i t y of

fans     had been eva cu at ed from the              terrace,       and    people were    clearing        the

a d v e r t i si ng   boards    from the        pitch.



There were            not any fans       that    I could see who were          requiring any help

in terms of first aid so                  1 therefore       began to       look for other    officers

from my serial.             I met up with PS7 FLACK                by the    concrete    ramp leading

into     the ground from the gymnasium.



Along with my serial               I made my way to the awaiting PSVs                   in order     to

convey the Liverpool               fans    back    to the M i d la nd      railway stat io n from the

ground.          The PSVs were         lined up a p p r o x i m a t e l y half a mile     from the
g round.



I bo ar de d a PSV and wa it ed for the fans to                  come.       We w a i t e d for about

f ifteen m inutes and then              left for    the   railway station.          The    bus was     by-

no m eans      full.       On the bus     I was    t ravelling   on,     one of the       fans   had a

small    t ransister         radio w h ic h was    tuned to a sport          programme.      This

p rogramme was           con ti nu ou sl y updating    the number      of dead and        injured?

this    only he 1 ped to fuel           the supporters      bitterness and anger             towards

the    police.



The    bus took a long          time    returning     to the   railway station due to the

heavy traffic            leaving   the area of the ground.



On arrival         at the station the fans were             escorted onto         their a wa iting

t rai ns and s u b s eq ue nt ly       left.    We then a w a i t i e d the arrival        of fur the r

s up po rt er s at the station.



A fter all         the   supporters     had    left the station?       my serial      made    our way

back to West Bar Police S t a ti on for de— b r i e f i n g .                We a r r i v e d at about

7.13    pm   (1915)       and we d e -b ri ef ed by Supt BATES.           After    the de­

briefing , along wit h other              officers     from Att er cl if f e Police Stat i o n ,

we made      our way back and went              off duty at 8.00       pm.      (2000)



The    times       referred to     in this s tatement are ap pr ox im at e as             I did not

make    comprehensive          pocket    book entries      of events      leading up to my

a c ti v it i es    inside    the ground.

                            Re: Hr. and Mrs. Church.

                            I have been approached by Mr. and Mrs. Church who are gravely concerned
                            about the quality of legal representation afforded to them by certain
                            local solicitors.
                                                                                                             j!
                            I understand that they have been in communication with you for a ,             ■:J
                            considerable period of time and quite frankly they feel that very
                            little, if any progress has been made in this matter.

                            I would impress upon you the urgency of the situation given that the
                            Hillsborough Inquests are due to commence on 19th November. Without
                            wishing to pre-empt any decision which you may reach, it appears likely
                            that you will advise Mr. and Mrs. Church to instruct yet a further legal
                            representative in the light of their allegations against their present
                            solicitor. I should be grateful, therefore, if you would proceed as
                            expeditiously as possible.

                             Yours faithfully,




                              Councillor Harry Chase,
                              Chair, Hillsborough Working Party.

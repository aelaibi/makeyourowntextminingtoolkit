Dear Sir

We have been    consulted by the above named in connection with his claim
for damages for personal injury and loss sustained during the afternoon

From the information presently in our possession       it appears the that
the injuries    sustained by our client were caused as     a result of the
negligence of yo uf your servants or agents and/or breaches of statutory
duty and/or the operation of the defective systems of working and we
have advised our client that in the circumstances he is entitled to
receive compensation for the injuries and loss sustained.

We shall be     glad to                     hearfrom you                      that         liability                is        admitted and        that
damages will be paid.

Yours faithfully

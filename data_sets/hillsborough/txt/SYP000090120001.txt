            quarters        full.        I could see at that            time    that    the terracing             on the

            sides of the ground was                 less full.

            At about 2.30           pm    (1430)    a man who was          s tanding     behind the          crash

            barrier and just             to my     right hand side started to urinate,                        because          of

            this myself and                        decided       to move    our    position.         We     could see

            from     position       number    one    1 that       there was a space at               the    front       of    pen

            number       three     in the    corner       by the dividing         fence     s eparating           pen number

            three     from pen number             two.

            Myself and                    m ov ed down to this            position w h ic h      I have marked as

            number two 2 on the separate                       grid plan.       It took     us about         two minutes

            to work        our w ay down to this               position,    we moved forwards               down

            the terraces           and through the             crowd without any         particular          difficulty.

            We got down to           p osition number            two 2 at about 2.32            pm    (1432).           I was

            standing        up a ga in st    the front          perimeter      fence,    between me and the

            d i v i d i n g fence    of pens 3 and 2 on my right                   hand side was a man and a

            small     lad who was         only about           nine or ten years         old.                     was

            standing        next    to me on my          left hand side.

            1 can remember the players running out onto the pitch for their kick

            about,       be tw ee n 2.32     pm    (1432)      and this time        pen number         three       had been

            g r ad ua ll y filling        up and at this           time    I could not move my               position but

            I did not feel           uncomfortable.              By this time                   had m oved from the

            front     fence w hen someone            had       pushed    in infront      of him and he was                   now

            standing        i mm ed ia te ly behind my           left    shoulder      right    next       to me,       the man

               and as they did this                  the    pressure         d ecreased slightly but              I was    still

               pushed up against               the     perimeter           fence and     1 c o u l d n ’t move.      At this

               point     it was       u n co mf or ta bl e      but the       crush w a s n ’t so bad that            it worried

               me.      The    little       lad who was standing                to my       right had started            crying.

               1 cannot        say what        caused this first               surge     but the        pressure ar ou nd me

               was gr ad ua ll y          increasing.                        had now moved sligh tl y he was                still

               standing        behind me        but was         now standing          behind my         right shoulder,          the

               game kicked off there was a n o t h e r V s u r g e which was very strong,                                  this

               surge     increased the             p r es sure abound me quite                d r a m at ic al ly an d because

               of this        I was       having     dS^f f i c v y ity   b r e a t h i n g , I could only breath          in

               short     quick    breaths.            The     little        boy to my       right hand side was now

               screaming.         This       second surge at kick off                    time was just a dramatic

               forwards m ov ement and as best as                           I can tell      no backwards movement

               to relieve        the       pressure.

               At     this    time just after              kick off there were               policemen standing on the

               track     on the other           side       of the fence,            they were     looking down at us and

               everyone was           shouting at them things                   like             the fence        down*    ’get us

             had gone v^ry white,               I can't        say what     happened to her,          I can only

here    get him o u t .*              I can remember       seeing Bruce GRO HA BL ER           leaving

his goal.           I believe          this was when the game           had been stopped.

S om et im e   between the game             being stop pe d and 3.15 pm             <1515)       I got    to a

position where             I was       pushed up against          the front     perimeter        fence and

the dividing             fence    of    pens 3 and 2 was up against my                right      shoulder.

As far as          I can remember          it was about 3.20           pm <1520)     w he n    I ma na ge d

to get out          of    pen number       three there/was          suddenly some         space around

me and       I climbed up the             perimeter /fence and over the dividing                    fence

into    pen number          two.        I cannot Joe    precise about         the   time      I got out of

the    pen but       I can say t h a C ”at/that            time    there was an a m b u la nc e         on the

track       behind the Liverpool             goal.

I got       into    pen number          two and the Police          rushed me out onto            the

pitch.         1 got out onto the pitch a nd I lay down on my back for

a bo ut 5 m inutes          to get my breath back.                 I was   upset at       this    time

and    crying.

W hi ls t    I was       lying    on the    pitch    I think       it was a police wo ma n         came

over    to me and a sked               if I was    okay.     I said     I was    okay and she went

som ew he re       else.

After       I had got my breath back at about 3.45                         pm <1545)      I went    to    look

for                 I saw a lot of          people     lying on the         pitch some were

receiving          first aid others          I saw were       not and       I s u s p ec te d they were

probably dead.              I c o u l d n ’t describe any of these              bodies at this

time     I was      very upset and was anxious                to find

E ve n t u a l l y at about 4.00           pm after wan de ri ng ar ou nd the             pitch    in a

daze     I found                      standing    on the    pitch at the L ep pings Lane                end by

the N or th Stand.               We    just tood talking          for about     five minu te s      I was

still       very upset.

               It was       then at about 4.05 pm           <1603)    we saw some fans         running up

               towards       the Spion Hop end of the ground,                 we   realised they were

              going to get an a d v e r ti si ng           hoarding    to   carry    injured      people      on so

              went and j oined them,

              We   ripped an a d v e r t i s e m e n t    hoarding    o f / ' from the mi ddle of the Spion

              H op end of the ground and m e ,                         and about 4 other           fans      ran

               back across       the     pitch wit h the hoarding           towards    the L ep pi ng s Lane             end

              of the ground.

              When we got to a point               near    to the    corner    of the L ep pings Lane end

              goal    18 yard box on the S o ut h S t an d s^de               of the ground we          placed

              the hoarding         down on the       pitch.

              About     five or six of us all             supporters,       then helped      pick a body up

c o < v / b i a ^ off the    pitch and     place    it oij/the hoarding.            We helped the         fans

SHOsl/lviSr lift the hoarding up and thffey started to run off towards the Spion
VrSiMu
            K op end of the ground wi^h the h oarding we let go of the hoarding

              because we thought            there were       plenty of fans         carrying      it.     I can't

               remember m uch about          the    body we    put on the hoarding           other      than he was

              a white        male aged about 25 to 30 years and he m ay have                      had blonde

              hair,     I    can remember his face was          very pale.          I c a n ’t say      if   he was

              alive     or dead,       the only thing        I can    remember about        his    clothing         is

              that    he had on either a white               shirt    or jacket,      1 think      it was      open at

              the front        exposing     his    chest and    I think       he was wearing        blue      jeans.

              After     this we just w a l k e d over         to the    line of      policemen w h i c h were

              stood a cross        the    centre    line of the       pitch.       I was   still    upset at this

               time and       I said to one of the           policemen,       "Why a r e n ’t you h e l p i n g ” he

               replied s omething          like    “we have got our         o r d e r s .“Next we went and sat

               down on       the track     by the South S ta nd for about            10

              mi nutes       we we re by a t e l ev is io n   came ra man who was          in a kind         of     dug

               0ut.

               1 think we went           out of the ground at about 4.20               prn <1620),        we just
                                                                                                          PAGE           9

left of our own accord.                    We went     out through a small               tunnel       between

the N orth S tand and the West Stand and                          left through          the L ep pings Lane

entrance wit h a lot of other                   supporters.

I never      saw any bodies            out by the area between the West S tand and the

L ep pi ng s Lane       turnstiles.

Although       I am now awara              that a barrier         broke     in pen number          three      1 was

not aware        of    it breaking         until     I heard about          it on the         telev is io n       news

after     returning          Horne later      the same day.

I did not        p ersonally witness            any deaths         on that day a l t h o u g h          I did sea

a   lot of bodies at             the ground         I cannot describe any d ec eased

persons any further                 than   I have a l r ea dy done          in my s t a t e m e n t .




D uring    the    course        of that a f t e r n o o n    I did not        see a ny th in g w hich         I

co nsidered to be a criminal                   offence.

The    points     I w o ul d     like to make about             the way >sfie incident was                handled

after     the m a tc h was          stopped    is that       I w as > s n n o y e a   that    loud speaker

a n n ou n ce m en ts were       not made      to    infprm ^ans what was               o ccurring also            I

d o n ’t think        that    the    police    handled the s ituation at all well                       they

just    d i d n ’t seem to know what                to do.

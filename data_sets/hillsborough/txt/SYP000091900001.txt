            On Saturday 15 April             1989 (150489)    I was part of the policing

comments of a general nature.



The part of the operation for which I wafs responsible consisted mainly

of several         police personnel     c a r r i e s containing teams of officers who

patrolled the city centre read^/to respond to any reports of incidents

involving football         supporters.          In addition offi/ers were deployed on

foot at various         prominent   locations      in the cityycentre.         All officers

were instructed to meal at West Bar Police Station after/3.00 pm

(1500), in other words w h i 1st the football match was / n                   progress

patrolled in an unmarked car driven by PC916 BRADLEY



Initially the city cent re was quiet.                After midday     (1200)     some

reports of football         supporters causing trouble were received.                    Most

of these concerned supporters who had entered city centre public

houses.      I was present in the Wicker and Nursery Street when officers

cleared groups of supporters out of public                houses    in that     area and set

them on their way to Hillsborough Football                Ground.     Most of the

supporters         I spoke to were Nottingham Forest fans.            There was         little

real trouble and I saw no arrests made.



After ^.00 pm (1500)         I returned to West Bar Police Station and went to

the Senior Officers Mess whefe I mealed with A/Superintendent KING
          a/ / T
and Inspector BEEDEN. \ / A few moments after this we learned that

Operation Support had been called at thpe^ Football Ground.



A/Superintendent KING,         In s p e c t g X BEEDEN and myself made a conscious

   ision not to attend b            e   w   e   knew we may be needed in the city

centre.       We were aware that some of our mobiles had already attended

the Ground.          Others were in the canteen at West Bar Police Station

and had not yet attended.               Again we decided to retain these           in case
                                                                       PAGE          3
                                                                       S3616

they were needed in the city centre.        After this we monitored the

Hillsborough radio channel on a personal       radio and gradually realised

the enormity of the tragedy.        We also realised that Superintendent

BATES was now detained at the ground and no longer       in a position to

command the city centre operation.



A/Superintendent KING,     Insp

Superin te nde nt ’s office at                                                   e

situation.      It was decided                       overall   command and

remain in the Control Room                       ce Station       woul d

command of policing at the        ■Qland Station and Mr BEEEnZn would take

command of the city ce            We also decided to contact the shift of

officers due to come on at 6.00 pm <1800) and ask them to come on

immediately.     We also contacted all    city centre public houses via the

’P ub wa tc h’ scheme and ask them to close un ti 1 further notice.        The

Control Room were instructed to perform both these tasks.           I then

went to the Midland Station.        At first few officers were available to

me and I asked for more to be provided as soon as possible.

Gradually officers who had been on patrol       in the city centre but had

responded to the    ’Operation Support* were released from the ground and

were   re-deployed to the Midland Station.      Gradually football    fans

arrived in varying numbers from'the ground and boarded trains.             They

were subdued,   even shocked and there was no trouble.



Finally when all supporters had departed I returned to West Bar Police

Station and spent my time talking to and counselling officers who were

distressed.

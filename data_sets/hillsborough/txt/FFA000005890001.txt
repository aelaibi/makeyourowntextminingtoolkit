Draft insert into                    letter

"We consider that jj                       s comments at

paragraph 52 under the heading "Poor Leadership” of the

Final Report concerning the FA and FL are unfair,       ^orofe

                Ifmada no comment in his Interim Report as to

any FA "obligation" to offer guidance to clubs on safety

m a t t e r s , although the Interim Report deals primarily with

questions of causation for which he completely absolved the

FA of responsibility under the heading "Chapter 17 the FA's

choice of ground".     Similarly if there was in the Judge's

mind any criticism that can be levelled at the FA or FL for

failure to advise it was never put to either body at the

Inquiry,    or subsequently.   The FA has limited powers it can

exercise in relation to crowd control and safety which are

set out in paragraphs 2.4 to 2.5 of the Joint Submission to

                         The respective responsibilities of

police,    club, and local authority under the supervision of

your Department have been fully set out in the

R e p o r t s , especially paragraphs 3.4 to 3.8 (Interim) and 4.13

to 4.19    (Final), were accepted at the                   I and

are accepted in practice by all those involved in the game.

The FA and FL do not have the technical expertise to give

detailed advice as to the safety structures required at

football grounds, neither have they the specific powers to

regulate or enforce compliance with safety standards as set
 by the aforementioned bodies.       However,   in the light o f s

                 '   criticism we are considering areas in which

 the FA can provide new ideas, resources and assistance to

 promote safety within the game.



 After " ..... hooliganism" on P. 2      "and we would welcome a

 discussion as to how we may coordinate and assist in the

 implementation of the measures and monitor compliance with

 them".

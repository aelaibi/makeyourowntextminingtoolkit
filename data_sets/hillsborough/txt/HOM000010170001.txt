W   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

    Thank you for your letter of 20 April enclosing prompt and
    comprehensive reports about Hillsborough.  I note you have copied
    these to Mr Dear.

    Despite the formal and professional tone of the witness statements
    by your officers, the experience can only have been a distressing
    one. Might I offer my sympathies to all those involved.

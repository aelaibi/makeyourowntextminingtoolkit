           vehicles seats either had been removed or they w e r e n ’t fitted and the

           fans were sat on crates of       beer,

           Some evidence was found of       fans anticipating our       search and consuming

           their stocks of alcohol      before arriving       in the county.    On searching

           one minibus, a large box which at one time            contained cans of lager was

           found.     Inside the box was a note which said something to the

           effect,    "You got us last year you bastards,        this time we've got y o u ” .

           The amount of empty cans lying on the floor of the van indicated they

           had already drunk     it all.

 ^         The Serial    continued to stop and search vehicles throughout the

           morning, and a number of offenders were reported on summons for

           various matters.      As the kick-off time approached,         the number of

           vehicles    coming through the village began to diminish and at 3»OP pm

           (•1300 hrs) that afternoon we arrivjrtf'at the Claywheels Ln Traffic Post

           for meal break.        5-0                          OF   POUiO£.

           A hot meal had been provided and was being served from a mobile

           catering unit. Serial 44 and a number of others were queueing for

           meals when we were redirected to the Leppings Ln             end of the    Ground.

           We travelled to the Ground       in the transit that had been assigned to



                                                                                          y l 'J t

         our detail;    on doing so we were under the impression that we were

         attending a large fight.         On arrival we all      1ejFJ^iThe vehicle and were

S.O.fi   directed by an Inspector to form a looseyrordon across the entrance to

         the Ground.     We remained as directe^^for only a short time?             perhaps

         five minutes at the most.            Djtiriijxf that time I was approached by a

         number of angry fans wanting to gain entry to the Ground;              they were

         very agitated and to differing degrees,            displaying all the usual signs

         associated with drunkenness.

         About that time I was aware of two middle-aged men leaving the Ground.

         They walked between me and another Officer?             both were crying.     As they

         passed me,    one said,     "You ’ve fucking killed     them you bastard". They

         continued to walk away from the Ground.             I then began to think that

         maybe something other than a fight had occurred.

         At that point an ambulance arrived at that location and another

         Inspector approached us from inside the Ground and told us to get

         inside and help.      Still    I did not know what had happened or what           I was

         to help with.     However,     on passing through the gate,       it became

         obvious?   I saw about 4 or 5 people lying on           the Ground being

         resuscitated by St. Johns staff and members             Jt
                                                                 q    the public.

S jb.£   I made my way, against a flood of supportj^s             running towards me,      into

         the tunnel.     Inside the tunnel        the sce/fe was of panic and confusion

         and it was difficult to fight through the crowd to enter the Ground.

         QxV erne rg i ng from the   tunnel    into the stadium there    is a metal fence,

         iot many people were in the left hand side but the right side was a

         seething mass of people,

         I entered the right hand sidy of that terrace and approached a number

         of casualties who were apparently dead.             I must have attended five or

         six dead males,     all kbsmt twenty years of age, and decided that they

         should be left where they were and that the best thing to do was to

         continue to search for someone who would benefit from First Aid the

              most

              On the steps of the terrace           I found a man in his mid to late thirtiei

* = > v & j£ c r who w a s n ’t breathing?   he was unconscious but a pulse could be felt.            I
TO   Vi £ W
              rendered artificial        respiration using a Force issue protection device.

TO            I was joined after a short time by a supporter who stated that he was

              a nurse and he took over resuscitation while                I performed heart

              massage.     Despite this,       the man failed to         respond and the nurse

              stopped.     We placed the m a n ’s jacket over his head.

              By then a large number of Officers were engaged in the removal of

              bodies.     It was apparent that all the victims wj>a^would respond to

              First Aid had been moved from that area, ^ ^ j o i n e d them and we formed
                                               ^                           n /i u g
              a chain,    passing bodies along /         I re ca ll   an Officer with a loud hailer

              standing on the perimeter fencing directing this operation.                  I cannot

              recall how many bodies           I assisted in moving but would estimate around

              ten.

              On several occasions           I was aware of fans on the balcony above us

              throwing things at us,          part ic ul ar ly, coins.    A torrent of verbal abuse

              was    continual and to some extent,         distressing.

              When the terracing had been cleared I went onto the pitch and was

              trying to assist the distressed people wandering around it in a daze.

              Almost all my efforts in that regard were                  rejected out of hand by fans

              who for that moment blamed anyone            in a uniform personally       for what had

              happened.

              After what seemed an eternity,           an announcement was made over the P.A.

              system that the match would be replayed and appeal                 for calm was made.

              Soon afterwards the members of my Serial who had entered the Ground

              (not all did)      left and returned to the transit van on Leppings Ln.

              We resumed mobile patrol           in the immediate area on Public Order duties.

              At 7.00 pm (1900 hrs) we returned to Claywheels Ln and returned to

              Doncaster at 8.30 pm (2030 h r s ) when I retired from duty.

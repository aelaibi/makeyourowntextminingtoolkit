HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

Thank you for sending me a copy of your note of 4 May to
Mr Yates, about the costs of the Hillsborough Inquiry.   I am
content to leave to Finance Division the tactical approach to the
amount which should now be put in to the revised subhead.   I am
intending to review our estimate of expenditure in early July -
by then we should have a clearer picture of how things will
actually turn out.

2.   My main purpose in writing is to put on record that I have
not agreed to £100,000 being released from subhead H.3. Whilst
the Fire Service College, in its FIS returns, projected an
underspend on capital spending for vehicles, etc, it projected a
corresponding overspend of £100,000 for capital spending on
building.  This item has therefore been presented as "savings
offered" in error.

3.   In discussion with Mr McAdam and Mr Clayton on the afternoon
of 4 May I agreed that no action need be taken to adjust the
figures in view of the very close deadlines which were being
faced. Your division wished to get these matters on their way
and I had no desire to bring up last minute difficulties.
Nonetheless, I wish to have on the record that this £100,000 from
Fire Department capital spending is not, in fact, on offer.
Mr Clayton has agreed that we will look elsewhere within
Mr Moriarty's budget to find a further contribution.

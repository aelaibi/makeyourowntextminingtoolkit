                                     perhaps         understandable                   due       to    obvious        lack       of

                 many        police         constables           st ill         apparently            considered            it    to       be

                 human        barrier          across       the       centre            line    of    the    ground         in

                 towards           the      "kop"     end       of    the       stadium.             It was       not

                 stretchers               made      from    the       advertising               hoardings          around         the

                 ground were                used     to    carry          the     injured and           dying        people

                 out - t h e s e            stretchers           were          in the      main       carried        by-

                  spectators.

                 This        in    itself        caused         some        s^nfusion           and would          not      have

as     was    the    case       on    that       day.



Because        of    l ar g e    number          of    constables             on d u t y        there must

necessarily arise                    questions             relating          to w h e r e    those          constables            were

drawn        from,       what    specific             training             they    had    for     this       occasion and

indeed what              experience            they        had,       and      what      was their training                 -

including           co-ordination                of    the       event         p rior     to the       start       of,       during

and after           the    game.



Concerning           the    Senior          Officers             —    it w o u l d     appear       t h at at          le a s t    one

of     the m o s t       senior       officers             on d u t y       had    only     recently           been

appointed           to    the    post       and       indeed          had    spent       most     of    his      career           in

the P o l i c e      Academy          and      had     very          little       experience           of    crowd        control.

Another        officer          was    investigated                   during       the T o x t e t h        r i o ts    for

decisions           which       he    t oo k     then,       which          had    similar        characteristics

to     the    events       of    13 A p r i l .



Th e    police       I believe            did     h av e      so me        sway with        the     in i t i a l       ticket

allocation           avid a l s o      the       part       of       the    ground       which would             be     occupied

by     the    different          s et s     of    spectators.                  I. b e l i e v e   t ha t     t h is     area       needs

thorough        examination               in     light        of      the    statements           made       earlier          and

relating        to       statistical             evidence             available          with     regards          to     crowds

and     the    la rge      attendances                at    matches          in L i v e r p o o l      and Nottingham

and     also    the       specific:         complaint                w h i c h was      lodged      by L i v e r p o o l

Football        Club       regarding             the       allocation             of    tickets.




Questions           must    certainly             be a s k e d as            to w h y     the     side       streets          were

                 I was       then        v i s i t e d at     rny o f f i c e     in S h e f f i e l d    by two      Detective

w o u 1d state           that    the     two    officers           were     thorough          i n thi s i n t e r v i e w         and

I have        no    complaint          in     respect       of     their     actions          but      I had        reservations

regarding           the    questionnaire             and      the    manner        in w h i c h        t he    questions          were

f r a rned.

Such      were      my    concerns          regarding         this     t h at     I wrote          a    let t er     dated 22nd

I am      concerned         no w w i t h       the    speed        at w h i c h    the      enquiry           is    proceeding

and      I question whether                   all    the    earliest         features          regarding             this

disaster           will    be    put     to    the    enquiry.

My      report      which       I ask       from     part     of my       statement           of       evidence          highlights

my      observation         of     the      disaster        and my        views     in      respect           of    what       should

h av e    been      done.        I would        point       out     that     my    criticisms             of       the

management           is    based       on m y       experience         as    a Senior          Manager             with    a

Masters        Degree        in O r g a n i s a t i o n a l      Management         albeit             within       the

Dear Sir,

I find it most disgusting to hear that certain members of the
Police Force on duty at Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989 are
to be able to claim monies in compensation for distress caused to
the said officers.

That terrible day several friends and I travelled to Sheffield for
the game, one of our party MR. ALAN JOHNSTON was not to return.
Before the game Liverpool Football Club and its supporters made
clear to the Police Authorities that conditions and arrangements
for the tie were totally unsuitable, obviously aware of the
unacceptable situation the Police and F.A. had forced upon us, in
exactly the same game the previous year. Unfortunately our worries
were to be proven fatally correct!

My deceased friend's family and fiancee,
                         have found the situation almost impossible
to come to terms with,       '
                                                     I myself was unable
to accept the events of April 15th 1989,




We now find the very people with whom Lord Justice Taylor laid the blame
of that day, are to benefit financially from their negligence. People
whom, if there so called distress caused them time off duty, will not
have lost any money. People whom by the very nature of their chosen
profession must surely accept distress as part and parcel of their
everyday duties.

May I add in closing that none of our party that day have received nor
do we wish to receive any payment for our distress, which I assure you
must be more genuine and heartfelt than any of your on duty, paid officers
suffered as a result of that day.

I for one do not wish to take a nice holiday or may be buy a new car
to relieve my distress at Alan's expense.

Yours faithfully,

    Dear Sir

    Your letter dated the 20 April 1990 has been bought to my attention in the
    absence of Assistant Chief Constable Mr Mervyn Jones.

    This is not a matter upon which I can comment but I have forwarded your
    letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police as the content is
    applicable to his force.

    Yours faithfully

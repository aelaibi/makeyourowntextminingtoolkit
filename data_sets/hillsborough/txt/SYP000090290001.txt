             club supporter all my life.  I am a member of the Deeside Liverpool

             Supporters Club, and through the club I got a £6 terrace ticket for

             the FA Cup semi final on 15th April                1989 (150489) at Hillsborough in

             Sheffield.           I travelled to Sheffield on a coach with the other members

             of the club.              We left Hollywell at about         10.00 (1000).

             We travelled on the motorway and arrived                 in Sheffield at     about 2.00 pm

             (1400)         We had no real delay on       the route.

             Ws parked in             a side street with a lot of         other Liverpool    coaches. I

             d o n ’t remember seeing any Police officers where we parked the coach

             but anyway I knew which way #o go to the ground.

             I walked with                          bate from                                       I
                                                                                        PAGE

               remember we went to a shop near the ground for a pie to eat and I

               suppose we got to the ground at about 2.30 pm.         (1430)

               I d o n ’t remember seeing or being checked b y the Police on my way to
   L~U.
               the ground and when I arrived the/4 were just a mass of fans outside

               the turnstile-     These were people with stand tickets and terrace

               tickets and none of us couhi/find out which turnstile to go to.            The

'feuof-        only Police I saw were^sotj>© on horses but they just a ppeared to be

               trapped in the crowd.

               Nothing seemed to be happening we stood for ages but the fans did not

               seem to be moving.

               It got to about 2.50/55 pm (1459 ^ ~f 1455) when I saw a lot of people

 c a t         going to the side of the turnstile and I guessed that a gate had been

               opened w e both went to the /ate and with a        lot of other people we
  'c J
              went through the gate.        Tftere were Police and stewards just inside the
C £ O n £D
               gate but we were not p e p p e d ,   just allowed to go in.     There were a lot

               of fans who went through with us at the same time.

              Once   inside the ground we went straight for the tunnel as you could

               see the pitch and my main concern was to get in and see the match.               I

               did not look to see if there wene any signs to say which way to go,              I

               just went for the obvious way/in and that appeared to be the tunne l.
 c ^ r
               I c a n ’t remember seeing any/Pol ice officers or stewards in the area of

           the tunne 1.
^>T7\N£> '--------------
           At the end of the tunnel we went just to the left into what               I now know

             /Vto be pen 4.     We took up a position about     1/3 (one third)    of the way

               down the pen towards y h e    left hand side.    At that time it would be

               just before 3.00 £m./(1500)

  / 1          Very shortly after we got to the posi ton I have described the crush

               was so severe I just could not move.         I d o n ’t remember any surges it

               was just a very tight crush.

               As the match started I lost             and I started to see fans    climbing
                                                                               PAGE     3
                                                                               S345S
Ca t
out of the pen both ove/ the -front and side fences.             People were

shouting out to t^e J ^ o lice to help them and for the fans to get back,

As people got out over the fence it seemed to get a little less

crushed and I was able to get to the fence at the left of the pen I

was in.     There wasf a big bloke the other side of the fence and he was

helping fans to/climb over.          He helped me to climb up and over the

fence into t h / next pen.        From there I wa s able to get onto the pitch

through t h V ^ f r o n t gate.

Once on the pitch I saw lots of fans just laying on the pitch being

at t e n d e d to by other fans and St J/shns ambulance     people.     I walked

aromro looking for/people         I kney/and I   eventual. l\/met tip with

                                                                   and I think

                 who were all members of our supporters         club.

We discussed what we should do and it was decided to try to help the
         Ca t
fans.  We got advertising boards and jus^c put people on them and ran

with them across the pitch to the corner at the other end by the kop.

As far as I remember all the people and there would be between 5 and

7, were alive but I would not be able to describe any of them in

detail.     They were all males both young men and older ones.               The lads

I have mentioned stuck together and carried the advertising boards

t o ge th er.

When we got the casualties to the corner by the Hop they were taken

over by ambulance staff or Police.

It seemed to quieten down and we eventually found no more people to

carry,    I c a n’t say what time it was as I lost all track of time.

Eventually we all        left the ground together I don't know for what

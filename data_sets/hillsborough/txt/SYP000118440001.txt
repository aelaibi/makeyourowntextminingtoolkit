            At 8.00am <0800)      on Saturday,    13 A p r i l , 1989 <150489)   I paraded for

            duty at the gymnasium,         NilIsbo rough Football Stadium, where         I

            assisted with minor administrative duties.             I had previously been

            informed that my main duties for the day would involve the recording

            and custody of property taken from the supporters at the                  "Liverpool

            side of the ground,         i e . the Leppirigs Lane end of the Stadium assisted
               L.



            by Police Constable Campbell.

            Shortly after my arrival at the ground I was briefed by Inspector

            Bennett and di rected to a Portacabin which was situated at the rear

            of the West s t a n d , adjacent to the fence that runs from the rear of

            the turnstiles     1— 9 and Gate A to the North st a nd .       The cabin was

            situated approximately 4 yards from the gate in the fencing allowing

            access to and from the West stand enclosure, with the door facing

            that gate.    The window to the left of the cabin looked out on to the

            rear of turnstiles     1—9 and A, the window to the right looked out onto

            the ladies toilet situated at the far left of the West stand.

            Following the briefing in the North stand, myself and Police

            Constable Campbell went to the Portacabin and were involved in

            preparation for 12 noon when the turnstiles were opened.

            Once the turnstile® had opened I could see th^t a steady stream of
supporters were coming through the turnstiles to the North st a n d .

At approximately 2.35pm ( 1435)      Inspector White entered the Portacabin

followed by PC Graham Wright,       of E'1 Sub Division,   he was carrying a

boy of 13-14 years who was in a collapsed state,           the boy was

c 1utching a ’Ventolin*     inhaler and I was aware that this was

medication for asthma sufferers.         After using his medi cation,    the boy

recovered slowly nad I was engaged in conversation with a man aged

about 20-24 years who was looking after him and another boy of

similar a g e .    I can recollect 1ook i ng at my watch and saying that it

was 2.40pm    (1440) and there was still     pienty of time for them to get

in.    He said    ’It is murder out on Leppings Lane and people are being

crushed".     AFter 5 to 10 minutes the boy had recovered sufficiently

to walk and they left the cabin.

Whilst    I was in the cabin with the young boy I was aware from the

radio traffic that extreme problems had developed outside the

tuinstiles and I heard requests for the gates to be opened, although
  I
I did not hear who made the request.         Also, around this time Gate A

began to ’b o u n c e " and it looked as if it was about to col lapse

inwardly.     I   noticed that a further serial of men had lined up at

the rear of Gate A supervised by Sergeant Higgins.

People at this time were coming through the turnstiles           in a very

distressed condition and also very slowly.

At 2.50    (1450) - 2.55pm <1455)    I saw that Gate A was being opened by

police officers and supporters streamed through.           This was shortly

followed by fans attending at the gate        in the fence dissecting the

North stand entranee and the West stand enclosure requesting entry

into the West stand.       Conversley,   fans were approaching from behind

with     North stand    tickets wanting access through the gate      into the

North stand entrance.       This was constant for approximately 5 minutes

and the stewards on that gate began to get flustered and I was
vetting the tickets for them and getting them through in both

directions.     Events settled down and I then heard a radio message

requesting all available manpower to report to the front of the West

stand terrace on the playing area.          I locked the Portacabin and

remained outside.       There were still a few fans wishing to get through

the gate.

I was then aware of constant radio traffic and I believe         it was Chief

Inspector Sumner       requesting that a temporary mortuary should be set

up,    this was shortly followed by fans reappearing      in the enclosure of

the West stand and one in particular         looked to be in a very

distressed state and was being aided by some other supporters.            PC

Campbell went to him and after a few minutes         indicated that an

ambulance was required.         I attempted to contact the control to

request an ambulance but because of the constant t raf f i c I was unable

to get t h ro u gh .

I told PC Campbell       that   I would go down to the gymnasium or Police

Roam and request one from th e r e .      I ran down under the North stand

and I could see through the entrances what appeared to be hundreds of

supporters and police officers on the field of play.

When I reached the gym the St. John Ambulance had gone and personnel

were    in the process of clearing the gym of tables and chairs.

Outside the gym was Inspector Martin and his serial awaiting

instructions,     I quickly obtained two officers from him with the

intention of carrying the injured man being cared for by PC Campbell

back to the gym area to await an ambulance.

I went with the officers back to the West stand enclosure but PC

Campbell and the injured man had disappeared.          I released the two PCs

to return to their serial and I remained outside the portacabin.               At

this time there were many supporters milling about the enclosure with

some hurling abuse       in my direction,   as I was at that time the only

         officer there.       I noticed that the stewards who had been manning the

         gates had removed their fluorescent waist coats.

         PC Campbell      returned to me and informed me that she had got some

         supporters to carry the man outside because she had heard the

         ambulances travelling along Leppings Lane and that they had laid the

         man alongside some who were obviously dead.         She then informed me

         that she was a member of the Casulaty Bureau and I directed her to

         the gym.

         From that time supporters we re returning to the portacabin to

         retrieve the i r property,   fla gs, banners,   penknives,   etc. and after

         that   procession had ceased I cleared the property and returned to the

         g y mna si um.

         It was only at that stage did I realise the full extent of the

         disaster when I saw the number of bodies on the gymnasium f l o o r .

         I took no further part in the police activity at the stadium.

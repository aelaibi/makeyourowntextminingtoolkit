      The     lads       were    Liverpool                   supporters                 and       had     Liverpool            accents.

it    done    to me a f e w             times,       if y o u     stand       behind         a    barrier        you      expect               to

be    crushed       but       t his    was    unbearable.               Experieno/loId                   me    to     ge t    under

asked    him       to move.            He    just     said      "Sorry        mate",         and      didn't        move.          I

could    see       that       he    had,     room     to m o v e      but     just      w o u l d n ’t so        1 punched                 the

As    I lifted         thg^'kid u p           I could              see       people        standing         on      his     legs,            the

We    helped a           lad       onto    a    board and a Pol ice ma n                        told       us    to    take       him    round

difficulty             breathing.               Other      f ans        helped        me a n d                       carry       him    d own.




We    said       to    the a m b u l a n c e       fella       on       th e    radio,          where        do y o u       want       him

put    him       down wi th          the       other     bodies.               We    then       ran b a c k          towards       the

pitch       to    tr y    to       help    someone         else.



It h a p p e n e d       so    quickly          I can 't       describe              h i m - he           could       have       been my

own    brother           and       I wouldn't          have        recognised              him.




I saw a man              l y in g    on    th e    floor       with       his        trousers             around       his       ankles       and

off.



I didn't          know        if    he w a s      dead     or a l i v e .            There          was    no m o v e m e n t      from

him.        I didn't           want       to a c c e p t    the         fact        he w a s        dead -       I didn't          want       to

accept       the       f act       anyone      was     dead.

"He's       de ad" ,    so    I said           to    him       "Show       some    f'ing          respect",          I went        For

We went        back     on    t h e r p i t c h a n d me a n d                          started         crying




We    got    back      on    th e      pitch        by t he      centre       on    the       halfway          line     I saw a

Policewoman and Policeman                            carrying          a young          lad w i t h             r o ken      leg    so we

Then    I couldn't            do       no m o r e      because         I couldn't             stand       the       pain     from    my

shoulder        anymore,            then an          old man          from    the       FA    came      out     onto/the           pitch

and    I was      talking           to    him -        I think         his    name       w as

I went       there      to w a t c h a n d           have       a good       day    out,          I c an ' t    believe        what

happened.



Just    to     clarify where                  I wa s      as    I stood       on    the       terrace          and    looked

straight        ahead        the       goal      post      was    either          just       slightly          to m y      left     or

I think          that        f a ns    should          have       been    directed       away       from       the      tunnel       - the

I saw       people           getting         h ur t     on    the       spikes    on    the      fences        as      they were

trying         to    get      out      - why       have       spikes        on them,       I think            this      contributed

to    the      injuries          people           received.

                                                                                                                                      S 1 133

I went        to An£>*'e 1 d on              t h e M o n d a y y /f r         Tuesday after               t h is    tragedy       had

happened/'              I went        to     lay a w r e a t h               for    those         who    ha d died.




As    we    were        queuing         up    th e         camera men were                   photographing             the      people

coming        to      pay t h e i r        respects.                I got          upset       with      them.       I dropped           rny

wreath        off       came      out      I was           upset        and angry            about       the    c a m e r a men.         I saj

this       man and          I/asked          if    he       wa s    a    r e p o r t& r .,     he   said       he w a s    so    I hajT a

bit    of a g o / a b o u t           what        was       going        on/        I asked         him    to      print      wha^f I'd

said       abemt        camera        men     taking             photographs.                  He   wrote       it* d o w n     and    I gave
                                                                                                        A , s'
him    my     name       and address.                      He    was
                                                                         _
                                                                         from       the S u n d a y Jpimes.



He    p h o n e d me a f e w            times          - on the F r i d a y               he      phoned       up a n d    he a s k e d      me

if    I could           describe           the     two          lads w h o         had    died      to    him.       That       was    just

going       too       far - t h e r e ' s          no       dignity           in t h a t.




All    I can          say      is t h a t     it       never        should          have       happened.            If e v e r y o n e      had

done       their        job     properly           it w o u l d n ' t           have      happened.




Instead          of     treating           people           like        d ogs      and    animals         maybe      we    could       be

treated          like       human       beings.




I thought             s o me    Police        officers              were        c o u r j ^ e o u s , but       some w e r e ^ b w a r d s

I didn't           go    to     the     semi-final                 last      year.           On          s da y     I was       wearing         a

pair       of W r a n g l e r        jeans,        a       red     sweatshirt

                 on the         front        and       a    pair        of    bljrek t r a i n e r s       with      red a n d        white

             Another        thing        is    t ha t   all    the    bodies         were    mixed       up - the      injured       were

             lying     with        the    dead.         There       was   no    on e    there      to    say   injured       to    the

             left,     dead        to    the    right      because        maybe        one   more       life   could    have       been

             saved.

         HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

         You will no doubt be aware by now that Mr Leslie Sharp, QPM, Chief
         Constable of Cumbria, was appointed as the new Investigating Officer with
         effect from 1 April 1990.  He is now in full command of the investigation
         and is responsible for deploying officers of the West Midlands Police
         investigation team.  Consequently, any future communications on the
         Hillsborough investigation should be referred to him, care of Nechells
         Green Police Station, or anywhere else he may specify.

         The Inquests were concluded on Friday, 4 May 1990 and that day saw my
         departure from this investigation.  With effect from Tuesday, 8 May 1990, I
         took up a temporary post at the Police Staff College at Bramshill as the
         Assistant Chief Constable to the Senior Command Course.  The purpose of
         this letter, therefore, is to indicate my departure and at the same time
         express my gratitude to you and your staff for the very professional way in
         which our relations have been over the past twelve months.  In expressing
         these sentiments I also reflect those of my colleagues with whom I have been
         privileged to work.

         In saying thank you can I also express my appreciation of the efforts made
         by Mr Colin Cleugh, Mr Mike Kennedy and Mr G Williams Q.C.

         With Mr Sharp at the helm I feel certain that there will be no loss of
         momentum nor loss of continuity, especially as Detective Chief
         Superintendent Mick Foster remains with the team.  Of course, whilst I will
         be in Hampshire I will be available to give Mr Sharp any assistance he
         requires.

Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

Mr Williams and Mr Birts are retained to advise the Crown
Prosecution Service in this matter.

I enclose copies of an advice on corporate manslaughter
prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service by Professor Smith
of Nottingham University.
I should be grateful if you could pass these copies to
Mr Williams and Mr Birts.

Yours faithfully




M G Kennedy

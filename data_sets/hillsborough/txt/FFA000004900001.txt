FA/HILLSBOROUGH

1 spoke to John Dyson QC. We agreed that rather than
ra-hash the detailed and comprehensive report by PopplawalJU
Taylor will be likely to pick un from where Popplawell left
off.

It was clear that the FA had not provided Popplawall with
most of the detail on which he relied.

We would need to explain what happened since Popplewell and
the way forward. He agreed to come to the FA at 2.30 today,
I said I would be sending him copies of the full statements
and the additional police evidence in 3 volumes for his trip
tomorrow. I understood Julian had already sent him
statements of the 3 police officers to be called tomorrow.

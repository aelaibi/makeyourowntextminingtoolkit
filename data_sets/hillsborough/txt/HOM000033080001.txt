     Thank you very m ud. for your letter of 7 May in support of recent calk for a new public
     inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

W ™ T ren ? l conside1rinf thet representations which have been made for a fresh inquiry I
 ^ h a v e been following the families’ campaign for a new inquiry closely and I have had the
     opportunity to meet some of the members of the Hillsborough Families Support Group
     since the broadcast last December of the television drama about the disaster. I am veiy
     conscious of the strength of feeling on this issue and will reach a decision as soon as I can.

     Finally, I would like to thank you for your kind comments on our election success. I am
     vexy much looking forward to the task ahead.

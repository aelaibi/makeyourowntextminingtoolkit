By     1 . 0 0 pm      (1300) on this     date I saw        several     groups      of youths

g a t hering           to the        front     of the      Co-op store drinking            cans of beer and

lager       bought       from    inside       the shop and many more           groups      coming     from the

shop      carrying alcoholic              beverages,       these youths        o bv iously    being

football            supporters,         A ro un d this time       I was a p pr oa ch ed    by many more

supporters,             at   least    on 6 occasions asking where               the    nearest       open

public       house was.

At 2 . 0 0 p m       (1300)     I was    on duty outside Threshers,              M i d dl e wo o d R o a d , an

O f f - l i c e n c e which was         e xtremely busy with football               supporters,         Ihis

shop      became        so full,      a member      of staff      in the shop had to          control        the

flow of        people        entering and leaving           the shop by locking the door and

allowing            only a few       people     in as others       left.

At 2 . 2 0 p m         (1320) I spoke     to a small        group of youths           carying    cans of

lager and              a bottle      of Cider. They        informed me       that     the drink was          for

c on s u m p t i o n    in H i l l s b o ro u gh Park before       the m at ch with some friends.

At 2 . 5 0 p m       I was    still     being a pp ro a ch e d by youths asking             the dir ec ti on

of the football               ground,     the m aj or i ty of these youths            smelt     of

intoxicating             liqour.

At 3 . 1 0 p m       (1510)     I a tt e n de d at H i l l s b o ro u gh Football     Ground,        Leppings

Lane where             I saw several          ambul an ce s and    large groups       of    people     leaving

the ground             in an e x tr em el y d istressed        condition.        Many of these          people

were      leaving the ground shouting                    vio le nt ly at    police    officers        standing

a ro u n d this         location,        As    I went    to the aid of a man who was alone and

crying two men wal ke d                 past and one shouted,              "Murdering B a s t a r d 11 to

the side            of an amb u la nc e where        I asked him to stay and wait                for    some

uncontrollably,                 I then a s si st ed another man who said his                  chest     hurt,

and asked him to stay with the first man until                               he too     could be treated.

At this        time      I saw several          bodies at the side of an a mb ulance                  lying

Date: 4 September 1997

To:     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith




This note comes with the following material


        file HO 397/70 - includes the photographs you mentioned this morning;


        box containing files HO 397/68 and 397/69 - the envelope at the back of 397/69
        contains the police operational instructions for the Hillsborough operation on the
        day. Some of this is hard to read, so I have asked the police to send us down a better
        copy, which they are doing (by first class post not fax since a faxed document of this
        size is always a mess);


        the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, as it stood at the time of Hillsborough; and


        the Green Guide (also as it stood at the time of Hillsborough).

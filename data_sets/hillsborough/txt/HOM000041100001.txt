DELETED:-

“ I could instinctively sense this feeling, one o f malevolence and awe ”(p.3) (Describing Leppings
Lane at approximately 2.15 p.m.)

His statement o f 1st June 1989 describes his experience in 1998. (See pp 7-9) NONE OF THIS
STATEMENT IS INCLUDED IN HIS AM ENDED REPORT. (See pp 10-13) In his
statement o f 1st June 1989, PC Booth states that at the 1988 semi-final, all people entering
through the Leppings lane turnstiles were searched. He further states that individual officers from
his serial were detailed to stand on the rear step o f the central pens, “ to assist in any possible
evacuation and to keep an overall eye on things inside the enclosure”. However, because the
central pens were immensely congested, these officers had to stand at the end o f the tunnel with
PC Booth and the remainder o f the serial.

      I was      deployed,           together          with         the    rest       of m y      serial,         insi de       the

     The     serial        Sergeant            was   PS     1 7 5 7 B urns.            He    informed            us    that we

     should work             in     pairs       behind       the      turnstiles             with     female          officers

     deployed          behind        the       majority          of m a l e s ,     on      searching            duties        in

 / ^ m        roughly         11.30am          unt i ! 1 4 . 1 5         or    thereabouts,                the    passage           of

     individuals             into    the       ground        was     sparce         with     very          few    pe o p l e    coming

     i " t’° - the    ground.           The     ones       t h at    di d      come      into     the      ground        betwee^T

    these      times,        appeared           to    be     family           types      in g o o d     jovial         mood.



    As    I say,       there        continued          to     be a s t e a d y         flow,         albeit,          sporadic,           of

    people       through          the     turnstiles              into      the L e p p i n g s       Lane       Enclosure.                         1

    Ho w e v e r ,    at    roughly 2.15p m                t h at    sam e      date,       there       began a profuse

    end.      Through         the       activated           turnstiles,               I could         see a       large        gathering

    of   peop le       outside          t he    ground       wh o     were       very       tightly         packed against
    e a c h other.




 I as a n            individual          member       of m y        se r i a l ,    continued              with       searching                 ,

du t i e s at         this     t i me .        Presently,            as m o r e       an d more            people       filed        in         ,

through          the       busy     turnstiles,              I wa s       approached            by    several          Liverpool

supporters             who     claimed          that       th e     situation          outside          wa s     becoming           r o u gh    !

This       situation           continued             for    so me     minutes,           and      I remember            stating           to

a     c o l l e agu e,      that     I knew          something            was a bo u t       to      happen,          that we w o u l d         t

be h a v i n g        some    trouble           of   same         kind.         I could         instinctively              sense

          At a p p r o x i m a t e l y         1430       t hat     sam e       date    I saw       that         several        y o u n g m e n ha d

J         started        to     enter          the     ground         by                            outer         p e r i m e t e r w a ll a n d

          the    r oofs       of     the      nearby           turnstiles.




          They were           repeatedly              told        by m y s e l f       and    other         officers        to   refrain

          from     climbing             in t h i s        way.       The        Liverpool         supporters             declined        to    take

          he ed a n d      regardless                of     care,      continued             to   enter          the    ground     in this way,

          It was      seen         by m y s e l f         that      a v a st      majority          of      these       persons       together

          with     o th e r s ,      that      had        entered          by    the    more      conventional             means        of    the

          turnstile,            were       smelling             heavily          of    intoxicants.                I saw     sev e r a l

          attempts         by o f f i c e r s         to    eject          or a r r e s t     these         persons,        r esu l t    in

          failur e,       due        to    the       vast       numbers          congregating               at    the   time.         Officers

          were     trying          to     control          the w h o l e         situation,         which          by n ow w as         becoming

          on to     the     terracing.

      He     became        agitated             and       started          abusing        the W P C         and    so    I in t e r v e n e d .

      As a       result         of               ^ conduct           and        his a b i l i t y      to    produce        a valid

      ticket        of a n y         kind,          he w a s      escorted            towards       the      Police       room,       with     the

      intention            of      expelling              him     from      the       ground.

      yu/mg         this        time       I was          joined      by PC 8 5 3 B u r k e              who     a s s i s t e d me     due    t
              disposition,              that      meaning        that     he w a s     struggling.



 At     one    stage,                  struggled         v i o l e n t l y a n d as a       res u l t     I was      thrown       to

 the     floor and                    was    heard       to     say    "Come     on    lads,       come    on",      with       the

 intention           of    inciting          other       Liverpool           fans     into a f i g h t      with myself

a n d PC B u r k e .




Eventually,               after       getting        myself         off   the    floor,              was     placed         in the

Police         room.           I remember           at   the     time     of    falling      to the        gr o u n d ,    that

 I ’d b e t t e r     get       up    or    else     I ’d be        trampled        to d e a t h or at        best,         badly

kicked.




After         lodging                I my    prisoner,           in the        Police      detention         room,        the

I then        took               to    the     Police         cell     bus     w hi ch was     parked       outside,            and

      was     then,       that        I realised          that        some     form   of   disaster         ha d     o c c ur red ,

due     to    the    vast       number         of    bodies         and   injured       laid o u t s i d e      the P o l i c e

room     inside        the      ground.




Myself        and PC       Burke           then     tried      to     locate     our S e r i a l    Sergeant          1757

Burris.        We w e r e       unable        to do       so,       and   now    in   retrospect          t hi s   was

probably        due       to    th e       chaos     caused         inside      the   ground       on the      Leppings

La ne    end.




After       trying        to    gain       access        to   the     pitch/terracing              areas     via      the

               It was       he re    that    I was          approached                by a d o c t o r ,      who      stated      he w a n t e d

               to     know where       all       the    i n j u r e d we re.              I escorted            h i m to     the    rear     of

               th e    treatment       of       casualties.




               At     1 6 1 0 or    thereabouts,              I left            the    g y m n a s i u m a r e a due        to all       of the

               casualties           having       been conveyed                  to h o s p i t a l .



            To *    then    returned        to    the rear           of     the L e p p i n g s        Lane       area and tried             to

Li;           distraught,           nevertheless               understanding                   of   the P o l i c e      situation.

            '"'Others       however,        some       smelling             of    d ri n k ,    were      more        abusive,      stating

               At     roughly       1700    all     Police          personnel             were      mustered           in the N o r t h S t a n d

               where       Serial     Sergeants             after          debriefing           could       stand       their      respective

               serials       down.




               At     1830 my       serial       was    stood          down       and     I returned            to B a r n s l e y .

goal,     was        very full      and as a result,                the      officers         detailed,             had to

mo st    of the first                            t,he game.

It struck me at               the     time     that     the     design       of    the s e c u r i t y fencing               was

in h i b i t i n g    the m o v e m e n t       of    persons       w i t h i n the        enclosure.

By this        I mean       that      the       end of the            tunnel opens            out    onto              the

which       transcends          the    terracing          right       to    the    front wall.                 This w o ul d

mean      that       persons       entering        onto      the L e p p i n g s     Lane      terrace,            w o u l d have

POLICE CONSTABLE 78



BARNSLEY DIVISION, PENISTONE SECTION



I am a Police Constable, number 7 8 , of the South Yorkshire Police, currently

stationed at Penistone Police Station, which is part of Barnsley Division.

At 8.30 am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I paraded for duty at Penistone Police

Station     as       part   of   a   serial   for    duties   at   the    F A   Semi-Final     between

Nottingham       Forest      and     Liverpool    due   to be held       at Sheffield Wednesday's

ground, Hillsborough.

Police transport then conveyed myself and others to Wombwell Police Station

where we later liaised with other 'B2' officers and boarded a Police Transit

van     and were       then conveyed      to Hillsborough Stadium.              After   an   in-depth,

initial briefing on the logistics and strategy to be implemented on the day,

given by both uniform and CID Senior Officers, all serials then took a small

snack type meal in the North Stand,                     where the previous briefing had been

held.

At    approximately         11.30 am,     after     a further briefing by Inspector,            I was

deployed,    together with            the rest      of my   serial,   inside the ground at the

Leppings Lane end behind turnstiles 9-16.                     The serial Sergeant was Police

Sergeant 1757 Burns.             He informed us that we should work in pairs behind the

turnstiles       with female officers deployed behind the majority of males,                       on

searching duties in accordance with the Inspector's previous briefing.

From roughly 11.30 am until 1415 or thereabouts, the passage of individuals

into the ground was sparce with very few people coming into the ground.                           The

ones that did come into the ground between these times appeared to be family

types in good jovial mood.
As I say, there continued to be a steady flow, albeit sporadic, of people

through   the      turnstiles       into          the    Leppings       Lane     enclosure.       However,    at

roughly 2.15 pm that same date,                         there began a profuse build up of people

outside   the       ground     entrances           to     the     Leppings       Lane   end.      Through    the

activated turnstiles           I could see a large gathering of people outside the

ground who were very tightly packed against each other.

I as an individual member of my serial, continued with searching duties at

this   time.       Presently,      as more             and more people filed in through the busy

turnstiles,        I was     approached           by    several Liverpool          supporters     who claimed

that   the     situation       outside        was       becoming        rough    and    unruly,   with   people

starting to push and shove each other outside.                             This situation continued for

some minutes,        and I remember stating to a colleague that I knew something

was about to happen, that we would be having some trouble of some kind.

At   approximately         1430    that       same       date,    I    saw that     several young men had

started to enter the ground by scaling the outer perimeter wall and roofs of

the nearby turnstiles.

They   were       repeatedly      told       by    myself       and    other     officers   to    refrain    from

climbing in this way.              The Liverpool supporters declined to take heed and

regardless of care, continued to enter the ground in this way.                                     It was seen

by myself that a vast majority of these persons, together with others that

had entered by the more conventional means of the turnstile, were smelling

heavily      of   intoxicants.           I    saw       several       attempts    by officers to eject or

arrest these persons result in failure, due to the vast numbers congregating

at the time.         Officers were trying to control the whole situation, which by

now was becoming chaotic and, as a result, persons without tickets may have

entered on to the terracing.
/                                               - 3 -



At approximately 1450, I saw to my left in the Leppings Lane enclosure to

the rear of the West Stand and Leppings Lane terracing,                          a man whom I now

know to be

                                He was involved in an argument with WPC Pearson about

whether or not he had got a ticket to see the football match in the ground.

He became agitated and started abusing the WPC and so I intervened.                             As a

result of             conduct and his inability to produce a valid ticket of any

kind,    he   was    escorted     towards   the    Police       room,   with    the   intention    of

expelling him from the ground.

During this time, I was joined by Police Constable 853 Burke who assisted me

due to          disposition, that meaning that he was struggling.

                            struggled
                                 At one
                                      violently
                                        stage,  and as a result, I was thrown to the

floor and           was heard to say, "Come on lads, come on", with the intention

of   inciting       other    Liverpool   fans     into    a     fight   with    myself   and   Police

Constable Burke.

                                Eventually, after getting myself
                                                            was placed
                                                                 off theinfloor,
                                                                           the Police

room.     I remember at the time of falling to the ground that I ’d better get

up or else I ’d be trampled to death or at best, badly kicked.

After    lodging             my prisoner,   in the Police detention room,                the normal

procedure     for    prisoners     was   followed,       with    regards   to   documentation     and

searching.

I then took            to the Police cell bus which was parked outside, end it was

then that     I realised       that   some form of disaster had occurred,                due to the

vast number of bodies and injured laid outside the Police room inside the

ground.
    Myself and Police Constable Burke then tried to locate our Serial Sergeant

    1757    Burns.      We   were   unable    to do so,      and now    in retrospect,        tiis was

    probably due to the chaos caused inside the ground on the Leppings Lane end.

    After trying to          gain access to the              pitch/terracingareas via the Leppings

    Lane North West          Stand area, Police Constable Burke          and myself returned to

    the rear of the West Stand.

    It was here that I was approached by a doctor who stated he wanted to know

    where all the injured were.              I escorted him to the rear of the North Stand

    outside       the   gymnasium   area,    where    I    then   assisted    in   the    treatment   of

    casualties.

    At     1610   or    thereabouts,   I     left    the   gymnasium   area    due   to    all   of   the

    casualties having been conveyed to hospital.

    I then returned          to the rear of theLeppings Lane area and tried to console

    members of the           public.    At this time, most people were though distraught,

    nevertheless understanding of the Police situation.                       Others, however, some

    smelling of drink, were more abusive stating the cause of the disaster to be

    the Police action, or in-action as the case may have been.

    At roughly 1700 all Police personnel were mustered in the North Star.i where

    Serial Sergeants after debriefing could stand their respective serials down.

*   At 1830 my serial was stood down and I returned to Barnsley.

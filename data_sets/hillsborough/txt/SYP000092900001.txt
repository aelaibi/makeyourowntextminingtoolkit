               at the Hi 11sborough ground in Sheffield.

               I attended as a Liverpool         supporter and have supported them for twenty

               years.      I was a season ticket holder at Anfield last season and

               regularly attended home matches.



r              I obtained my match ticket by using vouchers from my season ticket.

               My match ticket was for the Leppings Lane terracing and cost me siK

                     as not yet been seen by the Police



I cannot recall any traffic delays on the way to Sheffield.

The driver parked our coach in the vicinity of a fairly new red brick

building which was about a fifteen to twenty minute walk from the
                                                T-?*'
ground.  I now understand this brick builtj#sfig to be the Sheffield City
                                          y
morgue.     The coach was parked at abouj/'two thirty pm (1430).             Our

coach had been held up in footbal J^ tr af fi c.      For about twenty minutes

in Sheffield itself.           Becau^e^cf the time, we left the coach and made

our way straight to the ground.           I had not been to Hillsborough before

and was unsure of the way.           We did see a street sign indicating the

way towards the Hillsborough district,          so we followed that.       ye did

not receive any Police escort or receive any directions at tha_J#stage ,

but eventually we saw the ground and carried on towards  it^
                                                          :0'
As we made our way to the ground there were hundreds of,;#orest

supporters all around us, some of whom were d r i n k i n g ^ a n s of beer.           It

was obvious that we were at the Forest end of Ihe J r o un d, so we

approached a couple of Policemen and asked tMa |#ay to the Leppings

Lane end.     The Policemen directed us towards ueppings Lane, which we

found shortly after.

I did not see any disorder or fighting outside the ground,                neither did

I see any obvious drunkeness.                           ^

Me arrived in the area of the Leppings Lane/tur r.st i les at about two
forty five pm        <m 4       At that time,   the turnstile area between the

turnstiles and the outer         iron gates was packed with people.          There

were three mounted Policemen standing by the roadsign to the right of

the outer       iron gates.    These officers were trying to prevent anymore

supporters entering the al r eady overcrowded area beyond the outer

gates-     It was an impossible task for these three officers on their

own.     I saw another officer standing on the Jtop^ of the turnstile

b l o c k 7 to the right hand side of the b l q / K , nearest the river.        This

officer was pulling people         out of tira/crowd in front of the turnstiles

and up onto the top of the         turnstile block.

Having seen the crowd inside the turnstile area, and the Policeman

pulling supporters out of the crowd,            1 thought    that perhaps the

turnstiles had been closed         and that no more supporters were         being

allowed through those turnstiles.          Because of this,                     [ and

      decided to walk around the side of the turnstile block to see if

there were any further turnstiles                     and I had separated from

          and                  while we were outside the turnstile area,

       and I walked alongside the crowd to the right of the turnstile

block and as we^'walked beyond the turnstile block, to our left, we saw

an opening^/^ We walked through that opening,           still, looking for another

set of Jrurnstiles.         1 am now aware that this opening, was in fact gate

5C e Jifcwever at the time,      I did not realise that I had actually entered

th§ ground itself.          Other people were also walking through this

opening and entering the ground.

Having walked through the opening and still being unaware that we

were actually inside the ground,                  and I continued to look for

another set of turnstiles.          At some point a lad came over to me and

asked to buy my match ticket for ten pounds.                I said no chance,    I want

it.     The lad said to me that it d i d n ’t matter because        I was   inside the

ground.     I thought the lad was having me on, so I said I won't sell my

ticket and the lad went away*            I can only think that the lad was aware

’that he was inside the ground and was probably looking to make some

money by going back out through the gate and selling my ticket

outside.     The lad was obviously a Liverpool          supporter and spoke witj

Liverpool accent.

We were still        looking around for turnstiles when we enterjHfi the tunnel

and started walking along          it.   I am now aware that l ^ h ^ w a s   the

central     tunnel    that runs underneath the West Stand.

 I did not see any Policemen or Stewards by the entrance to the tunnel

or anywhere     inside    it.

From the time that we entered^rfi*e ground and before entering the

 tunnel,    I did not see any't ight i ng or any other form of disorder?              I

 did not see any peo&<e drinking          inside the ground.

We had a free passage along the tunnel.              It was while we were walking

along the tus/el,        that I realised that 1 could see the pitch.               1 also

 sa&kpJohr^HSfARNES? the Liverpool       player?   running across the pitch from

 right to left.        It was only then that I realised that we were actually

 inside the ground.

We were walking along the right hand side of the tunnel and at the end

 of the tunnel?       it became crowded and I had to edge my way along the

 gate at the end of the tunnel.           I edged my way alonq the gate and then

 along the wall to the right as you enter thy? terraces.               Having edged

 my way along the wall?         I realised that I/was now on the terraces?

 inside what I now know as^j>#n number y r e e

 At the end of the walL/'l thought {tpfot the terraces may run under the

 stand?    behind me. ./I was in the process of looking around me, when

 there was a stjpong push behind me.           There must have been tremendous

 pressure            behind because the next thing I knew?        I was down towards

 the front of the pen?          I have marked my initial    position at the end of

 the tunnel on the separate grid plan using the figure one.
                                                                          PAGE        3
                                                                          S3716

As a result of that strong push,, from behind?                 and I, were now

in a position towards the front of the pen, which was about eight to

ten feet behind the front     perimeter fence,      virtually in line with the

exit gate in the front     fence.    I have marked this      second position on

the separate grid plan     using the figure two.               was still with me

in position two,   slightly to my left.      I have no idea what the time

may have been then from that        point onwards I have     no recollections of

any events on the pitch.

From the time that we got to        position two,   I felt   crushed in by the

crowd.    I was unable to move      at all and had my arms pinned up against

my chest.    I could not   see anything off the pitch and I was slowly

being turned around to     my left. Initially I was taking deep breaths

and did not have any difficulty with my breathing.            Gradually my

breaths became shorter and shorter and I was sweating profusely.                 As

well as being turned to my left towards the North Stand I was also

gradually leaning over to my left hand side.           There came a point when

I could breathe in, but could not breathe out.            It was then that I

closed my eyes,    expecting to die.     My last memory in position two

was saying goodbye to my mother,       fathej^f^my two children, and my wife,

from whom I have since been divojs^ed.       Having said my goodbyes,        I

became uncon sc io us.

My next recollection is j K t Xin q up on the terracing towards the rear

of pen three.     There^ere   four lads standing over me, slapping me

across the face saying d o n ’t drop off,     stay awake or words to that

effect.     Ij have no idea how I got to the rear of the terracing or what

the time may have been.       There was a lot of space around me in the

pen and I can only presume that I must have been unconscious for some

time.     I still felt very tired and it was still a st^ugg^le to breathe.

I was then physically carried out by two l a d s b a d r along the tunnel

and into the toilet near to the tunnel entrance-             I felt very thirsty

a n d drank      some water.

Ha v i n g   left the toilet,          I sti      felt weak and         leaned up aga in st             the

wall      outside.         I had no i/rfea where                 was and      I sta rt ed to walk

aw a y    from the toilet           souting out                   name,      I only took a few

steps before           collapsing again.          A P o l i c e m a n helped me up onto my feet

an d     led me 'sb a c k<r'towards gate       'C ' su ppo rti ng me all        the way.          I left

the ground via gate             'C ’ an d sat for a while            fay the wire fence next to
                       _
the      river bank.         I do not know what        time      it was wh en      I left the

ground.

I e ve n t u a l l y   returned to the         coach and several         other     people        from our

coach had also             returned.    There were         supporters      from our      coach who

were      un ac co u n t e d for,   including               ,   We   later a t t e n d e d at

H i l l s b o r o u g h Po li ce S t a t i o n to report   the missing        people from our

coach.        Having made       the    reports    to the Police,          I a t t e n d e d at    the

centre next to the Po li ce S t a t i o n w                     had been set up as a treatment

treatment        centre.

           but he was not known X^o^Hfe personal l y .   The last time that 1 saw Paul

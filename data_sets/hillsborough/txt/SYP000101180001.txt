                I am        Michael             Buxton,             a    Police          Constable                of       25    years          service           and    I am

                stationed              at       Bradfield                in    FI     Division.                   In       the    course          of       my     work       I

                drive           the    Divisional                   Land       Rover          each       working                day.        The       Land        Rover          is

                fitted           with       a    multi            channel           radio       and          a    public          address             system.

                On    Saturday,                 15       April          1989       (150489)          I was             on       duty       in    connection              with

                the        FA    Cup       Semi          Final          between          Liverpool                and       Nottingham                Forest        at

                Hillsborough.                        My       duties          were       as    driver             with          the       Land    Rover          and
                                                                                                                                                                *
                Superintendent                       Chapman.                 We    were       on    duty             in    connection                with        Notts.

               Forest            supporters                   reception             at    Herries                Road       and       Herries          Road        South

               areas .

               Between            2.30pm             <1430)             and    3pm       (1500)          I       received             a    radio       message           from

                ground           control             to       take       the       Land       Rover          to       Leppings             Lane       to    assist           with

                crowd           control.                 I    informed             Mr.    Chapman                of    this       and       drove          to     Leppings

               Lane .

               When         I arrived                at       Leppings             Lane       turnstiles                   I was          amazed       at       what     I

               found.            From           the          turnstiles             to    beyond             the       traffic             lights          in     Leppings

               Lane         there          was       a       mass       of    supporters.                They           were          simply          pouring           down

               Leppings               Lane       towards                the    ground.              At   the           turnstiles                there          seemed        to

               be     making           little                if   any        progress          through                the       turnstiles.                 The

               pressure               at    the          front          of    the    queue       was          tremendous                  and     I    became           very
                                                                                                                                                       PAGE
                                                                                                                                                       R409

very    concerned.                    I appealed                      to        the       crowd       to       ease    the       situation             over

the    PA    this       had          no    effect.                     I    told          the       supporters             that       people       at    the

front       were       being          crushed                and           that       these          were       women       and       children,

their       own    people             that          they             were        crushing.                 It    made       no    difference.                 I

repeated          my    messages                several                    times          to    no    effect.

I    then    called          match             control                on        my    personal             radio       and       asked       for       the

kick    off       to    be       delayed                in       order           to       offer       the       crowd       something             to    stop

the    crushing             but       I was             informed                 it       was       too    late.

I    then    became          worried                and          I    realised                 people          were    going          to    get    harmed

and    injured          if       something                   was           not       done.           So    I called          the       Mounted

Inspector          on       the       PA       but       he          could           not       hear       me    because          of    the       noise

from    the       crowd          but       after             a       mi n u t e       or       two    I managed             to    attract          his

attention          and       I       gesticulated                          to    him       to       form       the    Mounted          Police

Officers          into       &       line       across                 the       area          parallel          with       the       turnstiles             and

this    he    managed                to    do       -    however                 this          had    little          effect,          the       crowd       was

hardly       affected                with       some             simply              going          under       the    horses*             bellies.

The    attitude             of       the       supporters                       struck          me    as       different          because          whilst

there       were       several             adults                with           youngsters                not    taking          any       part    in    the

matter       but       standing                to       one          side        of       the       main       stream       of    supporters

pouring       down          Leppings                Lane             the        bulk       of       supporters             appeared          to    be

gripped       by       an    urgency                to       get           into       the       ground          and    get       in    now       and    if

someone       was       hurt,             so    what,                it     seemed             as    though          something             more

important          than          a    football                   match           was       taking          place       behind          the

turnstiles.                 They          appeared                   fanatical                 to    gain       entrance.

It    was    obvious             that          the       greater                 part          had,       as    so    often       is       the    case,

been    drinking             and          had       left             it     too       late          and    on    arrival          seeing          the

large       crowd       still             waiting                to       get        in    the       ground          had    realised             they

would       miss       part          of    the          game,             although              I didn't             think       so    at    the       time       I

now    think       the       fans          were          storming                    the       turnstiles.

Just    when       my       concern             was          at       its        peak,          just       as    I was       at       my    wits       end
                                                                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                                                                              R409

wondering               what        I    could          do    next             the     crowd          seemed             to    disappear                 so    fast

that        initially               I    could          not       believe              it       and       I realised                that        a    large

concertina                 type         gate       had       been          opened:               I was          immensely                relieved              and

very        grateful.

Seeing        that           1 w-as          no    longer           required                   I began          to       drive        down          towards

the     rear       cf       the         South       stand          when          I     reached             a    gate          at    the        rear       of       the

Police        Match             Control            point          I heard              a       radio       message             "Everybody                 on       the

track,        everybody                  on       the    track".                 I stopped                 the       Land          Rover       and        gained

entry        to    the          ground            and     ran      onto          the        football             pitch.

Initially              what         I thought                I was             seeing          was     just          a    pitch          invasion.

There        were          no    players            on       the       pitch           and       fans          were       climbing              over          the

fencing           at       the      Leppings             Lane          end.            I was          not       overly             concerned              because

I     knew    that              we're         quite          easily             capable           of       dealing             with       a     pitch

invasion.                  I walked               towards          the          goalmouth              area          at       the    Leppings

Lane.         As        I did           so    I    saw       that          a    Liverpool              supporter                   had    got        to       t he

Notts,        end          of    the         ground          and       was       agitating                 the       Notts,          fans           by    his

actions           in       the      goalmouth                at    that          end.           As         I walked across                      to        t he

Leppings           Lane          end         goalmouth,                I       turned          and         saw       t h a t he          had    been

arrested           around            the          middle          of       the       pitch.            As       I neared             to       the

goalmouth              I saw        Police              officers               helping           fans          over           the    fencing              and        I

began        to    realise               it       was    more          than          -a p i t c h      invasion.                    I then           saw       a

gate     in       the       fence            and    fans          lying          trapped              on    top          of     one       another              in t h e

gateway.               I    looked            behind          the          fencing             and         saw       that the             fans       w e r e all

crushed           together.                   I    saw    a       young          fan       amongst             them           and    realised              he        was

dead.

I went        to       the       open         gate       and       tried             to    pull       a     youth             out    of    the           entrance

but    he     said         that         his        foot       was       trapped.                 With          other           officers             I then

tried        to    pull         a   young           female             out       but       she       was       trapped              by    fans           behind

her    and        she      began         screaming                and          the        other       officers                 stopped          pulling.

I   said      âs h e ' s        got      to        come       out,         come           on    pull.*            We          eventually                 pulled

                                                                                                                                               R409

her    free        and       then       pulled          out    a    youth       who       had    been           trapped           under         her

but     to    one       side,       after          which       1 was          able       to    pull        the    youth           who       was      at

the     bottom          back       towards          the       fence       and       I was       able        to    free          his       foot

which        had    been          trapped          between          a    metal       post       which           supports             t he

fencing           and    a    concrete             step.

 I   was     obliged          to    recover             by    resting          against          the        St,    John's

ambulance.                I saw         Chief       Superintendent                   Nesbit           standing             on     the

advertisement                 hoardings             and       holding          onto       the    fencing              trying          to       get

some       organisation                 but    the       noise          was    too       much.         1    ran       to       the    Land          Rover

and    a     hand       held       loud       hailer          and       gave    it       to    Chief        Superintendent                      Nesbit

who    was        still       in    the       same       position             still       trying           to    get       things

organised.               He       then       instructed             Police          Officers           to       form       a    tunnel          down

which        we    passed          bodies          of    the       fans       whilst,         some    alive,           a       lot    of       them

were       obviously              dead.        We       passed          back    body          after        body       until          eventually

we     cleared          the       area.

I    then     assisted             in    taking          dead       bodies          on    advertising                 hoardings                to    the

opposite           end       of    the       pitch       clearing             the    area       and        from       there          into       the

gynrma s i urn .

My    ne t        recollection                is    that       I drove          the       Land       Rover        onto          P e n is t o n e

Road       and     parking          on       the    central             reservation             and        performing                traffic

duty       directing              ambulances             down       Herries          Road       and        turning             right        into

Peni stone          Road          and    then       into       the       ground.

Eventually              1 went          to    the       gymnasium             looking          for    Superintendent

Chapman.            When          I arrived             at    the       gym    and       I saw       all        the    bodies             laid       on

the    floor        I    couldn't             believe          there          was    so       many,       row     upon          row       of    them.

E v e n t u a 11y       Detective             Chief          Superintendent                Addis          began        issuing

instructions                 regarding             procedures             and       finding          I was        n ot         required,             I

went       into     the      North           Stand       looking          for       Superintendent                    Chapman.                 He    was

there      with         other       supervisor                officers          so       I sat       in     the       stand.          I

remember          seeing          Chief        Superintendent                   Mole       approaching                 the       North          Stand
                                                                        PAGE   5
                                                                        R409




from the Police Control.

After being stood down by Mr Chapman, I returned to the gymnasium to

see if I could assist, but it seemed all organised.   I did a driving

job allocated to me by Chief Inspector Beal then resumed to my beat.

When I arrived at Leppings Lane initially, I was able to travel

freely up to the crowd because there were very few fans walking up

Leppings Lane they were all coming down.   The crowd was of three to

four thousand strong.

The mood of the fans was a grim determination to get in the ground,

no one was laughing or joking, just the determination to get in.

I have no recollection of any actions by any stewards.

Radio communications were not good so much so that on previous

occasions the radio set up in the Land Rover is such that it can be

utilised as a radio room and has been on previous occasions by

pressing the correct buttons.   It receives and transmits messages via

match control.   At one stage I thought that I would be required for

this.

My normal function on match days is that of driver with the Land

Rover of the Chief Superintendent and always in position in Leppings

Lane.   This is a duty I have been performing for years.

I remember that when I was at Leppings Lane and after using the P.A.

and having had no success, I was joined by an Inspector who climbed

onto the roof of the Land Rover and used the P.A. with the same

result.

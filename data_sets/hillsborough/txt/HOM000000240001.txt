          I am a single woman living with my parents



          I am a Liverpool F.C. Supporter and on Saturday 15041989 I travelled

          to Sheffield with

                                                      We travelled by car and parked

          in a side street.

          Ve did not have tickets for the football match and we went to the

          Penistone Rd North end of the Hillsborough Stadium where we

          purchased 5 consecutively numbered tickets from a ticket tout.             I

          have the stubs from 3 of the tickets       (Ex No         ) (REF NO            ).

          The ticket tout was a white male,       late 2 0 ’s early 3 0 ’s, 5 ’7" - 5 ’8",

          stocky build,    brown hair,    straight with perhaps a side parting.          He

          was casually dressed in a ski jacket type anorlrtc.         We paid him    20

          for each ticket.

          Ve arrived in Sheffield at about 1100 am and after parking the car

          went to a pub,       I think it is called the WHITE HORSE.     The pub got

          busy about 1230 onwards and became packed with Liverpool

          supporters.            had about 3 pints and a bottle of beer because

the pub ran out of glasses.                had half a lager and then

orange juice,           was driving and only had shandy.      I w a s n ’t

drinking.

At about 1330 pm we went to the ground.          The   tickets we had purchased

were for the Spion Kop end and so we went to           a Police kiosh,

something     like a   Portacabin,   outside the ground, in the area to the

South Stand.      Ve   explained to an officer that we were Liverpool

Supporters and he advised us to see a steward at the Vest Stand

entrance .

Ve went to the entrance to the Vest Stand and spoke to a steward.

This was man in his early 3 0 's and I think he had a beard.           Ve spoke

to him about the       tickets and he directed us to the far left

turnstile.      Vhen   we got to the turnstile the man there refused to          let

us in.      Ve then went back to the Steward and he directed us to the

far right turnstile.       Vhen the Steward sent us there he commented " H E ’S

BEEN LETTING PEOPLE IN.”       At this turnstile we were allowed into the

ground,     the turnstile operator    looked at our tickets and retained the

one half.

Once inside the ground it was not crowded at           that stage and we

entered throuh the tunnel to enclosure 4 (as           marked on the map). Ve

went towards the left hand side of the enclosure and sat slightly more

than half way back from the front.

It was not crowded but there were quite a few people there.              There

was room to move about and to sit on the steps.           Ve sat for about ten

minutes.

At about 1430 - 1440 we started to move forward.           Not necessarily

because we wanted to, but because of the numbers of people behind

us.   Ve reached a barrier and because of the pressure from behind me

ducked underneath it.       At this stage I w a s n ’t apprehensive,    it was

     just typical of a normal football match filling up.

     At about 1450 - 1455                   and        and I got separated from
     and                 I think         had got frightened and they had gone

     towards a gate at the front to try and get out.

     finished up against the fencing at the front.               Vhen we first got

    pushed up to the fence                     finished up in front of me and facing

    me I think his back was against the fencing.                This was the point when

    the pressure started to hurt and I got frightened.                The game had I

    think started but I c o u l d n ’t see the pitch.                 shouted for

%   people to move back but it was obvious that they w e r e n ’t going to.

    People then started climbing over the fence, onto the pitch.                   There

    were pople climbing both sides of me and I think someone close to

                managed to climb out.         People were shouting to be let out, and

    children were being passed over the fence.

    I think people close to me could have died but I d i d n ’t realize that

    at this time.           The pressure was so great that you couldn't turn around

    and c o u l d n ’t even look around.        I was telling        that it was

    hurting and to hold me and not let me go down.               He was shouting, and

    swearing,          to try and get me lifted out.

    To the left of us was about 3 lads and then the side fencing.                   People

    were trying to get the females and children out, and these lads

    helped me up onto the top of the fencing by the corner of the pen.                       I

    was helped down onto the pitch area.               I could f^alk to       and

    through the railings and I could touch them but you just c ou ldn ’t do

    anything.           After about 5 minutes           was helped out over the

    ra i l i n g s .          was still in there for what seemed like ages and I

    could see his face going a funny colour.               This was because he couldn’t

    breathe.           He then saw a gap behind him and faught his way to the

    side fencing and got out, over the fencing.

         When this all started I saw girls and children getting to the front

         and trying to climb out, or being passed or pulled out, and the

         Police were tryng to push them back into the pens.                Vhen the Police di

         realize what was happening there seemed to be no organisation and

         they didn t seem to know what to do.                The Police even seemed to be

        pulling the people off the fences that were trying to help other

        people get out.

        It also seemed to take a long time before the ambulances came onto

        the pitch.      Ve   got out of the ground as soon as we could.

        As a result of       the incident I suffered bruising to my ribs,          arms and

        legs.     I consulted my own Doctor,          for these injuries.

        I am 24 years of age,      5 ’3" tall,       slim,   long blond hair which was

        tied up with a       red scarf in a bow.        I was wearing a white sweat

        shirt and navy       blue tight trousers with a thin red stripe.

        Vhilst in the pub and in the area of the ground, we were asked on

        several occasions,      a dozen or so times,          if we had any spare tickets

        to sell.     This was mainly from Liverpool supporters.

        I am a keen Liverpool supporter and go as regular as I can.

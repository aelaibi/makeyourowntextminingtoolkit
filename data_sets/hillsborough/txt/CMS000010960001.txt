PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION FOR ORAL ANSWER ON MONDAY 19 FEBRUARY 19 90


The Lord Graham of Edmonton: To ask Her Majesty's Government how
they intend to promote implementation of the Taylor Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.


DRAFT REPLY (LORD FERRERS)


        My Lords,    the Government intends to require all              seated
accommodation at football league grounds and to create a National
Review Body for safety at such grounds by setting up a Football
Licensing Authority under Part I of the Football Spectators Act
1989.     My Department has already written to local authorities
drawing their attention to specific recommendations on safety
contained in the report.          The Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds

(the Green Guide) will be revised as quickly as possible and we
shall use powers under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 so

that     local    authorities     are    required   to    include     mandatory
conditions m      safety certificates.
                                                    (
                                            The Government is considering
urgently    the     suggestions    for   the   creation    of   new    offences

contained in the Report,          and we shall be discussing with the

national sporting authorities concerned the application of the

recommendations for all seated accommodation for sports other
than football.

BACKGROUND NOTE


General
Lord Graham's question opens up the possibility of a wide range
of supplementaries. In the absence of any indication as to the
direction he proposes to go Notes on Supplementaries cover a wide
area. They are primarily those drawn up for the Statement and
Commons debate on 29 and 30 January.

Most likely the interest will lie in all seater stadia and/or the
creation of new offences. Notes on Supplementaries cover these
W .    —      in, cost*.
The Football Spectators Act 1989
This Act applies only to England and Wales and only to football.
Part I will be implemented other than the provisions relating to
the Football Membership Authority and the Football Membership
Scheme. Part II will be implemented in full.
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act)
Unlike the Football Spectators Act 1989 the 1975 Act applies to
Scotland and to all sports. A separate note on the operation of
the 1975 Act is attached at Annex A.
Finances/Costs

The Football Trust and its 'sister' organisation the Football
Grounds Improvement Trust already provide substantial assistance
to football clubs.
Annex B is a press release from the Football Trust anticipating
£75 million for professional football over ten years.     (This
figure probably includes Scotland). Costs of £130 million for
all seated stadia quoted by the Football League/Football
Authority probably excludes Scotland. Professional football has
additional income from the pools companies and television (see
Annex C).

Other sports, eg rugby, do not have the benefit of such
assistance which is one of the reasons why we propose to discuss
the appropriateness of the Taylor recommendations with the
national authorities of the sports concerned.

Scotland

Scottish Departments are considering how to bring about all
seated accommodation at Scottish premier league matches in the
absence of powers under the Football Spectators Act.
Scottish Office advise that ticket touting is already an offence
under section 55 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.
This provides for a fine of up to £50 on summary conviction for
anyone who

     (a)   in a public place -

           (i) touts for the purpose of selling or advertising
           anything or otherwise obtaining custom so as to give
           any other person reasonable cause for annoyance, or

           (ii) importunes any other person for that purpose so
           as to give that or any other person reasonable cause
           for annoyance; and
     (b) fails to desist when required to do so by a constable
     in uniform.

Scottish Office Ministers are considering whether the above
provision needs to be strengthened.
                                                          ANNEX A

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 197 5 (197 5 ACT)

The 1975 Act applies to all sports grounds with accommodation for
spectators. The main mechanism of the Act for achieving safety
is the safety certificate.
A safety certificate is issued by the local authority, ie:
     London:-   London Borough Council
     Metropolitan:-* County Council (in Scotland the regional or
     island council)
in respect of grounds designated by the Secretary of State.
The Secretary of State may designate grounds with accommodation
for over 10,000 spectators. The Secretary of State for Scotland
exercises this power for Scotland.
All but one of the football league grounds are designated (the
exception is Torquay Utd which holds under 10,000).
International soccer and rugby grounds are also designated.
Other ('•non-league") soccer, cricket grounds, Rugby Union, and
Rugby League grounds in England and Wales identified as having
accommodation for over 10,000 spectators have also been
designated.    In Scotland, football grounds of clubs in the
Scottish League with accommodation for over 10,000 have been
designated.

Terms and conditions of safety certificates are determined by the
local authority who are under- a, duty to issue such a certificate
in respect of a designated ground.       The local authority must
consult the police and either the fire authority or building
authority about terms and conditions.

The local authority are also under a duty to arrange          the
inspection of a designated ground at least annually.
FIRE SAFETY AND PLACES OF SPORT ACT (1987 ACT)
Part III of the 1987 Act applies to sports grounds with covered
accommodation which are not designated under the 1975 Act. The
1987 provides,for safety certification of stands at such sports
grounds which can accommodate at least 500 spectators under
cover. Local authorities determine which stands require a safety
certificate.   Thereafter the system is similar to that of the
1975 Act.
Part IV of the 1987 extends entertainment licensing to indoor
premises used for sporting "entertainment" to which the public
are invited as spectators. Those licenses are issued by District
Councils.

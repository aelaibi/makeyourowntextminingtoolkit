                  I am a married man residing at the above address



                  On the afternoon of S a t u r d a ^ i S April                      1989 (150489),, I attended the FA

                  Cup Semi-Final               footbay/ftatch between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

                  at the Hi 1lsborougn ground in Sheffield,



                  I attended as a Liverpoo-Jr supporter and have supported them for about

                  ten years.              I am a/season ticket holder at Anfield and regularly

                  attend home matches.



                   I obtained my match ticj*€t by using a voucher^from my season ticket,

                  My ticket was for tlyr Leppings Lane terr^r£ing and cost me six pounds

         I travelled to the match with the following peoples

          a            cal1ed



         I d o n ’t know anything further about          or        , I only know them

         from having played football with them on Thursday evenings                I a sk e d

              and         if they wanted a lift to Sheffield on the Thursday

         evening prior to Hillsborough.



         We travelled to Sheffield in my private vehicle.            We left Liverpool at

         about eleven o'clock     (1100)    on the morning and travelled directly to

         Sheffield without making any stops.         I do not remember any delays on

         the way to Sheffield.



         We eventually ended up in S heffield town o e r ft t r e where there were a lot

         of Forest supporters.      We realised th g tz we had obviously entered

         Sheffield on the Forest side so           stopped and asked Police for

         directions.    We were given dL/e ct ions towards the ground and left the

         town centre.    We parked tj>fe car at about twenty past one       (1320) on a

         main road near to a p ^ f k .     It was only five minutes away from the

         g round,



         After parking the car, we IJiad something to eat, we had all            brought

         sandwi ches with us               eating them, we went off to try and get a

         match ticket foj^                              had trave 1      to Shef f ield

         without a jrfatch ticket and was ho pi ng to bu         ne on the day             and

               iach had a match ticket for the S              Kop e,nd of the>ground and
                                                                                              PAGE      3
                                                                                              S3598

they were hoping to swap them for Leppings Lane tickets                               I don't know

where            and          got their tickets from,            but they had the tickets

before we left for Sheffield.



We had a walk round and found a pub that was open.                           I can't remember

the name of the pub,           but it was about a ten minute walk from where we

had parked and it was near to a chur ch graveyard.                          Wg,^ent    into that

pub at about twenty to A w o             (1340).      The pub w a ^ v e r y busy and there

were a lot of a t h j i j S \ ^ iv < a r poo 1 s u ppo rters         re .   We brought a pint

and               s t a g e d asking around the/^ub for any spare tickets.                      One

man told                to wait around for twenty minutes until a friend of

his turned up,         possibly with spare tickets.              When the mans friend

turned up, he did have spare t i ckets^Cnd                            bought one off him.

           paid face value for a Laffpings Lane terrace ticket.                                 and

        had been t ry i ng to sw^fp the i r Spion Kop tickets,                 but without

success.       We had two^cfr three pints in the pub and 1 efj^at about

quarter past twg/*f 1415)



M y s e 1f ,                        left ahead of              and            who said they

were going to ttw^to i let.             We said we would meet them back at the car

We waIked h & c k to the car and had another sandwich.                                and

d i d n ’t c/me back to the car so we decided to carry on and walk to the

ground.



On the way to the ground I saw Policemen,                      but I did not need any

directions to the ground.                I knew the way to the ground                       having

been to Hi 11 sbo rougj^bef o re .           I attended the co rirg^rf>ondi ng match at

atmosphere amongst the supporters.



Myself                               ived at this Leppings LaneJrtirnstile area

at about twenty fiv<         la   three   (1435).     11 was vejjy busy at that ti m e .

The area in           en the turnstile block and/Che outer             iron gates was

packed wit         pie.      The re we re no q ue ue s, just a solid mass of people

trying to get to the turnstiles                 eeing how busy it was, we thought

it might be the same at the Kop end, so we told                      to start making

his way towards the Kop end                     and        had not yet    rejoined us

and we told           that we would send                around to the Kop end as soon

as we saw him.               md           were unab>€ to exchange their Kop

tickets.               left us and went
                                     to>*ards the Kop end                      and I

then joined    the rear of        the or'owd.       Shortly after doing   so, 1 went to

check    my ticket was still in my trouser pocket and realised                that I

still    had        ticket.         We left the crowd and stood by the corner

shop by Vere Road to wait for                   and          We waited    for a few

minutes and then saw                and         walking along Leppings Lane.          We

met up with           and            and the four of us went back towards the

turnstile area.       It was even busier when we rejoined the crowd outside

the tur nsti1e s , as large rmfffber of supporters w er e / S X i 11 a r r i v i n g .

There was one m o unted J^q I iceman,        he was a Serjeant     I think, who was

trying to get the/Cfrowd into some sort of /Srder,               but it was §^tfopeless

task due to >Che amount of people.              There were foot o f f ij^ers a mo ngs t

the crow^ff but it was impossible for them to do anvjming either.

AgainAeeing     how busy it was, we said to                  th*t he had better go

round to the Kop end and join                            seemed worried about going

to the Kop end,     probably thinking he might get some aggrovation from

Forest supporters.          While          was hesitating, we were increasingly

being packed in by the amount of supporters still arriving behind us,

We were still a good distance from the turnstiles,                 probably just
                                                                                 PAGE      5

outside the perimeter gates.*         I saw people being J>eiTped up onto the

top of the turnsti les^flock,        but they were jwlunly youngsters being

lifted away frpflf the crush which, must have been bad at the front.

We were to the right hand side of the turnstile block, as you look

from the street, and were packed in, unable to move around.                 I did not

see any stewards    in the area of the turnstile.         At some t i M ^ r o u n d

3 bout ten to three    (1jt&U)r    I saw that there was a gate/'open at the

side of the turnstiles.       11 was one of the concer t j m a    type gates which

I now know to/be gate     ’C • .     I did not actually/see the gate being

opened,    bjwXtx it -------------
                     was open and people were walking throy^i' it.          We

thought it was another way into the ground and^fiade for the g a t e .

        came with us and said that he would y G y he was a Liverpool

supporter and could he go into that e r / [ of the ground even though he

had a Kop ticket.     We all walked t h o u g h   the gate expecting to hand

our tickets to somebody,      but the/e was nobody taking tickets so

just carried on through.          As schsn as we got through the gatp-S, we

realised that we were inside the ground and headed for j/fie central

tun/e 1 that runs underneath the West Stand.           I did not see any signs

g/ving directions to the terracing and assumed that the tunnel was the

only way to the terracing.          Apart from that,   everybody that came

through the gate was heading for the tunnel.



Once inside the ground,      I did not see any disorder or fighting.               I did

not see any people drinking or any drunkenness.



We all walked along the central tunnel towards the terracing.                    It was

busy in the tunnel,     but we were able to walk along it quite freely.                   I

did not see any Policemen or stewards at the entrance to the tunnel or

anywhere inside it.
                                                                                                       PAGE

At the end of the tunnel,            I was carried to the right hand side and

into what I now know as pen three.              I was carried by the momentum of

the people in the tujafiel.           I entered pen l^a-r^ee at about three oclock

(1500).    The pljar^ers were on the pitj^tf^and I think the game M y m a v e

just startaef.    Although the pen was packed,             the m o m e n t i ^ o f        the crowd

carried/me through the packe^r terraces and towards/the front of the

pens   It was one continoi            movement from the ej        of the tunnel to the

f ront of the pen, and/only took a matter of /m ome nts .                  I had be come

seperated from                       and         an dr I didn't know where they were

I ended up in a/position towards/ the/front of the pen whi ch                                  was a

couple of f£/et from the perim^te^'fence and about four to five feet

away from a dividing fence, which was to my right.                     I now realise that

was the dividing fence between pen three and pen two.                       I have marked

this position on the >eperate grid plan using the figure one.                                          As soon

more packed than normal football             crowds.   I do not h-SVe any

re col Sections of anythi ng that happened on the pitch while the match

was in progress.          I was more concerned with trying to get people to

move back to give me more room,             than trying to watch the match.                                        I

could see p e o p l e ^ r o u n d me in obvious difficulty,         but I did not

witness any ^deaths.            I do not remembe r any obv i ous surges,             bu> at some

stage I^Keard somebody near to me say that Peter BEARDSLjSY had hit

the/crossbar.     At about that time there was a surge/yrom behind.                                                    It

wasn't a strong surge and didn't cause^fife any r e a l               difficulty.                              After

a few minutes,     I started having             i culty with my breathing and f eIt,

over the front perimeter / e n c e and using my head as a f o o tij/s t .                                          My

hold it, but coul dn’t pull myself up because of the crus£u-                      W h i 1e I

was still trying to pul 1                    up,    I saw                     outside the

Pen.            climbed             the fence and 1earmi^over the top and started

trying to pull Me up.              I was still     cn       i in and a man

who had ixs-#n standing           in front of me said to use him to try and get

out.     I started kicking out and with the help of the mans back and

         I managed to pul 1 m y s e 1f away from the crowrf'Vrtd get a footh o1d

on the fence.         I was th^frable to climb o v ^ r the top of the fence and

drop onto the tra^K outside.               I t h e n t      down on the track to get my

presumed was still             in the Kop end.              and I found           on the

I would consider to be a criminal offence.

was I aware that a crush barrier had broken.

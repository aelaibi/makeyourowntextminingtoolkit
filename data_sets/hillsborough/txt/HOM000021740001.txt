The Right Hon. Lord Justice Taylor
Hillsbrough Stadium Disaster Enquiry           1V1
Hone Office
London                                                18 October 1989


Dear Lord Justice Taylor
I have obtained and read a copy of your interim report on the disaster on
April 15. It is an impressive, well thought out report.

My own position is that I am deeply opposed to the idea of a National
Membership Scheme. I am a Plymouth Argyle supporter living and practising
as a Chartered Accountant in the West Midlands.
May I offer as evidence to Part II of your enquiry a document that I
originally prepared for my MP Iain Mills of Meriden, but has since been
distributed by various MPs and organisations. It was written in March of
this year and I have not sought to change it in any way since Hillsbrough.

Unless explained in the narrative, my figures all cane from the Rothman's
yearbooks.
Also enclosed is a schedule of attendance and percentages that would apply
if a scheme were to be limited to the first division - the first block of
figures, or the first and second divisions - the second block of figures -
and so on.
The hand written figures represent percentages of the relevant totals of
matches played in each competition and lastly in all competitions. I was
seeking to find out the number of matches affected where "scheme" and
"non-scheme" clubs met each other in various competitions.

Also enclosed is a copy of a newspaper report on Argyle's membership scheme.

I am a member of the "scheme".
Clearly I would like you to cane out against a National Membership Scheme
for the reasons stated in my memorandum. I feel that we all must try to
attract more supporters to games including families, youngsters and women
but a scheme such as the one proposed will only discourage these types to go
leaving a hard core of the young, dedicated, "wealthy", young men who will
still go to matches. Indeed there is a danger, as I see it, of football
being left with the sort of young impressionable people that now follow
England abroad which is no way for football to progress.
                                                       /continued.
In correspondence addressed to Mr Moynihan, I had a reply from one of his
staff which indicated that if your report "recommended against the
introduction of the national membership scheme the Government would have to
consider his (your) views very carefully. It would also need to study why
he (you) had taken a different view from that expressed by Mr Justice
Popplewell".

Judging by the quality of your interim report I trust that you will do so
should you make such a recommendation.


Yours sincerely

                         THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS' BILL

Any arrest and conviction relating to football is unwanted and it is not
unreasonable that the Government should seek to minimise the problem as much as
it is practical.

                            The size of the problem
The measures are to be directed at the 92 league clubs and the Minister has
published figures of arrests in and around those grounds which for 1987/88
amount to just over 6,000.

This figure has been widely discredited as a means of determining the size of
the hooligan problem, the arguments being as follows

The figures relate to arrests only       Proceedings may be dropped because of a
                                         lack of or insufficient evidence.
                                         Sometimes there is simply no case to
                                         answer. The courts may find the accused
                                         innocent. The Minister cannot assume
                                         that arrest equals guilt.
The figures include offences by          The police admitted that included in
people not attending the match           their figures, although they were not
                                         seeking to hide this when reporting to
                                         the Minister, were arrests for car
                                         theft, thefts from supporters cars, pick
                                         pocketing and selling of unauthorised
                                         goods to fans. i.e. minor offences not
                                         related to football.

                                         More than 20% of the arrests at Villa
                                         Park, the club that topped the so called
                                         "League of Terror" were for attempted
                                         theft from supporters' cars.
The figures were wrong in respect        When the Millwall Chairman challenged
of sane clubs                            the Minister on Channel 4 news about his
                                         clubs' figure it emerged that Mr
                                         Moynihan had written to at least 4 clubs
                                         apologising for publishing incorrect
                                         figures. Unfortunately I can only
                                         remember the names of Millwall and
                                         Southampton but the Minister will know
                                         who the clubs were and the extent of the
                                         errors.

Clearly these figures should not be used to determine the number of relevant
offences at football matches.

So what is the figure for the number of fans found guilty of football related
crimes? This is a question the Football Supporters Association has been asking
the Minister and he seems unable or unwilling to supply the answer. However,
we do know the figure for exclusion orders, issued in England and Wales, for
football related offences in 1987/88, presumably administered as a result of
just such offences. This figure is 1,089 and was given to a consultative
conference held by Derbyshire County Council on 24 February 1989 by Tan Pendry
MP Chairman of the All Party Football Committee. Mr Pendry also indicated that
of these offences approximately 60% occurred outside and 40% inside grounds.




                                     -   1   -
This figure, only when viewed in the light of the numbers attending matches at
league clubs show that football is not the hotbed of hooliganism and disorder
that the Minister and the Department of the Environment [DOE] would have us
believe.

The following statistics relate to the 1987/88 season and apply only to
competitive matches at football league grounds e.g. FA cup games at non league
grounds are excluded as are games at Wembley and friendlies involving league
clubs.


       Competition                    Games       Attendance   Average
       League                         2,030       17,959,732     8,847
       Promotion/relegation play
         offs                            19          305,815    16,096
       FA cup                           121        1,852,423    15,309
       League (Littlewoods) Cup         157        1,445,767     9,209
       Simod Cup (1st & 2nd division)    38          235,920     6,208
       Sherpa Van Trophy
         (2nd & 3 rd division)           81         279,738     3,454

                                      2,446       22,079,395

Unfortunately I do not know whether the "Moynihan 6,000" relates to just league
games or all games at league grounds, and as can be seen above, the figure of
6,000 is misleading in any event, but giving the Minister the benefit of every
possible doubt the rate of arrest for league games, at most is
0.033% (6,000 17,959,732) or 0.00033, a figure that most statistics would
regard as negligible.

However, if the "Moynihan 6,000" includes all games at league grounds, as I
suspect it is, then the arrest rate is 0 .027 % (6,000 * 22,079,395) or 0 .00027 .

Again, arrest can never be assumed to equal guilt, so assuming that the
exclusion order figure is more representative, then the rate almost drops off
the end of the calculator at 0.005% (1,089 + 22,079,395) or 0.00005.
In other words one person in every 20,000 attending a football match is
convicted of an offence serious enough to warrant an exclusion order being made
against him. Given that the chance of arrest and subsequent conviction must
surely be very high in the light of the most intensive policing, including the
help of closed circuit television at all league grounds, segregation of fans
and fencing, then when the figure is compared to national crime rates for
violent offences the legislation would appear to be taking a sledgehammer to
crack a nut.

The Minister's answer to exclude the 1 fan in 20,000 fan from grounds, not the
street, is to implement legislation that will punish and inconvenience the law
abiding 19,999 fans, that will not effectively deter the hooligan, that will be
unworkable in practice and that will decimate at least one half of the league
clubs.

                              dubs will be ruined
After many years of decline, attendances at league games have risen since
1985/86 as follows
                                    Increase/      % on
                       Total       (decrease) previous year
          1987/88     17,959,732       580,514                3-3
          1986/87     17,379,218       890,641                5.4
          1985/86     16,488,577   (1 ,361 ,258 )            (7.6)        [lowest annual
          1984/85     17,849,835                                             total]

So far in 1988/89 attendances have continued to increase. For example in the
first division, up to 16 January 1988 , the average attendance was 19,914, but
for the season so far up to 15 January 1989 the average is 21,064, an increase
of 1,150 per match or 5*77%.

Also, up to 1 April 1989 the average league attendance was 9,120 compared to
8,825 at the same stage last season.

It is unrepresentative to compare cup attendances from year to year as these
will vary due to the quality and number of games played dependent on the draw
and possible replays.

The DOE and the Minister have asserted that after the implementation of the
scheme crowds will cone back to the game after a "small short term downside
effect". To you and I this means a decrease, thank you Sir Humphrey. The
return of the fans is, of course, pure speculation but following the Minister's
logic, surely a 100% membership scheme banning away supporters altogether will
work better and thus bring these missing fans back quicker.

Two clubs to go down this route have been Luton and Colchester, although
Luton's scheme allows a member to admit 3 guests at the turnstiles, a
"privilege" denied by the Bill. So have the crowds flooded back to these
clubs?

Attendance figures at league games for the same period as above have been as
follows:-
                                     Luton

Luton          Despite a stable league position, attendances had decreased by
               7% in 1986/87 and by a further 21% in 1987/8 8 . The 1987/88
               season was the clubs most successful ever when they won the
               Littlewoods cup, reached the final of the Simod cup and the semi­
               final of the FA cup and played at Wembley in the League
               Centenary tournament. The club have since sold good players,
               presumably because of financial difficulty, and the directors
               described the feat of reaching another Littlewoods cup final
               this year as "a Godsend". The club have now sold their ground
               for £3.25 million to repay the bank overdraft and directors'
               loans. In Luton's case the "small short term downside effect"
               is nothing short of disastrous.

               Yet the Minister seems not to know of this alarming decrease.
               On BBC Radio 2's programme "Sports Report" on December 3 1987 he
               proudly proclaimed the success of Luton's scheme by stating that
               the average gate for 1987/88 had increased by over 1,000 on the
               previous year's figure. To date I have not heard him correct
               this mis-statement and thus put the record straight. Perhaps he
               could now, or let us all know where he gets his figures from.

               League attendances for the two years generally have increased by
               9% but have decreased at Luton by 27%. Does the Minister agree?

               Fortunately for Luton there are now many away fans who beat the
               ban as away supporters fans as evidenced by the loud cheering
               that can be heard on TV when the opposition score. The cards
               are now freely available among fans, especially in the London
               area so it is quite easy to borrow one and take 3 friends with
               you to support your club.

Colchester    Surely the experience that Colchester are now experiencing has
              rang alarm bells throughout the lower divisions. Having adopted
              their scheme at the beginning of the 1987/88 season the few
              supporters left saw their team climb the table to lead the
              fourth division by Christmas 1987 winning 12 and drawing 2 of
              their fifteen games from October onwards. Surely, according to
              the Minister's logic, the fans would flood back to support a
              winning team. Sadly for the club this never happened. Even the
              home games on December 28 and January 1st, times when clubs can
              normally expect bumper gates, produced 2,599 and 2,287
              attendances respectively, not even up to the previous season's
              average when the team wasn't doing nearly as well. In fact the
              attendance of 2,599 was the highest of the season, and the club
              was forced to sell players as money was being lost on a week to
              week basis. The result was that the club only won another 5
              games all season and finished 9th.

              The club abandoned its membership scheme in the middle of the
              1987/88 season but without any money to replace players the team
              has struggled and is currently lying bottom of the league along
              with Darlington desperately trying to avoid relegation from the
              Football League altogether.

In Colchester's plight lies the unfairness of the scheme, in that the lower
division clubs do not attract enough spectators to be affected by hooliganism
yet will lose revenue through a drop in attendances as well as suffer the costs
that the system will bring. Thus the price for many clubs will be extinction.
                               Cost to each dub

The cost to football will be enormous in terms of the drop in attendances, the
cost of the equipment and extra police costs.

Attendances   As indicated above, attendances have dropped by 27% at Luton and
              36% at Colchester. It is of course impossible to say by how
              much the decrease would be at each club should the scheme be
              implemented, but using Luton and Colchester as a guide and
              bearing in mind Luton's capacity for attracting casual
              supporters by allowing in guests of members, I would estimate
              that at 30% decrease across the board is probably a conservative
              estimate. Also assume that each person pays a minimum of £5
              covering gate money and perhaps a programme, lottery ticket, cup
              of tea etc, again a conservative estimate.

              The drop in revenue for each club would therefore be as follows,
              based on the average attendance for each division for 1987/8 8 .

installation of existing computer equipment where applicable, the
              installation and purchase of new standard equipment and the
              alteration of grounds to suit the requirements this new system.
              The Minister's favourite (and only) hope is the GEC "Smartcard"
              system, the equipment for which would have to be negotiated
              before a spectator pays at a turnstile. As these turnstiles are
              usually situated at the entrance to grounds they will have to be
              moved back further inside the ground. Often this will not be
              possible without large scale structural alteration to stands, or
              terracing or steps leading to terracing. The equipment cannot
              be situated outside the existing perimeter of grounds as in most
              cases the club does not own the land and often this area is the
              street!

Extra police   At present, clubs pay for the cost of policing inside grounds,
costs          The technology will mean that extra police will be needed inside
                the ground to check on card failures etc and probably more
                police will be needed outside to deal with the possibility of
                crowd trouble following a system failure.

               Take one club, Manchester United, who have 92 turnstiles in
               operation. The club estimate that 3 extra policemen will be
               needed per turnstile, the first to apprehend and deal with the
               first cardholder whose card fails, the second to replace the
               first officer and so on. Some smaller clubs might not need as
               much as 3 but in any event, there must be at least 2 per
               turnstile as it would be impractical and dangerous to shut down
               an entrance due to one card failure with people outside queueing
               to get in.

               The cost of police varies from club to club but I would suggest
               that at Manchester United, 276 extra officers will cost the club
               a lot of money over the course of a season. More importantly I
               would like to think that they would be better employed in
               preventing and detecting crime in Manchester rather than
               watching lights flash on and off inside a football ground.

FMA            Then there is the cost of running the Football Membership
               Authority [FMA]. This must be an organisation that is large
               enough to cope with the movements of 5-6 million potential
               members, and their re-application every 2-3 years i.e. the
               organisation must be as large as the DVLC in Swansea.

               If the cost of the FMA is not included, the this must also be
               accounted for, unless it is to be fully sponsored as has been
               suggested by the Minister.

               How much does the DVLC cost to run per annum I wonder as this
               figure will give potential sponsors an idea of what they would
               be letting themselves in for.
The total cost of football will therefore be in excess of £65,000,000 excluding
the cost of the extra police and the FMA. Clearly some of the largest first
division clubs will be able to cope with these extra costs as they have the
capability to attract the necessary sponsorship but other clubs will struggle
to survive. For example, a drop in attendances costing £110,745 to an average
fourthdivision club will not be able to be recovered in sponsorship and when
an additional equipment cost is added of £275,000 the prospect is truly
terrifying.

The Minister has totally ignored this in the pious hope that all will be well.
I hope I have demonstrated that it will not be so.

                                Civil liberties
The bill provides for an administrator to be appointed who will be in charge of
running the FMA. To date we have not heard from the Minister about the
constitution of the FMA but whatever its constitution, it will be controlled by
Minister, under the Secretary of State for the Environment as he must appoint
the Administrator.

Constitution   A private limited company, PLC, or a company limited by
               guarantee? Perhaps an authority such as FIMBRA, LAUTRO etc.
               Can the Minister tell us?
Funding        If by sponsorship, what if there are insufficient funds or no
               sponsors at all? If not by sponsorship then by whan?
               Can the Minister tell us?
Cost           What are the expected set up and annual running costs.
               Can the Minister tell us?

The FMA will be a body which must have access to police and criminal records in
order to administer the scheme. IVfy understanding is that no form of limited
company presently enjoys such access and that an "FMA Ltd" would create a
precedent. Can the Minister confirm this?

However, the FMA will have the power to refuse to issue or withdraw membership
from any person whether or not they have been convicted of a criminal offence.
The Authority, accountable only to the Minister, therefore has the power to ban
any person fron a ground whether or not they have been convicted of any
offence. To date we have had no guidance as to who can recommend
disqualification. Will it be the police, the clubs, the FA, the league, a
supporter, a member of the police or just plain anybody?

Supporters will be subject to a separate "legal" system. There will be no
judge or jury although an apparent "right" of appeal. Who to for goodness
sake. What sort of "offences" will be considered to be bad enough to warrant
disqualification from membership but be insufficient to bring a prosecution in
the usual way. Can the Minister tell us?

A disqualification will be considered to amount to a prosecution for a petty
criminal offence in the eyes of society and will deny a person the right to
watch a football match, a perfectly legal pursuit, without any safeguards or
rights enjoyed by us all in an open court. What if a club has no objection to
an individual's attendance at matches and indeed desires it? Under the
proposed legislation it would be an offence to go to a match even if he wanted
to go, the club wanted him to go and he had not been convicted of any criminal
offence. The solution to the problem would be that the club would make him or
her a guest thus excluding him fron membership even though they had been
disqualified. Ridiculous.

Can the Bill be right, just and fair? To my mind it cannot be so and makes a
sinister precedent for the future. How can this Government propose legislation
that would enable members of the public to be denied access to another person's
private property, i.e. a football ground, without any legal authority? It is
not right to legally punish an individual who has done nothing illegal. Would
the Minister agree that individuals should not be excluded from membership
without the support of a football related prosecution?

                            No deterrent to hooligans

Firstly the Bill does nothing to stop convicted hooligans travelling to matches
and causing violence outside or away from grounds. However as the Bill is
meant to be only one part in a package of measures, it is tempting to overlook
this amission as the Government have but to do so is naive in the extreme.

For a start most hard-bitten, violent hooligans have not the slightest interest
in football itself as any police officer will tell you. They will therefore
still travel to games but will cause trouble outside and away from grounds
where they cannot be controlled, contained or monitored by CCTV so there is
less likelihood of arrest and prosecution. The suggestion by the Minister that
they will not travel to games but will sit at hone peacefully and watch TV is
ludicrous.

The fraudulent or criminal obtaining of a membership card will also be regarded
as a challenge and part of the fun for those disqualified hooligans who
actually want to see the game. I can just imagine somebody sabotaging the
equipment so that when a system fails, his friends can obtain entry. This is
pure vandalism I know, but people vandalise phone boxes for sane reason.

The DOE readily admits that photographs cannot be checked on entry so why not
mug soneone on the way to a game, obtain entry and then throw the card away
before the canputer has had time to register the theft or, borrow soneone elses
card and use that. Better still, why not obtain another card using a false
name and a friend's address. If the friend is aware of his intentions as a
hooligan then he is hardly likely to object and if he is not, which of his
friends, or relatives would not accept a hard luck story of how the card was
confiscated especially as he might not have committed a criminal offence?

If the cards are to be easily obtainable then the scheme will be open to wide
abuse. If membership of the scheme is going to be subject to tight checking
and verification procedures then many will not apply in the first instance.
Even with intense vetting of applications, individuals have easily obtained
passes to airports and to the Houses of Parliament. This point should not be
lost on the Minister.

                                 Little quirks

The following are sane miscellaneous points which help to demonstrate that the
Minister arguments in favour of a scheme are illogical.

Will the technology cope?        The largest crowd that has passed through
Any system must be tested        Luton's turnstiles was 13,447 on March 28,
                                 1987. The average attendance at first
                                 division league games in 1987/88 was 19,272
                                 and 54,703 watched Arsenal's game with
                                 Liverpool. The real test is therefore yet to
                                 cane.
How do you test a system?        To ensure a system works it must be 100%
                                 tested under extreme conditions, in this case
                                 by big clubs with large attendances i.e.
                                 Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool, Spurs, Manchester
                                 United. I feel sorry for those poor away
                                 supporters who have to buy a card just for
                                 these games.
Don't leave home without it         If you visit friends or relations and do not
                                    take your card, e.g. Christmas or Easter, what
                                    happens even someone suggests you go to a
                                    match; you can't go.

What if a club cannot afford        Sane clubs have no spare funds at all so even
the cost of implementation          if they wish to comply, they find themselves
                                    unable to incur debts without any hope of
                                    payment under the Companies Act. They will
                                    therefore not receive a licence and will have
                                    to apply for a non-league place if they are to
                                    survive.
Why just cover sane games?          What about pre-season friendlies,
                                    testimonials, international games not at
                                    Wembley? Sane of these draw bigger crowds than
                                    league games although they do not appear to be
                                    covered.
Why exclude FA cup games            The answer is that it is impossible to include
between league and non-league       then despite the fact that statistically they

The number of teams in each division whose average league attendance is less
than the average shown above is as follows:

Apart from demonstrating the growing strength of non-league football the
figures prove, when conpared with attendances in the lower divisions, that
these games should be included for any integrity of the scheme to be
maintained. Yet practically they cannot be because of the installation of the
equipment involved. On this fact alone, the scheme should sink without trace.

The Bill does not enjoy any popular support because It Is seen by the vast and
overwhelming majority of people with any knowledge of football to be thoroughly
bad.

The Minister says that the FA and league are co-operating with him and
therefore support the Bill, albeit grudgingly, but this Is not the case. It Is
only that bodies would rather be associated with the FMA as at least they will
have sane say In their own destiny.

What is frustrating is that despite opposition from everyone connected with the
game the Government is determined to press ahead with the legislation. The
clubs and police especially are the experts on crowd control and I would have
hoped that their opinion would prevail in such circumstances, especially when
you consider that the police are independent and would surely have welcomed the
legislation if they thought it would help law and order and crowd control.

                                Recommended amendment

    There is an easy solution to the problems posed by the Bill, this being as
    follows:-

    Parts II and III of the Bill should be passed to enable restriction orders to
    be placed on individuals travelling abroad to watch matches. Part II can then
    be simply extended to this country enabling restriction orders to be placed on
    persons convicted of football related offences - such orders would make then
    report to the designated reporting agencies when matches are played i.e. on
    each Saturday and during mid-week evenings as appropriate. There are a number
    of advantages over the proposed legislation.

    1.       It deals only with the hooligans.

                  OBJECTIONS TO THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS' BILL

Supporters of the Bill have sought to mislead the public in relation to the
size of the problem of football hooliganism. The public are being conned.

The Bill does not address the cause of hooliganism.

Any scheme will not deal with violence outside grounds.

Over the last 3 seasons attendances have risen; proof that public confidence in
football is increasing.

Attendances will decrease dramatically causing clubs to fold. Attendance
figures for Luton and Colchester clearly show this.

The cost of implementation of the scheme will cost in excess of £65 million
which most clubs cannot afford.

The costs of the scheme will divert finance from clubs' attempts to provide
better facilities for supporters.

Supporters can be disqualified from membership without ccmnitting a criminal
offence for any reason deemed suitable by clubs, police or the FMA. This will
ban then from grounds for 2-3 years.

The identity of the cardholder will not be checked against the card on entry to
the ground enabling hooligans to enter with borrowed, stolen or duplicate
cards.

Supporters are currently segregated, fenced in, watched by police and filmed on
video surveillance cameras. Any hooliganism inside grounds is therefore
capable of being dealt with.

The computer technology, designed to deal with large crowds, does not yet exist
and has to be developed and tested.

Any systen failure will potentially lead to disorder and seriously endanger
public safety.

Extra police will be needed to operate the scheme at grounds.

A scheme cannot deal with matches where non-league clubs are involved e.g. FA
cup matches, thus rendering the proposals nonsensical.




YOUR MP HAS A VOTE - YOU DO NOT. YOU MUST PROTEST TO HIM/HER ABOUT THE SCHEME.

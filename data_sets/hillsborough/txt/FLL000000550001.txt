                                          Hillsborough Disaster Fund

     At the meetings of clubs held at Old Trafford yesterday, it was agreed
that all donations in respect of the Hillsborough Disaster, both from
supporters and clubs themselves, should be centralised through The Football
League. I shall be grateful, therefore, if all such donations could be
forwarded to me - cheques should be made payable to The Football League Ltd.

     All monies received will be forwarded to the Official Disaster Fund as
soon as possible.

     Any club which has already made arrangements to forward money direct
to the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal should notify me of the amount sent.

                                                    Yours sincerely,




                                                           J.D. Dent

                 On Sunday 9th July we held our second Sports Day for employees
                 and their families at Queensbury Sports Ground.

                 As well as many games and races a number of employees along with
                 friends and family ran stalls to raise money for local charities
                 of their choice.

                 The enclosed cheque to the value of £ 85.20 was raised at a
                 Bottle stall and is sent with best wishes.




                 Yours sincerely

      Dear David,

      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

      Please find enclosed a cheque for £6,000.00 In respect of donations received
      yesterday from the customers and staff of the North of England Building Society
      branches in the north east.

      This donation came "out of the blue" and has obviously not been referred to                    in
      any of our previous correspondence on the amount of donations collected.

      I would be grateful if you could let me have an acknowledgement letter which                    I
      can pass on to the Building Society for display in their branches.

      With thanks and kind regards.

      Yours sincerely,
                                                                                               itJ

            Dear Sir/Madam,

            Re; Enclosed Cheque for £                5 0    'l-S

            On Sunday 14th of May this year, the six Rotary Clubs local to Brighton and
            Hove organised a sponsored walk along the seafront mostly in aid of the Brighton
            Heart Support Trust. On the day, over 250 walkers turned out and we believe that
            some £8,000.00 was raised. The lion's share of this sum will go to the B.H.S.T.,
            but each walker had the option to nominate a second charity to receive 50$ of
            the total raised by that walker.

            To this end we are pleased to enclose our cheque in respect of .money raised by
            our walkers for your good cause.

            To save your administration costs, please do not feel it necessary                             to
            acknowledge this letter.

                                                                                                          <Vv.% ^

              I refer to your letter dated the 27th of July.

              As I understood the situation, all First Division Clubs were
              expected to donate in the region of £25,000 to the Hillsborough
              Disaster Fund. Our Club have donated an amount just short of this
              figure and have to advise you that there will be no .further
              donations.

Dear Sir                                                              1 1 AUG 1989
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL FOND.

Please find the enclosed cheque for £3,500 on behalf of the above Club.

 In any final accounting process, this amount should be added to the sum of
 £1,583.79 collected by our Supporters Club at a match at The Hawthorns in May.

 The original arrangement was that the Club would become the custodian of any Cash
 collected, and that we would forward it to you as part and parcel of an overall
 payment by West Bromwich Albion F.C.

 Instead, for reasons best known to themselves - and which I don't begin to
 understand - members of our Supporters Club who are also members of the F.S.A.
 took control of the money and banked it in the name of the latter organisation.

 I understand that the £1,583.79 has already been sent to Hillsborough.

 Although we are well aware that the overriding consideration is that all money
 collected should be made available to disaster victims, thefact is that the
 actions of local members of the F.S.A. have caused some resentment. I would not
 wish to see this (understandable) concern heightened by anyincorrect attribution
 of the Hawthorns collection.

 No doubt, you will note the points I have made and make any allowance you feel
 may be appropriate.


 Yours faithfully,



DR.JOHN.JVEVANS

HILTfSBQRQUGH DISASTER FUND

I am replying to your letter, addressed to the Secretary regarding the Hillsborough
Disaster Fund, and I am also enclosing a cheque for £3344.40 which we received
from the local Post Office which has been raised by the Post Office personnel
linked into our fund-raising target here.

We have already provided you with £10,332.00 and this therefore brings our total
to £13,676.40.   Please bear in mind that this is from a Second Division Club's
fund-raising efforts, even though we subsequently won promotion to Division One.

I think you should publish a list of Clubs’ donations so that everyone can see
what has been received and hew much the shortfall is..  It m y then be appropriate
to levy a charge against those Clubs who have not made a real effort to subscribe
their required proportion of our overall target figure.

My own view is that every 1st Division Club should have provided a minimum
£25,000 and every Second Division Club a minimum £10,000 with the balance
apportioned in a similar way between the Third and Fourth Divisions. It is not
acceptable for sane Clubs to do nothing and for the League to then make up the
difference, which means those of us like Crystal Palace who have exceeded our
target, would be.paying a further equal sum as Clubs who have done nothing
because we will no doubt receive a reduced distribution of the 3% pool, or from
whatever source the shortfall is made up.

One other observation is that the fund could be so high that it no longer needs
any additional contribution from us over and above that already provided.

Would you. please ensure that my canments are placed in front of the Management
               re any further decisions are taken. I am not aware of any further
               into us over and above the additional cheque enclosed.

 Dear David

                                      HILLSBOROUGH D IS A S T E R APPEAL

       With reference to your letter dated 25th July 1989
 regarding the contributions The Football Association has made
 or intends to make to the above fund.

       A payment of £250,000 has been made to date. No further
 sums have been earmarked although the Appeal will no doubt be
 given serious consideration when the monies from the Charity
 Shield are being allocated.

       You may also wish to note that we have passed on money
 to the Fund from a number of different sources totalling over
 £93,500. These have included U.E.F.A., Bayern Munich,
 Sportwetten GMBH and Boston United.

                If I can assist further please let me know.

                Kind regards,


                                                  Yours sincerely

Dear Norman

Re: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

 I thank you for your letter dated 27th July, and am happy to confirm
 that we have already paid over to the Hillsborough Disaster Fund, a
 total sum of £30,568.45.

We originally donated the sum of £25,000 from the Club on the Monday
immediately following the disaster, and the balance of £5,568.45
was raised via other forms of collections, donations, auctions etc.
etc. I trust this is of some help to you, and of course send to
you my best wishes,

 Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs,

     We are pleased to enclose our cheque for £216.96 in support of Hillsborough
Disaster Fund.

     This amount is the result of almost 100 employees from our company donating
one hours pay in the hope that this will in some way help those affected by this
appalling disaster.

     We would be grateful if a receipt for this amount could be forwarded for
display on our company notice board.




                                                                        Yours faithfully

Dear Sir,




                     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER APPEAL




I have pleasure in enclosing cheque value £1940. being monies raised
from a collection and match held at our ground for the above appeal.

We have also sent direct to Sheffield cheques which were made payable
to the Disaster Fund and totalled £55. So a total of £1995. was raised.




Yours Eaithfudly,




                                                                      2

Dear Sir,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER FUND

I am enclosing our cheque for £5,761.02 as Leicester City F.C.'s donation to
The Football League Appeal In connection with the above Fund.

For* your information, half of the sum is made up from collection receipts and
a voluntary increased admission charge at our match against Oldham Athletic,
which the club has matched to reach the final figure.

We are also accepting other small donations from various sources and expect
to send a further smaller cheque in due course.

Yours farfthfully,




A.K. BENNETT

Dear David,

Hillsborough Disaster Fund

In connection with the above, I have pleasure in enclosing
herewith a cheque for £25,000.

For your information, a collection was held at our ground
on Saturday 22nd April when we played Queen's        Park
Rangers and almost £7,000 was raised.     It was decided,
however, that the Club should make up this amount to
£25,000.

It would be appreciated if you could forward this donation
to the Official Disaster Fund.

Yours sincerely,




Graham Hover
Secretary

                    Dear Norman

                    Hillsborough Disaster Fund Appeal

                   We held a collection at our game last Wednesday and another one on
                   Saturday.

                    The collection on Wednesday raised £3,581.00 for which I enclose
                    four cheques made out to the Hillsborough Disaster Fund Appeal.

                    Our collection on Saturday raised £1,222.81 for which I enclose
                    cheques made out to the Hillsborough Disaster Fund Appeal.

                    I understand from my colleagues who attended the Football League
                    meeting in Manchester last Thursday that we have been requested to
                    send these cheques to you for onward transmission to the fund.

Dear David,

                              Hillsborough Disaster Fund

Further to your letter of 21 April, on c ontacting the League

Association which we did and subsequently sent our cheque for
£10,000 to Liverpool F C ,

We are having a collection at our match on Saturday, and will try
to ensure that the proceeds are forwarded to yourselves.

Your sincerely,



     pmth,
      NG DIRECTOR

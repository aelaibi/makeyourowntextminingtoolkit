From about            2    pm      (1400)         I noticed more                 and    more        supporters              in P e n i s t o n e

Road     near      to      the      turnstiles               attempting           to    purchase              tickets        for     the

match       from      other         supporters,                this       group    grew        steadily             in n u m b e r       in the

build       up to         k ic k    off     time        at     3    pm.     (1500)

At    3.02       pm    <i302)         Police           Sergeant           HOYLAND          ordered        us    to       c l os e    the

turnstile,,                fearing         a    "rush''         from      the     ticketiess            supporters              still

outside          the       g ro u n d .        Th e    turnstiles            were       duly       closed an d            the       s e ri a l

assembled             inside        the        g r o u n d at       the     rear     of      the    turnstiles.                 At       that

point       I heard Sergeant                      HOYLAND make               of    comment          that       ' t h e y ’ve        opened

the    gates          at    the L e p p i n g s            Lane     end."         Police         Sergeant           H O Y L A N D was             the

only     officer            in s e r i a l        10 e q u i p p e d        with a         personal        radio,           and an

earpiece          which         when working                  correctly           cuts       off    the    loud          speaker          of          the

radio       only       permitting               the        wearer      to    hear       the      radio     traffic.




Sergeant          HOYLAND           ordered            the      serial       to    go      onto     the     3K o p ’ r a t h e r          than

to    the a r e a          allocated            for        meals,      as    we    began         to w a l k     around          the       side

of    the    *K o p ' stand,               I heard Sergean t                    HOYLAND          say    “S e r i a l      10,       t h a t ’s

us,    come       on       there's         trouble            at    the L e p p i n g s       Lane      end."            The    se r ia l

then     ran      onto        the     "Kop*           th r ou gh a gate            onto       the      pitch an d           began

running          up    the      centre          of     the      pitch       towards          Leppings          Lane       Stand.              As          I

entered          the       playing         area        I noticed            several          Police       Officers             at    the          far

end    of    the       ground and               numerous            fans     also       on    the      ground        n e ar     the       goal

at    th e L e p p i n g s        Lane         end,        in a d d i t i o n     there       were      numerous            f an s       on       top

of    the    fencing            and       from my           position         1 formed            the    opinion           that       there

was    severe          disorder            taking           p l ace    and a       pitch         invasion was               i m i ne n t ,            I

approached             the      s c e ne    with           that     thought        uppermost            in my m i n d .              As       1

passed       the       centre         line        I became            aware       t h at     there      we re       no    players             of

either       s i de        on the         pitch and a s s u m e d               that       the     kick    off       had       been

delayed.




I reached             the     goalmouth               of    the L e p p i n g s      Lane        e nd at a          point       S or 3

yards       to    the       left      of       the     goal        in the       *6 y a r d 5 box.              At    that       p o in t          I

realised          that        what        was     taking           place    was      not a         pitch       invasion,             1

noticed          numerous           people            of    both      sexes       being       crushed ag ai ns t                the       fence,
                                                                                                                               PAGE            4
                                                                                                                               S3 4 4 9

some     of    these       we re     bl u e      coloured and appeared                      to    be    dead.




I then        noticed        several          officers           around an          open     gate       from       the      t e r r a c i ng

leading        onto       the     pitch,         these      officers         were        attempting           to    pull       p eo p l e

through        the      g at e    and    o n to    the      playing        ar e a ,      I went        and    joined         them        to

give     what       assistance           I could.




On arrival           at    the     g a te     I saw      one      young      man      lyi ng      on the          track      on the

pitch      s id e    of    the     fence,         he was         aged about           SO years          with       dark      h ai r      and

wearing        green       trousers,             he w a s    alright         except         his       left    leg was          trapped

in the        gateway,           with    other       officers           I attempted              to    pull       this

youth      free      but     it wa s        obviously            causing        him      severe        p a i n as       he wa s

screamin g .




As    there     were       numerous           officers           with     that      youth        I could          see    I would          be

of    no a s s i s t a n c e .      At      that     p oint       I moved          to my     left a f ew y a r d s

towards        the      S o u t h S ta n d ,      behind         the    fencing          a young        blond       girl       shouted

at me,        " H e l p me,       please         help me."             I saw       several        officers          in the

vicinity,           mostly Special                Constables,             I shoujred at               them    to a s s i s t        me    to

pull     down       the    fence.           Approximately               8 officers           attempted             this,       it was

not    however          possible         to m o v e      the      fsTnce,       despite          several          concerted

efforts.            Realising           the      fence      was    too     solid         I climbed           the    fence        and

reached        o ve r     the     t op a n d      down      to    the     girl      wh o    had       shouted.           I managed

to    reach     her       r i g ht a r m a n d       pulled        her     up      the     fencing          and    o nt o    the      top,

I then        rolled       her     off      to    other      officers           waiting          below who          caught          her,

she    was     a white           female,         with    fair      hair,        approximately                5'4    tall,        aged

about      18 y e a r s      and    wearing          a   red      tracksuit           with       b l a ck    markings          on     it.

Seeing        she    was a lr i g h t         I leaned           back     o ve r    the     fence       and       grabbed        the

arm    of a n o t h e r      female         and    repeated            the m a n o e u v r e      with       her,       however,

she    w as    quite       he av y ,     approximately                 9 stone        and    in       lifting       her      o ve r      the
                                                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                   /                                                                      S3449

fence       some       wire     ’s p i k e s ’ o r y a h e             tap     of    the       fe n c e    impaled my                right

armpit.           I managed             to    get      this        girl        over       the     fence         but    wa s      unable           to

repeat        that      operation             due          to     pain a n d         loss       of s t r e n g t h         in m y arm.

That       girl    wa s      a white          female         with             short m ousy           hair,       aged about                20

years       and    wearing           a dark          leather             jacket          and    black        trousers.




I then dropped                 off      the       fence      and         moved       a    few more          yards          towards             the

South       Stand,        there         in si d e      the       terrace            I saw a young                woman          on    the

ground        close       to    the      fence             and         low w a l l . Sh e       was       breathing             and       in      no

immediate          danger,           but w as              t r a p p e d u n d e r the          edge       of    the       crush          by the

legs,       t he r e    were       several           people            apparently              dead       on her       legs          or    near        t

her,       she    also       was     screaming              for        help.




Being       unable        to    get      to       t hi s    girl         I knelt          beside          her    and       told       her       that

I would          get    help       for       her     as     s o o n as         I could,           I told         her       to    get as

c l os e    up to       the     wall         as    she      could and               to    put     her      elbows          around          her

h ead,      this       she     did.          She     was     a white            female          aged a p p r o x i m a t e l y 20

years       with       long     straight             brown         hair,        she       was     wearing           what        appeared              to

be a       green       track       suit.




I then        returned          to      the       6 yard         bo>: in the              goalmouth             where       I sa w a

Police        Inspector            whom       I do         not     know        but       describe          as    being          about          6 *1

tall       with    d ar k      h ai r    and       clean         shaven,            he was        trying         to    help          direct

rescue        operations.                I s h o u t e d at              him    to       use    his       rad i o     to    get       some

cutting          jaws     to    the      sc en e ,         this        he     tried       to    do    but       from what             I could

hear       of R a d i o      Traffic,             I do      not        know whet he r             he was         successful                or     not




From       there       I went        to a g a te            near         to    the S o u t h S t a n d           where          living          and

                         quick     search         of    his       clothing         but    wa s    unable         to       find anyth in g                 in his

                         monitored          his       breath       rate      at    100    breaths         per m i n u t e              and      his      puls e   rate

                         fluctuated             between       100-190         beats       per m i n u t e .

Eventually              a group        of    fans      arrived         by the          body       of    the m a n          I had

covered w ith my an ora k                      and     placed        him     on a s i g n           board         they      had

utilised           as    a stretcher.                 I shouted         at       them       to    l e ave        h i m as     he wa s

dead and           to    take     my yo uth who              was     breathing,              this       they       did and            ran

b a ck    towards          the P e n i s t o n e       Road     en d    of       the    pitch,          I di d       not      see       that

y ou th again.




I then         returned          to    the     side     gate       where         I s aw      some       fans       carrying             away

the      girl      I had       previously             seen we ar in g            the    green          track       suit,         she w a s

alive        but a p p e a r e d       to    h av e    broken        legs.            I could          be    of    no a s s i s t a n c e

at    the      terraces          then       so w a l k e d a b o u t       on     the       pitch,          in a s t a t e        of

sh o c k ,     1 was       even more           deeply        shocked         by       the    sound          of    f an s    from        both

ends      of      the    pitch        taunting         each other.                1 was          then a p p r o a c h e d         toy

a drunken           fa n    calling          me a      'murdering            bastard.'                 I asked         hi m      if     he    had

been assist in g               the     injured         but     was     replied          to w i t h a             torrent         of a b u s e .

He    was      ushered away             by a n o t h e r       fa n who          apologised             to rne for            his

behaviour,              this     fan    i n f o r m e d me      he w a s         an    off       duty       fireman         from

Liverpool.




I then         returned          to a       line      of^olice          Officers             across          the     centre           of     the

pitch        to    keep     fans       separate.             I stayed            there       for       some       time      t h e n was

sent      o n to    Penistone           Road       to a s s i s t      in d i r e c t i n g         traffic          to a l l o w

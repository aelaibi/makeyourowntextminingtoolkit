HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER ENQUIRY


The Home Secretary will wish to be aware that Sir Peter Taylor
will take evidence from a delegation of the All-Party Football
Committee on 14 November commencing at 5pm. I understand that
it has been put to Mr Pendry, the Committee1s Chairman, that
Sir Peter would find it helpful if the delegation contained
members from all political parties represented on the
Committee.

I have informed my opposite number in the Department of the
Environment of this.

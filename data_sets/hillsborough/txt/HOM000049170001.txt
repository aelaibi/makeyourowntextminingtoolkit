EVIDENCE OF DETECTIVE CHIEF SUPERINTENDENT   M. J. FOSTER




                           1
 1    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Perhaps you would explain your
 2         position and tell me very briefly what you did?
 3    A   I am a Detective Chief Superintendent. I am presently
 4         seconded to the West Midland Regional Crime Squad, but in
 5         April 1989 I was a West Midlands Police Officer (and still
 6         am), and my role in the Hillsborough Stadium disaster was
 7         as the senior detective responsible for the investigation.
 8         That included the assistance to the judicial inquiry by
 9         Taylor LJ, and the service to counsel that represented or
10         worked to Taylor LJ, which I think was Mr. Collins.
ill   Q   Yes.
12    A   And the Treasury Solicitors. In addition to that, my
13         responsibility was the presentation at a later stage of
14         the file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the
15         overall responsibility for each of the deceased's files
16         for the Coroner. In addition to that, for other
17         complaints against police officers and the whole
18         investigation was supervised by the Police Complaints
19         Authority.
20              In respect of statements made by both South Yorkshire
21         police officers and South Yorkshire ambulance personnel,
22         my recollection is that legal representatives of both
23         organisations were employed to look at an deal with
24         statements made by those police officers or ambulance
25         personnel as they were submitted to Taylor's LJ Inquiry.
26         Those statements eventually were forwarded to the West
27         Midlands Police main incident room which was based in
28         Birmingham, and where necessary following the judicial
29         inquiry, it was necessary to re-interview either police
30         officers or ambulance personnel, then police officers from
31         the West Midlands were actioned to take further statements
32         in either clarification or in additional evidence areas.
33         For example, where police officers were recognised on
34         video footage dealing with a particular deceased or
35         injured person for purposes of continuity and evidence.




                                      2
 1    Q   So far as the club was concerned, I understand that some
 2        at any rate of the statements were taken by the solicitors
                                      A) (fct    ' f f* <X NAA/J i t /)u
 3        of the club, and supplied to^Mr. Holdswurth?                I
 4    A   Yes. Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and Eastwoods, who
 5        were the structural engineers for the ground, I believe
 6        both were legally represented. I cannot recall at the
 7        moment whether we were involved in the taking of their
 8        statements or indeed whether they submitted - and I tend
 9        to think they submitted - their own statements to the
10        judicial inquiry. Again, I think, for example, with
11        Eastwoods, with the Health & Safety Executive who we
>12       brought in to assist us in explanation of the details to
13        do with structure, barriers, etc, we would have
14        interviewed relevant people as witnesses, but also, of
15        course, at some stage the Secretary to the club and I
16        cannot recall now whether someone from Eastwoods would not
17        have been interviewed under caution in respect of the
18        possible offences that were alleged.
19    Q   So would be this be the position, that so far as the South
20        Yorkshire Police Officers' statements are concerned, you
21        knew that they had been vetted - if that is the
22        appropriate word - by the solicitors, or under the
23        solicitors' advice?
24    A   We would have been aware that those statements were made
25        by those police officers with legal representation.
26    Q   Did you ever see the original recollections that they had
27        made before any alterations were made?
28    A   Whether we received the first written recollection they
29        made or whether we received a sanitised version, I can't
30         at this moment recall. I think at that particular stage
31         we were servicing Taylor LJ and particularly Mr. Collins,
32         the QC that was taking the lead in respect of the Inquiry,
33         and the Treasury Solicitors, and I think we would ha-ve
34         taken those statements from Treasury Solicitors because
35         that is who they were submitted to.
36    Q   I see. There is no doubt that on one occasion - I think
37         it was the 15th day of the Inquiry, something like 6th


                                      3
 1       June - there is an instance when counsel for the families
 2       cross-examines a police officer, Police Constable        ~
 3       on the basis of his original recollections rather than the
 4       sanitised version.   There is correspondence about this.
 5       It looks as though in some cases at any rate, the original
 6       versions have not only been received by you but probably
 7       because of problems of time, have been circulated to the
 8       other parties. Can you remember that?
 9   A   They would have been circulated to all of the legal
10       representatives that represented either the families, the
11        club, the police officers, ambulance, at the time of the
12        Judicial Inquiry, as well as to ourselves.
13   Q   You mean if you had the unsanitised version?
14   A   Whatever version was put into Taylor's LJ Inquiry I think
15        would have been the version that would have been given to
16        us. The issue of the sanitisation is one I recollect
17        occurring. What I can't recollect now is whether Taylor
18        LJ or Treasury Counsel made any action to recover any
19        original documentation that had not been sanitised.
20       Certainly after the Judicial Inquiry, our own
21       investigation centred on every aspect of the disaster, and
22       we would have actioned - and I as theofficer as
23       responsible for the policy in respect of the
24       investigation, would have actioned - for any police
25       officers or any other people to be seen specific to
26       particular allegations or particular parts of evidence
27       that needed further clarification.
28   Q   There is no doubt that the police still have in the
29       archives the original unsanitised copies of the
30       recollections together with the amendments. I have seen
31       some of them and I am looking at them in more detail. Can
32       you recollect whether your Inquiry would have seen those,
33       or not?
34   A   I would have expected that every single piece of evidence
35       would have been handed to West Midlands Police because all
36       of the documentation that is now with South Yorkshire was
37       part and parcel of our investigation. The situation is


                                    4
 1        that you actually work for the Chief Constable of South
 2        Yorkshire although you are independent, and it is his
 3        responsibility to have back at the end of any
 4        investigation, all paperwork, and indeed, the database
 5        from the homes computer that we used to facilitate the
 6        investigation.   If that is the case, I would have
 7        expected that we would have had all of those original
 8        recollections as well as sanitised recollections.
 9             I have to say, the length of time that has passed
10        makes it difficult for me to remember whether we had both,
11        but I know that when we went up there, within two or three
>12       days we actually "seized" - I put West Midlands Police
13        Officers in of senior levels - every piece of
14        documentation evidence that was within South Yorkshire
15        Police, bearing in mind they had done the initial stages
16        of the disaster, the mortuary and evidence through police
17        officers.    All of that was secured and brought away. The
18        difficult area then is when they were asked for the
19        Judicial Inquiry to produce these recollections. We would
20        have finished with our seizure of the early evidence but
21        we would have been in post doing investigations on behalf
22        of Taylor LJ. At the moment I just cannot recall whether
23        we had them.
24              What I would say is a possible check on that is if
25         they have been typed. If those original recollections,
26         unsanitised, have been put on to the homes system, that
27         may well be a way of checking.
28    Q   I don't think they have, but I can certainly check that.
29    A   That would certainly give an indication as to whether we
30         had them. I may, and it depends - if I knew that they had
31         been in the domain of the Judicial Inquiry or with the
32         knowledge of Taylor LJ and Mr. Collins, when receiving
33         those originals, I would have made a policy decision about
34         whether to actually put them on to the system
35         evidentially. I would have thought that I would have
36        asked for those to be typed on to the system.   I cannot
37        see any reason why I wouldn't have done it.


                                     5
 1    Q   My impression is - and it is no more than an impression -
 2        that you did not, except in exceptional cases like
 3               who I have referred to, get the original
 4        statements. The whole object of the exercise, in a way,
 5        was for the solicitors to vet the statements before they
 6        sent them to the West Midlands Police Inquiry.
 7        Therefore, I would not have expected you at that stage at
 8        any rate, to see them. I may be wrong about that, and if
 9        you have any further recollections about that or if you
10        have any means of checking that, that would be helpful to
11        me.
'12            What I think is clear - and you have confirmed to
13        me - is that everybody in the Inquiry knew that these
14        recollections were not necessarily unsanitised, if you see
15        what I mean.
16    A   Yes.
17    Q   That is right, isn't it? You knew that some of them had
18         been vetted by the solicitors?
19    A   If I recall, I am sure that was the issue that had been
20         raised. I think at that time we were to some extent
21         unclear about what our process of investigation would be
22         afterwards: whether we would actually be doing a criminal
23         inquiry - we certainly knew we would be doing the
24         Coroner's Inquiry. I think because none of us had
25         experienced a Judicial Inquiry before and servicing a Lord
26         Justice in that way, I don't think we knew whether at the
27         end of that Inquiry Taylor LJ would make a series of
28         recommendations that would be different to the normal
29         criminal investigation. I recollect the issue about the
30         original statements and sanitised versions. I just cannot
31         at the moment think through how it came to light, what it
32         was about and what actions we took on it ourselves.
33    Q   I have got some material which might help you to jog your
34         memory. I am afraid it may take a little time to go
35         through it. I will not ask you to look at it now. Have
36         you got to rush away?
37    A    No, not particularly; we are OK, sir.


                                     6
 1   Q   May be the answer would be to let you have a copy of it
 2       and take it away, and let me have any further
 3       observations?
 4   A   Yes, because I would need to speak to South Yorkshire to
 5       search the West Midlands home system as we have done with
 6       some of these for Sergeant McCombie. We have got nothing
 7       within the West Midlands at the moment for me to refer to.
 8   Q   One of the things that slightly concerns me about these
 9       doctored or sanitised statements is that although what is
10       cut out can, I think, be regarded as comment and opinion
11       to a very large extent, what seems to be cut out is
12       criticism of senior officers, and what is left in is
13       criticism of the fans. Now, I think it is also fair to
14       say that the criticisms which were made of senior officers
15       are ones, all of which were accepted by Taylor LJ, and
16       were the subject of his findings.   For example, why
17       wasn't there somebody to block off the tunnel when the
18       gate was opened? Why wasn't there more filtering in
19       Leppings Lane? Why was there such chaos and lack of
20       appreciation of what happened? These are all things that
21       Taylor LJ found and criticised and so on. I don't know
22       whether you can express any opinion about this, but would
23       you have regarded the Inquiry team as in any way
24       handicapped by the fact that, as you knew, these
25       statements were being sanitised and were likely to exclude
26       opinions, comments and criticisms and so on?
27   A   I don't think we would have been handicapped because when
28       we did the criminal investigation alongside the Coroner's
29       investigation, you will be aware that people like Mr.
30       Hicks made written statements of complaint about the
31       actions of police officers, and the actions of South
32       Yorkshire police in general. We therefore specifically
33       took on the nature of the investigation to look at all of
34       the evidence, and that included lots and lots of witnesses
35       outside of the police officers that actually made
36       criticism from their previous experiences of the ground,
37       about the alleged failure to actually put in those


                                   7
 1        channels for people to come down, not closing off the
 2        tunnel, etc. I think by saying what you have just said
 3        has jogged my memory, that I recall that being an issue
 4        that there was the cutting out of the criticism of senior
 5        officers, and I seem to remember a conversation or
 6        conversations in and around that, but what I would say is
 7        from an investigation point of view whether those
 8        criticisms had been in or not, in statements, we
 9        investigated, and the questions of all the officers that
10        we interviewed under caution and all of the police
11        officers that we interviewed in respect of the policy and
>12       the major incident plan that we had, we questioned them on
13        the basis of the past experience of both supporters, of
14        stewards, of all sorts of individuals. So I don't think
15        that the investigation in any would have suffered from
16        that. I feel that there was adequate other evidence and
17        criticism from many other quarters that replicated the
18        criticism put by some officers.
19    Q   I think that, if I may say so, is probably correct
20        because, as I have said, the criticisms, comments and so
21        on of senior officers which I have come across and which
22        have been cut out, are all ones which Lord Taylor had no
23        difficulty in finding established. It doesn't look as
24        though it inhibited him, and therefore I would imagine did
25        not inhibit the inquiry team really.
26    A   Not at all, because in some of the interviews, and in the
27        report that I wrote to the DPP I actually make reference
28        in part to the findings of Taylor LJ in support of some of
29        the issues that suggested there may be cause to answer
30        criminal offences by certain people. So we when I did
31        that report, I actually referred not only to the
32        statements that were taken; I actually also referred and
33        used extracts from the transcripts of evidence done by
34        Taylor LJ.
35    Q   I am not sure that I have seen that report. I have seen
36        counsel's opinions.



                                    8
 1    A   The DPP file that I submitted includes     afrontreport from
 2         me which is pre the interviews.
 3    Q   I have got a lot of fileshere.
 4    A   That   is part of it.   There   should be an investigating
 5         officer's front report.    Is it that red one?    (Handed)
 6    Q   Yes, this is it.
 7    A   Yes, that is it.
 8    Q   I had better read that, I think.
 9    A   What I would say is that when I wrotethat report  the
10         process was this. Having gathered all of the evidence
11        together that we could find, we did the report in six
h.2       different sections which are marked in the example that
13        you have got over there. The object of that written
14        report was to identify for the Director of Public
15        Prosecutions the main individuals that allegations had
16        been made against: for example, for suggestions of
17        manslaughter. That report deals with each of the
18        particular individuals that we felt from the evidence that
19        was aimed at.
20             The report went to the Director of Public
21        Prosecutions, and a copy to the Coroner. The Director of
22        Public Prosecutions appointed two Queen's Counsel, and I
23        think one was a Mr. Williams.
24    Q   That is right:   now Lord Williams.
25    A   Yes. They reviewed the evidence, that report and video
26         evidence that was presented before them, and from
27         consultation afterwards with them later we then
28        interviewed the people that are named in that report that
29        I actually refer to. They were then interviewed under
30        caution on tape and on video.   Separate files were
31        presented in respect of those interviews and their
32        responses if they actually answered questions. For
33        example, you may be aware that Mr. Duckenfield declined to
34        actually answer any questions.
35             The following process from that report was each of
36        those criminal allegation interviews was submitted
37        alongside the normal process, the police complaints issue,


                                          9
 1       where at that particular time we actually would go down
 2       the process of saying, "You have been interviewed fox
 3       criminal allegations. I would wish to put to you the same
 4       questions again in respect of discipline. Will you accept
 5       the same questions as have been put in?"  Those were then
 6       submitted separately, and I think that was around the
 7       July/August of 1990. From that the Director of Public
 8       Prosecutions made the decision on whether there should be
 9       any criminal prosecutions. Then the same documentation
10       was forwarded also to the Coroner so he had exactly the
11       same evidence.
12   Q   That is very helpful. Thank you very much indeed. I do
13        not think there is any point really in my showing you the
14        brief synopsis I have here of some of the alterations
15        which were made. Would that help you at all do you think?
16   A   I don't think I would recall it now.
17   Q   I am sure you wouldn't. What I will do is get copies. A
18        lot of these are internal documents from the South
19        Yorkshire Police and so on. I do not see any reason why
20        you should not see them really with a view to seeing if
21        anything refreshes your memory. If it does, perhaps you
22        would let me know anything further on that aspect of the
23        matter.
24   A   Yes, I will.
25   Q   Thank you very much indeed.     I am most grateful to you.
26       We will send you a copy of this, and if there is anything
27       that you want to add to it, if you have not told me
28       anything that you want to, please do so. It has been very
29       helpful.
30   A   Could I make one short submission to you in respect of the
31        roles of Sergeant Appleton and Sergeant McCombie?
32   Q   Yes. This is in your role ----
33   A   Of background really.
34   Q   Yes, right.
35   A   And really the officer to whomthey wereworking.       I think
36        it is perhaps important, because they were obviously   quite
37        nervous, and I don't think they quite got across their


                                    10
    1   roles to you. Their particular responsibility encompassed
    2   many, many things. It is true to say that over the period
    3   that they were involved with all of the deceased
    4   relatives, that it was quite traumatic for each of them.
    5        Sergeant Appleton would not perhaps have thought to
    6   tell you, but I think she implied how important it was
    7   that the parents of young Kevin Williams knew what had
    8   taken place and the issue of the word "mom" came up.
    9   Julie Appleton lost her youngest sister just a few months
10      before this in a road accident. When the issue came out
H       on the Roger Cooke Report she actually phoned me at home.
'12     She was extremely concerned and said, "If only I could get
13      over to people, if there is anything that I could have
14      done to actually ensure that those parents knew, or the
15      mother knew, that the last word was 'mom', then there is
16      no way I would have ever changed that whatever the Coroner
17      thought, because I recognise how important it is." It is
18      the reason why perhaps people have not understood or
19      cannot understand it. She has had difficulty in dealing
20      with it.
21           Both of them, Sergeant McCombie and Sergeant
22      Appleton, took the initiative with Mr. Hicks and the
23      family because he represented the Hillsborough Support
24      Group at that time in the families, to actually ask me
25      could he come down to the main incident room to see what
26      we were doing. As you know, he came down.
27           What I wanted to say was that both of them and other
28      officers - and I think if you spoke to Mr. Hicks and to
29      the Bland family, just two years ago Julie had a little
30      girl, and the parents of the Bland family sent her a card.
31      That is how helpful she has been, and that is seven years
32      later.   Julie Appleton was actually invited to the
33      funeral of the Bland boy some three years after the event
34      because of the way that she helped the family. I just
35      really wanted to say that, not defensively but perhaps to
36      highlight matters.

Q   I think so far as the Hicks were concerned, at the time
    they were very appreciative and were very grateful. Mr.
    Hicks now says that Mr. Paul Taylor and Debra Martin have
    changed his view about that. He now thinks it was all
    rather cynical.   I am afraid if he thinks that, I cannot
    stop that.
A   Thank you for the opportunity just to say that.
LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Thank you very much indeed;   that
     is very helpful.

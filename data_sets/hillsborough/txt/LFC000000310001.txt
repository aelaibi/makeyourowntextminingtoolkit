                    HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
              JOINT STATEMENT BY LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB
            NOTTINGHAM FOREST FOOTBALL CLUB AND LIVERPOOL
                     AMD NOTTINGHAM CITY COUNCILS
WE ARE CONCERNED THATS'
(A) IN THE PAST YEAR CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY
    CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS TO DISMISS OR DISTORT THE FINDINGS OF LORD
    JUSTICE TAYLOR WITH REGARD TO THE CAUSES OF THE HILLSBOROUGH
    DISASTER BY PLACING BLAME ON LIVERPOOL F.C. SUPPORTERS,
    DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING CONTRARY EVIDENCE GATHERED BY THE
    JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION;
(B) SUCH INDIVIDUALS NONE OF WHOM, IT SHOULD BE NOTED, WERE
    PARTICIPANT IN OR DIRECT WITNESS TO THE DISASTER, HAVE
    CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO STATE THE SOURCE OR FACTUAL BASIS FOR
    THEIR "OPINIONS."

SADLY IT WOUUX-APPEAR^TSAT-~THE—LESSONS—LEARNED—BY-TH& MAHY ABOUT
SAFETY AT GROUNDS AT THEttEAVYCOST^OF 9SLIVES H A W ~ ALREADTTBEEN
FORGOTTEN OR IGNORED BY THE^FEW. THEREFORE ON BEHALF OF ALL THE
PEOPLE WHO STILL SUFFER TODAY AS A RESULT OF HILLSBOROUGH AND WHO
HAVE NEEDLESSLY BEEN CAUSED ADDITIONAL PAIN BY THESE GRATUITOUS
AND OFFENSIVE COMMENTS WE CHOOSE TO RENEW THE SPECIAL BONDS FORMED
BETWEEN THE TWO CLUBS AND THE TWO CITIES FOLLOWING THE DISASTER BY
PUBLICALLY PLACING ON RECORD OUR JOINT ENDORSEMENT OF THE
CONCLUSIONS OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR AND HIS IDENTIFICATION OF THE
FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL FACTORS WHICH IN COMBINATION CREATED THE
TRAGEDY OF APRIL 15TH, 1989:-
     1. THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE END
            (i) THE TERRACE WAS DIVIDED INTO A NUMBER OF SMALL AREAS
                WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY COMPUTERISED OR MECHANICAL
                MEANS OF LIMITING ENTRY NUMERICALLY INTO ANY ONE AREA
                IF ALL AREAS WERE OPEN FOR CHOICE.
           (ii) THE POSITION OF THE TUNNEL 'VIS A VIS' TURNSTILES A
                TO G, ITS LABELLING AND THE ABSENCE OF SIGNPOSTS
                ADVERTISING THE WING PENS MADE IT HIGHLY LIKELY THAT
                PENS 3 AND 4 WOULD FILL TO CAPACITY AND EXCEED IT
                UNLESS PREVENTATIVE STEPS WERE TAKEN.

     2. LACK OF FIXED CAPACITIES FOR THE PENS
         THE SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONTAINED NO MAXIMUM FIGURES FOR
         INDIVIDUAL PENS AND THE AVOIDANCE OF OVERCROWDING DEPENDED
         ENTIRELY ON VISUAL MONITORING OF THE CROWD.
     3. LACK OF EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF THE TERRACES
         FANS WERE LEFT TO "FIND THEIR OWN LEVEL" WITH THE TEST 0$
         FULLNESS BEING WHAT "THE FANS WOULD TOLERATE."

      4.   b u i l d -u p a t t h e t u r n s t i l e s

           THE LAYOUT QF THE TURNSTILES AND THE NUMBER THEY WERE
           REQUIRED TO SERVE LEFT NO MARGIN OF SAFETY AGAINST THE
           UNEVEN FLOW OF FANS WHICH TRANSPIRED. 23 TURNSTILES IN A
           NARROW AND CONFINED AREA WERE TO ADMIT 24,256 LIVERPOOL
           FANS COMPARED TO 60 TURNSTILES ACROSS A FAR LARGER AREA TO
           ADMIT 29,800 NOTTINGHAM FOREST FANS,
      5. THE BLUNDER ON OPENING THE GATES

           THE DECISION TO OPEN GATE 'C' TO RELIEVE THE CRUSHING
           OUTSIDE WAS NOT ACCOMPANIED BY THE CLOSING OF THE TUNNEL TO
           THE CENTRAL PENS.

      6. THE BARRIERS IN PEN 3

           PREVIOUS REMOVAL OF BARRIER 144 AT THE BACK OF PEN 3 AND
           THE EXCESSIVE GAP IN THE BARRIER HIGHER UP THE PEN CREATED
           ADDITIONAL PRESSURE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE COLLAPSE OF
           BARRIER 124A.

      7. THE CRUSHING NOT RECOGNISED

           THE FAILURE TO RECOGNISE THE CRUSHING AND THE INHIBITION
           AGAINST TACKLING IT CAUSED VITAL TIME TO BE LOST.
      8. THE PERIMETER OATES WERE TOO SMALL

           GATES 3 AND 4 WERE WHOLLY INADEQUATE FOR RESCUE PURPOSES,

PAUL ANTHONY JAMES EASON states :

1.   I was born on 23rd July,     1957.     I am a Station Officer

     stationed at Longley Ambulance Station, Sheffield 5.

2.   I have been employed by SYMAS since 2nd October, 1978.       I

     was a Qualified Ambulanceman at Batemore Station until

     August, 1982.    I then transferred to Middlewood Ambulance

     Station, Sheffield for 14 months.       I was then promoted to

     the position of Leading Ambulanceman at Maltby Ambulance

     Station where I remained until September,     1986.    I then

     transferred to Parkway Ambulance Station in Sheffield as a

     Leading Ambulanceman and I was promoted to position of

     Station Officer at Longley in May, 1987.

3.   I am qualified to perform the full range of ambulance

     duties.    I do not however have extended training.         My

     training has included a two week induction course, the six

     week residential course at Markfield Training Centre,

     Leicestershire and twelve months on the road experience.        I

     gained the Millar Award (DHSS Proficiency Award).

4.   Longley Station is just under two miles east of Sheffield

     Wednesday Football Ground.     Because of its close proximity

     to the football ground the previous Station Officer at

     Longley was nominated as Liaison Officer for that stadium.

5.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club provides two season

     tickets for me and a second Liaison Officer, Station Officer

     Higgins,   in the south stand.       One or the other of us or

     both of us will attend all the home league matches.        Our

      seats are in the south stand above the players tunnel.      Mr




                             (
     Higgins and I were both off duty and not paid for our

     assistance.     South Yorkshire Police are aware of the seat

     numbers of our tickets.      For big matches (e.g. semi-finals

     and league games where large crowds are expected) we take an

     ambulance to the ground (with crew) and position it at the

     point marked by a green rectangle on the plan attached.     We

     also have     a backup ambulance,    with crew,   stationed at

     Middlewood Ambulance Station on standby.

6.   When attending matches we each take a pocketphone radio.

     Before the start of any game it is our practice to carry out

     a radio test to ensure radio communications with the Control

     Unit at the SYMAS H.Q., in Moorgate Road, Rotherham.

7.   The match on Saturday 15th April,        1989 was the F.A. Cup

     semi-final.    At the last game before the semi-final I was

     told by a steward that the tickets reserved for us for

     league matches would be sold for this particular match and

     we would have to make our own arrangements if we wished to

     attend.       On the Tuesday before the game I telephoned

     Inspector S. Sewell at Hammerton Road Police Station in

     Sheffield and I informed him of our decision to attend the

     game in any event, as Liaison Officers.       I told him where

     we would meet him and the time in order that he could

     arrange access for us.       Although 1 was not present at last

     year's semi-final I understand from Station Officer Higgins

     that the same problems were encountered then so far as our

     tickets were concerned.
8.   After telephoning Mr Sewell I contacted           the secretary




                               -2 .
              of Mr MacKrell      (the secretary of the Football Club),        at

              Hillsborough and confirmed our arrangements made with South

              Yorkshire Police and her response was "lovely".

    9    .    I was asked by Assistant Chief Jones to ensure that I, Mr

              Higgins and the extra duty crews arranged for the match

              should each have pocketphone radios.       We decided between us

              that we would leave one vehicle at Middlewood Ambulance

              Station on standby (one mile to the west of the ground,

              outside Middlewood Hospital) and the other vehicle would be

              used by Mr Higgins,         the crew of that vehicle and me to
*
              travel     down   to the ground.        The ambulance     left   at

              Middlewood was intended to be backup - the idea being that

              there    should    always    be   one ambulance   on   station   at

              Hillsborough.       If that ambulance had to be used then the

              backup vehicle would be brought down from Middlewood to

              'replace the vehicle in use.

    ■   10.   We all met at Longley Station at 1350 and shortly after that
                                                                          and I

              proceeded to the ground in one ambulance.         We arrived there

               at 1410     We met Inspector Sewell of South Yorkshire Police

               and parked our ambulance inside the Penistone Road entrance

               in the position marked by a green rectangle on the plan

               attached.        This was close to the gymnasium which in

               accordance with the SYMAS Disaster Plan for Hillsborough

               would be used as a casualty clearing post in the event of

               such problem.      We asked Inspector Sewell how things were

               going and he said they were O.K.        The ambulance radio was




                                           “5
             operating satisfactorily.

    11   .   At 1445 we proceeded to the point marked on the plan by a

             green X (between the North Stand and the Spion Kop).      ' We

             checked the pocket radios and they were all working.       At

             the point marked by a green X there were a few St John's

             representatives and some police officers.

    12 . I clearly remember that the match kicked off at 1459 i.e.
             one minute early.     I always look at the stadium clock at

             the   time of kick-off.      At the time of kick-off

                                                           and I were all
*
             standing together at the point marked by a green X.

    13.      At 1503 we noticed what we took to be a scuffle occurring in

             the middle of the standing session at the Leppings Lane end

             of the ground.                         and I walked along the

             asphalt track by the side of the pitch (along the     side of

             the North Stand) to   investigate.   As we got closer there it

             appeared that there had been some overspill of spectators.

             When we reached that end of the ground (after about one

             minutes walking) there were more people actually moving onto

             the turf and some sitting along the length of the touchline.

             People were getting agitated.         Someone then drew our

             attention to a fan who was injured.       This was in the area

             just behind the lefthand goal post at the Leppings Lane end.

             We had proceeded round to the middle of the Leppings Lane

             end and we attended to the injured fan, a youth who   appeared

             to have a fractured leg.    At this stage I thought there was

             a scuffle going on inside the enclosure.          More people
             however started to emerge around us.       I think that it was

             about this time that the game was stopped by the referee.

    14   .   We needed a fracture-pac to put on the youth's leg, and a

             stretcher.      I used my pocketphone to speak to Control to

             ask them to contact S.O. Higgins with my request.        I tried

             the pocketphone but it did not work.      I moved away from the

             stand thinking that might help reception but it did not.

             There was no reply from Control.

    15.      By now people were getting angry and frustrated and they

             tended to take out their anger and frustration on those in
*
             uniform by hitting out and aiming kicks.       I was struck on

             the right      side of my chest    and   I noticed    that

                            and some of the policemen in the vicinity had

             kicks aimed at them by spectators.       I still at this stage \

             thought there had been a fight on the terraces and that

             spectators were coming away from the terraces to escape the

             fight.

    16.      When the spectators started getting aggressive I pulled Q.A.

             Chippendale and me back to our original position.             We

             walked back.      I advised S.O. Higgins of what was happening

             and I told him that my pocketphone was unserviceable.          I

             said there was a youth with a broken leg and there had been

             a disturbance.
                      and I then walked back to the Leppings Lane end with

             fracture-pac and stretcher, first aid bags and a bag and

             mask (an instrument for resuscitation).        When we arrived

             back at the scene the situation has worsened.        This was two




                                       6
          or three minutes from when we had left it.        We were still

          not aware of precisely what was happening but it was

          increasingly obvious there were a lot more angry and a lot

          more injured spectators.       Both S.O. Higgins and I were

          thumped and subjected to verbal abuse,

          applied a splint to the youth’s leg.

    17.   The situation was becoming increasingly ugly and we realised

          there were fatalities and serious injuries.        I took S.0.

          Higgins' pocketphone off him to see if it would work but it

m         would not.    The time was 1511.     I wanted now to bring the

          other vehicle     from Middlewood     to Leppings Lane as a

          precaution.     Because I could not get through S.O. Higgins

          returned to our ambulance to use the ambulance radio (he

          contacted Control at 15$2.52.)        Again we were subject of

          punching and abuse.      While S.O. Higgins was away I moved

          back to about half way towards the half way line and looking

          at the Leppings Lane end I saw that people were being pulled

          from the terraces into the seating area of the west stand,

          other   fans were staggering     out of the enclosure or overthe

          top of the fence and many spectators were falling/lying

          down.   I went down again     to the Leppings Lane end and   saw

          there   were people crushed against the fence.     By now    the

          police had started to arrive in large numbers.

    18.   I knew having worked with S.O. Higgins that he would by now

          have started setting up a casualty clearing point where

          casualties could be brought for assessment and I knew

          according to our disaster plan that would be the gymnasium.




                                   (o
19.   Prior    to   running    back     to our   ambulance   I saw   that

                                                   rere attending to fans

      laid on the pitch.       I told them to keep eye contact with me

      so far as they could since I wished them to make sure they

      knew exactly where I was.                               was on his

      knees giving mouth to mouth resuscitation on a patient.

      There was a gang of youths around him.          One of those youth

      kicked                          repeatedly on his side and legs as

      he gave the mouth to mouth treatment.          It was at this stage

      that a policeman told me he thought that some fans were dead

      or dying.     This was now stating the obvious.

20.   I knew that S.O. Higgins had returned to the ambulance but I

  .   did not have conf irmat ion of what .he had done -               M^

      intention in returning to the ambulance was to declare a

      Major Incident in accordance with our disaster plan.              A

      spectator approached me and asked me to look at a little boy

      whom he thought was dead.          He pointed at a group of people

      surrounding the body of a small boy on the pitch.                 I

      approached the group and a man who said he was a doctor was

      working on the boy.        He said he thought there was a chance

      for him.       I used the pocketphone repeatedly but to no

      avail.      I told the doctor I would summon assistance.          I

      continued on to our ambulance.               By this time Leading

                              had arrived.     The time was approximately

      1517.       He had come from Parkway Ambulance Station.          He

      asked what was happening.           I informed him about the child




                                9 -
    on the pitch and I tried to point out where he was.           The

    police were now forming a line across the pitch.         We could

    not see the child where we were but, carrying a stretcher,

    we ran across to where the child had been.        This was in the

    area marked adjacent to the words "Player's Tunnel" on the

    plan attached.       The child was there.     We loaded the child

    on to a stretcher.                      colleague had driven his

    ambulance after us and across the pitch.            The time was

    close to 1520.       We placed the child on a stretcher in the

    ambulance.     I spoke to the doctor.       I told him that if he

    was a doctor and wished to help he should make his way to

    the gymnasium and consult S.O. Higgins.            The ambulance

    drove off with                and the child.      I rode with the

    vehicle to make my call to Control.         I contacted Control at

    1521 and     I said that I was confirming to Control that there

    was a Major Incident developing (track 19 page 9).           I was

    advised by Superintendent Ray Clarke of Control that 9 or 10

    vehicles en route and to switch to channel 1.       Previously we

    had been on channel 2.       Channel 1 is our emergency channel

     for major incidents to ensure no other traffic impedes the

     traffic on that channel.          I instructed them to come to

     our Penistone Road end location in accordance with the Major

     Incident plan and liaise with me.

21 . I went back to the Leppings Lane end and started the process
     of trying to re-assess the situation.          There was general

     chaos and mayhem.      When I arrived at the Leppings Lane end

     I saw people crushed against the fence.          Some were being
      dragged out by police through gate 2.         Some were climbing

      over the fencing.     Some were being pulled up onto the stand

      from the terracing.     Somehow someone had made a hole in the

      wire fence in pen 4 to the right of Gate 4 as one looks from

      the pitch and some people were escaping through it.        I did

      not realise at that time that people at the front         of the

      fence must have been standing on bodies beneath them.

22. I tried to contact Control using the crews' radio but I
      could not get through.          I went back to my ambulance to

      report.   I saw Deputy Chief Hopkins (at the point marked

      with a red 0 on the plan), who had just arrived.         We went

      back onto the pitch and I gave him an up date on what I had

      seen and done and warned him to be careful because        of the

      aggression in the crowd.        He told me to make sure that the

      Major Incident Tender vehicle was on its way in accordance

      with the disaster plan.          I returned to the ambulance and

      radioed that request to Control at 1528 (track 16 page 3)

      and was informed that that vehicle was already on its way.

      I then went into Penistone Road and began marshalling

      ambulances which were by now arriving.

23.   Under our disaster plan ambulances entering Hillsborough are

      supposed to arrive at the point marked with a red X on the

      plan and to leave by the point marked with a red Y.           We

      could not however do this because of parked vehicles.

      There were hire vans which the police had used.        There was

      also a jail van in the way.        This meant that one could not

      proceed by vehicle to exit point Y from point X, within the




                                 °i
         ground.      I do not know if the hire vans had arrived before

         or after the incident started.

24   .   Our ambulances were coming from the south along Penistone

         Road.     There was enough space to reverse two ambulances

         side by side through the entrance X.             There was room for

         two banks of two and I marshalled vehicles in this manner.

         I held the arriving vehicles in Penistone Road until I could

         get them into the ground.

25.                       then arrived with the Major Incident vehicle.

         This vehicle is a mobile control and support unit full of

         equipment.      I marshalled him into the space marked with a

         red Z.

26.      Divisional      Superintendent        Dale    and Assistant   Chief

         Metropolitan      Ambulance      Officer     Jones then arrived,

         separately.          Mr Dale asked me to up date him and I told

         him what I was doing.          Mr Dale then went to the gymnasium

         to liaise with Mr Hopkins (Incident Officer in Charge).           I

         was still marshalling          vehicles      and all the time the

         ambulances were being loaded and sent on their way.             The

         next time I noticed Mr Dale he was at the exit marked with a

         red Y.       He must have been to the gymnasium.           He began

         marshalling vehicles in through the exit Y.            This allowed

         us   double    the    number   of vehicles to be loaded with

         casualties.

27   .                           arrived with a mini bus ambulance and I

         arranged for him to park on the pavement and told him to

         stay with his vehicle.           The intention was to use the 10




                                          IO
1



          seater mini bus for transporting walking wounded.       I told

          Mr Jones of the availability of this vehicle for walking

          wounded.

28.       Then Mr Jones asked me to re-locate myself and vehicles

          still arriving at the scene to the Herries Road Bus Depot

          and to treat this as an ambulance parking point (ceasing use

          of point red X ).     The Herries Road Bus Depot is about 200

          yards away.      Vehicles assembled at the Depot would operate

          as a standby pool and we kept vehicles there until there

          were required.

29.       I managed to locate another pocketphone and assembled a

          convoy of ambulances which proceeded to the Bus Depot.      At

          the Depot I contacted Control via the pocketphone and told

          them that I was stood, by there.       As vehicles arrived I

          stood them four abreast in an open area at the Depot.        I

          sited sitting case vehicles      (i.e. vehicles for walking

          wounded)   and West Yorkshire Incident Vehicle (with extra

          equipment in the back) separately within the area.      I then

          gathered together                                          and
          told them that              was staying with me as a relay and

          advised the others to make sure the crews stayed together as

          to attempt to maintain morale.         I asked              to

          complete a list of vehicle fleet numbers and respective

          services at the garage.                     did that.      The

          vehicles stood by were 13 SYMAS, 5 West Yorks, 4 Derbyshire,

          1 Yorks and 1 Notts i.e. a total of 24 vehicles.

30    .   I was starting to become concerned about the number of




                                     1}
          vehicles arriving at the Bus Depot.        The incident appeared

          to be coming to a conclusion and some vehicles might have

          been required for other emergency duties.            I tried to

          contact Control by pocketphone to suggest this but I could

          not transmit on the pocketphone.           I could however hear

          Control calling me.       I do not know why this was the case.

          After about a minute I got a poor contact with Control using

          a Barnsley ambulance on site.         I was asked by Control to

          contact them on a landline.

£   31.   I took                with me into the Bus Deport Garage to find

          a telephone.        With the help of garage staff I was given

          access     to   a manager's   office and I made contact with

          Control.        I was connected to Mr Page who instructed me to

          ensure that either Mr Jones or Mr Hopkins contacted him by

          Vodafone as soon as possible.        I had no communication with

          site so I told :              to despatch a runner to the ground

          with the message.        I believe the message was carried by



    32.   We could not maintain an open line so I agreed with Control

          I would ring in every ten minutes.       After about ten minutes

                          informed me that the vehicles at the garage were

          to be dispersed and I was required at the gymnasium.             I

          proceeded to the gymnasium by ambulance and once there I was

          briefed with other Officers by Mr Page.         Mr Page decided

          that Assistant Divisional Officer Morley, Station Officer

          Bettison and I should remain at the gymnasium and carry out

          a body removal        programme    if and as necessary.      The




                                      /2 ,
    ♦
              gymnasium was now full of bodies and we were told that we

              were now talking in terms of over 90 bodies.

        33.   Mr Jones then advised me that all bodies were to be removed

              to the Medico Legal      Centre    in Sheffield   (the Public

              Mortuary).

        34.   Assistant Divisional Officer Morley,                     and I

              discussed the. situation.         Mr Morley became Officer in

              Charge for the removal of the bodies.                      was

              made responsible for radio communications and I was to

%
              ensure that the bodies were loaded and conveyed with a

              policeman with each body.         There were three bodies per

              ambulance.     We did this all night from the first release of

              bodies at 2130 up to 0528          By 2130 eleven bodies from

              Northern General Hospital and one from Royal Hallamshire

              Hospital had been transferred to the gymnasium.     I   believe

              this was on the Coroner's instructions.

        35.   In all we removed and transported 94 bodies and accompanying

              police personnel between 2130 and 0528.            Mr Hopkins

              declared the incident closed at 0530 and I returned to

              Longley Station to organise equipment cleaning.         I left

              Longley for home at 0640 on Sunday 16th April.

        36.   ST JOHN'S

              During the mayhem on the pitch I saw a



                            She was with a male casualty who appeared to be

              dead.       I seriously question the benefit of having such

              young volunteers present at a football match when they might




                                       /3
      be exposed to a situation such as that.

37.   RED CROSS
      Sometime between 2230 and mid-night when we were busy

      transporting the bodies a Red Cross vehicle gained access to

      the area adjacent to the gymnasium.       In it there were two

      ladies whom I took to be nurses, one gentleman and a young

      child.      I asked the man what he thought he was doing and he

      said he was from the Red Cross.      I said this was a mortuary

      and not a proper place for a child and I told him to move

      on.      He moved and parked his vehicle behind the gymnasium.

      I do not know if the child was then left in the vehicle or

      not.

38.   PRESS
      There are some terraced houses along Penistone Road whose

      gardens back on to the car park adjacent to the gymnasium.

      A press man took photographs with the aid of flash as we

      loaded bodies into the ambulances.       I arranged for a police

      officer to deal with him.       We re-located the Major Incident

      tender vehicle across the line of vision from the gardens to

      the ambulances.

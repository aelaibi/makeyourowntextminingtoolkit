     C.D. died as the result of an accidenl/misadventure.
    C.D. was killed lawfully.

    Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not folly or
    further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
    arose.
  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.
    C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not

       Subje ct to the C o r o n e r s ’ A ct 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is

      Dear Sir,

      re: Henry Charles Rogers -
      Inquest Friday 20th April 1990 - 3.30 p.m.


      We write to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 10th April last.

      We confirm that we are instructed by the family in this matter to attend the
      Inquest on their behalf.

      This arrangement is outside the normal arrangements made for block representation
      since Mr. & Mrs. Rogers are presently in Australia and we have general
      instructions to deal with various matters on their behalf.

      Mr. Brian Dawson of this office will be in attendance at the Inquest.

      Yours truly,
      WALKER, SMITH &/UAY

De ar Sirs,

R e : RESUME D INQUESTS               19th N O V E MBER 1990.



If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m y ou represent,
on the 19th of No vem b e r 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue w i l l be n o t i f i e d in
due course.

 I do n ot have to remind you of the fact that a cons ide rabl e amount of
 evide nce has alre ady be en taken, nor of the n ature and limitations of a
 coron al i n v e s tiga tio n w h i c h you w i l l r ecollect is not a dv ersa ria l but
 inqu isit ori al in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ A ct 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
u n d e r my control, and in particular, it is my responsib ilit y to select the
wi t n e s s e s w h o w i s h to give evidence. I am at p r e s e n t engaged in c o n s i d e r i n g
 this and in de ter m i n i n g w ho I w i s h                    to invite to attend.

 W i t h o u t p r e j u dice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
 to give you an opportun ity to d raw to my a t t e n t i o n the names and other
 a pp rop ria te details of any witnes s or w i t n e s s e s w h o m you w o u l d like me to
 co nsi d e r calli ng to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

 M a y I please ask you in co nsi d e r i n g w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names                 to my
 attention, to bear in mi nd the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

 I also w a n t to mak e it absolutely clear that the s ubmission of a name or
 names for c o n s i d e r a t i o n is n o t h i n g mor e than that, and that the d e c i s i o n as
 to w h o   to call to give evidence is                           and remains a m a t t e r for me.

 I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 h e a r d from you by the end of Se pte mber I w i l l assume you have no names to
 submit.

Dear         Sire*

He:      hbsby      0 80HSES (dAcaaBSd). !fe.24*
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough.
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,

As you axe aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

LUNCH WITH COMMANDER FENTON         ;

You kindly provided briefing for Mr Moynihan's lunch with
Colonel Rothschild and Commander Fenton on Wednesday. The
papers have already been returned to SARD.          x
'     '        ^       v      V         V'- '   ''>■■■   •. j   "   •'   ■ :
Last night the Minister asked that a letter be drafted for
his signature to Commander Fenton covering the announcement
of Norman Jacobs as Chairman of the FLA. I gather that they
also discussed the Green Code. I am afraid that I do not know
what the Green Code is, thought I understand that it is a ^ .
Home Office matter. The Minister would like to suggest in the
letter to Commander Fenton that he discusses this with the
relevant Home Office Minister. Do you think that someone
could have a word with Home Office officials to see whether
such a discussion might be feasible and for a suitable line
to be incorporated into the draft letter please.

I should be grateful for a draft letter please.

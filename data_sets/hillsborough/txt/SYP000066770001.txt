                  I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police Motorcycle wing,

                 stationed at Barnsley.



                 At 08.00 hours (0800)                      I came on duty at Barnsley ffed/j|-af f i c Office on

                 Saturday 15th April 1989 (15048^).                                     duties for t W s      day were to

                  patrol the A61 trunk road fr<yfi                             £ \X T \# t   ion of the M1 at Tankersley

                  (Jet 36) to the Hi 1 lsbor&iighf Foottwr^u. Ground.



               / At 08.50 hrs (0850) I attended at the Force Driving Set >ol, Brightside
                                                                                                   A /& b '
                 Ln, Sheffield, where I was briefed by Insp. P O L S C H Q ^ E W                                   was

                 responsible for the motorcycle operation,



                 At 09.40 hrs (0940) I started my patrol of the route.                                        Initially
                                                                  PAGE
                                                                  S1103

traffic was very light, but throughout the morning vehicles started t

build up.



At no time during my patrol did I experience any problems with the

traffic flow.   Vehicles moved at a steady pace towards the ground at

all times.



At 14.20 hrs (1420) on the same day, I was on patrol on Halifax Rd.

At this location the flow of vehicles had almost stopped completely.

As the road was almost empty my initial thought was that a Road

Traffic Accident had occurred.    I therefore checked the complete rout

from the ground to the M1 and found it to be completely clear of any

major traffic whatsoever.



At 14.40 hrs (1440)   I received a radio message to stand down to

Brightside Ln Driving School.



At 15.25 hrs (1525)   I resumed from Brightside Ln to Claywheels Ln

 raffic Garage on standby duties.   From there I was deployed to the

Football Ground on Ambulance Escort Duties to both the Northern

General and Royal Hallamshire Hospitals.



At 18.30 hrs (1830) I resumed my patrol of the A61 rd until I was

slood down at 19.20 hrs (1920).



At 20.00 hrs (2000) I completed my tour of duty.

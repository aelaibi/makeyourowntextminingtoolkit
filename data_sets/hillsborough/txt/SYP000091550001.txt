           States:

           I   have been a supporter of Liverpool Football Club a ll my life.                      I am

           a season ticket holder.



           With my season ticket voucher           I got a ticket for the 1989 <000089) Cup

           Semi-Final to be played between Liverpool & Nottingham Forest on                        j5th

           April   (150489) at Hillsborough in Sheff iel d .

                                                                                      ^

                           &                        11 was             car and we left St      c
           Helens to go^t-o. Sheffield at about 11.30am (1130?.                  We travelled on

           the A37 Rd,     over the Snake Pass.        The journey was not too bad, with no

           serious hold up.       We arrived in Sheffield at about               12.45 pm (l&Vik^.       We

                                                                                 S 3 581

had no difficulty in finding the ground and we parked the car in a

side street about    10 minutes/Walk from the ground.               I don't know just

where it was                           ot got a ticket & so when we parked

the car he left us                     t see him till after the incident.



The other four of us walked to a nearby pub, but it arppeared to be

closed,                      off-licence & bought soiye}
           so we went to an «------------          y     c^ris of lager each,

We then just stood outside drinking.         At no time a j / d l l    see any bad

behaviour.     There were a number of fans like us drinking out of cans &

just singing football songs but nothing more.                There were police

officers near the pub and we were having a joke with them - it was all

very good natured.



The four of us then walked down to the Leppings/Lane end of the

ground, and apart from              we all had             Dpinqs i-ar)e t.rr.c.

tickets.     As we got outside the ground,                  Y^f ' Y us to go into the
                                                 V   —      ■''
<»tand.



Q.utside the ground there were no queues                  w a s just a mass of fans .

There were Police there on foot and m                       ut they could not

control the fans who were just pushing                   iuch,    It was so bad that

the horse of one ppiice officer got li                   off the floor



The three of us joined the crush and were slowly going towards the

turnstiles.     We knew where to go as I had been to the ground before.

While in that mass of fans I was crushed against the metal gate.                     I,

in fact,    grazed rny left hand,    the injury did not need any treatment,

it was just a slight     injury,           got hold of m              tiled me away

from the gate.     The three of us eventually                         turnstiles & we

all got into the ground together,        having gi                    tickets.
                                                                               PAGE       3
                                                                               S 3 581



We eventually got in at about 2.40pm                     While   I was    in the crush

outside the ground,      I        fmrnber of fafrs who climbed over the wall

above the turnsti              d o n ’t think   it was to get in without a

ticket,    but just to       Out of the crush.



When we got through the turnstile there were Police              inside,    but at no

time,   either outside or inside, was I checked for a ticket or searched

by Police.     There were also stewards         in the area,   just inside the

turnstiles.



Once    inside the ground,   tpfe three of us went to the terrace behind the

goal directly down the Jtfunjneyy       I did not see or look for any signs

telling me where to go a^/l y£:new I wanted to go down the tunnel.



There were no police officers or stewards            in the area of the t u n n e l .

I did not see any gates other than turnstile that were open.



The three of us had a reasonably easy passage down .the tunnel, and in

fact we went into what       I now know to be Pen No/ 4,         The three of us
                                                                v_-
were able to get quite close to the front.             I(jn<kve marked the place on

a grid.



By this time it was about                   45jy) , and although it was full         in

the pen,    it was only lik^fe a r^rmalkjELa-tUrday in the Kop.          Suddenly,    I

had a feeling as if a cold hand had been put on my shoulder, and I

felt I just wanted to move from where I was.             I looked to the left and

saw that there was some space.          I told the other two I wanted to move.

They agreed,    so we just    climbed the fence on our left.          It let us into

a narrow pen and then into the big one next to it, which I now know as
                                                                                    PAGE      4
                                                                                    S 3 581

    Pen No 6.



    I then remember the teams      came out and eventually the match started.

    I was watching the game, and it was not till the game stopped I looked

    into the pens behind the goal.        I s a w ,fanff\ b%4ng pulled up into the

    ftand above, and fans climbing over t h e / t y o p t   f e n c e s . Atfirst    I saw
m   Police    pushing the fans back.     i/don't know if at that time they

    realised the full extent of what was happening.            Then it became

0   obvious that something serious was wrong.          I saw police officers

    trying to pull the fences down and obvious casualties being              carried

    onto the pitch.



    I did not see a barrier break or any specific incident.



    I saw one small boy who was passed onto the pitch.             I saw some fans

    attending to him,    eventually they put his coat over his face and

    carried him a^ay o n an advertising board toward the other end of the
                 p~— * ,
    ground.     I    n6t able to describe this casualty,         other than he was a

    young boy. ~ ^



    I just stayed in the terrace watching w h a t ^ a s      happening till about

    3.5Qpnt (155Q) when I went onto the pitqX,        just to see if I could see

    anyone I knew.



    I then went back to the other two & about 5 minutes after the match

    had been called off,     the three of us left the ground back into

    Leppings Lane.     We all five eventually got back to the car & came

    home.



    Even as late as after the match had been stopped,            I felt that it took

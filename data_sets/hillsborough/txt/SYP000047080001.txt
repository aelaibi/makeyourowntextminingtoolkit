     Dear

     I am sorry that it has taken so long to reply to your letter in which you
     raise a number of questions in respect of the Hillsborough disaster.

    You should know that there are still investigations to complete following
    the publication of the Taylor Reports and although your questions are not
    specifically concerned with Hillsborough I do not consider it appropriate
    for me, the Investigating Officer, to comment.  However I think you will
    find most of the information and opinion that you seek, in the Final Report
    of Lord Justice Taylor.

     I am sorry that I air. unable to be more helpful.

    Yours sincerely




    CHIEF CONSTABLE
    CUMBRIA CONSTABULARY

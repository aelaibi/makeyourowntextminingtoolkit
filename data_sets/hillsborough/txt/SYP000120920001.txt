               At    a p p ’r o x i m a t e 1 y    1100       am    together             with    DC    515       Cawkwe 1 1 , 1          commenced

               duties         in     the    sterile           area       between          South       Stand       Gate       'E'     and      the

               Leppings            Lane     turnstiles.                  This       area       was    to    be    kept       sterile          and

               access         was     restricted              to    official             personnel          and       8 .B.C.      staff.              The

               area      was        protected           by    means       of       temporary          barriers.

               Most      of     the    time        was       spent       on    the       barriers          outside       gate        'E * a n d         we

               were      constantly               approached             by    Liverpool             supporters          asking          for       access

               to    Leppings          Lane.            This       was    refused          with       the    exception             of    the       elderly

^              and     infirm         who    were        escorted             through          the    sterile          area.

               From      approximately                  H.OO       pm    (1400)          the    numbers          asking       for       access

               increased             considerably              and       these       people          were    directed           to      Leppings

               Lane      via       Penistone            Road       and    Catchbar             Lane.

               At    2.40       pm    (1440)        I became             aware       of    a    large       build       up    of     supporters               at

               the     Leppings            Lane     turnstiles                and    approximately                6    mounted          officers

               were      le t      through         the       barriers          in    order       to    attend          there.           At    that       time

               supporters             were        still       asking          to    be    let    through          the    barriers.                 I

               continued             duties        at    the       barrier          until       a p p r o x i a m t e ly 3 . 0 6        prn ( 1 5 0 6 )

               pitch.           Together          with        approximately                6    other       officers          I made          my       way

               through          gate       "E*     i n to     the       South       Stand       and    onto       the    playing             area.           At

             the    pitch.              I saw       that       supporters             were       climbing          over    the      security

             fences         and        onto    the       pitch,          supporters          were       also       climbing         from        the

             terraces            into        the    West       Stand.           I saw       that      the       centre     section             of    the

             terraces            was     very       crowded          but       there       appeared         to     be    ample       room       in       the

             to    escape          from       the    centre          pen.        Police          Officers          were    helping             them

             him    to      the        players       tunnel          and       then    into       the      physiotherapy              room          where

             came     there            and    I attended             to    them.

             Whilst         at     the       security          fencing          there       was     general         confusion             and       during

             front       of      the     terraces             but    a    few    yards       back       just       to    the    south          of    t he

             goals.           Other          fans    were       trampling             on    the     bodies         in    order       to       reach       the

             security            fences .

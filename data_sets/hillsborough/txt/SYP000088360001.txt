The    p o li ce m a n / a m b l a n c e m a n was   very upset,          he was     crying.     I comforted

him and then returned, to the Ala n theatre.                                  There were    two or three

patients  being treated ijp^Cnis room.    I remember a male doctor was

There were alot            of doctotps a nri nn r            .a    ^ ham t.   I couldn't tell      you any of

their     names.        I remember                                            working with the female

patient at some            time.       After a considerable amount                     of time a doctor

whose     name     I don*t       know faaie— a— rip r i s ion to stop treatment.

T o ge th er w ith the         porter                             I tr an sf er re d t he f ema .1e pat ie nt

to the      temporary mortuary.                  I now know that              this   patient was    one of

the H I C KS sisters.

■Sometime      later      that a f t e r n o o n     I transf er re d another           p a t i e n t from the

resuscitat ion          room to the t emporary mortuary.                         I had no dealings         with

this    patient apart            from moving          him.

I do know that            the doctors         worked     on this          patient     for some

consid er able        time but        I am unable        to assist with the              identiy of these

persons.         I would describe              this    patient as a white m a l e, aged

s o me wh er e around        late     twenties,        early thirties.               He had dark hair         I

think,      I cannot       describe        him any further.

I had no further dealings with any                           patients           I finished work at

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2030 hours.

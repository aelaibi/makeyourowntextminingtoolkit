though they had seen Gate                     * C ’ open.         The n someone,        I c o u l d n ’t see

who,      opened Gate          ’8 ’ .   The    people at the           turnstile        then    ran through

this      gate and the          pressure       on the       turnstile was            relieved.

There were several                people who were            limping,         etc.,    and had obviously

 been     injured in the           crush.       None a p p e a r e d    serious and there were

d ef in i t e l y no bodies at this               location.

 I do not know who              opened gates          "C*    or    * 8 ’ or    if control       had requested

 them to be opened.                I can only say that               if they had not been opened

w hen they were              serious and       probable       fatal     injuries would           have    been

 caused.

 There were           roars    from the       crowd    inside,       possibly kick-off             or football

action of some               description,       I was       unable     to tell.

    "All       officers    on to     perimeter       track",       (repeated)

    I s houted to the serial                (6) and we all          ran towards         the entrance              near

to tu rnstiles             19 to 22 at the           rear    of    control      point.     We entered the

perimeter             track    via the front are a of the South Stand.                        People          in the

S o u t h S tand were           stood up and shouting abuse                  towards the West Stand

area.            It looked      like a pitch         invasion from the West S t a n d terraces.

There were             no players         on the field.           Numerous      police    officers        near

and a r ou n d the            perimeter      fencing and g o a l m o u t h area.           Fans were

sp illing          onto the field,           climbing       fencing,      etc.     My    immediate        thought

was that           it was a pitch           invasion and nothing more.

W it h         the officers       I made my way to the              perimeter      fencing.         I made my

way to the fencing                  towards    the    left hand side of G a t ew ay No.                  3.       .THis

gate was           open a nd      police     officers were          trying      to clear the gateway of

fallen people.

To my horror              I then saw the           reality of what was            taking     place.

The first 4 or 5 rows                     of supporters who          had been stood behind this

se ct io n of fencing               had all    been crushed together               up to the        fencing.

Several          were     o bv io us ly dead a nd others a pp e a r e d to be dying.

T here was one elderly man,                    greying       hair,



                                                                   He was    obviously dead.              Others

a ro u nd him were             turning      blue/purple as they were               suffocating.               A

young          girl    pro ba bly    15 or 16 years was             s truggling      to keep alive.                 She

was unable             to speak and         I suspect       fading    fast.       The gate wa y was open

a nd officers were                trying     to remove what          I realise       now. were      bodies

                                                                                                       R245

from the        gateway.          The     bodies were         ent an gl ed with other        bodies which

were alive.            S u p po rt er s       from the      back were    climbing over        bodies    to

get out,        thereby hindering                the    rescue attempts        by the officers

concerned.

The    crowds were still                pushing forw ar d an d          chanting at the           police.

I joined the officers stood on the wall                             and shouted at          the    crowd to

stop pushing.              Shouts       of abuse were          the only reply.

Officers were            trying to make              their way through the s e c ti on of             crowds

to the       left,      compound 2, and climb over                  the a dj o i n i n g fence.       They

were being            pushed and jostled by the                  crowd as they did so.

O ther     supporters were              climbing        over the dead and         injured at the front

to escape         over     the    fencing.           The    crowd at the      rear of this        section

a nd the West S ta nd area did not seem to                          realise what was          happening at

the front.            They    continued to shout abuse at the                     police.

X was unaware            if control           had realised the          seriousness of the

situation.            It was      impossible           to hear    radio t ra nsmissions           if in fact

they were         being made.

I jumped down from the fencing and                            ran towards      the go al mo ut h area        in
                  &
the hope tht            I could       contact        control and     ensure that          other   services

were attending.               We urgently            required     cutt i ng equi pinent, bul 1 ho r ns       ->0   r

the    public address             system to          let the     crowd know what was happening,

etc.,     and for officers                to be depu te d to attend            from the      rear tunnel,

that being          the mai n entrance               to areas 3 a nd 4.

It was m a y h e m and there was                  no way that a message            could be        passed

from my position.                 I ran towards              the S ou th S tand where       I saw

S u p er i n te n d e n t G r e e n w o o d   near         to the touchline      facing    the S ou th Stand

a nd the      control        box.       I shouted to him that             there were        f atalities and

we    needed a ss is t a n c e        quickly.              I did not wait for an answer and ran

back to the fencing are a near                             to gateway No.   3.

By this       time      several       officers         had climbed the fencing and were

hanging          over    the top trying to pull            people    up from the other           side of

the fence.              To some    extent     this was     being    successful.          Some were

being e xt racted from the gateway.                      By now a number       of severely

injured were             laid on the     playing a rea to the            left of the goalmouth.

Police      officers and supporters               alike were giving what a ss is t a n c e              they

could.

1 ran towards             the gate way and as          I did so a y o u t h was     pulled from the

gateway.           A ss is te d   by some supporters           I carried the y o u t h a ged about

17 years          to the    playing area,        his    breathing was s h a ll ow but he was

alive,       I therefore          placed him     in the     coma    position a n d as         I s tarted
                                                                         s'          ■
to get up I saw Chief S up er in t e n d e n t              Nesbi t ^>6 go    past me and go

towards      the gate wa y No.          3.

I fol lowed him an d saw that the gate wa y was still                         blocked.          Chief

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit    had told the       officers       to clear the gateway of

bodies as best             they    could but they were           being h am pe re d by two          bodies

in particular,             one of w h ic h was      laid face       down his head and upper

body being e n t a ng le d w ith the other                 bodies    in the doorway,           his legs

and      lower body being            on the    perimeter       track.                     .

I int ended to atte mp t              to remove     this    body when the body of a male

40 to 45 years,             well     built,    salt and pepper hair,          was   passed through

the gateway.             S er geant 840 Wright and myself                carried this man on to

the grassed area.                 I cleared the man's           throat and S er g e a n t Wright

commenced heart massage,                 whilst     I commenced mouth to m outh

resuscitation.              After a couple of minutes we                 realised that         this was a

pointless          exercise       the man was dead and           I covered his      upper       body with

my       coat.

1' returned to gate wa y No.                 3 and saw Chief S u p t . Nesbit            lifting a             !

small      boy up the         perimeter       fence.     The    child's shoe    or shoelace           had

become      ent an gl ed        in the perimeter fence and it had to be released by                            ,

this    time a number              of officers       had made       their way      into    the enclosure

a nd were       either moving             bodies,    ass is ti ng      others    over    the fences,        or

giving m outh to m o ut h                resuscitation.          Two    officers    in particular           come

to mind,        although          there were many others whose                  names    I do not know.

Sgt G utcher           and C o n s ta bl e Hum ph ri es     of    VC * Division.          Their actions

were    p ra is eworthy to say the                 least.

I then a ss is te d several                other    officers with the            removal    of     casualties

from the are a of a ro u n d gate wa y No.                  3.      With Chief S u p t . Nesbit,

S er ge an t Morton,           HQ Serious Crime S q ua d and other                 oficers,        we made a

chain and            continued      to    pass   injured and dead           people from the

compound.             It    is proper      to say at this         time that       the m a j o r i t y of thee

people were            in fact      dead by now.

As the number               of bodies      inside the       compound dwindled,            I a ss is t e d

police officers               and supporters         to   carry the dead away on make-shi ft

stretchers.                These were a dv er ti si ng      hoardings        used on the           perimeter

track    of the ground.

The    bodies were             carried to the        gym na si um where         they had to be taken

from the        stretcher          in order      to get them through the d o o r .                 The   bodies

were    then either               left with one of the officers who                 had a s s i s t e d 'in

carrying        them or handed over                to officers         inside the g y m n a s i u m for

c on ti nu ity        purposes.

I a s si s te d        with the       removal       of 3 or 4 such bodies          but    I a m unable        to

recall     anything           about      them other       than they were all male an d in

either     their           late t#*ns      or early twenties.

As    I was about            to    leave the gym na si um on the            last such v e n t u r e ,

s o me b od y    I     am unable         to say wh»t asked          if a check could be made

outside         to     see     if there were any more dead in the                  irnmediatearea-. of

the    prison van and               police   room.

I went     outside and a ss i s t e d            in carrying        the body of a male              20 to 22

years,     fair        hair, ,no other details,              into the gymnasium.               I    returned

and saw one more           body outside.          It was    laid on the floor             between    the

prison van and the g ym nasium wall.                    It had been      partially         covered

with a green blanket.               Together wit h PC 2031           Jakson    I carried this

body    into the gymnasium,              I a ss is te d PC Jack so n with the             completion

of a sudden       death     report and        left him w i t h the body.          This      body was

later    identified as Stuart W i l l i a m Paul               Thompson,    17 years,!

                                        Liverpool

S o metime after 4,30pm.

I then returned to the              playing a rea and made my way towards                    enclosure

No. 3.      I saw that          the wire     fencing    had been bent a w a y from the.frame

at one    corner.         This    I u nderstood       had been    done   by p o l i c e    of ficers      in

an attempt       to     remove the      casulaties.         I then noticed the broken

barrier w h ic h must have had an effect                   on the outcome        of this

tragedy.       The      cross member       had snap pe d near to the neck             of the

securing stand and then the whole                     stand had been pushed forward,                 no

doubt    by the        pressure    exerted by the supportrs at some stage.

Chief Supt.       Nesbit        had alre ad y    posi ti on ed officers       to preserve the

immediate      scene      for evidential         purposes.

I looked ar ou nd the scene at some                    of the officers        and saw that some

were overcome wit h emotion a n d others were                     physically       exhausted.

All,    I feel     sure,    were     numb w ith the scenes         they had witnsses.

It was at this           time    that   I noticed that my shirt            had vomit and blood

on it, my trousers              and shoes were         covered   in mud,    my hat,        coat and

tie were missing.

I went a ro un d speaking            to police        officers   giving what       support and

e nc ou r ag em en t    I could under the         circumstances.         I st ay ed on the

playing area until              nearly all      the    s upporters   had    left the ground          and

then    remained        in the ground until            I was   stood down ^ t 7pflV that

evening     by Chief       Supt,     Mole.

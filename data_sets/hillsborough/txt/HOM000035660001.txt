As you know, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will visit Liverpool in early October and we have
arranged an opportunity for all the Hillsborough families who wish to do so to put their points
of view directly to him. This will take place in the Lecture Theatre on the 4th floor of the
Merseyside Maritime Museum, Albert Dock, Liverpool, on the morning of Monday 6th
October.

This letter invites you and Ann Adlington to attend. The session will begin at 10 o’clock.
But it would be helpful if people who wish to come could arrive earlier and tea and coffee
will be available from 9.30.

This letter gives entry only to you and to Ann. If you come by car, you should park in the
main Albert Dock car park, which is two or three minutes walk from the Museum.

I look forward to seeing you and Ann again on Monday 6th. Please bring this letter with
you.

 I am copying this to Ann Adlington.

Message


Ann

I sent this letter this pm inviting you and Julian to the
lecture theatre session on Monday 6th. I didn ’t anticipate
that you9d have had any bother getting in anyway, but
Julian said he wanted to come & plainly felt happier with a
proper invite. So I sent him this one and included you too!

See you on Tuesday

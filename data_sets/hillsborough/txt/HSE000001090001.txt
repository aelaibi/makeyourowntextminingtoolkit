  History and Background
   On 11 May 1985 th e entire football world was shaken
   by th e death of 56 spectators a t Bradford City’s Val­
   ley Parade. In term s of hum an life it was not the
   worst disaster to befall B ritish football, nor was it the
   only one in recent years. On th e same day a young
   m an died und er a collapsing w all a t Birmingham;
   th ere had been several deaths th a t same m onth a t a
   m atch in Mexico City, and more th a n 20 deaths a t the
   Lenin Stadium in Moscow a few years earlier. In 1982
  th e collapse of a stand in Algiers cost another ten
  lives. Two weeks after th e fire a t Valley Parade, 39
  fans died a t th e Heysel S tadium when a wall col­
  lapsed, like Birm ingham , in th e wake of a senseless
  riot.
     W hat m ade th e events a t Brussels and Bradford all
  th e more shocking was th a t both were captured by
  television cam eras. Ibrox in 1971 was shown only in
  black and w hite, after-the-event news reports. Brad­
  ford burned before a nation in full colour.
     C ity’s tragedy was the first tim e football spectators
 had been killed in a fire. Millions of television
 viewers saw how antiquated was the stand and how
 quickly it was destroyed. They saw how people hesi­
 ta te d for a few vital seconds before realizing the
 gravity of th e situation.
     They saw how several brave individuals made gal­
 la n t attem pts to rescue those caught in the conflagra­
 tion, b u t did not see how m any others also risked

    The fault arose in th e north west com er of the

quite horrific crush. (For a full account of the disas­

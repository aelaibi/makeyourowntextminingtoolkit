 THE GROUND TO INSPECT THE TICKETS TO STOP PEOPLE WITHOUT TICKETS GETTING IN

WAS CHAOS,     I CRITICISE THE POLICE FOR NOT DELAYING THE KICK OFF, WHAT

HAPPENED TO COMMUNICATION AND VIDEO CAMERAS AS REGARDS TO OVERCROWDING IN

PENS 3 AND 4,      WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE TELL THE FANS TO SPREAD OUT,                 LACK OF USE OF

TANNOY SYSTEM TO PASS ON INFORMATION,,             THERE WERE NO STEWARDS IN OR AROUND THE

TUNNEL,    LAST YEAR WHEN IT WAS FULL THEY CLOSED IT AND DIRECTED PERSONS TO

 RELATIONS IS N E E D E D .

 THE LIVERPOOL FANS WERE MAGNIFICENT AT HELPING OUT WHEN OTHERS SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN DOING IT.

    Q53

    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,
■
    AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

     I FELT THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN STOPPED E A R L I E R . I ALSO BELIEVE THERE WAS TOO

    MUCH OF A DELAY BEFORE THE GATES WERE OPENED.

     THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS THEY WERE AT THE

    FRONT.        THEY DID VERY LITTLE TO ASSIST THE INJURED ONCE THE HATCH WAS STOPPED

    ^THE       SUPPORTERS WERE THE MAIN ONES WHO HELPED,,

    054

     IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

    JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

     I FEEL STRONGLY THAT THERE WAS NO NEED FOR PENS,, ALL. THE FANS SUPPORTED THE

    SAME TEAM SO WHY NEED FENCES TO PEN THEM IN.          I BELIEVE THE FENCES SHOULD HAVE

    BEEN REMOVED.

 SEVERITY OF WHAT HAD    TAKEN PLACE WAS REALISED.

 OF POLICE OFFICERS,    ALTHOUGH I APPRECIATE FANS MUST BE SEGREGATED.

  LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
  It has occurred to me that in this very difficult and complex
  inquiry you are undertaking on the Hillsborough disaster,
  questions may arise about the antecedent behaviour of Liverpool
  football supporters, particularly at all ticket games.

  I enclose papers which may just be of interest to the Inquiry,
  related to a match which occurred in February 1988 when Liverpool
  came down to play Watford and despite all the pre-match warnings,
  1,500 of those fans did not have tickets and caused difficulty
  outside the ground.  It was decided on the day, as a matter of
  expediency, rather than have this un-policed group wandering about
  the nearby centre of Watford, it was safer and easier for them to
  gain admission to the ground.

  The reports I attach are all self-explanatory, and you may take
  the view there is no relevance but at least you should be aware of
  the previous practice of people speculatively coming to venues of
  football matches from Liverpool, which we have not experienced from
  other clubs to such a degree, and their expectation that one way
  or the other they will gain admittance to the ground.

 RE:     LIVERPOOL FOOTBALL CLUB - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

 Attached hereto is the Football Match Summary relating to the match
 played between Watford and Liverpool at Vicarage Road, Watford on
 13 February 1988, the total crowd attendance being 23,838 this
 included 6,200 Liverpool Fans.

  Together with Superintendent HOWLEY I was responsible for policing
  this particular game.  I was responsible for policing outside the
  Football Stadium. Prior to kick-off it became apparent that approx­
  imately 1,500 Liverpool supporters had arrived without tickets. The
  game, which had been declared 'All Ticket' at Police instigation, was
  well publicised prior to 13 February. The majority of all fans
  attending were in possession of tickets. Some of the 1,500 fans had
  been drinking and were somewhat noisy although I am bound to say the
  behaviour was generally good. The prevailing weather, without doubt,
  assisted the policing of the crowd and after consultation with
  Superintendent HOWLEY I decided to hold the 1,500 supporters in the
  Cardiff Road area at the bottom of the walkway giving access to the
  Stadium. Given that it would have presented severe policing
  difficulties and problems were the 1,500 fans allowed to disperse and
  run the town and frequent local public houses.  After further consul­
  tation with Superintendent HOWLEY and Club Officials it was decided
  prudent to let these fans into the arena upon payment.  I was aware
  that there would be sufficient room in the Stadium to accommodate
  these fans because of the shortfall on sales of tickets in Liverpool.
  I was also conscious of the fact that previously Liverpool fans had
  attempted to enter the ground by forcing open gates. The match was
  relatively trouble free there being 2 arrests of Liverpool supporters
  and 14 ejections of Liverpool supporters.

  At the match briefing officers were told of the strong possibility of
  visitors arriving without tickets and seeking access to the Football
  Stadium.

      The estimated number of visiting supporters was sue’
                                                         " that it was necessary to make
      the match ALL-TICKET. Despite publicity some 15CO Liverpool Supporters turned up
      without and were kept in a holding area some 500 yards fron the ground until a few
      minutes before kick-off. It was decided tsrudent to allow these 1500 entrance to
      the ground rather than have them in the Town Centre.

        Minor difficulties at start of match «ith larse numbers of none ticket holders

        Some pushing and shoving around the turnstiles.                       Much of it good natured.




         A holding area for none ticket holders was established in Cardiff Rd to prevent
         nroblems at the turnstiles. This was possible because of the fenced walkway
         leading to the visiting support area. By not allowing none ticket holders to
         enter the walkway, they were kept away from the ground until it was clear that
         they could be admitted.

8.   C O M M EN TS ON POLICING TACTICS

     i.e. Escorts, T u rn s tile S earch es, Control of Licensing L a w s etc.:



          Searching carried out at turnstiles. Escorts to Shuttle Trains from Stadium
          to ’-'atford Junction. Large number of Liverpool Supporters travelled back into
          London on the Local trains. No problems.

          The tactics of establishing a holding area for those non^ticket holders was a
          success and will be done at future all-ticket games where this is likely to
          prove a problem.

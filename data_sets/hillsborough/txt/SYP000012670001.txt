      To: Chief Superintendent                                        Date: 1 8 th April 1 9 8 9



               SUBJECT:    Semi Final-Nottingham Forest v Liverpool 15.4.89

                On Saturday 15 April 1 9 8 9 at 09*30 I reported for duty at the ground in
              connection with the above event.Along with other special constables I attended
              the main briefing in the north stand, On completion of this I then attended in the
              gymnasium where a second briefing for special constables took place for the
              deployment of special constables by Commandant Stothard and Div Commandant
                     . The special constables were split into four serials , I was given
              command of two serials covering sectors D sad E. sector D covering parking
              of supporters vehicles in the Halifax fid Southey Ave area. Sector E covering
              Middlewood Kd ^ynn gardens Area.
                   At approx 10.50am gill officers went aut and took up there positions.
              At 11.15 * visited sector D s/c                 K5» were supervising the parking in
              that area and everything was under control. I then attended at Claywheels lane
              to change my radio which would not transmit. Haveing obtained a new radio I
              then made my way up Leppings lane to the officers on Middlewood road under
              the supervision of S/C                  , arriving at approx 12.15, At this time there
              was a large number of supporters in this area and a constant flow of vehicles
              arriveing, and I remained in this area until approx 14.45 when the volume of
              traffic and supporters at this point had now reduced and there was just
              intermittant vehicles. ^e walked along Middlewood Ed towards the ground with
          the main body of supporters who were well behaved, On arriving in Leppings
          lane I was aware of a very large Volume of supporters, I was instructed to
          take the 6 specials to the gym on stand by. Due to the heavy, congestion
          at the ground X took the officers docm Vere ^d entering the ground by gate 0
          Immediatley on entering the ground we were directed onto the pitch to assist
              it was approx   1 5 *0 5   , % was not aware at this time what had happened,
          Immediatly officers were split under the direction of a chief inspector^not Known]
          some going to Leppings lane end)these were S/Cs                               and SO
          S/Cs_________________ • and Myself were directed behind the goal at the
          spion kop end monitoring the Nottingham Forest supporters to prevent a pitch
          invasion. Once the supporters had settled I intermitantly helped dazed and
          distressed supporters to available first aid. Also makeing intermitant checks
          on special constables.
          At 17«30hrs I then began to co-ordinate the re-grouping of special constables
          behind the north stand as they began to return to the ground some in a very
          distressed condition. At 18.30 after de briefing, all specials being accounted
          for, I attended at the ®oyal Hallamshire Hospital to check on the condition
Gen/2     of one of my injured officers arriving at 1900hrs, S/C                              sustained
          ®ib injuries, unable to see him at this time I left the hospital, going off
           duty at 20.00hrs.                             Sub Divisional Officer

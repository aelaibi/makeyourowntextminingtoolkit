              I am presently s t ationed at Don c a s t e r                       as a uniformed officer            engaged

              on mobile        patrol.

              At 8.30 a .m . on Saturday,                  15 April       1989,       I reported on duty at

              Doncaster        Police S t a t i o n for duties at Hillsborough,,                        Sheffield,      in

              connection with the F.A.                   Cup S e mi-Final           between Liverpool         and

              N o t t i n g h a m Forest.        Shortly afterwards                I was    conveyed to S h e f f i e l d

              wit h other       officers         in a d o u b l e - d e c k e d    service    bus.      On arrival      I

              went    to the N orth Stand where                   I was      briefed along with other members

              of my serial.           This       serial     being      under       the    control    of Police |3ergeant
                  ^HD
              1684 Mozley.

Mr an         About        11.15 a.m.    the same date,              I took        up my    post     in company with

              Police Con s t a b l e 2042 Drury at the                    junction of Vere Road and Leppings

              Lane.         At this    location we erected                barriers across             the m o u t h of the

              junction        in order      to    comply with          the    instructions           that we were      to

              prevent access           to Vere Road by anyone                     other    than residents.

              F rom this time          on there was a steady                  flow of supporters            arriving,

              large        numbers    of w hich were          carrying        cans and bottles           of alcohol         in

              the     form of    lager and beer.                These     supporters were a d v i s e d         that    they

              w o u l d not be a l l o w e d      in the ground with the alcohol.                        With o u t any

                                                                                                                 R369

problems        they turned          round and wa l k e d away from the ground and

continued        consuming         the alcohol.            It also        soon became' a p p arent               that

large     numbers       of     peo pi                    v i ng without          tickets.           This was made

clear     fay them walk i n g about and a p p r o a c h i n g                  other    fans asking          if they

had    'spares' .        I myself         was a p p r o a c h e d      two or three          times    by, fans

e nqui r i ng where                       1 d obtain tickets.

As the morning wore                on and kick         off approached,                the    percentage          of

people arriving              in a drun k e n state,            still      carrying          cans    of beer etc,

increased,        but    the mood was still                good.

Most    of rny time at my               post was      spent,          apart    from    preventing          people

entering Vere Road,                directing         supporters          to their       respective

turnstiles,        most       of wi\uxTn had         clearly not          read their          tickets       which

were    s elf-explanatory.                                        .

About 2.30        p.m.       by which t^ime I had been joined by Police                               Sergenat

Mozley,      there was a marked                increase        in the number            of fans arriving

and    it was     not i ceabl e-v that supporters were                        starting       to build up at

the turnstiles.

S h o r t l y after w a r d s    a fight       broke     out      on Leppings Lane             in the area of

the    bridge     over       the River Don.            I d i d n ’t see what            h a p pened       but saw

two. youths       being       led away and through the                    barriers at Vere Road,

where     they went          from there,         I d o n ’t know.             By this       time    the

c ongestio n o f p e o p 1 e w a s g e 11 i n g w o r s e a n d the               cro w d stret c.h e d f r o m

the    turnstiles        to my       location.         A gain         I was    inundated with             people

arriving asking              directions and when               it was         pointed out          that    the

turnstiles        they wanted was              the    one s u r r o u n d e d by a sea of             people,

they started to become                   very A g i t a t e d ,       asking    if there was any other

way    into the ground.                 Some   ignored my advice and                   crossed       the    barrier

into Vere Road,              attem p t i n g   to find al t e r n a t i v e       entrances.              Some

w aited    patiently          but the m a j ority          stor m e d off and joined                 the growing

number     of   people who           I could see         pushing         towards       the    gates.

                                                                                                            R369

About 3.00         p.m.     as    I was    talking          to a Liverpool          fan who was        happy to

a l l o w the    crowd to         clear    before          gaining    entry.        I noticed the        crowd

suddenly ease,             this    seemed/tto         coincide       w ith calls      from the      crowd         for

something        to be dorie^lfo ease                the    crush.

A few moments           later      people       started to        come back         out    of the ground,

some were        injured and           in a very d i s t r e s s e d state.               1't soon became

clear     from talking            to   people        coming    out    that something          had happened

near    to the       turnstiles and on the                   inside       of the ground       involving

people       being    trampled             and       crushed.        At    that    stage    I wasn't     aware

of anything          happe W ing       on the t e r r a c e s .       Ambul a n c s s and the Fire

’
B rigade      started       to arrive          but    I still    didn't         know what was       happening

I DIDN'T HAVE A RADIO.                  Access        to the    ground       for e m ergency vehicles

was    hampered by people               stood making           no attempt          to either     enter or

fl eav e .

3'. remained at my           post not knowing about an                      instruction       for all

a v a ilable     officers         to go    into       the ground.          As     people    star t e d to    come

out    I at first a * *            pted to       prevent       them from entering Vere Road,                      but

as    it became app               nt that       something       serious         had happened,       I removed

the barriers          so    people      could        clear    quickly and supporters              were      going

to houses        in Vere Road to use                  telephones.

I. stayed       near to the junction and did not                           enter    the ground at all

until we were          told       to go to the N o r t h S tand              for de-brief,        instead         1

helped to get           e m e r g e r ^ ” vehicles         to the     ground and advise           fans      re;

location        of transport           etc.      As more       of the       crowd,    the younger        element

of which had o b viously                been drinking,            started to become             very

ag gressive and abusive                 towards myself           and other          officers who were

outside.         They were         saying       things       like,    "YOU MUR D E R I N G BASTARDS.

            feelings,         the only thing we          could do was        stand and take abuse,               if we     ;

I am presently stationed at Doncaster as a uniformed officer engaged on mobile

At 8.30am on Saturday 1 5 th April 1 9 8 9 I reported on   duty at Doncaster Police
station for duties at Hillsborough, Sheffield in connection       with the F.A.Cup
semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.        Shortly afterwards I was conveyed
to Sheffield with other officers in a double-decked        service bus. On arrival I went
to the North Stand where I was briefed along with other members of my serial.
This serial being under the control of PS 168A- Mozley.


About 11.15am the same date I took up my post in company with Pc 20k2 Drury at
the junction of Vere Road and Leppings Lane. At this location we erected barriers
across the mouth of the junction in order to conrply with the instructions that
we were to prevent access to Vere Road by anyone other than residents.


From this time on there was a steady flow of supporters arriving, large numbers of
which were carrying cans and bottles of alcohol in the form of lager and beer.
These supporters were advised that they would not be allowed in the ground
with the alcohol. Without any problems they turned round and walked away from the
ground and continued concuming the alcohol. It also soon became apparent that
large numbers of people weue    arriving without tickets. This was made clear
by them walking about and approaching other fans asking if they had "spares”.
I myself was approached two or three times by fans enquiring where they could
obtain tickets.


As the morning wore on and kick off approached the percentage of people arriving
in a drunken state, still carrying cans of beer etc. increased, but the mood was
still good.


Most of my time at my post was spent, apart from preventing people entering
Vere Road was spent directing supporters to their respective turnstiles, most
of had clearly not read their tickets which were self explanotary.
About 2.30pm, by which time I had been joined by Ps Mozley there was a marked
increase in the number of fans arriving and it was noticable that supporters
were starting to build up at the turnstiles.


Shortly afterwards a fight broke out on Leppings Lane in the area the bridge
over the River Don. I didn't see what happened but saw two ypuths being led
away and through the barriers at Vere Road, where they went from there I don't
know. By this time the congestion of people was getting worse and the crowd
stretched from the turnstiles to my location. Again I was unindated by people
arriving asking directions and when it was pointed out that the turnstile they
wanted was the one surrounded by a sea of people they started to become very
aggitated asking if there was any°jway into the ground. Some ignored my advice
 and crossed the barrier into Vere -^oad attempting to find alternative entrances.
Some waited patiently but the majority stormed off and joined the growing number
of people who I could see pushing towards the the gates.


About 3*00pm as I was talking to a Liverpool fan who was happy to allow the crowd
to clear   before gaining entry I noticed the crowd suddenly eased, this seemed
to coincide with calls from the crowd for something to be done to ease   the
crush.


A few moments later people started to come back out of the ground,some •£ were
injured and in a very distressed state. It soon became clear from talking to
people coming out that something had happened near to the turnstiles and on the
inside of the ground involving people being trampled on and crushed. At that
stage I wasn't aware of anything happening on the terraces. Ambulances and the fire
brigade started to arrive but I still didn't know what was hapening - I DIDN'T HAVE
A RADIO. Access to the ground for emergency vehiclesswas hampered by people stood
making no attempt to either enter or leave.


I remained at my post not knowing about an instruction for all available officers to
go into the ground. As people started to come out I at first attempted to prevent
them fro* entering Vere Road but as it became apparent that something serious
had happened I removed the barriers so people could clear quickly and supporters were
going to houses in Vere Road to use telephones.


I stayed   near to the junction and did not enter theground at all until we weretold
to go to   the Norte stand for debrief,instead I helped to get emergency vehicles to
the ground and advise fans re location of transport etc. As more of the crowd
the younger element of which who had obviously drinking started to become very
aggresiwe and abusive towards myself and other officers who were outside.
They were saying things like, " YOU MUJERING BASTARBS"-, » IT'S YOUR FAULT FOR OPENING

THE GATES";
" I HOPE YOU DON'T SLEEP YOUMQRG6RING BASTARDS". Some of the older and more
responsible fans kept apologising for the behaviour of these supporters
saying there was nothing anyone could do.


At this stage as more supportes came and began venting their feelings the only thing
we could do was stand and take the abuse, if we had reacted in any way we have
clearly been put under physical abuse. As I stood and took the abuse I felt
totally helpless, I still didn't know what was happening, I wasN't able to offer
any information to people at all. I actually started to fear for my own safety
and it crossed my mind that these people who were clearly drunk were the ones
who had arrived at the ground late were the ones responsible for the pushing
outside the ground before the kick-off.


Eventually all the crowds disappeared without incident and we called into the
ground where we were debriefed. At no time did I see or handle any bodies.

                  Dear Sin

                  R - v - South Yorkshire Police Authority Ex                                                 Constable for South Yorkshire
                  Police

                  We understand that your client wishes to be heard on the Chief Constable's application for judicial
                  review of the Authority's decision of 5 February 1999.

                  We would not oppose your client being represented at the substantive hearing which is due to
                  commence on 22 March 1999. Indeed, we think it would be sensible and helpful for the former
                  officers to be represented since they are directly connected with the decision under challenge. This
                  is particularly so as Miss Adlington has disputed the Chief Constable's standing to bring the
                  application. We do not think that submission is right.

                  It is in the public interest that this case is heard and we would not want a technical point cm
                  standing to prevent the court from considering the substantive issue.

                  We understand that the clerk to Counsel for your dient was represented at the meeting at court to
                  agree a time estimate and fix a date for the substantive hearing. Therefore, we do not drunk that
                  representations by your client should upset the time estimate.


                  Yours faithfully

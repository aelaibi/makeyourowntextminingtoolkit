                  Sportsground                 to       prevent       unlawful                     parking        in      that     location.                 Other

                  officers           on       my    serial          were           PC     3087       Keenan,           PC    1968       Tams,       PC       831

                  points        supervising                   the    supporters.

                  My     detail          took       up    patrol          at            this       location          at     approximately                11.15am

                  (1115).            At       this       time       there               was    a   slow       trickle         of       supporters             making

                  their        way       to    the       ground.               They           were       well, b e h a v e d       and       in    good       humour.

                  However,           several             of    them       were            asking          where        the    nearest             pub    w&s       that

                  was        open.        I    can       remember              a        group       of    a p p r o ; ; i m a t e ly    eight       youths          who

                  were        walking          to       the    ground,                  return       past       me     because          they       had       been       told

                to      me    that       people       were    arriving       too    late    for    the    game       and    were

                rushing            past    me    as    late    as    2.50pm       (1450)    to    get    to    the    ground.           Some

                of      them       seemed       Hell    bent    on    getting       to    the    ground       as    quick       as   possible

at    this       time             I    can       remember             a    supporter                 at    the           back         of     me       saying

"Get       him       to,breathe".                          I    don't          know        why,       but           I    told         my     colleague             that

we    should              try         again.              I    knew        he       was    dead,           but          I s e e m e d to              want    to       be

trying          to        df      something.                    I    then           left       him    on        the g r o u n d a n d                  went       to

the    fence              at' t h e             front.                     I    can       remem^f               a       s                                              th e

Eventually                there            fas        s u f f m ^ C ^ o m ,                 and       I as^hsj^?c^rn                         other          officers

fence

I    was       feeling                sick       at       the       time.

Eventually                when             all    the          bodies          had        been       passed              through             I went          back

through          the          gate          and       to       the    rear          of     Leppings             Lane             where           1    saw

approximately                         twelve          dead          bodies          laid        on    the       ground                with           clothing

over       their          heads.                 I was          told       by       an     Inspector                    who      I    don't           know,       to

form       a    cordon                to    prevent             people          from        examining                    the         bodies.            I    then

remember             talking                to    an       injured             man       who     was       at           the      side        of       the    wall,

on    his       back,             complaining                   of    back          and     stomach              injuries.                       I    placed       my

jacket          over          him          and    spoke             with       him       and     tried          to          keep        him          conscious.

He    was       eventually                      taken          by    ambulance              and       I    think              he      would           have    been

okay.

I    can       then       remember                being             told       to    go     to       the    back              of      Leppings              Lane

stand          where          I       formed          a    cordon          so       that        Liverpool                   supporters                 leaving

the    stand             could             be    ushered             through             one     gate       out             of       view        of    the

bodies.              I    can          still          hear          the    chants           of       being              called          a    murderer             by

several          of       the          supporters                   leaving          the        ground.                  I didn't                know       how    to

respond          but          felt          quite          angry          as    I    did        not       know          what          had        happened.

Eventually                when             the    crowds             dispersed              what          was           left       of       my       serial       was

returned             to       the          North          stand       for       a    debrief.

Eventually                I       retired             from          duty       at    8.00pm           (2000)                at     Mexborough.

Having          now       had          time       to       think          about          it,     I am       not             surprised                 about       the

serials          should        make          their      way       to     the          ground             and       I    can          recollect                      going

I    can    remember           a    tail       was        made         for       an        ambulance,                   on      the radio,                      and       I

thought          that    some           serious           public disorder                          was       occurring                       inside             the

grou/d.           We    were' o r i g i n a l l y             t o l d to         form          a    cordon             around                the       gates              to

thy    entrance          to        Leppings             Lane       end       of       the          ground,             at       the          time          I

d b u l d n ’t    understand                 this       and       shortly             afterwards                   we       were             told          to       go


into       the    ground.

As    we    entered          the        ground,          at       the    rear             of       Leppirtgs            Lane             stand,                I. s a w

bodies       laid       on     the       floor          immediately                   behind             the       stand,                a       lot       of       these

were       being       tended           to    by    police             offi/cers,                  but       I got          the          impression

that       some    were        already             dead.           I walked                through             the          gates                into

Leppings          Lane       terrace           where          I    saw       a       large          number             of       youths                on       the

playing          area    and        everything                seemed             to       be       in    a    state             of       chaos.

I    can    recollect              an    ambulance                behind             the       goal          mouth,             but          I     cannot

recollect          if     that          was    there          when       I       first             attended.                    I    then             saw       bodies

at    the    side       of     the       wall       next          to    the          metal          fence,             these             appeared                   to    be

two    and       three       deep        and       were       blue       and          I    got          the    horrible                      smell             of

vomit       and    alcohol.

I. c a n    remember           being          in    a. m o m e n t a r y             state          of       shock          at       this             scene,             but

was    then       called           to    give       artificial                   resuscitation                         on       an       elderly                man

who    was       laid     on       the       floor       several             yards             back          from       the          wall.                 He       was

laid, a t        the    side        of       another          youth          who          appeared             to       be          dead.              One

officer          gave     mouth          to    mouth          whilst             I    performed                heart                massage.                    The

At     this          time       I    can       remember              heariVig,           on    the       radio,                of          some       trouble^

At 10.00 a m on S a t u r d a y 15 April 1989, I attend ed H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o tball Ground,
Sheffield, for a b r i e f i n g of the F A Cup semi-f inal b e tween N o t t i n g h a m Forest and
Liverpool. . M y serial c o m m a n d e r was I n s p ector M i l l e t t and I was infor med that I
was  in  charge       of     serial  32, w h i c h e n t ailed    the s upervision   of Liv erpool
supporters a t t e n d i n g the game from P e n i stone R o a d North.

M y serial was on static p o i n t s b e t w e e n the rou nda b o u t at the b o t t o m of P e n i stone
R o a d N o r t h -and the T r a v e l l e r s R e s t public house.        PC 2103 Frost and PC 2298
C o o p e r were on duty at the e n t r a n c e to N i a g a r a S p o r t s g r o u n d to p r e v e n t unlawful
p a r k i n g in that location.            O t h e r officers on my serial were PC 3087 Keenan, PC
1968 Tams, PC 831 Wright, PC 201 O l n e y and PC Edwards.                           These o f f i c e r s were on
static p o i n t s s u p e r v i s i n g the supporters.

M y d etail took up p a t r o l at this location at a p p r oximately 11.15 am.                 At this
time there was a s l o w t r ickle of s upporters m a k i n g their w a y to the ground.
T h e y were well b e h a v e d and in good humour.           However, several of them were asking
w here        the       nearest pub      was  that w as   open.      I   can r e m e m b e r a group of
a p p r o x i m a t e l y eight y o u t h s who were w a l k i n g to the ground, r e t u r n past me
b e c ause        they had b e e n told that a p u b further up Halifax R o a d was open.
E v e n t u a l l y as the came d r e w closer the amount of p edestrians m a k i n g their way to
the g r o u n d increased.              Again  they were in good h umour and were causing no
problems.

I can r e m e m b e r coaches a p p r o a c h i n g the g roun d and I was present w i t h PC Olney
and PC E d w a r d s w h e n the y we re d i r e c t e d to Clayw h e e l s Lane for parking. Thes e
buses w e r e chec ked by PC O l n e y to verify they were Liverpool supporters and,
again, these too were in g o o d humour.

E v e n t u a l l y somewhere b e t w e e n 1.45 and 2.00 pm the Clayw h e e l s Lane was full and
coaches were then d i r e c t e d along P e n i stone R o a d N o r t h to Halifax R o a d for parking
I can r e m e m b e r saying to myself, as it got after 2.00 pm, that the supporters
'are going to be r u shing to get to the ground' .                          I can r e m ember a coach being
d i r ected to H a lifax R o a d as late as 2.40 pm.                 At this time the s u p p o r t e r s were
in large numbers, most of them r u nning towards the ground, some d r i nking from
beer cans and I thought to myself, 'fancy having to have a d r i n k like this and
leaving it so late to get into the ground'.                     A l t h o u g h a lot of t h e %crowd ranpast
me, they were not c a using any p u blic order problems, but just s e e m e d to be in a
rush to get to the g r o u n d before kick-off.                 I was a ma zed to find so m a n y people
arriving so late and one of                    m y r e c olle ctions was         of a car p u l l i n g up on
Penistone R o a d N o r t h at the P i z z a h u t with five occupants, o b v i o u s l y L i v e rpool
supporters, i ntending to a b and on their vehicle and r u s h to the game.                         I advised
them to park their v e h i c l e p r o p e r l y on Halifax Road, this was at about 2.50 pm
and I was g r eeted w i t h a n g r y shouts of frustration from the occupants.

A t this time I can r e m e m b e r hearing, on the radio, of some trouble inside the

N o r t h ro undabout a n d a s k i n g w h e t h e r or not our serial should make his way to the
ground.        I had no idea w h a t sort of trouble was occurring.              Inspector Millett
was then informed that all s e r ials s hould make their way to the g r o u n d and I can
recolle ct going up P e n i s t o n e Road-.North and informing my serial of this.



                                                                                                         C o n t 'd
We a t t e n d e d at the" L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground where I saw a large group of
p olice o f f i c e r s , some on h o r s e s and a small group of supporters who w e r e venting
their f e e lings at        not b e i n g a l l o w e d to get into the ground.

I can r e m e m b e r a         call was m a d e for an ambulance,      on the radio, and I thought
that some s e riou s           p ub lic d i s o r d e r was occurring   inside the             ground. We were
o r i g i n a l l y .told to    fo rm a c o r d o n around the gates    to the entrance to Leppings
Lane end of the                 ground, at the time I couldn't          u n d e r s t a n d this and    shortly
a f t e r w a r d s we were    tol d to go into the ground.

As we e n t e r e d the ground, at the r e a r of Leppings Lane stand, I saw b odi es laid
on the f l o o r i mmedia tely b e h i n d the stand, a lot of these were being tended, to
by p o l i c e officers, but I got the impression that some wer e already dead.                          I
wa l k e d t h r o u g h the gates into L e p p i n g s Lane T e rrace where I saw a large number
of youths on the p l a y i n g a r e a and e v e r y t h i n g seemed to be in a state of chaos.
I can r e c o l l e c t an a m b u l a n c e b e h i n d the goal mouth, but I cannot r e c o l l e c t if
that was there w h e n I first a ttended.                  I then saw bodies at the side of the-wall
next to the metal fence, these a p p e a r e d to be two and three deep and were blue
and I got the horrible smell of v omit and alcohol.

I can r e m e m b e r being in a m o m e n t r y state of shock at this scene, but I was then
called to give a r i t i f i c a l r e s u s i t a t i o n on an e l d erly m a n who was laid on the
floor several yards b a c k fro m the wall.                        He was laid at the side of another
youth w h o a p p e a r e d to be dead.                  One officer gave m o u t h to m o u t h whilst I
p e r f o r m e d heart massage.         T h e o f f i c e r who gave m o u t h to m o u t h stated it was no
use he was d e a d and at this time I can r e m ember a s u p p o r t e r at the back of me
saying, "GET H I M T O B R E A T H . "         I d o n ’t know why, but I told my colleague that we
s hould try again.            I k n e w he was dead, but I seemed to w a n t to be trying to do
something.          I then left h i m on the ground and went to the fence at the front.                     I
can r e m e m b e r a s u p p o r t e r t ryin g to rip the fence away and I assisted in trying
to pull the fence away w i t h him.                       E ventua lly there was suffic i e n t r o o m and I
assis ted in other o f f i c e r s p a s s i n g the dead bodies and i n jured p e o p l e through
the gap in the fence.

I was feeling sick at the              time.

Eventu a l l y w h e n all the b odies h a d been p assed through I w e n t back t h rough the
gate and to the r e a r of L e p p i n g s Lane where I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y twelve dead
bodies laid on the g r o u n d w i t h cloth i n g over their heads.             I was told by an
Inspe c t o r w h o I don't know, to form a cordon to p r eve nt p e o p l e from e x a m ini ng
the bodies.           I then r e m e m b e r talking to an injured m a n w h o was at the side       of
the wall, on          his back, c o m p l a i n i n g of back and s t o mach injuries. I p l a c e d my
jacket over h i m and spoke w i t h him and tried to keep him conscious.                         He was
eventually taken by a m b u l a n c e and I think he w o u l d have been okay.

I can then r e m e m b e r b e i n g told to go to the back of L e p pings Lane s t a n d where I
formed a c o r d o n so that L i v e r p o o l supporters leaving the stand could be u s he red
through one gate out of v i e w of the bodies.                 I can still hear the chants of
being called          a m u r d e r e r by s e veral of the supporter s l e aving the ground.   I
didn't k n o w h o w to r e s p o n d but felt quite angry as I did not know what had
happened.     E v e n t u a l l y w h e n the crow ds dispersed what was left of m y serial   was
re t urned to the N o r t h S t a n d for a debrief.

Eventuall y I r e t i r e d from duty at\,8.00 p m at Mexborough.

H a v i n g n o w had timfe to t h i n k about it, I am not s u r p rised about the b u i l d up of
suppor t e r s outside the L e p p i n g s Lane Stand.   It was clear to me that p e o p l e were
ar r i v i n g too late for the game and were rushing past me as late as 2.50 pm,^ to
get to the ground.           Some of them seemed hell bent on getting to the g r ound as
quick as p o s sible and on r e f l e c t i o n that seemed to be the only thing on their
m inds at that time.          I c a n say that they were not sho uting and a l t h o u g h in a
r u s h w e r e npt disorderly.

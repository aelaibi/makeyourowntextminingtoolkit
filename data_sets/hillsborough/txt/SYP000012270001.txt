                              18 April 1989

            Dear Mr Miller

            In response to your Telex of 17.4.8 9., requesting
            reports from officers who were at the Liverpool v
            Nottingham Forest match on Saturday 15 April, I
            report that I was there, off duty.

            I was invited to Hillsborough         by Mr Brian Clough,
            the Notts Forest Manager, who         presented me with a
            Nottingham Forest shirt for a         charity raffle, in
            their dressing room, prior to         the start of the match.

            Just before the match, I went with Sheffield Wednesday's
            Head of Security, Mr Lock, into the South Stand at the
            Nottingham Forest end of the ground to watch the game.

            I saw what football there was and witnessed the start
            of the disaster when people were climbing the perimeter
            fence and coming on to the playing area.  I also saw
            people being lifted into the upper stand.  I, like most
            of the other people at that end of the ground, simply
            thought it was hooligans invading the pitch.  It was not
            for some time that I realised anything untoward was
            happening.

            After about 15 minutes, when I felt there was going to be
            no more play, I left the stadium to return back to
            Pontefract.  At this time I was still unaware of the
            nature of the incident.  As I was leaving, there were
            unconfirmed rumours that 5 people were thought to have
            died.

            I was 24 hours cover and my Sub Division borders on
            South Yorkshire Police area.  I decided to return to my
            station in case of a call for assistance.


                                                                           / c o n t 1d ,

I listened to Radio Hallam in my car on the way back
to Pontefract and was astounded and shocked at the
news that was being continually broadcast regarding
casualties and the number of fatalities, which was
continually rising.

I had my camera with me and took a couple of snaps
of the start of the game and the early instances of #
people climbing over the perimeter fence.

I have really no idea how the disaster occurred, being
too far away to make any judgement either of cause or
police response.

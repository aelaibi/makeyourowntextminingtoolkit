Thank you for your letter of 9 October about Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
reported comment during his recent visit to Liverpool.

I am sorry that you were upset by the Judge's comment to Mr Phil Hammond.
The Judge has said on the record that he deeply regrets this remark, which he
made off-the-cuff and without any intention to offend. He has made it clear that
the behaviour of the fans is not the subject of the Inquiry.

As you know, the Judge spent three days in Liverpool meeting the families of
those who died and listening to their concerns. He has said that he found these
meetings fruitful and constructive, and that they will help him to write his report.

I am satisfied that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will produce a thorough report in
which the families and the public can have confidence.

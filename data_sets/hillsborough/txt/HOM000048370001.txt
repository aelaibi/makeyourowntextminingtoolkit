Dear Mr Bone
Hillsborough Enquiry
I am just writing to make contact with you concerning the above. Although I have not seen
a copy of Lord Justice Smith’s Terms of Reference’, I understand from press reports that
his enquiry has no specific reference to the Hillsborough Inquest. Nonetheless you should
be aware that every co-operation is offered.
The Hillsborough inquest was conducted by Dr Stefan Popper who retired in October
1991. I can make contact with Dr Popper should that prove necessary. Obviously a good
deal of documentation concerning Hillsborough is currently held by me in Archives.
Please let me know if I can do anything to assist.
Yours sincerely




C P Dorries
HM Coroner

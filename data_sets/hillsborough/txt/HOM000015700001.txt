  We have been asked by the Spanish Interior
  Ministry to thank you for allowing the two
  Spanish officials to sit in as observers
  at the Hillsborough Inquiry.   The Ministry
  say that they hope to be able to put some
  of the lessons they learnt to good use in
  their preparations for the Olympic Games in
  Barcelona and EXPO in Seville in 1992.

PRIME MINISTER

ANNIVERSARY MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR HILLSBOROUGH

The Home Secretary would like to know how important you feel it is
that there should be a senior Government representative at the
Memorial Service to mark the anniversary of Hillsborough.


He has been invited to attend the Service which is on Sunday and
will be held at Anfield.   Mr and Mrs Kinnock will be present.


He has private commitments on that day but he could attend if you
thought it was very important for a Cabinet Minister to be there.
He has been invited in Mr Patten's place, who is unable to go.


Content for me to stress to Mr Waddington's office that you think
it is important that the Government is represented at a senior
level, particulary as Mr Kinnock will be there?

                                     *

Dear Mr. Church,
R e: H illahnroiig-h S ta d iu m D is a s te r - A p ril 1 9 8 9

Thank you for your letter of 20th August concerning the above. I thought it m ight be
helpful to begin by explaining the role the Law Society takes in Co-ordinating large
m ulti-party actions, and then to deal, as far as I am able, w ith the specific points you
require regarding the Hillsborough Co-ordination.
The role which the Law Society takes in cases such as Hillsborough is now a
well-established service to solicitors and their clients engaged in m ulti-party actions
and disaster incidents. The first occurred in 1987 in the wake of the Zeebrugge Ferry
1 /lS E iS tG r •

In relation to Hillsborough, the service opened its helpline for enquiries both from
solicitors and members of the public shortly after the incident. At the same         1
was contacted by colleages at th e Liverpool Law Society who, as a result of their
proximity to the "disaster" set up a local service to deal w ith the m any anxious
enquirerss. Following our standard procedure we dealt w ith enquiries, kept a record
of solicitors instructed and at th e invitation of the Liverpool Law Society I attended
the meeting convened in May for instructed solicitors. At the meeting I acted largely
j S ®j r ? ne? broker" and facilitated the election of the co-ordinating committee as
decided by the meeting. W hilst the Law Society continued to received and deal with
enquiries from solicitors and members of the public, once th e co-ordination
committee was founded, any action taken by the committee becomes their
responsibility and further involvement of the Law Society is minimal
The details of the steering committee are attached as requested. All those listed are
practising solicitors and were already acting for people involved in the disaster at the
tim e of the meeting.


                                 v              Q        ^         g4> vmji/   MwvlvUj UU&AXV X OUgC vO v       Vy ^

approach the Chairman of the group, Mrs. Elizabeth Steel. Mrs. Steel’s details are
highlighted on the attached list.

Finally, regarding the status of co-ordinating committees there is nothing in law
which states th a t such a committee m ust be formed. The principle of co-ordination
however, has judicial approval and now forms p art of the Legal Aid Board’s new ’
procedure for the aw ard of contacts to solicitors to undertake legally aided work in
M ulti-party actions.
(The existance of a co-ordination committee does not interfere w ith the client- solicitor
relationship but simply acts as a vehicle for the exchange of information and pooling
of resources to ensure the individual solicitor is in a position to advise and assist his
client and to enable all the claims to be drawn together in one action.
If a client has reason to complain about a member of the co-ordination committee the
normal complaints procedure would apply. A leaflet from the Solicitors Complaints
Bureau explaining this is enclosed.
I hope this answers the points you raise and if I can be of any further assistance
please do not hesitate to contact me again.

Yours sincerely,

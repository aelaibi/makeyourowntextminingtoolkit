 L -U--     but I found my entry point ok and made my way in easily.

            I d i d n ’t see any other gates open or anytime at all,        I d i d n ’t see

            anyone    climbing   into the ground at all,
                                                       I handed my ticket in at the

            all   I just saw         tunnel.

            I went thpgfigh the tunnel easily and then at the other end went into

 k / R t    Pen 3-"fothe     right at the bottom, and it was very very packed with
&TArt£>
            people at that time I had to fight my way,            I find my viewing point.

            As I entered the tunnel         I d i d n ’t see any police or stewards, or at the

            other end when I came out in to the pens.

            From when I came through the turnstiles until            I got my match viewing

            point,    I d i d n ’t see any fighting disorder or drinking at all,        I first

            took up my match viewing point at position D3 as I have              indicated on

            the graph, after the surge of people            I ended up in position F6.

            Whilst in the pen,       I d i d n ’t see any crush barrier break,   nor I was not

            near any barrier breaking.

            was getting nervous,

            I was still     in the crowd when the surge        came on us, because too many

 CAT        people had been let through/it got worse and worse people were

            shouting and screaming fojr help and I saw a lot of people going down

              the outside and me and my mate                   ed through the hole and on to

              the pitch.

              I felt back pain at                 , once on the playing area we walked

              around for a while looking for               brother we found him ok then we

              went   into one of the empty pens we stood there for a while then we

              left on our accord but I d o n ’t know the time we left.

              I saw people going down they never got up again but I c o uldn’t say if

              they died or not,      I thought they would get up but they didn't I

              couldn't help anyone at all        I was too shocked and upset.

              All the deaths and injuries were caused because too many people had

              been let into the pens,        I d i d n ’t see any kind of criminal offences

              taking place.

              I saw fans who had climbed out/t)f the crush telling players that

              something bad was happening/and the police were putting them back in

              the crowd,   the police w ^ r e   dead slow to react to the crush had been

c o k n   & J T S i think it was terrible that all those police,      cordoned off the pitch



 < ffpc
              because they stood there for too long they should have helping the

              f a n s .I think there should hay^ been more police outside the ground

              organising the fans into queues it was chaos, following the crush

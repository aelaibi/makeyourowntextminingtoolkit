the     gro u n d

During          the       ten    minutes            or     so      that     we     had        been       part    of       the       crowd          I did

no t    think         that       the       crowd         increased           greatly               but    believe             that       the       vast

majority             were       already            there,,           The    time        between           us    leaving             the       entrance

to     the      ground          and      returning              from       Catchbar            Lane       was    only          2    to    3    minutes

at     the      most.

I    c a n ’t    remember             entering             the       ground        but        the       next    thing          1 do       know       is

that       I was          standing            along        the       pitch       edge         at    the    Spion          Hop       end       of    the

ground          just       to    the       left       of      the     goal.         I think              that    this          was       just       after

the     match         had       been       stopped            as     I don't        recall              seeing       any       of    the

               were        climbing             up       and       then         jumping             back       down        onto          the       pitch        but       I have

               found        since          that          this       was         n ot       the      case..           2 then          saw       t he       s t e w a r d s line

               view        was       blocked             by       tne    stewards.                   1 assumed             they          had       lined        up       pecause

               there        had       been          fighting..                  Everyone             just       seemed          to       be     standing              around

               with        no    idea          of    what          was      going          on.,       I have          no       recollection                    of     time

               from        this       point          on       as    soon         after          the       scene       became             chaotic,,

               The     next          thing          I knew          there         were          crowds          of    fans          on    the        pi.ten a n d          soms

were      dead          or     not,,          The       whole         scene          was    one       of     total          confusion                ana

chaos         with        fans         everywhere,                and       I    c a n ’t     remember              a n y t h i ng         about       these

thing         I    remember              is       being      in       the       yard       between           the     West          Stand         and       the

people            left       the       ground,,            Along        the          wall     to      the      left         of     the      concertina

gates         1 could             see     3       barriers            about          5ft    long        and       3ft       high          with       sheets

draped            over       them.            I    could         see    that          in    between            these            oarriers             bodies

had      been          piled        up    which           were        obviously             dead.            We     formed            a    cordon
                                                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                                                           SI 358

between        the     west       stand       and       the       wail       w h i ch        divided        the       yard       and       the

people        leaving          the    ground        through             the        tunnel          had     to    go    through             the       ga

in    the     wall     and      out    through           the       gates           on    the       other        side.          Most        of

the    fans        were     very      abusive           blaming             t he    police          for     the       deaths          calling

us    ’M u r d e r e r s *.       Some       of    them       who       said        their          friends        had       died       did       not

want     any       help,       they    continued              to       be    abusive.,              When        one    of      t he    female

specials           broke       down    crying           some       of       the     fans       aid       try     to    comfort             her,

but    in     the    main       the    atmosphere                 was       one     of       hate       towards        the       police.,

When     the       ground       had    emptied           we       went       out        into       Leppings           Lane       and       saw

fire     engines          and     ambulances             everywhere.                     Most       of     the    bodies          had       been

removed        by    ambulance           by       this    time,,

Soon     after       this       we    were        given       a    briefing              in    the       North        Stand       but       i

cannot        remember          a word        that       was       said,           1 had       no       more     involvement                after

the    briefing           and     left       the    ground             at    6,30pm           to    6.45pm        to      go     name„

I would        1 ike      to    add    that        since          starts, ng            to    work       football           matches             i.

have     never       seen       such     a    large       crowd             of     people          as    there        was      outside           t ne

ground        at    the     Leppings          Lane       end       of       the     ground,,             N o r m a l ly     there          wouia

be    orderly        queues          there        ana    there          would           be    no    difficulty              in    gaining

entry,,        Also       I saw       more        police          on    duty        before          this        match       than       I    nave

seen     in    any     previous          match.           Usually                the     briefing           would         take        place

either        inside        the      gymnasium           or       in    the        yard       outside           but    this       time

because        of    th e      number        of    officers             it       was     held       in     the    North          Stand.

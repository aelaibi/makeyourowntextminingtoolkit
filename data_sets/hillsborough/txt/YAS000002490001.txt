Sir


The     Doctor's          criticism           on    T.V.     of    the    Police      action    was       totally
unjustified.


They     worked          like    trojans in trying to rescue                      the injured and dead
and     in    many       cases        gave    mouth     to    mouth       resuscitation.            The police
did     the       only    thing        possible       at     the   time;      pulling the injured and
hurt     over       the       fencing trying to relieve the pressure as best they
could,       as    events       later        came to light this was the only way because
the     back       entrance       was        blocked       with    injured       people   who       had    fallen
on their way into the ground.


The Doctor stated that no one seemed to take charge of the situation.
I believe this to be untrue (at the rear of the stadium major incident
plans        had    been        put    into        operation).           At   first    all     seemed      to    be
utter    chaos and confusion out of which order was restored by small
degrees at a time.                    This may not have been apparent to the untrained
eye.


He further          complains          of no        'De-fib1 being available in the ground.
Question:          If     one    had     been        available,          where    would      they    keep       it,
and who would be able to use it ?

I     suggest     he      was    talking      without       forethought       and   in   the    heat    of
the moment.


He    was   not      in    his       hospital    environment asking for equipment which
would normally be put into this hand by near-by trained staff.


At the casualty clearing point there was an over abundance of Senior
Ambulance       Staff       equipped         with    vital    radios    yet    a    serious     lack    of
liaison     with       ambulance         crews      seemed    evident,       the    crews   seemed      to
be left to their own devices as to priority cases.


Mistakes     were made by all including                      the F.A.       but for the emergency
services        to   have       to    deal    with    the    amount    of     casualties       they    did
in so short a time was in my opinion, exceptional.


The Trent Region can be proud.

the     motorway,           Ml,       heading           for    Sheffield,              I di d      see       a    large

congregation               of     p ol i c e ,     traffic:         police        I thi nk,         at       the m o t o r w a y            exit

who     I. a s s u m e d    were        directing             traffic.            I d i d n ’t see               them       stopping             any

traffic.             On    the     way      into        Sheffield           town    centre          there             were    traffic

Als o,       I noticed           that       a     lot    of    the       public     houses         were           boarded          up at

this     time.

We a r r i v e d      in the         vicinity            of    the       g r o u n d at   about                                             ) and

parked        the     cars        in 13a 1 m e n        Rd,    Sheffield.               Guy     had a r r a n g e d           to m e e t         a

few     lads       in a n e a r b y         public         house,         Th e    B&                             so    he    knew

exactly         where       to     go as          he    had    been       there     the       year       before.              At       the

ti me    of     parking           the     cars         I did     not      see     any     police         direction                of

traffic:        or    faotJrall          fans          in t ha t     area.         All    ten       of       us       then went             to

T-he B e e h i p e y ^nd          congregated              together          and    we    all       had a d r i n k .                  I know

that     five        rounds        of    drinks          were       bought        but     I personally                  had       two       p i nts

of    l a ger      and a        pint     of       shandy and             missed     out       on    the          others.

W h e n we      f i r st    got       i'nto the          pub     there       were       already          a       lot    of    football

fans     in therfe,             ■al t h o u g h    it w a s n ’t full .             The       number             of    people

steadily           increased            until          I would       say     the    pub w a s        full.              The

atmosphere            in the          pub w a s         very     good,       everyone           anticipating                  a    repeat

of    the     previous           year's           win,     s i ng i ng a n d a          general          f e e 1 ing         of

get     jostled             and    pushed and                 became         part     of    the         la rge         crowd.              By     t hi s

control           the       horse          as    the       c r o w d was       all    around            him       but       I felt          he was

doing        more       harm       than          good and             people      were      having               to    push          themselves

away     from          the    horse             to a v o i d       gening         trampled,                  I believe                it was

waving        to       p eop l e       to       come       in his        direction.

rig ht       near       to    the          edge       of    the w a 1 1,          I remember                 a    lot       of       the    people

in the        crowd were                   shouting           to      the    policeman             on    horseback                   but     I c a n ’t

really        remember             what          they       were       saying.

After        h a lf      a minute             or    so,      all       of    us    got       together             and    organised

front        of      us.        It     seemed           as     through            there         was     jw     r o o m at      all     in f r o n t         of

us     but      there       was       a sudden               crowd          su                  n d us and,            in a m a t t e r         of

seconds,             I was       part         of     the       crowd and               I wa *       split       up     from      the      rest       of

the     lads.           I had         no      control             whatsoever               of     where        I was      going        but      I do

know      that        I had          go ne      i n t o \ p e n ^ Immediately,                               I started          to     get      crushed

my arms           were      down        by m y          sides          and       I couldn't             move      them.         The       air       was

being        squeezed            out       of      me     and,         at    tim es,         I had        great        difficulty              in

breathing.                 At    times          my      feet       were          off    the       ground and             I was       being

carried           along         with       the       crowd.             Most       of      the      other       t im e    I was        forced          to

walk      on      t ipt oe.           I j us t          felt       as       though         there        were      constant           surges

be h in d m e w h i c h c a u s e d                  me      to    be carried                in a       zig-zag          mot io n down              the

terrace.             People             in the            crowd were screaming                           and shouting               for     help and

1 noticed most                   of     the        screams             u^re       directed            at     a policeman who                was

standing             the    other          s id e       of/the          fence          in f r o n t       of    us.       I then          noticed           it

I first           saw      the       g at e     it w a s          closed.              The      policeman             turned        away       from       the

g ate     for        a moment           and        then        looked            back      at     the     gate.          I had       h een yC x\

the     crush         for       about         ten minutes                   when       I s aw      the       g at e    o|ening

At     t hi s     time      I w as         in f r o n t           of    the       g at e     but      there       were       a/fot        of

people          b e t w e e n me        and        the       gate.           I was         in     pos i t i o Kj-S-'ma r k e d on               the

grid      shown         to me.             I soon            found          myself         right        in     front      of    the       gate

and     I remember               a    policeman                pulling            me    t h r o u g h the                       It a p p e a r e d

out.         The      people            to      either            s id e     of the        g a te     were unable              to m o v e      and

When     I was        in the          pen       I d i d n ’t see             anyone         fall     o ver      nor      did      I see

anyone         that       appeared          to       be    unconscious.                   People         in the        crowd were

obviously            being       crushed.

When     I was        pulled              out    through             the     gate         I was     very dazed              and

breathless            and       I went          and       sat    on a n a d v e r t i s e m e n t              hoarding           just     to

the    rig h t       of    the       gate.           I turned             round and          faced        the    terrace           and     saw

the    faces         of    people          crushed          up a g a i n s t          the    fencing.            These         people

were     not     moving,             their       eyes       were          stil l,      some        open,       s ome     c lo sed ,      and      I

thought         that       if    this       carried             on    they       would       die.         1 saw more              people

being       pulled         out       through          the       s a me     g a te     I had        come    through.               This     was

a slow         process          and       people          were       coming         out     in o n e s     and      twos.          I think

I was       amongst         the       first          twenty          or    so    that       w as    pulled       out.

By    t his     time       there          were       thres       or       possibly          f our    p o l i c e m e n at         the    gaj^e

where       I had         come       through.              Soon       there         were     quite        a few        people          around

me    who      all    seemed          dazed and             confused.                 Some    were        lyi n g      on    the       pitch,

some     were        sitting          down,          some       j ust      walking          around,        not      knowing            what      to

do.

After       just      half       a        minute          or    so      of   sitting          down,       a policeman              took        hold

of me a n d          started              to w a l k       me      along        the       pitch     e dg e t o w a r d s       pen      o n e.    I

c a n ’t r e m e m b e r        anything             about       the       footballers              at    this      time.

He    led me         to    the       gate       at    pen       one       and    I remember              his    hand        on m y      back

as    I walked            into       the    pen       through             the    gate.         1 was       sti ll        very      dazed

a n d w a s n ’t r e a l l y          sure       what       wa s      going         on.

Straight         away       I saw Ron                KING       in the          pen a n d      we    got       together           a n d we

were     soon        joined          by                               and                                 We    then w a l k e d         up

the    terrace            and    stood          by    the       Police          Control        Box.        The      whole         of    this

particular            section             was    virtually                empty.          From      the    position            I watched

as    the      tragedy          unfolded,             people          were       being       pulled        out      of      pens       3 and

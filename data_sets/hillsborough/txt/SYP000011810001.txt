Besr Sir,
            Re; Hillsborough - 15th April 1

Thank you for -jour letter of 26th May*•.
For your information I have had correspondence ■
with Hr. 1 »11.Wislleyt .Secretary to the Saauiry*
in ny latest letter to Mis, I stated that I fead
completed a detailed report setting eat nineteen
Betters, under the headings     ,__
                               h- *      ___

Controller and Coainunicatians.
She report contains a few factual inciderts, at sll
of which 1 was present as a terrace supporter, any
of which but for the Srfce of God, could hare turned
into yet another'tragedy.         ■    ' •
the report will also show in detail, sasj
procedures few ©f which are in existence at present*
ner were they in action at Hillsborough-
I new intend to spend a week: revising and
the report*
As soon as this work is finished,, I will ksir© the
report typed in a proper manner*
I propose sending a copy to Mr* WhaHey.
X would be pleased to sent yon a copy if you
thought it worthwhile.

lours faithfully,

Vij Lord,
        to* leadry, ; *r*, xe^la^r to • letter X seat-
him, stated that he thought X should write t© you,.,
although he will attend j m r Enquiry «ad raise some
matters X mentioned in my letter.
X am partly to blase for this tragedy, although.1 was Hot- ■
st Millst>©r©iigk*.
I have watched football *l*«?ys as a terrace supporter .for
sixty yeara.
I: hare seem more thaa 2000 Batches.*
Qm three specific occasions in the laeb •ive years, 1
have had narrow escapes fr<m'injury or death*
Tou will hear the evidence ©f msaj experts, and you will
eventually establish the cause of this disaster.
But will you listen to the evidence of a terrace expert
e» law t© avoid the mast misery which will'fcjsppe*. I
Emu many ©f the other expect »»*il be e'ol- tc ascribe to
you 'in detail, their owm personal survival r»_*ns -hey
prepare ©sell, time they attend a big match ?      ■•
How many of them study the feaees and weigh, up the chances
of climbing up them, ®x* at grounds with c-rl:/ £ ** o-'-rier
deliberately stead next to a sti:?*'.. rco1^ mam-and. hope
that if ne c esssJi jy will he helped .up «m€ m e r the •
terrier ©a to the        of the pitch#
I. read in a newspaper that you intend to visit a match
.as a terrace supporter to obtain some personal knowledge*
If this is yomr intention, By lord, I plead with, y©m to
allow me to tell you which match t© watch* letter still,
permit :               cost, tom stand together*■with yum
lima show yam the dangers th«t exist* and what 'should
be d©me t© avail witr.               '■      ■
Whet a pity it would be if you attended on.ordinary game
as I have in.. at least <£>% of the 2000. matches I. here sees
where you would leara nothing of what could and sometime*
does' lichen tr the other 5# ©£ the g8mes.'
I seid I wss partly to blame* I am feeeaws© eacfc time I and
the- youngsters escsfed wit'beat injury, T did nothing to
prevent such things happening again, I did nothings;
a© letters me pretests a© meetings mo nothing* ■
Although 11 days have gone by, my heart aad souls still
mourn, i?lee«e% wy-Lord, help me to find .peace, of mind
again*

             Introduction.

X have M e n watching football fsr sixty years*
1 have seen more then 2500 aatehesjslways except for
» handful of gsaes, as ® terrace supporter*
^h® Inquiry will produce aiany competent expert witnesses •
in their own particular field*
I feel* fro® ell the matches I have watched, mmd fro*
@11 the incidents that I have been personally involved
in* that I at qualified to speak aa an expert terrace
supporter*
I know only too well, primarily because ay own safety
was involved, how few real safety procedures there,
were and still are*
X know only too well what should have been don# and
whet was not done*
I coulsfr fill many page® describing events that have
occurred while I was present* all of which had one
thing in common* neaely the absence of efficient
crowd control and command*
Mho is there to blame for what has happened ?
In ay view* we are al^uilty*
fhe I*A* the Leaguet the Clubs* the Police* the supporters
everyone connected with football crowds could have
and should h®ve done sore*
The report that follows, tries to show what should be
done now to prevent another tragedy in the future*

llaxt step forward must bo the immediate removal of wtot I
call vertical barriers*
!2hese are the steel fences which run downwards from the
top to the hottest of the terraces*
the only way to pass through them is by means of mm oar
two narrow gateways about 2* ia width*
X presume they were originally put up to prevent rival fens
on the seme terrace fighting with each other*
I do not presume* but I know what it was Hike et one m®$ch
at Tottenham last season#
A surge deTeloped during the natchi I was pushed forward until
I wee pressed against the steel fence surrounding the pitch#
What made it so bad was the fact that the front of oybody
was up against the pitch fence f and the right side of toy
body was pressed against the vertical fence*
Where there is space there is the chance of life*
Although the initial surge is always forw.rd and downwards*
the instintive response if you cannot go forward any more
is at least to try and push sideways to escape the pressure*
I cannot recall how many tiaes at Upton Park* I h©ve been
abfi to move away from the most crowded part of the terras#
(usually behind the goal) to the comparative comfort ox
the open spaces at each side*
Bat what action can you take when you are segregated and
locked in to one of these cages with fences in front and at
each side of you with no entrance or exit unless allowed.
by the police standing by these narrow gates*
fhese fences aust come down* The only alternative % can think
of to prevent sags fighting amonst rival fans* is to give the
whole of one terrace to tbe away supporters who can then
spread themselves out for their comfort and their safety*
I know this would cause problems to the home elubf but what
problems compare to the risk of tragedy*
Ibis concludes a brief summary of what could be dime now
to save life before the next surge happens*
Hothing would give ae more comfort that to attend the Inquiry
and go into so much more detail the points I have mentioned*
I will never be able to forget that If only I     tried^ _
years ago to do what I am now doing, it mlg^t have resulted
in at least one life being saved*

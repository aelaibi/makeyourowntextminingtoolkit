HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

Thank you for your letter of 16 August. The reference in the
Home Office press release is to the Football Licensing Authority
to be set up under the Football Spectators Bill. You will see
        clause 13 -of .the latest print of the Bill, that is to say
the Bill as amended in Standing Committee A and printed on 27
July, it is    proposedthat the Licensing Authority should have     the
function of    keeping under review the discharge by local
authorities of their functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds
i 4-i975 ln    relationto sports grounds at which designated
football matches are played. For ease of reference I enclose a
photocopy of the new clause.

The new clause provides an opportunity for the Government to
introduce a means of supervising the safety responsibilities of
local authorities if it is considered necessary when we have seen
the final report. The only reference which is made to the
possible need for supervision in the interim report is at
paragraph 314.

Dear Mr Bilbe

Re: ARSENAL V CHARLTON ATHLETIC
    SATURDAY 23RD SEPTEMBER 1989

Thank you for your recent letter and I am sorry to hear of the problems that
occurred at our above match.

Arsenal Football Club cannot operate without a current Safety Certificate which
is issued by the London Borough of Islington. This certificate is issued on
the condition that all of the recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor's
Interim Hillsborough Report appertaining to crowd safety are complied with.
We are at present undertaking a comprehensive building programme to comply
with these recommendations and to enable a more flexible approach to the number
of away supporters admitted. However, due to the need for planning permission
etc., these changes cannot be accomplished for several more months and therefore
to comply with the necessary recommendations we, after consultation with the
police, have to decide prior to a match whether to give away supporters 1,580
places in the South West corner or the entire South terrace which holds in
excess of 10,000 spectators. The information gathered for the above match
indicated up to 2,000 away fans attending and as estimates are invariably high,
the appropriate decision was made. We would not allocate the entire South
terrace to the away supporters unless we were expecting in excess of 5,000
as the effect of doing this would result in locking out home supporters when
there is still ample room within the Stadium. The decision was therefore made
to allocate Charlton F.C. the South West comer of the terrace accommodating
1,580 supporters.

On the day of the match when the capacity of that area reached 1,580                 the police
could well have turned Charlton supporters away, however, the result                 of this
would have been disappointed fans who had travelled to the match and                 the real
possibility of them gaining access to home supporters areas with the                 possibility
of potential crowd disorder.

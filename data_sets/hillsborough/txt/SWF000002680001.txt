    I,   RICHARD WILLIAM BEADSLEY of
                      WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS


    I was born on the 6th November 1959.             I am presently employed
    as                                                           I am a
              by       trade                                                  and




    I have been a steward or gatemen for Sheffield Wednesday
    Football Club for the last 9 seasons. For the first 6 seasons
    I was a steward and was almost always positioned at the bottom
    of the steps leading to the seated area. There are two sets of
    steps leading up to the seated area, but I was positioned at
    the right hand steps which are nearest to C gate.           For the last
    3 seasons I have been a gateman for C gate.


    It has been the practice in recent years for the stewards and
    gatemen to be given a briefing at the annual meeting shortly
    before the start of each season. Representatives from the
    Police    and Fire Brigade attend the meeting to provide guidance
    on the evacuation procedures. At the start of the season I am
    also provided with a document known as "match day instructions
    for staff" which I have read.

    As part of my duties as a gateman, I am fully aware that there
    must be at least one gateman available to man a gate.      The
    normal     proceedure       is   for three gatemen to C gate    to   be    in
    position       2    hours   before   a league match, and   to   remain     in
    position until kick off.     The other two gatemen for this
    season have been Malcolm Bain and Ian Marsh. We have worked
    out a router whereby once kick off has started, two gatemen go
    off to watch the game and one remains on the gate.        That
    gateman     by the gate is then relieved after 15 minutes and             the
                                       - 2 -


process is repeated.   Shortly before half time all three
gatemen are back in position and once play has been resumed
the process is repeated again. About 10 minutes before the
final whistle, the gateman at that time opens the gate. All
three gatemen then go off to hand back their jackets and to
collect     their       pay.     This basic routine is repeated     for    all
first     team    matches including FA Cup matches and FA          Cup     semi
finals.

I now turn to my involvement in the events which took place on
the 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough. I arrived at the ground
at about 11.20 to 11.30 am. I signed in and took my steward's
jacket and went to C gate. I was the first gatemen there.
Shortly afterwards Ian Marsh and Malcolm Bain arrived.   From
about 11.30 am to 1.00 pm the gate was left open about 18
inches. The gate should not be open but it is easier for the
gatemen to leave the gate open to this extent to allow Police
and other club officials in and out. It saves us having to
continually open and shut the gate. The gate can be opened to
this extent and locked into position.


I should mention that the gates are always unlocked when                     we
arrive  to take up our posts. The gate can be opened by                       a
simple     lever and it is not possible to open the gate from               the
outside.

From     about     1.00    pm we had a Liverpool steward    with     us.      I
cannot remember his name.


We knew all the senior Police Officers at least by sight who
were present at or near C gate. However, many of the other
Police Officers appeared to be new faces. It is normal for any
league match to have 8 - 10 Police Officers behind the
turnstiles        and     near   C gate.   About the same number    were     in
position,        and    as fans came through the turnstiles        they    were
searched.
                                - 3 -


We also allowed 8 or 9 Liverpool stewards through C gate.        They
all had passes from Liverpool Football Club and were             also
wearing   steward's jackets. They proceeded to mingle with the
crowd and were helping to deal with any problems or to help
direct fans to the relevant area.

Outside the gate, there was a Police barrier.      This was a
simple rail blocking the pathway leading to the South stand.
The barrier was put in position at 90 degrees to the end of the
gate nearest to the South stand. At last years semi final
involving the same teams,        the barrier was placed at the
opposite end of the gate.        There were four or five Police
Officers around the barrier.

There were no problems until about 2.10 pm. The gate was still
open about 18 inches. A Liverpool supporter wanted to pay to
get in. He did not have a ticket. The Liverpool steward told
me   that    he would not be granted entry and he went   away.      We
then closed the gate.


About this time, I saw Liverpool supporters coming through the
turnstiles and throwing the counterfoil of their tickets over
the turnstiles so other supporters could use them to attempt
entry.


At   about    2.45 or 2.50 pm a number of supporters     started    to
climb over the turnstiles.     The first six or seven were ejected
through our gate by the Police Officers.      However, shortly
later the Police started to help fans down from the turnstiles.
I remember seeing one supporter with a broken arm.

The gatemen were told to open the gate at about this time.         The
order    was given by a senior Police Officer, an Inspector, whom
I know by sight but his name I do not know. He has a beard.
The gate was opened about 5 feet. The supporters who were
outside were allowed through the gate which remained open for
about   1 to 1% minutes. There were six or seven Police
                                    - 4 -


Officers outside directing the supporters through the gate.
The gatemen were then told to shut the gate by the same Police
Inspector.

1 cannot remember whether I was responsible for opening or
closing the gate at this time. The Police Inspector was about
2 to 3 yards from the gate. I believe that about 300-400
supporters got through at this time.

Within     a    minute   or so we were told once again       to   open    the
gate. I heard the same voice from behind from the Police
Inspector to open the gate. I cannot remember whether the
request or order was repeated. I have seen the photographs of
Superintendant Marshall since the 15th April and I do not
remember seeing him in the area behind the turnstiles. He may
well have been outside C gate.


As   the       order was given, I heard someone shout that        we     would
have blood on our hands or words to that effect if the gate was
opened.   Many Liverpool supporters were milling about behind
the turnstiles and some had said to us that if we did not open
the gate a riot would start outside, whereas others said if the
gate was opened there would be trouble or bloodshed inside.


At     this time I had no idea of the numbers outside but I              could
hear     banging     against   the gate.    The supporters    inside      were
shouting and swearing at us.

I do not remember whether I was responsible for opening the
gate, but it was pulled back and I then helped to pull the
gate fully back.      We stepped to one side as the Liverpool
supporters went past.


There    was no discussion with the Police over whether the               gate
should be opened. My job is to man the gate in the event of an
emergency and to open the gate before the final whistle is
blown.   If the Police direct me to do something, I do it.   I




                                                                                 f
would    not        open    the gate unless told to do so by             either    the
Police or the Chief Steward.

The supporters             that came through headed for the tunnel, there
were about 200             - 300 supporters behind the turnstiles and they
became caught              up in the people coming through C gate.     The
first reaction              of the gatemen was to have a laugh and joke
over the chaos             before our eyes. The gate remained open for 2
to 3 minutes and certainly not more than 5 minutes. An order
was given to shut the gate but I cannot remember the Police
Officer who gave this order. We kept the gate open about 18
inches. By that stage there was nobody outside C gate.      The
supporters were still being allowed through the turnstiles.


At     last       years     semi     final   there   was    no   great    influx     of
supporters.           Only     Police Officers had been allowed through              C
gate.         I    remember        at 3.55 pm at last years semi         final     that
there    were no people outside. I also seem to remember that
there    were a lot more Police Officers behind the turnstiles at
last years semi final.


I am almost certain that the Police at last years semi final
did close the doors to the tunnel or stood outside the tunnel
leading        to the central pen.           I have seen this done many           times
before        by    the Police, once they realise the central pens                  are
full.

I should mention that the Police outside C gate told me that
the kick off had been postponed until 3.15 pm. This occurred
at     about        2.50 pm or thereabouts.          In fact, I did not        realise
that the game was underway at 3.00 pm.                     I remember hearing over
the     Police radio that there was a pitch invasion.                    The     Police
Officers           behind the turnstiles made off towards the South West
pen.

Shortly afterwards, a Liverpool supporter came up and said that
he wanted to get his money back.                 He said there was going to be
                                - 6 -


no   football   played at Hillsborough today, and that there    was
likely to be     another Heysel. I took him over to the  main
offices but when I got back to C gate I noticed people being
brought out through the tunnel who were injured. I went to
the tunnel. The ambulancemen and firemen present told me that
there was nothing I could do.


I    took drinks from the snack bar underneath the West stand    to,
people in the    area between the rear of the stand and    the
turnstiles.   After that, I went on to the pitch and I was
amazed at what I saw. For about half an hour I walked about in
a daze. I went home at about 4.50 pm.

This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

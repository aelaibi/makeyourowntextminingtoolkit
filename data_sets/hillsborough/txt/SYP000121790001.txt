                          At 1pm Saterday 17th August 1991 I attended at Sheffield Wednesday

        football ground where I took a series of photographs to show views from the

        police control box of the west, north and kop ends of the ground.

                         The photographs were taken using a 35om camera and a zoom lens

        set at the 50mm focal length setting*

                         Photographs 1-12 were taken frominside the box and numbers 13-15

        were taken from the landing area outside of the box.

                         I have produced indexed albums of enlargements of these photographs

        which I identify by a label which I have signed. The negatives relating thereto

        being in my possession.

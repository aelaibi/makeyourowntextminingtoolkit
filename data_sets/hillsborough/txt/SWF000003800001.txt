CURRICULUM VITAE of N J Burne
            SUMMARY



    ^       Overall spectator capacity too high


            There was a lack of correct measurement of spaces in the

            northwest and west terraces leading to a sensible

            evaluation of the numbers who could be safely

            accommodated.



                  The maximum number who should have been allowed on

                  the 5.4/mz gross basis was about 8763 not lO, lO0

                  which was the designated capacity and which was

                  unlikely to have been exceeded on 15th April 1989.


            2     This figure should have been radically reduced to


                  a    give safe access and egress facility


                  b    ensure likely loading on barriers was safe.



    B       No subdivision of capacity or management of flows


                  Armed with maxima for each sub area a system of


                  a    directing by signs

             b      measuring by counting


             c     controlling by closing off from further

                    inward movement


             could have prevented overcrowding.


        2    Similarly outward emergency or exit flows could

             have been managed by
0
             a     safe routes


             b     signs


             c      facility for emergency operation.



    C   Inadequate crush barriers



             Barriers were in inappropriate positions such that


        2    there was no gangway


        3    gaps were too wide, too narrow or In an

              inappropriate place.


             Some barriers appropriate to physically control

             crowd flow were absent.



                              2
5   Cross hatch paintlng on the ground was the only

    form of sign.


6   Barriers were too low and were ineffectual to

    prevent crowd loading flowing over.


    Some barriers including 124a were of a design which

    was theoretically inadequate. They were 59 years

    old, corroded and had been frequently repaired.

    Deflection under design load was in excess of

    British Standards.


    In 1990, of 7 barriers similar to 124a tested by

    the same rlg:


          123 and 141 (previously repaired) failed by

          fracturing of centre support at or below 6

          kN/m


          128a, 131 and 142 failed by lack of recovery

          of deflection at this loading


          140 and 134 passed doubtfully


    Barrier 124a was tested in 1983 and 19BB and should

    have been falled or at least retested. It was



                    3
              against normal practice to take each of the 3 tests

              as a separate measurement by rezerolng the

              measuring device. There are no worklng or fleld

              notes available of the incremental measurements

              which ought to have been recorded and plotted to

              guide analysis and judgment.


        10    This type of barrier under uniform load over 2

0             continuous spans initially attracts load to the

              central support, Rail failure in theory occurs

              under the centre support clip at a similar load to

              that at which the support yields in theory at the

              lower rivet hole on the rear leg.


              124a support 3 actually felled on 15th April 1989

              at this second rivet hole on the rear leg and was

              bent to the ground. The rail twisted support 4 and

              pulled out of it.


        11    In my view the 1988 Certificate should not have

              been issued without Conditions.


    D   Conclusion


        There are too many variables in any analysis of the

        causes of the disaster to allow specific attribution of


                                  4
causative defects. Lack of barrier height meant

spectators would find difficulty in resisting pressure

from behind. The absence of barriers in a line from the

tunnel or to the rear of 124a must have contributed

significantly to the pressure on and over barrier 124a.


It is my belief that:


     The failure of barrier 124a contributed enormously

     to the pressure on those spectators in front of it.


2    Such pressure must have seriously affected all

     spectators between barrier 124a and the perimeter

     fence.


3     It is a reasonable deduction that the large

     concentration of fatalltles between barrier 124a

     and the perimeter fence was directly related to the

     failure of that barrier.


4    The overcrowding identified should not have caused

     failure of the barrier. The balance of probability

     is that the real number of occupants was nearer to

     the 1200 arbitrarily ascribed on E & P drawing 64E
     rather than the 31.3% excess of the preferred

    5   Testing of the barriers should have Identified any

        lack of ability to resist 6 kN/m horizontal force

                                                                    .t,\

        under e load of about 5.25 kN/m sustoi -.oXong-.the


0       rail length. This loading was the result not only

        of the numbers in the pen but the height,

        positioning or absence of other barriers

        particularly (144), 136A end 136. This loading yes

        thereby higher then the expected design loading.


    7   In my view the overcrowding would not have occurred

        if appropriate numbers had been ascribed by the

        Engineer for each separate entity within the

        terrace identified by physical separation, namely

        each pen. They should have been self contained end

        provided with a counting management system. If

        such a system could not be achieved then overload

        provisions by means of additional radial fence

        gates should have been Installed at the front of

        each pen. Separate pen capacities vere essential.




                         6
Other factors which contributed and which should

have been properly engineered were:


a     the lack of signs to the NW terrace and pens

      6 and 7 for more than half the standing

      capacity


      the Inadequate sign to the SW pens 1 - 2 for

      more than a quarter of the standing capacity


c     the complete lack of signing or Indication of

      the presence of the relief valve gates at the

      rear of the radial fences


      the steepness of the ramp against the

      direction of escape which encouraged the

      forward movement of entering fans


e     the inadequacy of the pitch perimeter gates

      in terms of width, difficulty of access, lack

      of signing or capability of opening from

      inside in an emergency

1.0   INSTRUCTIONS


I.I   Instructions were received from Hammond Sudderds on 20th

      July 1989 for Elrond Engineering to act in the matter

      concerning the disaster at Hillsborough on 15th April

      1989. The appointment is in respect of the South

      Yorkshire Police Authority.


1.2   Site visits were made, tests witnessed and documents

      examined which have led to the selection of those

      elements particularly germane to the Issues. These ere

      reported in e separate Volume II of appendices to this

      report. Extracts from British Standards, Statutes,

      other reports, photographs end analyses have been

      included end referred to in this volume.


1.3   Some of the information from Standards end Statutes is

      referred to or alluded to in the Home Office/Scottish

      Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds published by Her

      Majestyâs Stationery Office In October of 1986. This is

      referred to as the âGreen Guideâ end has been used as the

      main vehicle on which to report technical issues to the

      Court. Appendix volume II information is therefore

      cross referenced to that chapter in this volume. To

i.4   Details of the author of this report appear as Appendix

      S.


i.5   Considerable footage of video film has been studied.

      Building Regulations, Legislation, British Standards, the

      Inquiry Reports of the Rt.Hon Lord Justice Taylor and

      Appraisal of Existing Structures by the Institution of

      Structural Engineers have been addressed. Tests have

      been witnessed. A demonstration of the test rig of

      Eastwood and Partners has been monitored. Much of the

      detail of these investigations appears as Appendices in

      the separate volumes of this Report.

          Safety at Sportsgrounds which pays due deference to the

          Building Regulations and has been in existence since 1976

          before being revised in 1986.

    First published in May 1976 the October 1986 version was

    introduced as a result of the Bradford City Fire in 1985 and

    hence Mr Justice Popplevellâs Inquiry. It is analysed below in

    Comment This paragraph is the cornerstone of any analysis.

    See GG Chapter 16 and clauses 222 - 225.


    16 Crowd pressures on terraces and In exit routes need

    restraining to ensure free movement.


    17 Emergency situations present a very serious problem.


    21 Obvious defects should be rectified by suitably qualified

0   persons. Signposts for exits require particular attention.


    Comment See clause 57.



    CHAPTER 2 Management Responsibility


    24 Management responsibility is to impose and enforce restriction

    on crowd numbers.


    29
    (x i v)
          To ensure gangways and exit routes are unobstructed.

                any debriefing about crowd control.


    (xviii) Keep records of attendance figures and Inspections and

            tests.


    CHAPTER 3 General Fabric and Structural Natters


    To meet safety requirements all barriers should have the

0   strength and durability to perform safely their required

    function.


    CHAPTER 4 Inspections and Tests



    36 Detailed inspection required by a person with recognised

    professional qualification and experience of Inspecting

    existing structures.


    37 Appraisal of Existing Structures published by the Institution


0   of Structural Engineers 1980 is validated. Appendix N.


    38 Testing of crush barriers should be in accordance with

    Annexe C (see later). Barriers should be tested every 4 years,

    unless from visual inspectlon doubts are raised as to thelr

    strength or integrity, In which case they should be re-tested.

    Testing should be carried out by or under the supervision of a



                                 17
    suitably qualified Structural or Civil Engineer.


    39 Following each event a general visual inspection of

    the ground should be made for signs of damage. Crush barriers

    should be examined for deformation or any other overt signs of

    weakness.

    CHAPTER 5 AND 6 Ingress and Egress


    Spectators should be admitted at a rate which is compatible

    with the dispersal arrangements for them inside the ground.


    44 Turnstiles should be of such numbers as to admit spectators

    at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are kept waiting and

    yet no faster rate than the arrangements for distributing

    spectators within the ground permit.

Q   46 Contingency plans may include opening additional entrances.


    47 The notional rate at which spectators can pass through

    turnstiles is unlikely to exceed a maximum of 750 persons per

    hour.


    Comment Turnstile rates of 750 persons per hour as a maximum


                                 18
    would mean that the 7 turnstiles available for those attending

    the west terrace could.only pass I0,100 people in 2 hours,


    48 The preamble to this paragraph indicates ?here should be

    smooth and unimpeded passage through an exit route.


    53   Care should be taken in the planning of exit systems to

    ensure that in the event of an emergency which blocks the

0   usual exit route, spectators will be able to use an alternative

    exit route.


    54 There should be no funnelling.


    A packing density of 54 persons per I0 square metres

    of the area available for standing is the maximum for safety.

    Arrangements should be such as to prevent this being exceeded.


    Comment As a result of anthropometrlc measurements it is

    actually possible to calculate a physical maximum achievable
Q   density of 125/lOm2 for men and 167/I0m2 for women and smaller

    men. That is not a situation which could be regarded as

    acceptable or comfortable. HSE measurement suggest lO0/m2 is a

    plausible maximum. Appendix H Summary page 2.


    Evaluations have been made of the actual number of occupants by

    means of comparing and counting heads as a result of a specific

    enlargement of the photograph appearing in Appendix 5 of Lord

    Justice Taylorâs Interim Report. This was taken at 2.59 as

    recorded on the digital clock which was I minute slow.

    Appendix C shows an overlay of the identified heads. The

    number of visible heads or areas of hidden heads extrapolated,

    Indicates the following figures

0   This compares with HSE evaluations, Appendix H, of 678 in pen 3

    at 14.52 (3.7/m2) and 1408 (7.7/m2) at 15.03. This indicates

    that the HSE preferred figure of 1576 based on a density of

    8.4/m2 may be too generous.


    56 Egress time. Exits from each area should be so

    designed that all spectators can leave that area and if



                                   2O
    desired, pass into a free flowing exit route system in 8

    minutes or less.


    Thls tlme is not the same as emergency evacuatlon

    tlme.


    57 A comprehensive system of signposting which clearly

    indicates routes to the various.parts of the ground, and to the

    exits from the ground, should be provided. Signs relating to
0   fire safety to be in accordance with BS 5499 part I 1984

    Appendix P. Safety signs, for example, first aid facilities to

    be in accordance with BS 5378 part 1 1980.


    BS 5588 cl I0 and BS 6034 Appendix P.


    Exit gates should be clearly signposted in accordance with BS

    2560 Appendix P or BS 4218. Directional signs should be

    provided.

    Comment Directional signs were virtually non existent. It

0   would appear that only the tickets indicated the designetory

    letter of the turnstiles through which the spectator should

    pass. Photograph ! Appendix B



    Once they had passed through the 7 turnstlles A - G, there was

    no Indication of any kind In the concourse as to their



                                 21
    destination other than


          a single 8vv high sign over the entrance to the tunnel

          labelled âSTANDINGâ, and Photographs 3, 4, and 5 Appendix

          a 2~" high lettering sign indicating âSTANDINGâ at the

          Southwest corner for more than 25~ of the anticipated

          numbers who would use this route. Photographs 8, 9, and
0         !0 Appendix B



    There was no indication of any kind that the occupants of pens

    6 and 7 and the Northwest corner and the Northwest terrace a

    total of more than 50~ were to pass through a gap in the radial

    wall to the North. Photograph 3 Appendix B. There was no

    counting or control of these 3 separate flows.


    There were no exit signs of any description.


Q   59 The minimum width for any section of an exit route should be

    l.lm. BS 5588 Part 3 Table 3. Appendix P


    63 All doors on an exit route should be secured in a fully open

    position before the end of play. No door should obstruct any

    gangway passage, stairway or landing.




                                22
    Comment The doors in the tunnel reduced the width of the tunnel

    such that the exlt from pen 3 was 1.53m, the exlt from pen 4

    was 1.650m. Photographs I, 2, 3 and 4 Appendix O3, Orauing

    1340/07_A Appendix R.


    64 There should be no changes In level at exit doors.


    Comment The doors at the entrance to the tunnel have a

    substantial mound of concrete to facilitate the bottom bolt of
0   the double doors. The total width of those doors is 3.375m.

    Because the doors lean towards the walls the measurements were

    taken with the doors forced back. Photograph 2 Appendix D3.


    67 Facilities should be provided to enable people to leave the

    ground at any time.


    Comment In respect of pens 3 and 4, apart from the potential

    exit onto the pitch through gates which could not be opened

    from inside, weaned or manned, were too narrow and up
0   steps, photographs 19 and 20 Appendix I)3, there were gates

    which led into the next adjacent pens through gates at the top

    end of the radial fences which on this occasion were kept

    locked open, photograph 24 Appendix D3. These however could

    not easily be seen as the top rail is at shoulder height. The

    only other means of leaving was via the entry route through the



                                 23
    tunnel photographs 4, 7 and 8 Appendix I)4. This route was not

    provided with a gangway and did not have the benefit of any

    signing upon it. Gaps in barriers were obscured by spectators.

    There were therefore no facilities to enable the occupants of

    pen 3 and 4 to leave at any time. There were no signs.

    Details of the radial fence gates appear in photographs 2 and 6

    Appendix D4.


@   CHAPTER 7 Stairways and Ramps


    88 Ramps. The maximum gradient acceptable will depend on a

    particular rampVs length, purpose and usage. A ramp subject to

    heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient of I

    in I0.

    Comment The Brade drawing 1340/03/Rev A Appendix R shows the

    ramp in the tunnel to have maximum slope as being I0Â° over a

    half metre length. The sloping portion in general is 5.g4m

    long with a slope of 8Â°20v The total length of the tunnel is
0
    21.05m. I0Â° equates to I in 5.67, 8Â°20v equates to I In 6.82.

    BS 5588 cl 9.8 requires < I in 12 Appendix P. Photograph 2

    Appendix D3.


    In heavy crowd flow inwards there would be a strong tendency to
    accelerate towards the terrace. This would be exacerbated by



                               24
    the enthusiasm of late arrivals. Anyone trying to leave would

    have a literal uphill struggle as well as having to fight

    against the crowd flow Inwards.


    CHAPTER 8 Terraces and Viewing Slopes


    Arrangements should be made to encourage the even distribution

    of the crowd, particularly if a local emergency should arise.


0   89 Excitement or surging deliberately induced is

    recognised.


    Comment The kinds of forces which might be expected on barriers

    from numbers of people has been addressed. Various studies

    [BSI and University of Surrey] have been undertaken of the

    force which the average human can exert. This is evaluated as

    being 0.25 to 0.29 kN [56 to 65 Ibs force] at chest height for

    the average stature male. Photograph 42 Appendix D3.


0   If a normal male is 500mm [19~"] wide it means that a single

    row could produce .5 kN/m to .58 kN/m and I0 rows 5 kN/m to 5.8

    kN/m. With 54 people per IOm2 in a space 2.6m deep (Table I GG

    cl 117 class B) it could be expected that the load on the rail

    would be a maximum 4 kN/m, 4.07


    In a space 3.3m deep 5.16 kN/m,



                                25
    In a space 3.5m deep 5.48 kN/m and (barrier 124a to 136 and to

    149)


    in a space 3.6m deep a load of 5.64 kN/m or 386 Ibs force per

    foot of barrier.


    These show that the Green Guide figures for the barrlers at

    design of 3.4 kN/m for class B, 5.0 kN/m for class A, are not

e   unreasonably high and such forces can readily occur with such a

    density of packing.    Thus the test load offers very little

    real protection beyond the loads which may be expected in

    practice.


    If a crowd is assumed to be robust, substantlally framed men,

    what might be termed the âellipse of occupancyâ is likely to be

    1.27m [50"] in circumference, 500mm [19~"] laterally and 250mm

    [I0"] from front to back at chest level. Alternate rows with a

    50% overlap laterally would be 375mm from front to back. That
e   is a density of 67.5 persons per lOm2 and represents a density

    representing completely full capacity. With a front to back

    dimension of 2.6m between barrlers, there could easily be 6 and

    possibly 7 rows of ordinary stature men at the rate of 2 per

    metre, exerting ordinary capability pushing forces at the level

    of the rail. The loading of 5 kN/m is reproduced by such a



                                26
    density.


    The distance to the rear of 124A was 3.5m. Thus there is e

    potential force of 6.73 kN/m. The H and S E study Appendix H

    IRL/ME/8g/36 also concludes that the 6 kN/m test load figure is

    not adequate.


    A potential overturning force oh 124a which was 0.95m height


0   (see cl I10) but effectively only 84% of the laid down minimum

    of 1.02m was therefore greater by a substantial factor. There

    is also considerable potential for load transference across the

    top of short barriers.


    92 Terrace steps should not be less than 280mm (11") or

    more than 380mm (15") wide. The preferred dimension is between

    355mm and 380mm (14" and 15").


    Comment The mean ?read length shown on the Brade drawing

    1340/02A is 385mm (151/8ââ) ranging from a maximum of 400mm
0   (153/4ââ) to a minimum of 330mm (13"). Appendix R.


    93 The height of risers should be between 75 and 180mm.


    Comment The mean riser is 85mm or 31/3ââ.


    96 âGangwaysâ The aim should be to ensure that every spectator

    on the terraces is within 12m of a gangway or exit.


                                   27
    Comment Appendix M shows the areas in which spectators would

    be more than 12m (39v-4") from an exit route. Maximum direct

    distance 12m. BS 5588 Part 3 Table I. Appendix P.


    For those in front of the first barrier in pen 3 with the

    exception of a radius of I.gm from the gap in the centre of

    this barrier, the distance to the mouth of the tunnel for exit

0   purposes exceeds 12m from the level of the tunnel at the

    forward end of the flank wall. The number of people so

    encompassed       would be, at the rate of 5.4/square metre, 229

    persons who would have a distance of up to 19m to ?ravel. In

    addition ?here are a fur?her 60 persons ?rapped in the southern

    end of the section between the firs? and second barrier.


    Thus, there are 289 or 29.15 red hatched areas of those in pen

    3 at the 5.4 density who would be beyond 12m from an escape

    exit unless gate 3 was open.
Q
    In addition those 42 people (4~) in green hatched area would be

    more than 12m away from an exit if none was available through

    pen 2.


    In pen 4 ?here would be 230 ?rapped between the fence and the

    firs? primary barrier and a fur?her 81 ?rapped between the



                                              28
     firs? and second primary barriers. Thus 311 or 30.8{ of ?hose

     in pen 4 would be beyond 12m from an escape exit unless gate 4

     was open with a further 16 (I.5~) in the green area.


     29.1{ of ,he capaci,y of pen 3 and 30.8{ of the capaci,y of pen

     4 were a, leas, 12 me,res away from an exi, rou,e if ,he pi,ch

     gates are excluded. As ,here were no gangways, spec,a,ors

     would have ,o rely upon a knowledge of ,he presence of gaps in

@    ,he barriers behind ,hem, ,he Ioca, ion of which would no, be

     visible when the pen was full.


     97 It is suggested ?ha? gangways could be sunk I00 - 200mm to

     discourage spectators standing in ?he gangways and if crush

     barriers were provided behind the step.


     Com~n? There were in fact no gangways of any kind.


     98 Radial gangways are suggested to be sunk 150mm -

     200mm.

     Comment There was an area of 1.9m wide 4.2m out from the tunnel

     door, an area of 8 square metres, cross-hatched in yellow pain?

     in pen 3 at the front of the tunnel exit. Here 2 spans of

     barrier 144 had been removed before 1983, subsequent 1o the

     construction of the radial fences between pens 2 - 3 and 5 - 6

     in 1981 but before the radial fences between pens 3 - 4 and 4 -

same amount an area of 8.8 square metres. Photographs 2, 3 and

35 Appendix 03, Pho,ograph 8 Appendix D4, Droving Appendix Ol.


99 In situations where gangways are not sunk the boundaries

should be highlighted with paint and spectators advised by

signs. Stewards may be needed.


Comment There vere no signs or stevards,          f


I01A ground should be divided into sections to prevent

potentially hazardous migrations by spectators. Each section

should be self contained with its own entrances, exits, ,oilers

and refreshment facilities.


Comment None of the pens vas self contained nor vas the vest

as they should have been. Alternatively additional gates at

thefront of radial fences should have made access between pens

lessdifficult.


There vas no self containment as the only toilets and

    which it was separated by a steel mesh fence some ]m (gvlO") in

    height and a parapet vail 500mm (193/4") in height.



Q   The effective distance to the edge of the grass on which the

    pitch was marked is 3.4m. Appendix D5 shows the cross-section

    at this position together with the steps which were necessary

    to mount to reach gate 3 or gate 4. Photographs 8, 19, 20, 21

    CHAPTER 9 Crush Barriers and Handrails


    The foreword Indicates that many hazards can be eliminated by

    provision of well constructed correctly positioned and properly

    mounted crush barriers. BS 6180:1982. Appendix P.


    I10 Specifically relates the height of crush barriers to that

    part of the body most able to tolerate pressure. The


0   recommendation is between 1.02m and 1.12m with a preferred

    height of I.Im (3v4" - 3v8" preferably 3v71/4").


    Comment The wording of this paragraph has been construed as

    "above the nosing of [that part of the step which is

    immediately behind] the barrier". If the interpretation is

    made "the nosing of [the next step to the rear behind] the

    barrier", then the effective height of the barriers is reduced

    by the rise of I step (3.3" or .085m). The height of the

    barriers in pen 3 were:

    The lowest barrier was at 0.83m (2â-9") the highest was 1.15m
0   or 3â-9". This puts the lowest dimension at the level of the

    average persons upper leg, below the groln and at the level of

    hands extended straight down, where little force can be

    exerted. The upper level recommended by the Guide Is at or

    immediately below the rib cage of the average person at a

    height where the hands could be employed with the forearm



                                33
    horizontal.


    One of the most obvious problems with short barriers is that

    âpush loadsâ will carry over the top as those behind have no

    fixed point against which to push. Thus loads are transferred

    and increased from those behind to those in the space in front

    of the barrier. The lowest barrier in pen 3 was number 136

    directly behind 124a. The second lowest 136a was in line

0   between the tunnel and 124a. As a direct result of lack of

    height therefore increases in pressure will have been directed

    towards 124o.


    The forces exerted are likely to be downwards as well as

    horizontal, giving rise to greater potential risk. Low

    barriers enable those behind to lean over them.


    When barrier 124A failed there was nothing to prevent those

    behind it falling and being pushed fully onto those who were in


Q   front and lower down the terrace. The consolidated plan of

    the location of fatalities evidence Appendix J shows a

    substantial majority in front of barrier 124A.


    ii2 - ii9 Spacing of crush barriers is dealt with.


    Comlent Laterally the lines of barriers in pen 3 and 4 were in

    no set pattern which was easily understood. Some rows were


                               34
    continuous except for a small gap. Other rows only consisted

    of a shor, length of barrier. Plan Appendix Di.


    ii3 Gives the Ideal of crush barriers provided along

    the full width of a terrace except for a gangway.


    C~)mment In pen 3 the front row of barriers 124a and 125

    extended across the whole pen, a total width of 14.355m, except

    for one approximately central gap of 1.5m. This row was set

    3.6m back from the perimeter fence. Plan Appendix DI.


    A further 3.5m back was the second row of 136 and 136a with two

    gaps one of 2.2m and one of 2m. Set back a further 3.5m was

    the third row with a gap of l. Im at the radial fence with pen 2

    and a gap of 6.3m to the central fence between pens 3 and 4.

    This 6.3m gap had been masked by a previous length some 2.6m

    long of 144 removed before June 1983, the remains of which were

    to some extent encompassed by the cross-hatching.
Q
    In pen 4 barrier 126 was installed 2.1m from the perimeter

    fence to overlap gate 4. The first row of barriers 125a, 127,

    128 in line with the flrst row In pen 3 had gaps of 1.9m, 1.3m

    and .185m.


    Set further beck some 2m was e newer berrler .2m clear of the



                                 35
    radial fence between 3 and 4 and protecting the first gap in

    the main front row in part created by the removal of a length

    of 144 and overlapping the 4.4m gap in the second row of

    barriers 137 and 138 in line with the second row on pen 3.

    This row also had a further 1.7m gap towards the northern end.


    The rear row had a gap of 8.5m in the 14.54 full vidth of the

    pen which was interrupted only by the one remaining length of
0   2.425m of barrier 144 set lm further forward and leaving a 2.2m

    gap in the area cross-hatched.


    Thus there was no, a concept of a radial gangway for ,he whole

    of each pen. The front row of barriers in pen 3 had a single

    1.5m opening to allow radial movement in either direction for a

    space 14.32m wide (47â) and 3.6m front to back (11â9"). At the

    density of 54 persons per I0 square metres there would be 278

    people in this space.


Q   There would also be 270 people between the first and second

    rows of barriers and 409 in the rear section. There is

    potential for a further 43 to be standing at that density on

    the cross-hatched areas giving an overall total of 992.


    Similar figures for pen 4 are 282 plus 274 plus 406 plus 47, a

    total of 1,009. These are capacity figures. Substantial



                               36
I




        numbers 17% and 13.6% would be without the benefit of a barrier

        In front of them. See Appendix H Max allowable capacities

        IRL/ME/89/35 of 822 and 871.


        The distance behind the rail of barrier 124a/3 to 4 Indlcates a

        potential force from the leanlng crowd model of 7m depth and a

        5.4/mz crowd of 7.33 kN/m.


        ii4 Recommends where barriers are not continuous
    0
        between radial gangways the alignment of gaps in successive

        rows should form an angle of less than 60Â°. There should be

        no more then two consecutive gaps.


        C~)mment In pen 3 where there are five gaps, that in the front

        row contravenes the Regulatlon as the angle between that In the

        first row and one in the second row is greater than 60Â°. There

        are not more than two consecutive gaps in any line of gaps in

        pen 3.

    Q   In pen 4 however there are three main rows of barriers end

        three secondary rows of barriers. If they are treated as

        separate rows the 60Â° rule Is not broken, but there are at

        least five occasions where the frequency of consecutive gaps is

        more than 2.


        It Is very difficult to quantify the effect.


                                       37
I




        ii5 Where there are gaps in the line of crush

        barriers the gaps should be I.Im to 1.4m in width [3â71/4ââ -

        4,71/4,,].

        Cx)eeent There is variance with requirements in the width of

        gaps particularly where barriers were removed or not installed.

        Gaps were left in specifically vulnerable places, reliance

    0   instead was pieced on cross-hatch painting on the ground. The

        line of gaps in pen 3 left a major direct avenue for crowd flow

        and hence crowd pressure from the exit of the tunnel directly

        to barrier 124A, which was accepted as being a column A table I

        barrier to be tested to 6 kN/m width.


        As can be seen from Appendix R the above only two of the five
        gaps in pen 3 and twelve gaps in pen 4 measured up to this

        requirement.


    0   The effect of these infractions is that in a crowd it would be

        impossible to define where the gaps were in order to use them.


        ii6 Provides a table of maximum distances between barriers and

        allows interpolation for the terrace gradient.

        ~)ement In this instance the slope is 13o40â with a mean riser

        of 85mm and mean tread length of 385mm or a slope of I in 4.53.


                                    38
    Thus, the maximum horizontal distance between barriers for peak

    viewing type h is 4.166m. Other areas type h 6.41m. Se also

    BS 6180 Appendix A Table i0 Appendix P.


    I1 is construed that this is a peak viewing area and the

    maximum horizontal distance for type B barriers has been

    exceeded in that the primary spacings of barriers are 3.6m,

    ].Sm and ].Sm. They fulfill the maximum criteria for Type h of

    4.166m except in so far as


          there is a section 6.3m wide in pen 3 with a front to

          back dimension of 6m without barriers and


          two other areas in pen 3 where the gaps between barriers

          are substantially greater than allowed where the front to

          back dimension is 7m or 9.5m.


    There are similar areas in pen 4.

0   The effect of spacing is very closely affected by the effect of

    lack of height.


    118 Older crush barriers spaced In accordance wlth

    column h for peak areas should be able to resist a load of 5

    kN/m width. The applied for at least 5 minutes test load

    should be 6 kN/m width.

    The Health and Safety Executlve Incident Report for the Inquiry

    also addressed the materlal In the barrler 124a whlch falled.

    The tensile strength of the wrought Iron tube materlal whlch

    formed the rall was measured at 365 MPa, or 365 N/mm2 [or 23.6

    tonnes/inch2] with an Vestimated elastlc llmltv of 150 N/mm2

    [or 9.7 tonsf/inchZ]. Similarly, the tensile strength of the


0   mild steel angle used for the supports was measured as 360

    N/mm2 [23.3 tonnesf/inch2"] wlth a âyleld stressâ of 288 MPa

    [N/mm2 or 18.6 tonnesf/inchZ].


    Simple theoretical analysis in which the geometry of the legs

    and the rail is introduced into a simple computer programme

    forecasts failure of the leading edge of the rear angle leg to

    occur at the bottom of the triangular gusset plate at a load of

    5.25 kN/m. Appendix L.


    Simple analysis of barrier 124a using a straight forward
O   elastic analysls engineering computer programme Is reproduced

    as Appendix L.


    It Is assumed that the ends of the two members formlng the

    barrier support are built Into the concrete and a horizontal

    force based upon 6"kN/m run as required by the test load

    wrltten In the Green Gulde Is applied as a horizontal force,


                                 4O
    perpendicular to the rear vertical 2" x 2" x {" angle section.


    The front angle section of similar size acts as a strut and is

    in compression as well as bending under this load force. The

    rear member is in tension as well as bending. It can be seen

    that the rail 124a would have


          a)    Exceeded the serviceability limits horizontally at
0               between 5kN/m and 6 kN/m


          b)    The rear leg would tear in bending at the lower

                rivet near the top at 5.25 kN/m


         c)     The front member would fail by a horizontal

                buckling load of 6 kN/m.



    This is particularly close to the location of the lower of the

    2 rivets holding together the 2 elements, the gusset plate end

0   the rear leg.


    It Is In exactly this location where failure has occurred

    on those legs which have been tested to failure, Includlng

    These evaluations were undertaken early in 1990 on the then

    known figures published by HSE in Appendix H.


    Subsequent materials testing by SGS shows


                                                        ultimate
    Rail length I - 2 was low carbon steel with        499 N/mmz

    Rail length 2 - 3 was wrought iron with            375 N/mmz
                3 - 4 wrought iron with                405 N/mmz


                compared with the HSE figure of        365 N/mmz


    In other words the rail which failed was somewhat stronger than



                                43
|




        the HSE results tended to indicate.


        The SGS results for the supports show


        Support 2 Front 51.9 x 52.8 x 6.7mm                 386 N/mm2
                   Rear 52.9 x 52.9 x 6,7                   386 N/mm2
        Support 3 Front 49.5 x 49.8 x 6.1                   353 N/mm2
                   Rear 49.4 x 49.3 x 6.0                   388 N/mmz

                   Front 52.7 x 53.2 x 6.6                  400 N/mm2
                   Rear 51.9 x 51.9 x 6.3                   406 N/mm2



        Again the ultimate tensile strengths were conservatively

        measured by HSE at 360 N/mmz.


        The older barriers were initially Installed before the 1939-45

        war as the steel from which they were made was from Dalzell

        Ltd. Certainly it was before Dr Eastwoodâs Involvement in

        1979. There is evidence to suggest that the original portion

    O   of them goes back some 59 years as they were erected in 1929.

        for people to ,ravel from any point in a structure to a place

        of safety without ou,side assistance. This will usually be the

                                    44
    forward escape onto the playing area. It is the menegementâs

    responsibility to ensure that all exit routes for use in an

    emergency are capable of being safely and effectively used at

    ell times when the ground is occupied.


    ~ment The locks on the pitch gates 3 end 4 were specifically

    designed to be opened only fromâthe outside. There were not

0   any panic bolts end there is no possibility of being able to

    open the latch from the ihside. There was no sign to say that

    this was an exit route. Photographs 20 and 40 Appendix D3. The

    width available for passage between the Inside face of the gate

    when opened end the latch post was 810mm [313/4"] for gate 3

    end .78m or 303/4" for gate 4. In both cases it was necessary

    to mount steps totalling 2â in height to obtain exit.


    The gates in the rear of the radial fences both gave e clear

    opening of I.Im when the gates were open. The height of the

Q   rails on the radial fence was 1.715m or [5â 7~"]. There was no

    Indication by means of e sign of such an exit route being

    available. The fence Itself would be obscured by the presence

    of persons of average height in the vicinity on the top 3 steps

    of the terrace in each case. Photograph 24 Apl~endix D3


    The only other potentlel exit In pen 3 was the 1.53m gap glvlng



                                45
    access to the tunnel between the Jamb of the timber door and

    the post of the radial fence. There is a 1.65m dimension for

    the similar opening at the rear of pen 4.


    It can be construed that the width of escape routes ought to be

    in conformity with paragraph 115 for gaps in crush barriers

    between I.I and 1.4m or clause 96 where gangways should not be

    less than I.Im wide. This is also reflected in clause 82.
0   Clause 59 the minimum width for any section of an exit route

    should be I.Im.


    Heans of escape under Regulation H3 of the Building Regulations

    for purpose group VII assembly requires a stairway to be at

    least Im wide if it serves a compartment which is capable of

    being occupied by more than 50 persons.


    Approved document H of the 1985 Building Regulations in respect

    of means of access the minimum clear opening vidth of an

Q   entrance door should be that provided by a lm single leaf.


    183Emergency evacuation time is to be calculated from the

    spectator capacity of the accommodation and the flow rate from

    chapter 17 as defined in clause 234.


    CcxIent Thus, the flow rates potentially should be evaluated as

    follows:


                                46
f




        the egress time of 8 minutes which is the maximum time it

        should take spectators to enter the normal exit system from

        their viewing positions at the end of play.


        185 The emergency evacuation time is discussed in relation to

        stands.


        186 Where emergency evacuation is to a perimeter track or

    0   playing area and where there is a pitch perimeter fence it

        should have access points in accordance with paragraph 215.


        Comment The gateway width was 1oo narrow. Gate 3 was 0.81m or

        74~ of the required width. Gate 4 was 0.78m or 71~ of the

        required width. The gates were unsigned so that there was no

        indication of their presence. Each required spectators 1o

        climb up 2 or 3 steps from a sump 2v-O" deep. They were not

        at sufficient frequency to be effective even when opened from

        the outside.

    0   Their effectiveness as escape routes was essential for nearly a

        third of the potential occupants.

        place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points

        should be properly stewarded and clearly marked so that

    CHAPTER 16 Est i mat ion of Safe Ground Capaci ty



    219 Guidance is given concerning the capacity of a terrace for

    estimating safe ground capacity. This is governed in clau~

    220 by the number of people that can be safely accommodated on

    a terrace in terms of

0           the capacity calculated on a clause 222 basis of   5.4

            persons per 10 square metres or


            the numbers who can leave by the normal exit route in 8

            minutes calculated on clauses 229 - 232 or


    c       the numbers who can leave in an emergency within a time to

            be assessed under clauses 185 - 186 which should not

            exceed 2~ minutes unless there are consultations with the
            Fire Authority

O
    Com=ent The number in the west terrace was evaluated apparently
    solely on the basis of 5.4/mz without any reference to

    evacuation times. The number for the north vest terrace was

    simply taken from a 1970 drawing on which there was an error.

    This was not picked up in 1979 or subsequently, until November

    1989.

    222 Identifies the use of 54 persons per I0 square

    metres as an extreme allowance when the terrace is in good

    condition. Sub clause B requires 27 persons per I0 square

    metres when the terrace deviates materially from the

    recommended guidelines so as to constitute a possible hazard.

    There Is the potential for interpolation between these two

    figures.


    The total figure arrived at in this way I0,100 was referred to

    on 30th April 1981 Core Bundle      in a letter between the

    Assistant Chief Constable, operational and the Chief

    Superintendent Herold of F Division.


    The figure was also reflected in a letter dated 27th February

    1989 from G H Mackrel the Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday to 5

    R Clark a competitions secretary of the FA, Ca~-e Bundle


    The figure was broken down only arbitrarily between pens.


    Assessment by reference to an 8 minute exit through the normal

    exit route is simple to make from clause 234, a basis of 60

    persons/minute/unit exit width of 0.55m. The tunnel represents

    2.78 units of exit width giving an 8 minute evacuation of 1334

    spectators.



                                51

                                                  717

    The theoretical capacity of pitch gate 3 at a
0   width of .81m or 1.47 units is

    2~ x 60 x 1.47 or                             220

    Giving an optimistic tota of                  937


    The history of the capacity of the north west pen starts with a

    Husband & Co drawing in September 1970 when the total ground

    capacity was 55,000 based on 1.34 feet/person on each step,.

    3,000, amended by E & P in 1979 to 2,900. The figure was

    originally modified by Taylor Inquiry to 2,300 with 680 in the


O   pen 7 lower area. The space shown on the Husband drawing

    reflected in the E &. P drawing 64E was found to be inaccurate.

    Draying 1610/64E ^ppendix R.


    As a temporary expedient the figure was reduced to 1500. This

    was because of physical problems on 21st November 1989.

    Initial calculations resulting from re-measurement on 23rd



                                   52
    November 1989 showed 2242 as the 5.4/mz gross figure.


    Clau~ ~ Indicates that when gangways do not meet

    recommendations reductions should be made for areas for

    standing other than designated gangways. If a notional gangway
    I.lm wide is presumed from front to back a total distance of

    13.1m then at 5.4 we reduce the capacity for pen 3 by 77

    persons.
0
    The mean tread length is 385mm which is lOmm more than the

    guide recommendation. There therefore should be a reduction of

    2~% on this account.

    Our own check of the total gross area of the North West terrace

    is 3005 spectators at 5.4/mz. A part is fenced off reducing

    the total to 2384. Some 821 of these need to view the vast
    majority of the ground through a glazed screen. In our view

    therefore the real gross figure for NW terrace should have been

O   1563.


    The gross capacity of the various pen areas of the West Terrace
    spectators evaluated in Appendix D2 on the basis of 5.4 per

    square metre is as follows:

        The overload resulting from northwest terrace being only

        capable of holding 2384 instead of the E & P 2900 means that

        the rest of the terrace will have carrled 7.1% more.

    e
        The analysis indicates that pen 3 could well have been
        overpopulated in comparison with the 5.4/mz gross figure by

        17.7% at frequent Intervals in the past.

        ~=~nt The clause does not define 75~ of what. Is it

        the recovery of the total deformation since the original

        measurement at the commencement of the first test or as E

        & P took it to be the amount of deformation subsequent to

        the application, maintenance and removal of load for each

        cycle only?

        It is valuable to distinguish between the linear

        load/deflection elastic deformation and the non-linear

        plastic deformation in differing parts of the barrier.

        The rail is relatively compliant and hence at mid-span

        exhibits large elastic (recoverable) deflection and small

        plastic (Irrecoverable) deformation. By comparison the

        support is stiff and undergoes relatively small elastic

        deflection but is seen to undergo plastic deformation.


        It follows that measurements to assess recovery should be
    Q   made at those positions which are most susceptible to

        plastic deformation namely thecentre supports. By
        comparison Eastwood and Partners 1988 measurements were

        made at one mid span rail position which is bound to

        exhibit high "recovery. Deflections measured will not

        reflect any permanent deformation of the centre support.


                             59
       Recent measurements confirm that percentage recovery is least

       at the centre support, which demonstrates the shortcomings of

       the Eastwood and Partners 1988 and 1983 measurements.


       The load/displacement curve actually obtained in testing

       barrler 131 may help this explanatlon.

    This shows the ratchet effect of apply load which Induces not

    only elastic recoverable deflection but plastic irrecoverable

    permanent deformation.


    Basically what happens when a steel barrier is loaded is that

    the application of horizontal load to the rail initially takes

    up any looseness in the system, for example, between the rail

    and the clip.
0   Further application of load causes deflection of the rail and

    differing deflections of the supports.


    The amount of deflection of the rail also depends upon the

    restraint conditions at the supports. If there is no adjoining

    rail, the end can turn a little within the clip. The clip

    itself can also be twisted slightly.


    Where there is an adjoining continuous rail the stiffness of

    that rail will assist in carrying load so that the deflections
O   for a given load are less. If the adjoining continuous rail is

    also loaded to the same extent the deflectlons wlll be further

    reduced.


    In general terms the amount of deflection for any specific

    conditions will iniâtially be linearly related or proportional

    to the applied load. Removal of the load will reduce this


                                 61
    elastic deflection in the same proportion.


    Load and elastic deflection will continue to be linearly

    related until a certain stress Is reached in the rail - usually

    at the centre. This stress is referred to as the âlimit of

    elasticityâ or yield stress.


    Further increase in load will cause further change in stress.

@   In modern steels this change is a further not very different

    increase. In steels without the benefit of oxygen blowing

    during manufacture and hence containlng impurities there is

    likely to be a much reduced increase in stress. In some steels

    there may even be a reduction in stress capability, referred to

    as the upper and lower yield points.


    A lower yield point means the material is actually less able to

    carry load.



O   Even further increase in load will cause permanent or âplasticâ

    deformation as well as the previous elastlc deflection. The

    amount of increase in load to cause a glven Increase In

    deformation will depend very much on the type of iron or steel.

    The stress resulting from this strain wlll Increase to an

    âultimate tensile strengthâ at whlch tenslle failure will

    occur.



                                   62
    Failure In tension may be actual brittle fracture. There may,

    In more ductile materials, be a thlnning down of the sectlon as

    it stretches - âneckingâ Movement or deflectlon may be very

    large without much increase in load.


    The speed at which the deflection occurs also depends on the

    material. It can be many minutes before the full strain is

0   developed. At that stage it can prove difficult to keep the

    application of load constant. If the load is not maintained

    there will not be a truly reflective response.


    Failure in compression is less well understood as the

    phenomenon is less frequent. The material crumples or bows

    sideways - crippling.


    In practice most failures arise from combinations of reasons.

    Design however would be expected to be elastic. Thus, testing

    should have been expected to produce linear results.
O
    Load displacement data which show deviation from a linear

    load/deflection relationship should be a cause for doubt and

    require more detailed investigation.


    6     If during any test even though the barrier or rail



                                63
    satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should

    arise for any reason (including such matters as cracking

    of the terracing or distortion of connections) as to the

    safety of the barrier or the rail, a detailed

    investigation should be carried out. Unless the results

    of this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety

    of the barrier or rail, the barrier or rail as the case

    may be should be deemed to have failed the test.

    Comment Thorough examination reveals that many barriers

    near 124a were the subject of visible corrosion and

    additional bracing both laterally and at ground level.

    Similar barriers have been repaired at exactly those

    points predicted as being the most vulnerable by simple

    computer analysis as indicated in Appendix L. The same

    tension bending failures are demonstrated in barrier 124a

    as can be seen particularly in photograph 24 Appendix E


O   of support 3 where compression bending failure of the

    front leg is also visible. Photograph 2_5 Appendix E also

    of support 3 shows this tension failure aggravated into a

    complete tear from the bottom rivet hole to the top of

    the section as well as compression failure of the front

    leg. Other Iocations of failure at this point were

    identified in clause 118.


                          64
    7     A record should be kept of all the barriers and rails

          tested and their performances during the test.


    ~mment It would appear that the only records we have are the

    summaries of tests which occurred on the barriers are those

    Disclosed in Cx)re Bundle            . Those tests were dated June

    1983 and 19th July 1988. There are no working or field notes

0   for either year. Barrier 124a was tested on both occasions.

    The 4 supports labelled I, 2, 3 and 4 by HSE had between them 3

    continuous spans of rail labelled 3, 2 and I by Eastwood and

    Partners. It is understood that on both dates E & P loaded

    spans I and 2 together and measured only the horizontal

    deflection of the mid position of span I. The specific

    deflection of the supports was not measured. The deflection

    horizontally of the rail was not measured for span 2. Spans 2

    and 3 were then similarly loaded and the deflection of span 2

    only was then measured. The handrail deflection measurements
O   will have included the average deflection of the supports.


    Simple steel rules were apparently used in 1988 to measure

    deflections.


    It should be noted âthat mid span rail deflection does not give

    an indication of minimum recovery.

        It is not known how the load was applied, whether it was in

        approximately equal Increments at all or for how long it was

        held for 5 minutes. The load was then removed in one fell

        swoop and the deflections remeasured which figure is recorded

        in the âunloadâ column. Recovery was then evaluated as the

        difference between the deflection at the end of 5 minutes of

        application of full load and the deflection as measured after
    0   immediate release of the load, expressed as a percentage of the

        total full load deflection. Tests 2 and 3 were taken as

        completely separate and distinct tests with a completely new

        zero.


        As can be seen from Core Bundle       the E & P load deflection

        figures in 1988 are as follows :-

        Test I

        Presumably 0 - load - 29mm unload - 12 Recovery =


    0   Test 2

        Presumably 0 - load 19mm unload - 5mm Recovery =   14   14= 74%
                                                                19

        Test 3

        Presumably 0 - load 19mm unload - 19mm Recovery = 19 19 = 100%
                                                               19



                                     66
    This does not recognise the real deflections. With 29mm

    deflection on Test I full load and unload to 12mm,

    Recovery = 17 = 59%
              29

    Test 2 starts at +12mm to which Igmm added = 31mm, unload - 14

    = 17mm

     Recovery = 14 = 45%
                31

0   Test 3 + 19mm gives a total deflection of 36mm, unload - 19mm

    so that recovery at the end of test 3 is 19 or 53%
                                              36


    The 1983 test of barrier 124a are in thousandths of an inch as

    follows

                      Test I            Test 2            Test 3

                  0 940 220 950 280           I010 280


    Actual          720 = 76.6% 67-0 = 70.5% 73-0 = 72.2%
    recovery is     940          950          I010


    which is less than 75% and the test showed barrier 124a to have


                                  67
    failed.


    In attempting to understand Just what dld happen In the July

    1988 test the following analysis appears to cover the position.


          Test I Load application, Imm of âbedding inâ + 16mm of

          elastic deflection + 12mm plastic deformation, unload to

          12mm recovering 16mm of elastic deflection.

0         Test 2 Load application, 16mm of elastic deflection + 3mm

          more plastic deformation unload to 5mm recovering only 14

          of the 16mm of elastic deflection.


          Question. Did the gauge move further beyond 19mm before

          the load was removed?


          Test. Load application 16mm of elastic deflection + 3mm

          more of plastic deformation unload recovery of the 16mm

          elastic deflection and some bedding in.

O
    Hence strictly according to paragraph 5 of ennexe C the tests

    should be repeated. If that repeated test recognlsed less than

    75~ recovery, then the barrier would have failed.

    Alternatively if the recovery was less than 50% on the first

    test then it should have been deemed to have failed In any



                                  68
    event. The 53% of the overall test is only very marginally

    over the allowable failure figure.


    BS 61BO cl 5.7 Appendix P requires deflections of barriers

    when subJected to half loading to be span/125 or 25mm whichever

    is less. Span/125 in this case is 18.4mm.


    It was noted that during the 1990 tests it was extremely

    difficult to accurately keep loading on hydrauic gauges to the
0   test figure. A small margin below the plastic load should fail

    to advance plastic deformation, Alternatively reading errors

    of Imm on the steel bands may be a valid explanation.


    The E & P load applied to rail lengths I to 2 was 1.44 tonnes

    which equals 14.3426 kN. The length of span I is 2.2m and 2 is

    2.265m so that the load equates to 6.52 kN/m and 6.33 kN/m.

    The test load given on the chart however is exactly the same

    for all spans, at 1.44 tonnes. The span length is not recorded

    on the record sheets for any location. 54 tests of 3 stages
O   were all given the date 19th July 1988.


    Further it was noted during many of the 1990 tests that at the

    end of 5 minutes in the fully loaded condition deflection

    gauges were not static - the readings were continuing to

    increase. The limitation of 5 minutes Is In accord with the



                                69
    Guide. However since the legs were concreted in originally and

    further concreted in by the addition of concrete steps to the

    terrace, I conclude that plastic deformation was still

    continuing even at the end of 5 minutes. Partly this was

    contributed to by the difficulty In keeping up the loading

    pressure as the rails and supports moved away.


    The 1983 and 1988 tests are claimed to be undertaken in

0   accordance with Appendix C of the Guide to Safety at

    Sportsgrounds. The foregoing analysis identifies numerous

    deviations from the Green Guide requirements.


    Certainly there is substantial permanent deformatlon In the

    rails. Dr Eastwood indicated in evidence to the Inquiry that

    perhaps some of the deformation was in fact caused by the

    tests. His evidence was that in the tests the rails provided

    the majority of the deflection and not the supports. There is

    lack of alignment of supports which were presumably installed

e   straight, and one is particularly concerned about the rails

    which have obviously been bent laterally. Photograph 18

    Appendix E. One could readily understand rails being bent

    vertically through abuse, but lateral bending must be expected

    from test or crovd loading. It is valuable to note that H & S

    E only laboratory load tested rails.

        In my opinion the E & P Interpretatlon is plainly wrong and

        would not accept that there Is a body of opinion which would

        support it. Examination of the top of 124a/3 clearly shows

        Photograph 15 Appendix D3



                          necking and fracture of the flange materia

                          outside the bottom rivet hole in the rear eg

    0                     followed by tearing of the remainder of the

                          material in this flange of the angle at the

                          same level


                          followed by tearing of the bend in the angle

                          junction parallel to the flanges up to the

                          section where part of the flange was cut out

                          during manufacture to mate with the front leg


                    The bottom rivet hole is exactly the point

    e               identified by theoretical analysis. There is also

                    compression bending failure of the upper section of

                    the front leg. Appendix L.


        The actual forward movement under load of the rails is

        very much greater {han either the elastic or plastic

        deformation of the support. Thus, unless the latter is


                                       71
    specifically measured, it is completely disguised and unlikely

    to be observed unless actual failure occurs. 140/2 is a

    perfect example of a support being loaded and with only the

    rail deflection measured. Some support damage was recognised

    and repaired. However it physically fractured or deformed on

    both front and rear legs 2 years later under the same test load

    criterion.

0   It is particularly interesting to note that the section of rail

    which did not fail was some 27% stronger than the sections

    which did fail.

    ANALYSIS OF THE DEFECTS




    5,1   A ticket holder approaching Hillsborough from the

          Leppings Lane end on 15 April was faced with 6 external

          perimeter gates, 3 led to turnstiles I - lO labelled A,

e         turnstiles 9 - 16 labelled C. The other 3 led to the

          rear right bank of turnstiles A to G labelled âBâ.

          Detailed information Appendix B, Aerial view Appendix A,

          Photograph I Appendix B.


    5.2   There were turnstiles A to G, seven in number, leading

          into the concourse area facing the tunnel Photograph I

          Appendix B



          The route to pens I and 2 was to the right around the

Q         southern end of the stand


          and the gate in the wall leading to pens 6 and 7 was to

          the left Photographs 3, 5 and 6 Appendix B.


          There were 10,100 spectators to be accommodated on these

          terraces.



                                76
    5.3   There were apparently 497 spectators per turnstile on

          average in respect of the south and east stands. As far

          as the north stand Is concerned I0 turnstiles for 9,700,

          or 970 per turnstile; and for the west stand 743 per

          turnstile. For the west and north west terraces I0,I00

          were to go through 7 turnstiles, 1,443 per turnstile.


e   5.4   Progress through the turnstiles was extremely slow for a

          number of reasons, not least the crush of numbers. At

          14.52 the police opened exit gate C in an attempt to

          alleviate the crush outside and allowed an estimated

          2,000 spectators to bypass the turnstiles in a period of

          5 minutes 30 seconds. This approximates to 6 persons per

          second. Photograph 2 Appendix B.


    5.5   In the concourse beyond the turnstiles the access stairs

          to the West stand were obvious. However the areas
i         allocated for standing in the West and North West Terrace

          were only indicated to would be spectators by 2 signs;

5.6   There vere no signs relating to the open access gate in

      the radial wall which divided the concourse between the

      groups of turnstiles. More than half the estimated

      numbers would need to pass through this gate and go

      around the north end of the stand to the North West part

      of the terrace (E &âP 2900) and pens 6 and 7 and North

      West corner (E & P 2525). Photograph 3 Appendix B, plan

5.7   The numbers evaluated for the capacity of the West

      Terrace including the north West Terrace for Safety

      Certificate purposes was I0,I00. Of these, 2,900 were

      accounted for by the NW terrace. That figure was based

      on an erroneous drawing. The true pre Taylor figure

      should have been 2,384 or only 82% even if those with an

      imperfect viev of the ground through a glazed screen are

      included. If those 821 are excluded the figure reduces

      to 1,563 or 54%.


      âCapacityâ crowds of I0,I00 would therefore not be able

      to find sufficient space in the NW terrace and hence



                            78
           overload the remainder.


    5.8    No figures for spectator capacity in the individual pens

           was added to the Safety Certificate either in 1981 (when

           the first radial fences were installed) or in 1985 when

           the remainder were installed. Nevertheless E & P gave an

           arbitrary capacity of 1200 to pen 3 and 1000 to pen 4 to

           plan 8945/IA shoving the ground layout in 1987. This

O          needs to be judged against the emergency evacuation

           capacity so easily calculated at 937. In turn this

           reduces to 717 if pitch gate 3 is omitted from the

           calculation.


    5.9    Toilets and refreshments could only be accessed from the

           external concourse. Plan Appendix DI.


    5.10   Fixed control of access to the central tunnel could only

           be by the use of a pair of wooden doors which open

           inwards into the tunnel. These would open only against
O          a would-be exit flow and could not be expected to be used

           whilst there were spectators in the pens. A second pair

           of doors which opened against the incoming flow were set

           in the east wall at the terrace end, and would

           individually âclose off against the central fence, between

           pens 3 and pen 4. Photographs ! and 2 Appendix D3.


                                 79
           These would also be difficult to use as spectators

           wanting to enter the pens would have already gone down

           the tunnel before finding the doors closed.


    5.11   There was no system of counting the numbers passing

           through the tunnel nor official estimates of individual

           pen capacity against which to control such numbers.


0   5.12   The natural geometry led spectators to the correct

           deduction that the tunnel was e direct route to the most

           sought after location behind the goal.


           The slope of the tunnel is a 4m long average upward

           incline of I in 18, followed by o downward incline of I

           in 18 for 8.5m, and then followed by a steeper downward

           incline of I in 6.8 towards the pitch, which would have

           an effect of speeding entrants into the pens and would

           make any attempt to get back out through the tunnel more

e          difficult. Brade drawing no. 1340/03A Appendix R. At

           the entrance to the pen there was no barrier to stem the

           flow of incoming spectators - merely o yellow cross

           hatched patch presumably intended to be kept free similar

           to a crossroad âboxâ Photograph 35 Appendix D3

           photograph 8 Appendix I)4



                                 8O
           The distance apart of the barriers down the slope of the

           terrace was greatly in excess of the recommendations for

           barriers of that strength. They were really only Class B

           barriers at a Class A spacing.


           They vere mostly far too short and were belov groin

           height for most people, so that it was not possible to

0          use them to push against and resist pressure from behind.


           The gaps in the rows of barriers were not in any regular

           position and it yes not possible to see vhere they vere,

           to find a way out.


    5.13   The layout and detailed information of the Terraces is

           included in Appendix D. Isometric sketches, very

           carefully made to scale, of the spectators views of the

           pens are also included at Appendix D4.


0   5.14   There vere accesses into adjacent pens via gates 1.1 m

           (3â-71/4ââ) wide through radial fences 1.7m (5â-7") high.

           The top rail is a shoulder height. These accesses were

           without the benefit of any sign or indication of their

           presence for use either as communication into a less

           densely filled pen or as a means of escape. The gates



                                 81
           could not be seen, whether they were open or not.

           Photograph 24 Appendix D3.



    5.15   There was an emergency route onto the pitch via a gate.

           Access to the gate was up 3 steps a total height of .600

           m [2â] from the well of the pen. The only sign on the

           gate was its number oriented towards the pitch. It could

           only be unlocked from the pitch. Photograph 40 Appendix
0          D3.

    5.16   There were no emergency escape signs of any kind. The

           only real emergency exits were completely unmarked. Even

           the normal exit routes were unmarked. Photograph 36

           Appendix D3.


    5.17   The only means of escape in emergency were


                 the normal exit route of retracing entry through


0                the tunnel which would be up a quite steep slope

                 against the flow of an incoming crowd


                 exit through the unmarked gate in the radial fence

                 separating the next pen end which was not visible

                 in crowded conditions


           c     through o narrow, unmarked, not panic-operable from


                                 82
                  the inside, gate onto the pitch, up 3 steps and 2â

                  higher than" the well of the Terrace.


    5.18   33.1% of those in Pen 3 and 32.3% in Pen 4 were more than

            12m from the tunnel, 29.1% of pen 3 and 30.8% of pen 4

           were 12m from the tunnel or a radial gate. Appendix M.


    5.19   The layout of gaps in rails was extraordinary - there

           were no gangways but gaps where none could be expected

           and barriers where gaps would be expected. No barriers

           were at the mouth of the tunnel. An area was marked in

           yellow cross hatching presumably requiring people to

           avoid standing in the area in front of the tunnel.

           Photograph 8 Appendix D4.


    5.20   All of ~ese in general terms combined to fail to provide

           a reasonable degree of safety as required in GG 8. The

           numbers who could be safely accommodated were not known,

e          not controlled or counted as indicated in Green Guide

           clause 220.


    5.21   The location of injury and fatality was concentrated in

           front of barrier 124a. The actual failure of a barrier

           necessarily means that the forces applied to it by those

           behind can be no longer resisted. Those behind will


                                  83
       necessarily fall on those In front whose occupied space

       is necessarily compressed by the collapse.


5.22   Apart from the barrler 124a In pen 3 and the single

       section remaining of barrler 144 in pen 4, there are no

       other apparent signiflcant reasons for 8 deaths

       originating from pen 4 but 87 orlginetlng from pen 3.


5.23   This suggests the collapse of 124a was a major factor in

       the fatalities. However, it is beyond my speciality to

       attempt to apportion specific causes of death.

                   ANALYSIS OF EASTWOOD TESTS



1.0   DESCR I PT I ON OF EQU I PMENT [ AS SEEN I N 1990 DEMONSTRAT I ONS ]

1.1   The testing rig used by Eastwood & Partners
      consists of a series of rectangular hollow
      section [tubular] members bolted together so
      as to produce a horizontal loading at four
      points along each span of barrier. A drawing
      showing the details of the rig is included as
      F1 and photographs of the rig are inciuded in
      this appendix.

1.2   For the tests on 26th June 1990, two identical rigs
      were used so that adjacent spans of the same barrier
      could be loaded.

      Various adjustments in the rig dimensions are possible.

      Connections between the various steel members of the
      rig consist of welded and stiffened joints and single
      bolted joints.

1.5   It appears to be intended that all welded and stiffened
      connections produce a rigid joint with no relative
      rotation of members.

1.6   It appears to be intended that all other
      joints, i.e. the bolted connections, are
      sufficiently free to allow rotation of the
      members connected. There is tightness in
      application.


      1983 AND 1988 TESTING OPERATIONS

      Deflections in 1983 tests were measured in thousandths
      of an inch. In 1988 tests were measured in
      millimetres. It is not known how these
      measurements were taken or with what
      frequency.
2.2   It was understood that the method of testing in 1983
      and 1988 was to load two adjacent spans of each barrier
      simultaneously and to measure the maximum deflection of
      the mid point of the rail on one span. In the case of
      a single span barrier load was applied and deflection
      of the rail at mid span was measured.

2.3   The number of increments of loading is not known. The
      test result tables show only a deflection related to a
      single load increment of 6 kN/m. The duration of this
      load was not recorded.

2.4   In calculating the percentage recovery each cycle of
      loading was considered in isolation.



3.0   1990 TESTING DEMONSTRATIONS

3.1   Load was applied to two adjacent spans of each barrier.

3.2   The deflection of the barrier was measured by means of
      gauges supported by robust free standing posts on the
      opposite side of the barrier to the rigs. Deflection
      was measured at each support and at the mid-span
      position of each rail.

3.3   The load was applied in six approximately equal
      increments. The maximum load was maintained for five
      minutes.

3.4   In calculating the percentage recovery the deflections
      are considered by Elrond Engineering to be progressive
      throughout the three cycles of loading [i.e. a
      complete test]. Eastwood & Partners consider
      each cycle in isolation.

3.5   Figure F4 shows the relationship between load and
      deflection of the top of the central support of barrier
      131. This illustrates the progressive nature of
      deflection during a test.

4.1     Application of Load to Barrier Rail

4.1.1   The application of load to the barrier at four points
        is not a truly uniformly distributed load. The effect
        of this is to increase the support moment by
        6% and the mid span moment by I0% compared to
        a uniformly distributed load case. It does
        not significantly affect the support
        reactions.

4.1.2   The support reactions, that is the loads transferred
        from the testing equipment by way of the barrier rail
        to the supports vary according to the condition of the
        rail relative to the supports. The support reactions
        for a double span of barrier rail are indentlcal to two
        single spans only if there is no continuity of the rail
        at the central support. If there is continuity, that
         is if a single length of tube is used for both spans
        then the support reaction is increased by 25% at the
        central support. This comparison is shown in Figure F2.


4.2     Fixity of Joints in Test Rig


4.2.1    The combination of bolted [pinned] and welded [fixed]
         connections used on the rig creates an asymmetrical
         displacement of the rig. The rig displaces away from
         the fixed end towards the pinned end from right to left
         on plan. This will affect the load position and may
          introduce a nominal horizontal force. These effects
         are likely to be slight. It was observed during one
         test demonstration that the rig slipped laterally along
         the barrier rail.

4.2.2    If some or all of the bolted connections are over-
         tightened then a fixed or partially fixed condition can
         occur.

4.2.3    The analysis of the rig assuming all fixed joints
         produces a radically different set of forces, moments
         and deflections.
4.2.4   With all fixed joints, the loads applied to the barrier
        are much higher near the ends of the barrier so that
        the reactions at the central support are less than the
        theoretical case. The reactions are compared in Figure
        F2.

4.2.5   The distribution of moment along the barrier is such
        ~hat higher moments are produced near the supports.
        comparison of the maximum bending moments for the ideal
        condition and the two fixity conditions is shown in
        Figure F3.

4.2.6   The effect of fixing all the joints is to reduce the
         lateral deflections of the rig. The maximum
        theoretical lateral deflection with pinned and fixed
        joints is lO.5mm and with all fixed joints is 0.3mm.

4.2.7    With all joints assumed fixed the deflection of the
         barrier at right angles to the rail is drastically
         reduced since the application of load is more
         concentrated nearer the supports. The maximum
         theoretical deflection using pinned and fixed joints is
         13.4mm whereas using all fixed joints the maximum
         theoretical deflection is 2.9mm.

4.2.8    From the tests carried out on 26th June 1990, allowing
         for the deflection of the supports which occurred, the
         maximum rail deflection was of the order of lOmm. This
         suggests that the rig behaved in that instance as
         intended as a combination of pinned and fixed joints.

4.2.9    In practice the connections will behave as though
         partially fixed and the lateral displacement will be
         less than the fully pinned condition. The forces and
         moments will vary between the limits calculated.


4.3     Other Factors


4.3.1    The rig is supported on the barrier and introduces
         compressive forces into the supports of the barrier.

4.3.2    The compressive force at each support tends to reduce
         the tensile stress leading to failure and increases the
         capacity of the rear support leg by approximately 1%.
4.3.3   Because of the limited range of adjustment of the rig
        it is not always possible to ensure that the main legs
        are perfectly horizontal. A variation from the
        horizontal would mean that the measured load applied to
        the rail could be marginally increased or decreased.

4.3.4   Similarly because of the limited range of adjustment of
        the rig members in the direction parallel to the
        barrier, it is not always possible to ensure that the
         load positions are equally spaced along the barrier and
        the loading produced is not exactly as assumed.

4.3.5   When the maximum load is applied to the barrier during
        testing, it is maintained for 5 minutes. However, in
        practice because of the deflection of the barrier, it
        is difficult to maintain a constant load and the onus
        to do this rests on the pump operator, i1 was
        observed on a number of tests that the
        deflections were still increasing during the
        five minutes under the application of a
        constant load

4.3.6   In order to ascertain the jack force required and hence
        the gauge reading at the pump it is necessary to
        measure the length of barrier exactly and calculate the
        necessary total force equated to the specified testing
        load of 6 kN/m run. There is clearly a possible source
        of inaccuracy in both the measurement and calculation
        stages of this operation.

4.3.7   The accuracy to which the deflections and loads can be
        read is dependent upon the readerâs perception of the
        spaces between the dial graduation marks. In the case
        of the deflection gauges these can be moving rapidly
        and a short interval of time can make a difference to
        the reading taken. The gauges are graduated to O.Olmm.

4.3.8   Without calibration certificates for the pump gauge
        which has so far not been made available, it is not
        possible to confirm if the recorded reading is the
        actual force applied to the main legs of the rig.

4.3.9   The readings taken on the pump gauge are expressed in
        Tons and are reported to relate directly to the load
        in the main leg.

We understand that the Eastwood rig has been calibrated in

such a way that the pressure reading shown on the hydraulic

pressure gauge indicated directly the force applied by each ram

to the barrier. Therefore:-

1.0   DESCRIPTION OF EQUIPMENT



1.1   The testing rig used by SGS consists of one or two
      modules which allows a single or two adjacent spans of
      the same barrier to be tested.

1.2   Each module consists of three horizontal telescopic box
      sections which are connected to the face of a flange on
      an aluminium alloyâlateral I beam. Three hydraulic rams
      are bolted to the opposite flange of the beam in the
      horizontal plane so that they make contact with the
      barrier at rail height.

1.3   The whole module is positloned to the rear of the
      barrier, the I beam end being supported on three
      adjustable vertical screw jacks. The free ends of the
      box sections are supported on a terrace step of
      convenient height and braced against the riser of the
      next step back.

1.4   The relatlve position of each ram can be adjusted
      laterally to provide spacings along the barrier span of
      I/3 length of span commencing I/6 length of span from
      each end support.

1.5   Load is applied to the barrier through a âVâ shaped end
      on each ram. All rams in use are connected to a single
      hydraulic pump via. flexible hoses so that equal
      pressures are developed on the piston of each ram. The
      hydraulic pressure in the system Is indicated by a dial
      gauge calibrated in pounds per square inch [pslg] which
      is attached to the pump.

1.6   The conversion of hydraulic pressure to load applied to
      the barrier is shown in the first two columns of the
      tabulated test results and the method of calculation
      addressed in the notes which precede the tables.

Load Calculatlon SGS rig



Information regarding the calibration of the SGS rig is not

clear. It is understood that some part of the hydraulic

pressure applled to the base of each ram is not transmitted

to the barrier. Six rams were used in tests carried out on

9th July 1990, 3 rams have been calibrated and the

transmission loss measured. The loss can be expressed as a

ram efficiency and includes the effect of the ram piston area.

The reason for part of the loss is not understood. The

efficiency of each ram is different and varies with the

hydraulic pressure applied. However, the individual




                                21
figures have been averaged to give two efficlencies.



0.87 up to 1100 psig hydraulic pressure
0.91 from 1100 psig to 1600 psig hydraulic pressure



Therefore the force applied to each barrier has been

calculated as:-

Load on barrier kN/m =

0.87 or [0.91] x No. of rams x 4.448 x I
                                1000    L


Where 4.448 is a conversion factor Ibsf to kN and L is the
       1000
 length of barrier.



All rams used have not been calibrated. The ram efficiency

quoted is less than is attributable to the plston area.

There is an unexplained loss in force transmission.

Reasons for this are not understood and some doubts must

exist regarding the accuracy of the tabulated applied loads.

                   HEALTH AND SAFETY REPORTS SUMMARY


The 13th June 1989 Incident Report SMR/343/Z35/O!



This deduced barrier 124a had consisted of a continuous horizontal

wrought iron tube, the portion between supports 2 and 3 had

been bent to a permanent deflection of 133mm at mid span.

Section 3 to 4 had been bent to a maximum permanent deflection

of 200mm at mid span with a tensile strength of 365 MPa or

N/mm2 23.6 tons f per square inch and an elastic limit

estimated at 150 MPa 9.7 tons f per square inch.


Four vertical supports each made from two lengths of steel

angle joined at the top by a steel gusset plate, five of the

eight support feet reinforced by additional angle sections let

into the concrete steps, supports I and 2 with angle braces on

the rear legs. The tensile strength of the mild steel angle

was measured at 360 MPa 23.3 tons f per square inch and a yield

stress of 288 MPa 18.6 tons f per square inch.


The estimate of the total number of spectators was evaluated on

TOTAL           188.0             1015                (1576)

There was an assumed packing density of I0 spectators per

square metre identified in tests as the maximum achievable

without undue discomfort.
Examination of crush barriers IR/L/MM/89/II llth December 1989


The size of the sections for the supports was identified as

52mm (2") angles with a thickness of 6mm (I/4"). We measured

2" x 2" x I/4, SGS measured 49.5mm x 49.8mm x 6.1mm.



Each support leg had been flattened and shaped to form a foot

which had been positioned horizontally in the ground and bolted

to a base plate. Considerable thinning and loss of metal had

been observed in the vicinity. The thickness of the concrete

showed the terrace steps varying in thickness between 79mm

(3.11") and 141mm (5.55"). The concrete associated with the

original support feet varied between 180 (7.08") and 245mm

(9.65").


The newspaper found inside tube 2/3 was dated 24th October

1931. Up to 13 layers of paint were identified.


It was recognised that the tube I/2 was a low carbon steel with

an elastic limit of 282 - 301MPa and an rm (resilience maximum

or maximum tensile strength) of 488 - 499 MPa. The tube 3/4

was recognised as wrought iron with an elastic limit of 142 -

159 MPa and an rm of 371 - 358 MPa. None of the test pieces

exhibited a yield phenomenon.
NOTE

re = resilience elastique

rp = resilience proof

rm = resilience maximum


The low carbon steel tests on the legs of support 3 which did

exhibit yield phenomenon gave upper yield stress figures of 267

MPa and 308 MPa with rm of 343 MPa and 376 MPa.


Tube fractures were recognised in areas located under metal

straps where there had been significant corrosion.

Considerable subsurface corrosion of the supports played no

part in the collapse. Possibly explained by the raising of the

level of the terrace with concrete steps subsequent to the

corrosion occurring.


Collapse load calculations for barrier 124a IRL/ME/89/36 7th

February 1990



This evaluates collapsed loads for the "built in" span 2 - 3

and the "simply supported" span 3 - 4 as follows


                Original thickness     Corroded condition


2 - 3            12.3 kN/m              9.40 kN/m
3-4                  9.05 kN/m            8.11 kN/m



No collapse loads are reported in respect of the supports.


Corrosion reduced the load capacity of the rail by 25% and 6%

respectively.


A leaning crowd model based on step height, step width,

spectator weight and push height with the crowd on its toes

leaning forward Identifies pressures on the person in front

when subjected to pressures from behind


      The collapse loads for the rails with a crowd of 5.4/m2

      and the rail in the corroded condition on span 3 - 4

      would require a crowd depth behind the handrail of 7.5m.

      This would result in a load on the rail of 6 kN/m plus

      22% or 7.33.


It is appreciated and acknowledged that there appears no

previous work in this type of calculation and that caution

should be exercised in using the model. However, it appears to

me that with a crowd density of 5.4/mz the load from a leaning

crowd model is ] kN/m length of rail for each metre of

horizontal separation between barriers.


Investigation into the number of people in pens 3 and 4


                                 5
IRL/ME/89/32 18th December 1989



Photographs at 15.03 for pens 2 and 3, 14.52 for pens 2, 3 and

4 and 15.00 for pens 3 and 4 were digitised for the head of

every discernible person giving a count of 678 for the

occupants in pen 3 at 14.52 and 1408 at 15.03. An alternative

and preferred assessment of the number of persons based on the

number possible in the front row and the crowd packing density

of I0 persons per square metres gave a preferred estimate of

1576 which gives an overall density in pen 3 of 8.4 persons per

square metre.


Estimation of the maximum allovable capacities of pens 3 and 4

IRL/ME/89/35 31st January 1990



Pen 3 822 persons, pen 4 871 persons on the basis of

relevant reductions for maximum horizontal distances between

barriers, lack of radial gangways but crush barriers not

extending the full width. The figure was arrived at by

evaluating plan areas behind barriers extending either to the

next upstream barrier or the maximum horizontal distance

recommended in Green Guide table I column A. No modification

was made because of height.



                              6
Six departures from Green Guide recommendations were recognised

in respect of paragraph 92 terrace steps,

An investigation of the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane

An investigation into the number of p~ple entering the stadium

through turnstiles A to G and through Gate C IRL/ME/89/34 Ist

February 1990



The conclusion is reached that the number admitted through

turnstiles A to G was 7,494 and through Gate C 2,240, a total

of 9734 with a probable true total unlikely to have exceeded

I0,124.


Gate C was opened at 2.48 for 30 seconds


                         2.52 for 5 minutes 30 seconds

Examination of turnstiles

Examination of crush barriers


This document includes a description of a barrier test on 16th

April 1989 using the Eastwood and Partners rig and refers to

figure 12 in respect of deflections. It was apparently barrier

136 which was tested and a deflection of 16mm measured with

full recovery.


      Barrier 137 was also found to deflect 13mm on a 6 kN/m

      test load and recovered fully.


This load was then increased to 500 Ibs/ft run (7.3 kN/m) the

deflection was 20mm which gradually increased to 29mm and

recovered only to 11mm having failed. Initiation of

fracture/tearing had been produced at the central leg

immediately below the gusset plate and adJacent to the lower of

the two rivets in the rear section of the leg together with

commencement of twisting of the leg.


Barrier 128 had a tube bent outwards approximately 55mm and

downwards 25mm. Test load of 400 Ibs/ft run (5.84 kN/m) gave a

further deflectionâof the rail of 16mm recovered to 4mm

indicating a 75% recovery.


                             9
Two further applications of loads to 1.75 tons (7.3 kN/m) and

2.1 tons (8.76 kN/m) gave a deflection of 40mm and recovery to

13mm outside the recommended levels.

                  SGS MATERIALS REPORT SUMMARY



The SGS test programme has established the following evidence:-



II     BARRIER 124A MATERIALS


       Rail I/2, includifig the short 360mm insertion piece

       welded at support 2, has been manufactured from a low-

       carbon steel tube of seam-welded design, (either

       electric-resistance seam weld and normallsed, or solid-

       phase welded at high temperature)Â¯



 Â¯     Rail 2/3 and 3/4 consist of wrought iron tubing, this

       disclosure indicating the rails substantial age.



 Â¯     The leg supports (front and rear legs) have been

       produced from rimming quality mild steel angle section.



 Â¯     From the observation of the resident microstructure,

       the steel l.eg straps vary in carbon content between

       supports 2, 3 & 4, the latter comprising a medium/high
      carbon composition.



      The bends on the front leg sections of supports 2, 3 &
.

      4 appear to have been produced at elevated temperature

       when manufactured.



      There was no evidence of welding between the front and
,

       rear leg sections at the top and sides adjoining the

       gusset plates.



12   CORROSION



       In consideration of the corrosion which has taken place

       at specific locations on the barrier, the principal

       areas of attack relate to the leg support positions

       where a natural crevice would exist between the strap

       and the tube surface.



       Under such conditions, allowing water ingress and

       contact with unprotected surfaces, and in view of long

       period over which crevice corrosion has occurred,

       gradual thinning of the wall section has taken place.




                               2
The actual mechanism of corrosion appears to be from a

series of shallow pits; indeed this was implied from

the visual condition of both the outer surface of the

tubes and the bore surfaces, particularly at support 4

where water has entered the end of the tube and been

allowed to accumulate.



The relative resistance to water corrosion of wrought

iron is very muchdependent upon factors such as

electrolyte, method of manufacture, surface condition,

conditions of exposure etc but is regarded in one

source of reference (1) as at least the equal of mild

steel and in certain instances the superior material.



The leg sections have also sustained corrosion of

varying severity between supports, the locations

being:-



I.   The top of the front leg (under the rail)

2.   The gusset plate adjacent to the front leg

3.   The bottoms of the legs under terrace level

     and

4. Adjacent to the bottom strengthening angle plate



                         3
         Advanced corrosion resulting in perforation of the

         gusset plate on leg 2 was also observed and significant

         attack of one rivet head on leg No. 3



    13   BARRIER FAILURE



         Ultimately, with regard to the actual failures

         sustained by the rails 2/3 and 3/4 and leg supports 3 &

         4, all fractrographic evidence is consistent with

         mechanical overstressing; where brittle mechanisms of

         failure have been observed, these are attributed to the

         conditions under which the loading was applied or

         component configuration where brittleness would be

         favoured.



          racture of the wrought iron rails has eventually



0        fccurred at the reduced wall thickness at support

          oints 2, 3 & 4 as would be anticipated, but only after

         substantial plastic deformation and deflection of the

         rails. While wrought iron does not possess the

         ductility of mild steel, mechanical testing results

         confirm the material to show reasonable elongation

         values of 12 - 18% over a 50mm gauge length.

    PRELIMINARY



            Damage to crush harriers during Incident




    I.I       Only one crush barrier collapsed during the Incident
    on 15th April 1989. Thls barrier (No 124A) has been the

    subject of laboratory examination by the Health and Safety

    Executive which has shown that the failure Involved the
    collapse and fracture of supports Nos. 3 and 4 and the fracture

    of the horizontal tubular rail between supports 2, 3 and 4.

    The laboratory investigations have revealed that the fractures

    In the tubular rail developed In areas which had sustained

    severe wastage beneath metal retaining straps. The collapse

    of the supports involved bending and buckling of the legs and

    was aggravated by corrosion.



0   1.2       Although only one barrier collapsed, a number of

    other barriers appear to have been damaged either during or

    prior to the IncidentÂ¯ The nature and locatlon of these

    damages, as described below, provides further Insight into the

    condition of the barrlers on the West Terrace and the likely

    sequence of damage development In barrier 124A.
    1.3   Barrier 128




          i)     The tubular rail between supports I and 2 was

                  heavily bent In a forward direction.


          ii)    The rail appeared to have started to fracture

                 at the second support where It was retalned

0                 by a welded strap.



          III)   The rail was penetrated by corrosion at the

                  Ist support.



          Iv)    The trailing leg of the 2nd support had

                 started to fall below the bottom edge of the

                  gusset plate.

                      buckle.

0
    1.6       The damages described above reveal two main sources

    of weakness in the old-style barriers. The wrought iron rails

    possess inadequate strength and are further weakened by severe

    corrosion at the support positions. Where the barriers

    comprlse more than one bay, the central supports possess
Inadequate strength wlth fallure Inltlatlng In the tralllng leg

at the gusset lower rivet.



 1
          Previous Repairs



2.1       Inspection of the remalnlng old-style barriers

reveals that various repairs and renewals have been carried

out. These include:-



          I)      Replacement of original wrought Iron rall by

                  mild steel rall



          ii)     Replacement of rall retalnlng straps.



          III)    Reinforcement of bottom of legs due to severe

                  corrosion.




         Iv)      Weld repairs to tralllng leg to rectlfy

                  severe wastage.




         v)      .Plated reinforcement of tralllng leg to

                 rectify bending at gusset lower rivet
                 sustained during testing in 1983 (letter from

                 Eastwood to Club dated 29.8.85 refers).




         vl)     Renewal of complete support on one barrier

                  (131) by new style rectangular tubular

                 support.




2.2      The existence of the repairs demonstrates that the

Club and their safety advisers were aware of the corroded and

weakened condition of the barriers. The degree of damage may

have been more severe on some barriers than others. However

the number of repairs together with visual inspection of the

remaining WsoundW barriers should have revealed to a

responsible engineer that all of the old-style barriers were in

a debilitated condition and should have been replaced.     In my

opinion piece-meal repairs over an extended period of equipment

which was obviously in a deteriorated condition was not good

engineering practice.
          Damage to crush barriers preceding Incident
 .




3.1       The HSE investigation has pointed out that in

addition to barrier 124A, barriers 125 and 128 in pens 3 and 4

contained obvious corrosion holes in the tubular rail at end

supports. In addition, barrier 134 in pen No.2 has been found

to contain a corrosion hole in the rail at support No.3. Also

barrier 128A In pen No.5 contains a corrosion hole in the rail

at support No.3.



3.2       Several barriers exhibit severe wastage In the upper

part of the support, particularly In the area of the riveted or

bolted connection of the rail retaining strap to the top of the

forward leg.



3.3       On barrier 140, support No.3 has suffered pronounced

bending of the trailing leg at the gusset lower rivet together

with bending of the leading leg. The damage Is covered by an

adherent coating of palnt and obviously predated the Incident

on 15th April 1989.



3.4       The damages described above are obvious and should



                             6
have been apparent to the Club and their safety advisers before

the 15th April 1989. The presence of such obvious damage

should have put the Club on notice that the old-style barriers

were in a weakened condition and liable to fail if heavily

loaded.



3.5       The condition of support No.3 on barrier 140

demonstrates that on some previous occasion this barrier was in

imminent damage of collapse. Paragraph 39 of the Green Guide

specifies that "Following each event, a general visual

examination of the ground should be made for signs of damage

which might create a potential danger to the public .......

Crush barriers and balustrades should be examined for

deformation or any other signs of weakness". Either this

inspection was not performed by the Club or no account was

taken of the evidence of weakness in the barriers.




4.        Testing




4.1       The method of testing the barriers adopted by

Eastwood and Partners has already been commented on by Elrond

Engineering Ltd. The practice of discounting the permanent
deflection recorded on the first and second load applicatlon in

the series of three load applications was bad engineering

practice and gave a misleading impression of the strength of

the barriers.      In particular barrier 124A would have failed

the test if it had been conducted in a proper manner.



4.2          Previous deficiencies in the test procedure are

indicated by the test performed on 26 June 1990 which resulted

in the failure of barrier 123 which previously had been tested

by Eastwood and Partners and reported to be in a satisfactory

condition.



4.3          The Barrier Testing Record Sheets prepared by

Eastwood and Partners contain data which should have put a

responsible engineer on notice that certain of the barriers

were In a deteriorated condition, even if they satisfied the

load test requirement specified in the Green Guide. As shown

by the tests on the new-style barriers, not only should the

deflections under load be fully recoverable, but very similar

deflections should be recorded during each of the repeated load

applications. The occurrence of anomalously high deflections

such as those recorded on barriers 124A, 133, 136, 137, 138,

142, 143 and 144; the occurrence of less than I00% recovery on


                                8
unloading such as observed on barriers 124, 124A, 129, 136,

137, 138, 140, 141 and 144; and the occurrence of variable

deflections during repeated loading such as reported for

barriers 124A, 129, 131, 136 and 137, should have warned the

engineer responsible for the tests that o number of the

barriers were performing in an abnormal manner which demanded

further investigation. Had such investigations been carried

out, they would have revealed the weakened condition of the

barriers.

                  THEORETICAL EVALUATION OF BARRIERS

                        AN ELEVATION OF THE SUPPORTS




    1.0   The construction of the 1929 vintage barriers is


          a     a tubular straight horizontal rail

          b     strapped to supports and fixed with two nuts and

                bolts

          c     a cheek plate riveted twice to each of the legs of

                the support

                a Pear leg of 2" x 2" x I/4" angle with the forward

                flange cut short at the top

                a front leg of the similar section forged to a

                curve at the top the end matching into the rear leg

                cut-out

                the bottom of both legs concreted into the terrace

O               steps and the ash fill below



    2.0   The presumption is made that the top sections of both

          legs and the cheek plate act as a rigid section.




                                   2
    3.0   The resultant tensile force causes bending about XX and

          YY axes. The stresses are summated in Equation [I]

          below. The sectional area is reduced to allow for the

          rivet hole opening. No reduction has been made to the

          inertia about XX or YY axes thus giving a higher bound

          conservative solution.


          Combined Elastic       E           Pex Y            Pev X
          Stress =              An     +      Ixx       +      lyy

                             stress]         stress]         stress]



    4.0   There are four axes about which bending can take place,

          these are the XX, YY, UU and VV axes shown in figure LI.

          When the barrier is restrained laterally by the top rail,

          it has been presumed that no bending occurs around the UU

          or VV axes. Once restraint is released bending will

          tend to occur on the diagonal axes.


0         BARRIER 124A


    5.0   Mathematlcal analysls of the centre support on Cads

          Analyse programme was made in April 1990 using HSE (yield

          stress figures). This shows commencement of failure at

          a horizontal rail load of 5.25 kN/m [359 Ibf/ft] which is
          only 87% of the Appendix C test load of 6kN/m [411

          Ibf/ft]. The initial failure at the lower rivet hole is

          at the top of the rear leg under combined tension and

          bending.



    6.0   If the rear leg was able to sustain this loading there

          would be a failure of the front leg near to its top under

          combined compression (crippling) and bending at a

          horizontal force of 6 kN/m [411 Ib/ft].   If the rear leg

          has already failed the horizontal force required to cause

          front leg crippling is less than this figure.



    7.0      There are two further thresholds of failure at the

             bottom of the legs. These will occur at theoretical

             loads of 6.1 kN/m and 7.0 kN/m.



    8.0   The rail is theoretlcally capable of carrying up to 7

0         kN/m without fracture in bending.    However, the

          deflections under loads substantially less than this are

          considerable. Structural members such as this are

          usually limited by acceptabledeflections of no greater

          than 1/125th of the span.    In a 2.2m [7â-3"] rail the

           limiting deflection would be 0.69 inch or 17.6mm.



                                 4
9.0   Under a load of 5.25 kN/m the deflectlon of the top of

      the support is theoretically 2.36mm [3/32 inches].

O   2.2   The Engineer will need to clarify the brlef and its

          implications ....   To define the line of responsibility to

          reach definite conclusions and to state these clearly.



    2.3   No Engineer can avoid responslbllity for his actions.

          However, if the appraising Engineer states his oplnlons

          and advice clearly, gives the basis for these and can be

          seen to have acted wholly objectively and prudently, he

          should have no need to fear lega actlon against him even

          If his opinions are later proved wrong or hls advice

          unsound.



          The duty of care and professiona responsibllity of the

          Englneer practlsing the professlon whlch by Its nature

          demands some special sklll, ability or experience carries

          wlth it a duty to exercise to a reasonable extent the
          amount of skill, ability and experience which that

          practlce demands. Thls duty is owed not only to those

          partles wlth whom he has contractual arrangement, but

          also to all persons who are so closely or dlrectly

          affected by the negllgent act that they ought reasonably

          to have been foreseen as llkely to suffer from that act.

          formula and work back using first principles to find the

          assumptions made in its derivation. There is no absolute

          measure of adequate safety and even less of

          serviceability. There does however exist a generally

          accepted level of safety provided by design and

          construction in accordance with current Regulations and

          Codes of Practice. This level of safety should be used

          as a datum, but when assessing existing structures,

          engineering judgment should take precedence over

          compliance for the detailed clauses of Codes. The

          Engineer should .... be aware of his responsibility for

          public safety and decide whether to report factors or

          findings not covered by the original brief.


          The Collapse of a member that could lead to loss of life

          should be treated with an entirely different level of


                                2
            concern than structural distress merely affecting

            serviceability.


            When failures are investigated they are usually found to

            be caused by combinations of several factors. It is rare

            for failures to be attributable to shortcomings that

            would be shown up by a conventional design calculation.

e           This should be borne in mind when planning the

            calculation checks.


            For an existing structure with unchanged use, It is the

            magnltude of the existing deflectlons that is important

            and whether they are likely to increase. Care should be

            taken to distinguish between deflections caused by

            permanent load and those arlsing from fluctuations in

            imposed load.


    3.2.2    The structure should be visited to make o survey of Its
e           condition. It may be necessary to determine what

            loadings the structure has been subjected to as well as

            the intended or probable future loading. In the case of

            structural defects, damage or lack of serviceability, it

            will also be necessary to determine the nature of these

            sltuations and the parts affected. The condltion wlll
    first be assessed visually. Advice is given on this in

    Appendix 4. (as follows)


    Visible Defects Appendix 4 Structural Steelvork.



    Visible ~f~ts - excessive deformations resulting from

    distorted or buckled members. Possible Cause -

    overloading. Investigations Suggested - structure may be
O   unsafe, therefore assess conditions and give

    consideration to closure and temporary support; check

    original: original member design, existing load

    conditions, effectiveness of connections.


    Visible I~f~t - slight waviness or Iocalised buckling or

    bulging generally at or near points of support or

    concentrated loads. Possible Cause - local yielding due

    to overload. Investigations Suggested - check actual

    load, shear and bearing capacities.
O
    Visible I~f~t - poor appearance of welds. Possible

    Cause - unsatisfactory welding.    Investigations

    Suggested - test for adequacy.


    Vlslble ~f~t - hairlines or slight gaps on edges of

    materlal often revealed by flame cutting or near



                           4
            weldments. Possible Cause - lamellar tearing.

            Investigation Suggested - non destructive testing.


            Visible I~f~;t - corrosion. Possible Cause -

            environmental attack. Investigations Suggested -

            ascertain cause. Is sufficient sound material remaining

            to support the applied loading?

O
    3.2.3     The initial assessment. Checks should be made of the

            load carrying capacity of the structure and the margins

            of safety by calculation using the available information
            on actual loads and on the size and strength of the

            materials and components. In particular, the Inherent

            stability and the adequacy of the construction should be

            looked at. In these calculations it will be necessary to

            make assumptions about the distribution of loading and

            the strength of materials. Such assumptions should be
O           conservative.



    3.2.6     Load testing. Calculatlons should be carrled out to

            predlct as far as posslble the results before the tests

            are carried out. Thls Is to establish approxlmately the

            amount of loading requlred and the magnltude of



                                  5
            deflections to be measured. A calculation that predicts

            the result before the test Is carried out will also carry

            more welght than a slmller calculation performed after

            the load test.



    4.1.5     Survey condition. An Important pert of the survey is

            to determine the physical condition of the

o           constructlon ....   (vhich) ..... should be approached vith

            an open mind without prejudging the cause of any apparent

            defects slnce the complexlty of each structureâs hlstory

            prevents all posslble combinations of defects and their

            causes being defined.



    4.2.1 Requlrements for testing wlll arise where the presence

            of deterlorated or deleterlous materials is suspected.



    4.2.2     The Engineer carrylng out an appraisal wlll rarely
0           carry out the tests hlmself, but he should be present to

            observe and supervlse the work.



    4.2.3.2 Types of load test.


            (II) Overload test to assess safety. This Is a test In

            whlch the structure or part of the structure Is tested


                                    6
          under an overload to confirm that an adequate margin of

          safety exists under servlce loads. Where there has been

          no deterioration of the structural materials this test

          will not normally lead to collapse.



    4.2.3.4 Instrumentation. It is important to provide measuring

          devices at the supports as well as at mid span of

          flectural members in order to eliminate errors from
O         column shortening and bearing bedding in.



    4.2.3.5 Loading. To ensure that the desired loading

          conditions are obtained (thls) restraint should be

          minimised, for example by the use of ball seatlngs or

          rollers. Distrlbuted loadlng may be slmulated by using a

          number of jacks or by single jacks with load bearing

          spreader beams.



O   4.2.3.6 The load should be applled incrementally at a

          controlled rate without Impact. A full set of

         observations should be recorded at each increment, and

          graphs should be plotted of observatlons at crltical

          points on the structure as the test proceeds, to obtain an

         assessment of the response and the posslble onset of



                                7
    foilure. Once any non-Iineority is observed the

    structure should be unloaded end the recovery recorded.

    At this stage it may be desirable although expensive to

    unload end reload after every few increments. In ony

    cose o careful inspection of the structure should be mode

    at each increment of load end the progress of any local

    damage noted.

Appraisal of

existing structures




JULY 1980


The Institution of Structural Engineers
11 UPPER BELGRAVE STREET, LONDON SWIX 8BH
                 2 Procedure




          2.1    TERMS OF REFERENCE
                 The first stage is the receipt in writing of a brief from the client in which he states his
                requirements, dates for reporting and confidentiality. It is essential to find out at the
                start exactly what the client needs, how detailed the appraisal is to be and to what use
                the results are tO be put. An appraising engineer must recognize that he may be called in
                by someone who does not understand or define his problem. Thus it may fall to the
                engineer to develop his own brief, together with the cUent.
                The cUent will probably be in one of the following categories, each of which may require
                a different approach to the appraisal and a different type of report:
                          Â¯ government depariment
                          ,, national orporation
                         Â¯ local authority
                          ,, industrialist
                          s property company
                         s private owner
                         ,, corporate or private tenant
                         s architect, consulting engineer or other designer
                         Â¯ contractor or supplier
                        s civic group
                        Â¯ insurance company
     2.2 POINTS TO BE ESTABLISHED
                   engineer will need:
                         s to clarify the brief and its irnplications with the client and to state these in
                            writing with any qualifications. This should be done before accepting the
                            commission or as soon alter as is practicable. The client must know clearly
                            what is being done and on what he will get a report
                        s to define the line of responsibility especially when making an appraisal
                           jointly or on behalf of more than one party
                        s to isolate and state the factors that are centnd to the issue as soon as
                           possible and to let the chent know immediately when any new problems or
                           factors are found in the appraisal, giving, if appropriate, an interÂ£m report
                           and an updating of the brief.
                       Â¯ to state in general terms how he will proceed with the appraisal and what he
                           will aim to establish, and to work within these terms
                       ,, to agree the extent of the appraisal and to give the client an initial estimate
                           ufits cost
                      s to advise on whether other experts or ~g houses are to be employed
                           and, if so, how they are to be paid
                      s to establish the time avai/able
                      s to keep the client fully informed ofaU continuing fâmancial implicalions and
                          to get approval of any special expenditure (tests, scaffolding, etc.)
                     s to advise the client on the need to seek legal aclvice
                     s to reach definite conclusions and to state these learly in a written report;
                         s~-ommendations should be included in the report only if it has fâu-st been
                         agreed with the client that the~e are required.
    2.3     RESPONSIBILITIES
            No engineer can avoid responsibility for his actions. However, if the appr~ing
                Â¯
            engineer states MsÂ¯ optmons
                                   Â¯Â¯   and advice
                                                Â¯ clear/y, glves

            to have acted wholly objectively and prudently, he should have no need to fear legal
[           action against him even if his opinions are later proved wrong or his advice unsound.
          The engineer should:
                     Â¯ decide whether the brief is morally and pmfeuionally acceptable; de~le
                        whether to accept it, reject it or persuade the clie~ to alter it
                     Â¯ remnin objective 8t all th~es
                     Â¯ be aware of his re.spons~iHty for public safety and decide whether to report
                         factors or findings not covered by the original brief
                     Â¯ respect the reputations and feelings of othen involved; in particular to
                        avoid defamation by irrelevant or derogatory statements even ff this is
                        apparently in the clientâs interests
                     Â¯ avoid playing too safe in the appraisal or giving undue thought to personal
I                z
                        responsibilities ratherâthan the cfie~ntâs best interior
         A note by Lord Justice Graham on duty of care and profesalonal responsibility states:
         âIt is not poss~le nor appropriate.., to define duty of care and professional
I        responsibility in any detail. Apart from cases where there can be shown to be breach of
         conwact, this is a mm2er largely based on the Common Law v/ânegligen~, which is
         being developed from day to day by the Courts. The following are some general
         principles of the law, as it stands at present, which may help to clarify the position in

l        regard to negligence.
         Duty of care
         The professional person has a duty, just as much as anyone else, in the particular

[        circumstances to exercise reasonable care to avoid acts and omi~ions which ran be
         reasonably foreseen to be likely to cause physical or financial injury to persons or
         property. Negligence is failure to exercise that care.
        The practice era profession, art or calling which, by its nature, demands some special
         skill, ability or experience, carries with it a duty to exercise, to a reasonable extent, the
         amount of skill, abifity and experience which that practice demands. If a person
        professing to practise such a profession, art or calling fails to possess that amount of
        skill, ability and experience which is usual in that profession, art or calling or if he
        neglects to use the skill, ability and experience which he possesses or which is
        demanded or professed, he will be liable for breach of duty. This duty is owed not only
        to those parties with whom he has a contractual arrangement, e.g. by whom he has been
        employed or consulted, but also to all persons who are so closely or directly affected by
        the negligent act that they ought reasonably to have been foreseen as likely to suffer
        from that act.
        Duty of care thus arises where there is such proxinfity between two persons that the
        negligence of one is likely to affect the other injuriously.
        Liability for damages
        Liability attaches to negligence not only where it is the sole effective cause but where it
        is also a contributory cause of an injury.
        Negligence of a professional person thus gives rise to liability under Common Law in
        tort, apart from the more obvious liability for breach ofcontract. Where an employee is
        negligent, both he and his employer will normally be liable. A person who has been sued
        for negligence, although liable himself, may in some circumstances, be able to pass on
        his liabllty to someone else (e.g. an independent contractor or a professional man who is
    0   ~ually, responsible, for the particular negligem act).
        ~n all cases, it is for the courts to decide who, if anyone, is liable. The position in any
        given case will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of that case, and the
        taking of legal advice should be considered as soon as any serious question of liability
        seems likely to arise...
        Further information can be found in Halsburyâs Laws of England: Negligence (Vol.
        28), 3rd Edition, and 1977 Supplement.â

        REPORTING
        General considerations
        The writing of the report requires much careful thought, review and redrafling. The
        mea.~ing of each sentence must be examined critically. The report will ot~en be used by
        non-technical readers and lawyers, and it must therefore be simple and clear. At the
        same time it must be technically accurate and precise, and proper weight must be given
        to interpretation. Symbols and abbreviations must be generally understod or be given
        precise meaning to avoid confusion.
        The report should be logical, have continuity and be easy to follow. The contents must
        be relevant to the brief, nothing of importance should be left out or any unnecessary
        materials included. The report must be based on factual data and should be objectivein
        approach. Any reservations or limitations implicit in the method, technique employed
        or interpretations of results should be clearly stated.

THE PATH OF ASSESSMENT: THE FLOW CHARTS
Introduction
The process ofapprahal is cyclical as shown in the flow charts (see Figs. I and 2).
InÂ£onnation is collected and assessed. IÂ£the result shows that the structure is adequate
the process can stop there. Ifinconclusive more information can be collected, assessed
more thoroughly and so on. The action required should be taken in stag~, each stage
depending on the findings of the previous one.
The stages can be as given in clauses 3.2.2 to 3.2.6 below.

       Suggestions for this are given in sub-section 4.1 and Appendix 1.
       The structure should be vmted to make a survey of:ts condition (see Appendixes 2 and

                            type and quality of the materials may be relevant. Itmay also be
      necessary to determine what loadings the structure has been subjected to as well as the
      intended or probable future loading. This is partly determined visually or by askiag
     people, although some peopleâs statements need to be treated with reservation. Written
     confirmation of verbal statements should be obtained. In the case ofsuâucuual defects,
     damage or lack of serviceability it will also be necessary to determine the nature of these
     situations and the parts affected. The
     given on this in Appendix 4. condition will first be assessed visually. Advice is

    The initial assessment
    The information to hand should now be studied and analysed. Checks should be made
    of the load-carrying capacity of the structure and the margins of salâety by calculation
    using.the available inÂ£ormation on actual loads and on the size and strength of the
    materials and components. In parucular, the inherent stability and the adequacy of the
   construction should be looked at. In these calculations it will be necessary to make
   assumptions about the distribution of loading and the strength of materia/s. Such
   assumptions should be conservative.
   The first calculation will practically always be a simple conventional design
   calculation. This may lead to one of three possible conclusions:


                                                   14
            (i)The calcul~oas show that the ~ has an adequate nnu1~ of safety
                according to the relevant code of practice:
                If the engineer is satisfied that the Code recommendatkms m~ adequate for
                 the likely use of the structure, and if the visual examination of the
                 has not revealed any signs of distress, it should be necessary only to re-
                 check the assumptions to guard against gross error before prono~g the
                 s~cmm safe. The poss~ility of such modes of failure as fatigue or unseen
                 corrosion should be considered. If the structure however does show signs
                 of distress amore careful recheck of the survey and the cnlculation must be
                 undertaken.
           (ii) The calculations indicate that the stmcnu-e is grossly overloaded to the
                 extent that the calculated overall factor of safety is unity or less.
                  If the structure nevertheless is carting its load without any signs of
                  overstress and generally appears in good order the basis of the calculation
                  must be examined for error.
                  If the snvcture has been seen to be badly cracked, grossly deflected or
                  collapsed, the type of failure should be compared to that predicted by the
                  calculations.
           (iii) The calculations indicate a factor of safety greater than unity butless than
                  that recommended by the codes and the structure shows little if any
                  indication of overload.
                  In this case a revised calculation is called for using a refined mathematical
                  model that takes account of diverging (alternative) load paths and
                  secondary load-carrying mechan~ms.
    The flow charts (Figs. I and 2) indicate the general sequence that the process will
    follow and show the cyclic paths along which such assessments usuafiy proceed. They
    will not apply in toto to all appraisals and may not be complete for certain situations.
    They are, however, considered to provide to provide useful food for thought.
    There will obviously be occasions when deviations from the sequence will be
    beneficial. For example, when a member shows visible distress, a simple check on this
    member should be carried out fâ~st.
    Weak point are as common at connections as in members. Where the flow charts read
    âelementâ, this should therefore be interpreted as âmember and/or connectionsâ.


            [I] A mechanism is a system that, because of the disposition and number of
                members and/or the freedom of the joints to deform without increase in
                moment, is inherently unstable.
            [2] At this stage the check is for overall stabifity.
            [3] This is equivalent to the check for Building Regulations DI./and DIS
                 (âthe 5th Amendmentâ). These are legally applicable only to buildings of
                 over four storeys for which building regulation approval was sought after

                   the calculation indicates (possibly by inference) that the recommend-
                   ations of the relevant Code of Practice could be shown to be observed.
                   [2"] may depend on the outcome of some of the calculations referred to
                   under [4] and [5] and these latter are obviously repeated for each element
                   in turn.
              [6] A visit to the site should be made at this stage to confirm that the
                   parameters used in the calculations are realistic.

J                   prevent it buckling, then early yielding (say, as prerequisite for load
                    sharing) could deprive the possibly more essential compression member of
                    some of its lateral restraint.

              brick strength and mortar composition by sampling and testing, and one can assume
              that the 7m values include some inbuilt allowances for deviations from the design such
              as laying bricks âfrogâ down, cutting ofhorizontal chases and raking out of joints prior to
              pointing with su~ mortar. Detailed site information on this point may make some
              reduction of 7m acceptable.
              The very low stresses which codes of l~ractice allow in brickwork laid in lime mortar
             may be motivated by a requirement to limit the squeezing-out of the mortar and the
             resulting settlement of the brickwork in the period following the construction. This
             consideration is not relevant when assessing an existing building. The increase in stress
             that might be allowed is however difficult to assess in the absence of further
             information, such as may sometimes be obtained by sawing out large prisms of
             brickwork and testing them intact.

           increased, or to recommend remedial works.



3.2.5.4    Calculations requiring special consideration
           GENERAL "-
           While most engineering calculations do not in any way represent the real structural
           behaviour they do however in most cases, when used with the customary safety factors,
           result in structures that are safe and serviceable. Certain types of structural behaviour
          are however not amenable to accurate prediction by calculation so that safety factors
          used in calculations will not necessarily ensure safety. Unfortunately the types of
          failure that are most dilncult to predict accurately also tend to be the most sudden and
          therefore present the most danger to life.
          Perhaps the greatest danger is the use of a formula in a situation where it is not directly
          applicable. If the formula is obtained from a recognized code or standard there should
          be no danger provided that the formula is used exactly as intended in the document.
          Formulas from textbooks have usually been derived for idealized, simplified conditions
          and will give values applicable for those conditions only. The Euler formula, for
          example, will Five the exact elastic critical load for a straight pin-ended bar, but does
          not include parameters such as yield strength and initial bow which are necessary to


                                                               19
                      Â¯ Ifa Code of Practi~ or British Standard formula is used to check lmckling
                        does the accuracy of construction of the.sWucnmD corresponded to that
                        assumed in the Code or Standard?
            CONNECTIONS
            The rigorous analysis of connections is extremely ditficult~ and it is often only the
            ductility of most engineering materials that enable calculatio~ to give results that
           predict actual failure loads.
           Certain connections have to be checked for imposed displacements caused by
           temperature movements, foundation settlement, etc. This applies particularly when the
           connection is the âweakest link in the chainâ so that movement is concentrated at the
           connection.
           If, as is often the case connections are hidden, so that their condition cannot be fully
           ascertained by inspection, no reduction of safety factors should be conm~mplated.

          BOLTED CONNECTIONS
          Bolted and riveted connections should be checked to ensure that the fasteners are in
          good condition (e.g. not loose) and of a type and number adequate to transmit the
          service loading.
          High-strength friction-group bolted joints should also be inspected for satisfactory
          contact of the faying surfaces and absence of corrosion between them. A check should
          also be made with a torque wrench for the existence of adequate shank tension.

          WELDED JOINTS
          These should be checked to ensure that the welds are of a size and type adequate to
          transmit the required loads and inspected for cracking or other signs of deterioration.

3.2.6     Load testing
          The real behaviour of certain structural arrangements is sometimes not amenable to
          calculation. Ifa structure appears to be adequate but the caiculations at this stage fail to
          demonstrate an acceptable margin of safety, it may be worth while to:
                    Â¯ load test the structure within the elastic range to examine the manner in
                        which it actually distributes loading
                    Â¯ remove components from the structure to test to failure in the laboratory
                    Â¯ isolate pan of the structure and test it to failure
                   Â¯ test the complete structure under an overload.
         Advice on the decision as to testing requirements is given in sub-section 4.2.
         Calculations should be carried out to predict as far as possible the results before the
         tests are carried out. This is to establish approximately the amount ofloading required
         and the magnitude ofdeflections to be measured. A calculation that predicts the result
         before the test is carried out wil also carry more weight than a similar calculation
         performed after the load test.
         The procedure to interpret the test results should be decided before the tests are
         commenced so that the instrumentation can be arranged to providethe relevant data
         necessary for the calculations.
        If calculations to predict test results are based on Codes of Practice, partial factors of
        safety should be assumed equal to 1.0 and material strengths and stiffness adjusted to
        expected rather than minimum values.
        Load tests have the effect of reducing uncertainty. Safety factors ;n calculations
        subsequent to load tests can be adjusted accordingly. Care must be taken to ensure that
        only the correct pan of the safcty factor is reduced, e.g. ira water-retaining structure is
        filled with water and the induced stresses are measured accurately in various
        components then if there is no l~ossibility of a denser liquid ever being stored it could be
        argued that the factor "},f could be reduced to 1.0 for the assessment of those
        ~mponents.    This isand
          ing considered,     incorrect since "},falso
                                 this portion          has toremain.
                                               of "},f must   account for the importance of the limit
        There will be occasions when it is impossible to carry out reliable calculations or
        impractical to perform load tests to assess directly the level of safety of a structure. In
        such situations any other information that can lead to a conclusion regarding adequacy
        is of great use. Other data that could be used include:
                 Â¯ an estimate of the ratio between the maximum load taken by the structure
                    in the past and that likely in the future (== RI.,).
                 Â¯ an estimate of the ratio between the load at which signs of distress would
                    become apparent and the load to cause collapse (--Rs); if brittle failure is
                    possible then Rs must be taken as 1.0.

   TESTING
   Determination of testing requirements
  The requirements for testing will depend on the outcome of the survey.
  There is no need for testing where the survey provides sufficient information to enable
  the engineer to complete the appraisal and reach conclusions and reo~-,-*-a-~ons
  with confidence. This situation will occur where:
            Â¯ the suuctum is clearly in a sound condition without defects and the physical
               dimensions found in the survey edlow calculadous to confirm the suitability
               of the structure for its intended future use
           Â¯ ~ defects or the poor condition of the structure point to obvious
               conclusions that meet the requirements of the brief.
  Requirements for testing will arise in other situations where, for example:
            Â¯ there is a lack of information on what materials are present in the
            Â¯ the presence of deteriorated or deleterious materials is suspected.
  Where testing is needed it is necessary for the engineer to make an assessment of what
  further information is needed. The purpose of particular tests and the information that
  they can provide must be understood so that the fight tests are carried out.
 Available test teclmiques cover a wide range of cost and complexity, the engineer
 should proceed in a logical way. S~ne tests lead to Ettle disturban~. At the other exlzeme
 it may be necessary to remove the structure from service while tests are undertaken. In
 some circumstances the cost of tasting may be such that immediate remedial action will
 provide the most economfc solution. Appropriate experience may be necessary to see
 that some types of test are carded out successfully, and specialist advice may be needed
 to interpret the results.
 Types of test can be divided into those that give a local measurement of a dimension,
 material integrity or material condition, composition or property and those that give a
 direct indication of the performance of a structure or structural element. It is often
 necessary to use a combination of testing techniques.
Tests providing local measurement are described in clause 4.2.2 and Appendix 6.
 Since these tests are local it is necessary for the engineer to decide on the number of
tests and their locations so that representative samples are obtained. Usually there are
typical dimensions or material characteristics in structural elements. If not the
dimensions of the complete structure must be established, wkich can be used laterin the
appraisal. Minimum values or average values may be required. In either case, several
tests will be needed.
The numbers of tests and location will depend on the particular ~unstances and
should be decided by the engineer remembering that:
        (i) the l~ly variation in material properties within and between parts of the

       (ii)   the probable critical locations
              the posss~ole errors in the test procedureâ
       (iv)   different teclmiques may measure properties of different volumes, e.g. in
              concrete ultrasonic-lmlse-velocity measurements indicate the average
              quality through the depth whereas core tests measure to only 100-300 mm
              depth.
These factors will affect the consistency (scatter) ofthe results and hence the strength
obtained by standard statistical procedures, the confidence level appropriate to which
will increase with the number of results. Guidance on interpretation of the results of
tests which give an indication of strength is available in some cases (e.g. for concrete
structures see reference 9).
Tests that give a direct indication of structural performance are discussed in clause
4.2.3.

       ~aterials testing
               The engineer carrying out an appraisal will rarely carry out the tests himself, but he
               should be present to observe and supervise the work. Thus this clause does not give
               detailed information on test techniques but identifies the types of test that are available,
               what information they give, and their advantages and limitations.

              described (including non-desmtctive tests on material not removed from structure) can
              be carried out on a comparalively small sample of material. The largest pieee required
              is likely to be for a standard tensile test specimen. When it is possible to obtain only
             non-standard size test specimens (i.e. miniature pieces of different shape) the results
             must be carefidly considered since they may not be representative nor give a true
             indication of actual properties.
             Available test techniques are summarized in Tables I--5, with further details of the
             techniques in Appendix 6.

                            Where deterioration is apparent, the test may be used to assess the
                            working load corresponding to a required margin ofr~âety. When in~pient
                            failure can be recognized, i.e. ifthe mode of failure is sufficiently ductile, it
                            will not normally be necessary to continue the test so as to produce actual
                            collapse.
                            Static load test continued to collapse .
                           This test would be carried out on a mass-producod structure or structural
                           element, or on a part of a complete single structure, in order to investigate
                           the mode of failure or to obtain an estimate of the failure load of the
                           remaining similar structures or s" ctural elements. Any such estimate
                          must take account of the inherent variation between structures and the
                          variability of the strength of materials, arising from the processes of
                          manufacture and construction. Non-destructive measurements, as des-
                          cribed in clause 4.2.2 and Appendix 6, can assist in this.
                          Such a test may be carried out by isolating the structure or element and
                          testing it to failure in situ or by removing it to the laboratory. The choice
                          will be governed by relative costs and consideration of the practical

                          It is sometimes necessary to ascertain the dynamic beh=viour of a
                          structure or to assess its remaining fatigue life. The dynamic behaviour can
                          be assessed on the basis of measurements of v|âbration ampfitudes at
                          different frequencies in service conditions or under imposed dynamic test
                          loads. Fatigue life may be assessed, when many identical components
                          hnve been subjected to simi/ar fatigue loading, by removing a number of
                         components for fatigue testing to failure in a laboratory.
                         Alternatively, the stresses at the stress raiser in the component may be
                         calculated and the fatigue life estimated from data on specimens with the
                         same stress concentration factor.74                                           74. ESDU data item 74016. Fatigue and

                   (v) Soil testing
                        The identification and classification of the subsoil and the determination
                        of its strength and deformation properties aimed at assessing possible
                        causes of foundation failure is a specialist subject. Descriptions of

          The testing and acceptance clauses included in several Codes of Practice, e.g. BS 449,

          appraisal of existing structures. The engineer may refer to the testing clauses in the

          the smscmre being appraised. 7s.~

         representative responsible for the personnel engaged in the testing must be under the
        direction of this engineer. The engineer should fully inform the contractor ofthe nature
        of the work and ofthe quality ofthe personnel required for it. Casual labourers will not
       Â¯ nommily be suitable.
        Free-standing structures, e.g. unclad frames,must be stayed against lateral collapse.â
        Provision must be made to restrict movement at failure. This may be done with chocks
        or layers of timber, which can be removed progressively as the test proceeds.

       As the collapse load will usually exceed the safe capacity of the floor below this will
       have to be âpropped throughâ to the next and perhaps the third floor below. (Ifthe test

                                                                                             the products of corrosion

A5.4.5 Remedial measures
        In some situations, replacement of a damaged member may be the most practical and
        economic solution. Elsewhere, reinstatement will be justified in order to avoid
        inconvenience and loss or damage to other smmmral membett.
        Where new member, are conneated to exis~g one,, monolithic a~-tion must be
        etmured; this calls for careful preparation of the concrete uuâfae.ea and continuity of
        steel. For reinstatement, the removal of all loose friable concrete is essential, to ensure
        adequate bonding. Extra reinforcement should be fixed by experienced welders.
        New concrete may be placed either by casting with formwork or by the gtmite method~~
        with the latter it may be possible to avoid increasing the original dimensions of the
        member. The choice of method will depend on the thickness of the new ~, the
        surface finish required, the possibility of placing and ~ompacting concrete in the
        formwork and the degree of importance attached to an in~use in size of section.               ht~ây T~mi~l rqxm ao. 1 .~0 Lmdm~

        Large cracks can be sealed by injection of a latex solution or resin. Various washes or
        paints are available to restore the appearance of finely cracked or crazed surfaces.
        Further guidance is given in reference 91..An interesting analysh offire effects and
        design guidance is given by Kordina et arz.

 A5.5 ANALYSIS AND REPAIR OF STEEL STRUCTURES
        In general, a structural steel member remaining in place, with negligible or minor
        distortions to the web, flanges or end connections should be considered satisfactory for
        further service. The exception will be for the relatively small number of strncmres in
        cold-worked or tempered steel where there may be permanent loss of strength. The
        change in strength may be kssessed using estimates of the maximum temperatures
        attained or on-site tests; ifânecessary, the steel should be replaced. Microscopy can be
        used to determine changes in microstrucmre. Since this is a specialized field, the
        services of a metallurgist are essential.

 A5.6 ANALYSIS AND REPAIR OF BRICK STRUCTURES
        It will be possible to determine from the colour change of the mortar or of the bricks
        themselves the degree of heating of the wall. For solid brickwalla without undue
        disto~on the portion beyond the pink or red boundary may be considered as
        serviceable and calculations made accordingly. Perforated and hollow brick walls
        should be inspected carefully for the effects of thermal shock and may need
        replacement. Plastered bricks sometimes suffer little damage and may need replace-
        ment of the surface treaunent only.

 A5.7 ANALYSIS AND REPAIR OF TIMBER STRUCTURES
        BS 5268: Part 4: Section 4.1 can be usedto analyse the residual strength of members
        that have been subjected to a fire. Generally, any wood that has not charred could be
        considered to have full strength. It may be possible to show by calculation that a timber
        section or structure which has been subjected to fire still has adequate strength once the
        affected surfaces are cleaned off(by planing, sanding etc.). Where additional strength is
        required it may be possible to provide this by gluing on strengthening pieces or
        otherwise replacing lost strength. Joints that may have opened and metal fixings that
        may have conducted heat to the interior are points of weakness that should be carefully
        examined.

 A5.8   TEST LOADING
        Analysis ofthe damage and assessment ofthe necessary repairs may be possible within
        a reasonable degree of accuracy, but final acceptance may depend on proofby load test.
        Performance is generally judged in terms of recovery of deflection after removal of the
        load.

  T2.q Drillings and spectrographic analysis--âspotâ tests
  These tests will enable material composition to be ascertained. A small amount of
  drillings can usually be taken from non-~itical areas in most steel plates, sections and,
  with care, even rein/âorccmenL These can be submitted/âor ~ chemical analyais by wet
  methods, or for selective analysis by spectn~raphy.
  In sire âspotâ tests of an elementary nature can sometimes identify some elements, but

  T27 Wrought iron and cast iron
 The presence of" wrought iron and cast iron should be expected in all 19th Century
 structures. The structural use of" these materials ~hed with the introduction of
 steel in the 1880s and effectively ceased by the 1930s.
 (a) Wrought iron
 Although not easily distinguishable chemically from a low-carbon steel, wrought iron
 may readily be identified by its characteristic laminated structure. If a small patch is
 ground on the surface to remove scale and expose the clean metal, which is then
 polished with fâme abrasive paper, the filaments of slag, which are visible through a hand
 magnifying F/ass, will identify the material as wrought iron. In longed elements -- such
 as clevises, brackets, eye-bars -- the direction of the lamination should be checked to
 identify areas in which tension stress occurs normal to the plane of lamination.

 Forge welding was a common practice in fabricating structmâal elements. The presen~
 of welds in, for example, eye-bar ends, large bars with threaded ends, orwhere there is a
 marked change in section, should be suspected and non-desuâuctive tests made to verify
 the soundness of the weld. As the laminations of wrought iron constitute internal flaws,
 crack detection techniques are of little use in determining its integrity. Visual
 examination, if possible supplemented by tension test samples, must be used. The
 surfa~ of the sample should also be examined for stamp marks that identify its quality.
 (b) Cast iron                            "
 Cast iron may sometimes be identified by the apcarancc on its surface of evidence of the
 casting process-- sand marks, mould joints. The reaction of the metal to cutting with a
 sharp file will normally distinguish it from steel. It may also be identified by drilling,
 which will result in fragmented swarf. Beams with unequal flanges, or of unusually thick
 section, should be suspected as being made of cast iron.
 Cast-iron members must be examined for cracks and for soundness (i.e. casting defects)
 by any of the NDT methods previously described. Additionally, dimensional accuracy
 (e.g. constancy of wall thickness) should be checked.

 T28 Cables
  The comments below refer to structural cables and not to those used in lifting gear or
  other mechanical equipment,
Â¯ If the original specification is available a check should be made to see if the cable was
  prestretched (normally by the manufacturer). Subsequent stretching in service, which
  may be checked by measuring the sag or alignment of adjacent structural elements and
  comparison with the original design, will normally indicate significant damage.
 Appraisal is generally by visual examination, bearing in mind that:

           0"           damage is most likely to occur at the ends (terminations), the
                        outer wires generally failing before the inner ones

COMMENTARY


RIBA EVIDENCE



This highlights at paragraph 18 the suggestion that there

should have been at least one turnstile for each 1,000

spectators. Even that on the basis of 750 persons per hour per
turnstile still leaves the 10,100 spectators for the West

Terrace an hour and 20 minutes to gain access at a free smooth

flow.


Paragraph 17 considers the prime cause of death was due to

overcrowding. However, the estimate of capacity in paragraph

18 on the basis of 5.4 persons per square metre was 2,000 for

the central pens. These numbers are closely related to the

number of persons shown in the relevant photograph as being in

occupation at kick off time. Thus, the overcrowding issue is

not as great a significance as the failure of the barrier 124a.

This is a subject whlch Is not addressed.


The subject that is addressed is that It is necessary if there

is to be fencing between the spectators and the pitch, then

there should be the opportunity for the fence to be opened

quickly. In other words, a proper means of escape.
 Evidence to the


HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

June 1989


INTRODUCTION


      The Secretary to       the Inquiry wrote on behalf of the Rt Hon Lord
      Justice Taylor to       the Secretary of the Instituteâs Building Control
      Committee on the       23 May 1989 inviting the submission of written
      material.


2.    Lord Justice Taylorâs terms of reference were stated to be:


      "To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on
      15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
      control and safety at sports grounds."


      The .CÂ°mmittee, Chairman Sydney E Bell, Dip Arch (Birm) RIBA, Acting
.

     County Architect Nottinghamshire County Council, met at the RIBA on 8
     June 1989.       It had before it the Secretaryâs letter dated 23 May 1989
     and general      plans and sections of the Sheffield Wednesday ground at
     Hillsborough     which had been provided through the Secretaryâs office.
     The Chairman subsequently went to look at the ground and whilst unable
     to gain access was able to look at the external spaces around the
     ground.        The capacity figures for each stand have been obtained from
     the Club.

.
     We are aware of thegeneral background to the disaster as reported by
     the news media but not of detailed evidence provided to the inquiry
     and our evidence is therefore limited to observations on the planning
     layout and detail design considerations which may have influenced the
     course of events and suggestions on how these considerations might
     affect decisions in the future so as to prevent a recurrence.
 SPACE OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND ENCLOSED AREA


 5.    We consider the fundamental cause of the disaster to be due to
       overcrowding.     By overcrowding we mean the number of people within a
       confined space are in excess of the maximum number that space is
       designed to hold safely.        Overcrowding in any space can be a
       distressing experience for some people but rarely leads to multiple
       fatalities, nevertheless movement can create local pressures and lead
       to people being crushed.      Where however the floor of the space is
       sloping" or stepped the force of gravity will increaseâthe pressure
       exerted by a crowd on those people at the bottom of the slope. The
       greater the depth of the slope, i.e. from pitch to the back of the
       crowd, the greater the potential pressure.         Crush barriers are
       therefore frequently "introduced to try and reduce the build up of
       pressure.


6.     We look at four aspects of crowd control in this paper. First,
       admittance to the ground;     secondly, admittance to any enclosure;
       third, communication and fourth, general safety considerations.


7.    The Sheffield Wednesday ground at Hillsborough, like many other club
      grounos situated in an urban environment, is in a builL-u~ a~ea
      surrounded by residential housing, main and residential roads. The
      ground is hemmed in by the surrounding development and whilst the
      pitch and stands are of a high standard befitting a club of the
      stature of Sheffield Wednesday the surrounding space outside the club
      ground is inadequate to provide for the effective supervision and
      marshalling of large crowds of spectators.


8.    In particular, while turnstiles serving the North Stand, Spion Cop and
      the whole of the South Stand are dispersed along a length of 400m; the
      turnstiles serving the remainderof the North Stand and the whole of
      the West Stand are all contained within a length of 40m. Furthermore
      the width of the access from Leppings Lane is only 22m and the depth
      of space in front of the turnstiles to the road edge is only in the
      order of 25m.




                                                                                 5
      The dispersal of turnstiles on the east and south boundaries of the
 .

      ground does provide some space to marshal the crowd but even here
      space is limited, particularly adjacent to Penistone Road North where
      the pavement is only 5m wide and the road must become obstructed by
     spectators.


i0. At the Leppings Lane entrance the confined area does not provide any
     space where orderly queues at the turnstiles can be formed and would
     appear to provide no opportunity for thee police to exercise any
     effective control.      For example, 23 turnstiles admitting I0 persons
     per minute would admit 230 people in 1 minute. Ten minutes queuing
     time would result in a crowd outside thee turnstiles of 2,300 which in
     the space available means they would be packed as tightly as a
     capacity crowd on the terrace. These turnstiles serve half the North
     Stand and the West Stand and terrace with a capacity of 19,416. It
     therefore would take 1 to 1.5 hours to admit all spectators.


II. The latest edition of the Home Office âGuide to Safety at Sports
    Groundsâ is an excellent publication but only makes brief reference in
    para 46 to the need to have contingency plans to deal with situations
    where available entrances at a ground have proved insufficient to stop
    unduly large crowds from gathering outside. No guidance is given to
    what external space outside turnstiles is desirable and where space is
     inadequate.     It would be difficult to imagine what those contingency
     plans could be.


12. The handbook of âSports and Recreation Building Designâ published by
     The Sports Council states "As pedestrian traffic approaches the
     stadium there is much to be said for segregating it from vehicular
     traffic and immediately surrounding the building there should be a
     clear circulation so as to allow spectators to walk unimpeded around
     the entire stadium. Clearly visible from this ambulatory there should
     be regularly spaced turnstile positions, sufficient in number to admit
     at a rate fast enough to avoid large admission queues and yet slow
     enough for the comfortable distribution of spectators within the
     ground." .... "If site dimensions inhibit an external ambulatory, it
     should be incorporated within the perimeter of the stadium." The




                                                                               4
    Hillsborough ground does not fulfil those conditions and we believe
    the selection of this neutral ground to be unfortunate. In defence of
    those who made the decision we must say that they may have had little
    alternative and that conditions surrounding other venues might have
    been equally bad.


13. We would recommend that games with this emotional content should only
    be staged at venues where there are adequate ~ccess and facilities to
    enable effective crowd management to be obtained. For example, The
    Sports Councilâs handbook refers to the close proximity of a railway
    station and coach parking. Provision for car parking (on street or in
    parks) within a reasonable distance, the ability to obtain access to
    the entire perimeter of the enclosed ground and the dispersal of
    turnstiles around the perimeter adjacent to the particular stand or
    enclosure they serve.


14. Few existing grounds are likely to meet these criteria and if they are
    not available we suggest that a number of regional football stadia may
    need to be provided in suitable locations where major football events
    could be staged.     We do not recommend multipurpose stadia because
    provision for other sports, and particularly athletics, reduces the
    ~a~# of experienc~ that a good r^~.~.~1 s.~,,~ ~o...~,,~o          T~
    does not inhibit the use 6f the stadia for other activities including
   pop concerts, megastores and specialised supermarkets which could use
   many of the same facilities.


15. Although we are advocating the use of stadia which meet the necessary
   criteria for crowd management for special events we do not see a
   wholesale need for clubs to move from their current sites. The police
   should advise clubs of the size of crowd they can effectively control
   outside the ground and this should be an additional criteria in
   determining a groundâs capacityâ- this may necessitate some clubs with
   a large following moving to more appropriate accommodation and some
   events which will attract a larger than normal crowd being staged away
   from the home ground.


[6. These first set o~â observations a~âc principally concerned with space
    ?u~sJde the e~ic]osed area or the ground and stands. We would now ilke
     to comment on the control of crowds in terms of access to terraces and
     grandstands.


 ADMITTANCE TO ENCLOSURES


 17. In our view the prime cause of death on the west central terrace was
     due to overcrowding, i.e. an excessive number of people having
     obtained access to the ground were able to gain uncontrolled access to
     the prime viewing spot behind the goal.


 18. The âHandbook of Sports and Recreational Building Designâ recommends
     one turnstile for each 1,000 spectators and that turnstiles should in
     addition control the dispersal within the ground.              It further
    recommends that standing spectators should be divided into pens with a
    capacity of about 2,000 and that each pen should have its own pair of
    turnstiles and exits to the perimeter. The capacity of the central
    pens on the west terrace is of this order (i.e. 370m2 x 54 persons/10m
    = 2,000).        However,    there is no separate control to this section at
    Hillsborough     and the     turnstiles would appear to allow considerably
    more people      into an     area which serves several enclosures. In that,
    the ground does not conform with good practice.


19. We would agree with the recommendation in the handbook by the Sports
    Council -      and with that contained in paragraph i01 of the âGuide to
    Safety at Sports Groundsâ that access to any compound or section of
    stand should be independently controlled. This should be done so as
    to count the number gaining entry to any compound and stop access once
    capacity is reached.        It is possible to control access to the ground
    separately from access to individual enclosures and tickets can be
    collected at either point.         Individual enclosures should, however,
    ideally be equipped with toilet facilities at the minimum and
    refreshment facilities are also desirable.


20. The provision of individual seats is another way of exercising control
    on numbers and we would recommend seated provision be expanded as more
    in keeping with modern life-styles but not to the exclusion of all
   standing provision.          As control in the form we are suggesting will
   cost money it may be acceptable in existing grounds to impose it only
   in the most popular areas where pressure on space is always high.


                                                                                   6
 COMMUNICATIONS


 21. The third issue on which we would comment is that of communication.
     Emergencies happen quickly.     It is difficult for people outside a
     crowd to reallse that a serious emergency is developing. The police
    outside the ground, in the crowd, realised they had an emergency and
    took some action.     To our knowledge no one in authority was in the
    crowd in the enclosures and we suggest that consideration should be
    given to stewards with radio communication being placed in the most
    popular" enclosures to monitor the situation and keep ground control
    informed.


22. Most grounds have public announcement facilities and in our view this
    is a tool which if used effectively could help in most emergencies. A
    large crowd will react with sympathy if they know what is happening
    and instructions can be given to a large number of people, including
    officials, very quickly    by effective use of the public announcement
    facility.     Time is of   the essence - it only takes 3 minutes for
    someone to suffocate.      The requirements of a good communications
    system is set out in the âGuide to Safety at Sports Groundsâ
    Effective communication is, however, not an end in itself - it is an
    ~id to effective management.       The guide sets o,t the d,,t~ ~nd
    responsibilities of management in Chapter 2. The guide however does
    not lay enough stress - in fact it hardly mentions - the need to have
    someone in total management control once spectators have entered the
    ground until they have all left. The manager is responsible not only
    for the game but also the ground, staff and all spectators, he must
    have the ability to appraise a situation, make (often unpopular)
    decisions quickly and above all give instructions as they are
    necessary.


23. On detailed design matters, not having been inside the ground, we have
   little comment.      If the crush barriers were of adequate strength we
   would have expected them to have prevented the crowd pressure that
   resulted in so many deaths.       Medical evidence might be useful in
   ascertaining if the crush barriers were of safe design or if they were
   the cause of some injuries.
 GENERAL SAFETY


 24. We must express some concern about safety at football grounds. There
     is always a conflict between security and safety but safety should be
     paramount.    Whenever an emergency occurs in a football ground with so
    many people there is frequently only one safe space to go to and that
    is on the pitch. The current practice on so many grounds of erecting
    fencing between the crowd and the pitch creates a hazardous situation
    whenever an emergency occurs and we deplore the practice. Emergencies
    can take many forms -         fire, bomb scare, structural failure, maniac
    behaviour, or overcrowding - all require the quick movement of people
    away from the danger.


25. If no other way can be found to prevent pitch invasions than fencing
    (and there must be better ways in the interest of football) it must be
    possible for 50 to 100% of that fence to be opened quickly in an
    emergency.     The operation can be by a number of means but local
    pressure sensors and both local and remote automatic release should be
    possible.     Other forms of barrier which prevent escape onto the pitch
    should also be avoided.


26. It is easy to be wise after the event but we believe %he available
    space outside the       ground was such that the police had an impossible
    job in trying to        control the crowd there.      Lack of control of
   spectators inside    the ground led to overcrowding of the central pens
   and the fence erected to prevent access to the pitch by the crowd was
   the reason this emergency turned into a disaster.


27. We would recommend that research should be carried out to establish
   what space is desirable for marshalling crowds outside turnstiles and
   standards determined.       These would be a further limitation on ground
   capacity and this should be included in the âGuide to Safety at Sports
   Groundsâ.

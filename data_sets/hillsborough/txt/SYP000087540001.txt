they also        believed there had been an                invasion of the         pitch,    shouts

of    "GET THE BAS TAR DS LOC KE D UP, GET EM OFF THE G R O U N D . "

Some Notts        fans   started to        climb up perimeter            fencing,    waving     fists at

Live rpo ol      fans.     Cha nting      obscenities.

After    being     in position only a few minutes                   I became aware of fans

being    carried out of the ground on stretchers                         (advertising       boards)    by

police and fans.            Notts    fans    jeering at       sight of       injured being         carried

off.

I then noticed that           some of the          bodies    had    coats    over their      faces,    and

I realised that there had been some fatalities.

Yo ut h from Liverpool            fans    ran up full       length of       pitch with no shirt

on.     Stood     infront of goal mouth started waving                      his fists at Notts

fans,    shouting        obscenities,       either       drunk or very emotional.             S p o k e n to

by other        officers and       returned to far side of ground.

I spoke to some of Notts                 fans mai nl y middle aged,            nearest    to fence

said that        it was app are nt        that   there were a number            of Liverpool        fans

injured and not           just a simple          pitch invasion.           This a p p e ar ed to    calm

some of the older more              reasonable          fans who tried to pass           the wo rd on

to fans        further    back.     But Notts       fans    continued to jeer as more

injured were        stre tch ere d out of the ground,                fighting     broke     out between

Notts      fans as        some who had realised the si tuation were upset by the

actions          of these fans.

Notts      fans      started to calm down stopped shouting,                           and some    came

forward to perimeter                 to offer assistance.              Some were trained            1st

aiders and a l lo we d onto               the   pitch.     Some worse for drink              to be of any

use to any one and were                  refused access          to   pitch.          A number    of Notts

fans all          upset a p p a r e n t l y   caught    up in the emotio n and heat                of the

day.      Together with other officers                    carried them through gate                 in fence

on perimeter and a d m i n i s t e r e d           1st aid,      no serious           injuries.

Wh e n   I looked across             at the Leppings Ln end I saw a line of police

officers across              the full wi dt h of the            pitch.

Jo i n e d on perimeter            track      by dog handlers,         but by this         time    the Notts

fans     seemed to be aware              of the situ at ion and had               calmed down.

More     bodies were          being     carried out on stretchers.

Al t h o u g h    I did not note the time but                  I saw a Su pe ri n t e n d e n t with a

loud hailer           speaking       to the Notts        fans.    Ex pl a i n i n g    that Liv erpool      fans

had been          injured and        requesting        their    co-operation.

I was also aware              that    there was a public an no un ce me nt                over    the addres s

system by manager of Liverpool                     K e n n y DALGLIESH.

                     ON BEING APPOINTED TO EXAMINE EVIDENCE
               WITH REGARD TO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER


 I have very little to add to the statement made this afternoon by the Home Secretary in

 the House of Commons.


 My enquiry will not take place in public.


      shall be examining the evidence which it is said was not previously available at Lord
     Taylor's enquiry, or to the Prosecuting or Disciplinary Authorities. I shall have regard to
     representations which have already been made and which are made to me in writing.


     I shall then consider whether it is necessary to hear oral representations.


     In due course I will let those who are involved know where to send their written
     representations and such arrangements, if any, as will be made for oral representations.

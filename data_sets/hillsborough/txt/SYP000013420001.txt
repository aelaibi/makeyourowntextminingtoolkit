9th May 1989.

Liverpool Football Club/
Anfield Road,
Liverpool.4.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough.

I attended the match with my employer, his son and
my friend,              My friend and I had tickets for
the standing area in the Leppins Lane end and we reached the
ground at approximately 2.05. There was no crush whatsoever
and we went through the turnstiles, and the first thing
that struck us, after we passed through the turnstiles,
was that there was no steward or policeman to direct
us where to go. We quite naturally made our way through
the tunnel on to the central area. The area was very
crowded at the back, but we were able to get to the
front where there was plenty of room. We actually sat down
on the terracing.

After approximately 10 minutes we realised that the
centre area was getting very crowded and we noticed a
gate in the fence between the centre area and the area on
our left. The gate was at the back of the standing
area, and we decided to see if it was open because we
could see plenty of room in that left wing area. It
was open, and we passed through into the left wing area,
at approximately 2.20. My friend and I had agreed that
if we had stayed where we were it was going to be
uncomfortable.
                                                continued..

There was certainly no indication of the horror which
was to come.

At about 2.55 we did realise how bad it was. People were
climbing the fence at the front of the central area and
a little later on, after the game had actually been
stopped, we noticed the gate through which we had passed
was now shut. Whether it was locked or not I have
no idea. Nobody tried to climb over the fence
between the two standing areas and it was apparent that
the very bad crush was all in the middle and at the
front.

My friend and I stayed where we were until the game was
officially abandoned and then we left and re-joined our
colleagues.

Yours faithfully,

At   1453 hours            I went w it h other                  o ff ic e rs to The Gate         public     house as

a result          of a report           of fighting              inside.

These     premises          were       locked and e ntry was                   gained wit h some

difficulty.             Upon        enterin g     the      lounge        I saw that        it was    full    of

football          s up p o r t er s    s upporting         red an d white             colours.      The atmos ph er e

was hostile and a                   lot of them were                  heavily     drunk.      The L a n d l o r d was

approached           by PS S he rr a tt and the                      persons     present were       r eq uested to

leave the          premises and the L a n d l o r d was                       requested to       close the bar.

there             still     a number            of Li ve rp oo l    farts still making          their way, to

the gratiAd.

About     1515 hours          the        street was       r e l at i ve l y quiet and we        liaised with

our    commander         Ins p ec to r Townend.

Suddenly        I noti ce d a sudd en surge                  in the Police a ct iv i ty a ro u nd the

g r o u n d and     could hear            constant       radio     traffic    from PS S h e r r a t t ’s

radio,      but at this             time     I c o u l d n ’t quite make out what was

happening.           We then            pro ce e de d along P e n i s t on e Road to the             ground

e n t ering    via the         large       gates a dj ac e nt       to turn st il es ,77 arid 88.              It

was    there      that I saw two a m b ul a nc e s               parked     in the    corner        close    to the

corner      of the S p i o n Kop.                There were        two    persons    being    dep os it ed

beside      these am b u l an ce s,             both covered and a pp ea r ed dead.

We were       then d i r e c t e d        to the       pathway     into the Spiori Hop an d            it was

there     that      I was a p p r o a c h e d       by a number          of Notts.    Forest        s upporters

who    offe r e d their            services.           At this     time    I was    still    not     quite    sure

e x a c t l y what was        ha p p e n in g     other than        seeing    the two dead           persons and

i nf ormed that          others          were    injured.

Wit h memb e r s       of our Serial              I then went        w ith these v ol un te er s        to the

there     that      I saw total            chaos,      a number      of bodies were          being     carried

became      full      of bodies and               injured    persons.           This    area was      still

heavily       c o ngested w i t h g rieving               relatives        searching       for    their        friends

ambulances          nearby.

Inspector Barker                 took    charge      of the situation.                 I was   del eg at ed      on a

RE; Hillsborough incident


On Saturday 15 April, 1989, I was on duty in company with other Officers
involved in duties at the FA Cup Semi Final Football match at the Hillsborough
Stadium, Sheffield between Liverpool FC and Notts. Forest FC. I was detailed
in Serial No. 34, a Serial which contained 8 Police Constables including
myself , PS 2248 Sherratt and Inspector Townend in command.

At 10.00 hours we all attended a briefing in the grounds Northstand.

At 11.00 hours Serial 34 and 35 were briefed by Inspector Townend.

At 11.15 hours our two Serials took up positions on Claywheels Lane
and there PS Sherratt instructed my Serial in their duties which were to
instruct each individual supporters coach which arrived to drive to the
far end of that lane and return and park for an easy exit facing out of
Claywheels Lane. Each bus was then parked in convoy along the nearside
kerb. My Serial then met the supporters on each coach, welcomed than to
Sheffield , informed than that they were to leave any prohibited articles
on the bus , informing than that they would be searched on entering the
ground and requesting than to make their way to the ground as soon as possible.
I myself carried out a number of these warnings, they were done in a friendly
manner and responded to warmly by the supporters. The buses which arrived
eventually filled the whole of Claywheels Lane. In my view this section of
supporters , although it was apparent that some had been drinking, were well
behaved and in good spirits. However, some of these fans had obviously
arrived without tickets for the match as they were going round fans leaving
the buses asking if there were 'any spares'.

At 13.45 hours Claywheels Lane was completely full of supporters' buses and
PC 3234 Cobb informed me she had recorded a total of 52 buses and 2 mini buses
at this location.

At 14.25 hours we were further deployed to the junction of Claywheels Lane
with Penistone Road North/Halifax Road.

We positioned ourselves outside the Public House situated on that corner
namely 'The Gate' public house. Our duties were defined as supervising the
arriving fans who were walking down Halifax Road towards us.

PS Sherratt instructed my Serial to form a filter lane of officers along
this pavanent and the pavanent on the opposite side of the carriageway and
requested us to inform any supporters passing this position that alcoholic
drinks should be left there and taken no further.

As I arrived at this location and took up this point I could see a good distance
up Halifax Road and as far as the eye could see I saw that there was a
continuous flow of Liverpool Supporters in groups approximately 10 abreast on
both sides of the carriageway coming towards us.
Re:   Hillsborough incident



The majority of these supporters were males in the lower age bracket, it
was very apparent to me that a large amount of alcohol had been consumed
by the vast majority of these men.

A large number of than were still drinking on their way towards the ground
and a large number of than were halted and asked to leave their intoxicants
at this location.   Some of than left their drinks .others insisted on
consuming than at this location. These drinks consisted of a variety of
canned beers and lagers. The whole of the wall outside The Gate public house
became heavily littered with these objects.

Generally these supporters were all of good behaviour, they were drunk but
not incapable or unduly disorderly.  It was apparent to me fran the time I
commenced my position at this location how late these thousands of drunken
Liverpool supporters had left it to go to the ground in such a mass hoping
to get into the ground before the commencement of the game.

I knew that there was little likelihood of than being there for the kick-off.
I felt it hard to understand why these persons should travel so far to allegedly
support their team and then (a) leave it far too late to get to the ground and
(b) be in such a drunken condition so as not to be able to fully appreciate
the match from the obtained admission.

This heavy mass of persons continued without any significant gaps appearing
until about 15.10 hours.

At 14.55 hours I went with other officers to The Gate public house as a result
of a report of fighting inside.

These pranises were locked and entry was gained with some difficulty. Upon
entering the lounge I saw that it was full of football supporters supporting
red and white colours. The atmosphere was hostile and alot of them were
heavily drunk. The Landlord was approached by PS Sherratt and the persons
present were requested to leave the pranises and the Landlord was requested
to close the bar.

I ascertained that there had been a fight inside these pranises where stools
had been thrown . The fight was between different supporters groups.    No
injuries were apparent and no complaints were received. A number of Liverpool
supporters had to be escorted from the area as they were wanting to return
inside the public house and perhaps cause further disorder.

Our Serial then returned to its static point and continued to marshall the
supporters. The passage of fans had now thinned but there was still a number
of Liverpool fans still making their way to the ground.

About 15.15 hours the street was relatively quiet and we liaised with our
commander Inspector Townend.




                                                                    cont'd
Re: Hillsborough incident


Suddenly I noticed a sudden surge in the Police activity around the ground
and could hear constant radio traffic from PS Sherratt's radio , but at this
time I couldn't quite make out what was happening. We then proceeded along
Penistone Road to the ground entering via the large gates adjacent to
Turnstiles 77 and 88. It was there that I saw two ambulances parked in the
corner close to the corner of the Spion Kop. There were two persons being
deposited beside these ambulances, both covered and appeared dead.

We were then directed to    the pathway into the Spion Kop and it was there
that I was approached by    a number of Notts. Forest supporters who offered
their services. At this     time I was still not quite sure exactly what
was happening other than    seeing the two dead persons and informed that others
were injured.

With members of our Serial I then went with these volunteers to the passageway
between the Northstand and the      Spion Kop, and    itwas there that I saw total
chaos , a number of bodies were being carried upthat passageway towards
the gymnasium area by an assortment of supporters and emergency personnel.

At this PS Sherratt instructed us to follow him to the playing area where
I was confronted by the sight of the whole of the playing area literally
covered with the bodies of the      dead and injured.There were large numbers
of persons also present on the      pitch who were    assisting in attempting to
revive these persons. Police Officers were fully involved in this and
in my view all of than did their duty. We assisted carrying a large obese
young Liverpool supporter into the area underneath the Northstand adjacent
to the gymnasium. With ISSherratt we tried in vain to revive this man.
The area around me was totally carnage, littered with the bodies of dead and
dying. There were many non injured supporters cluttering the area and making
it difficult for the anergency services to operate. I then returned to the
pitch with PS Sherratt and as we passed another corner of the Northstand it
rained human spit onto us. Looking up I saw hundreds of hostile young men
shouting abuse and spitting in our direction. I don't know how many bodies
we carried passed this location, but I would recall that the spitting was
present throughout.

The area beneath the Northstand adjacent to the gymnasium soon became full
of bodies and injured persons. This area was still heavily congested with
grieving relatives searching for their friends and family. The whole situation
was not progressing , difficulty was being experienced in moving injured
from this location to parked ambulances nearby.

Inspector Barker todccharge of the situation, I was delegated on a cordon
line across the natural gateway into the area underneath the stand.

With difficulty the area was semi cleared of unnecessary persons. The sterile
area we hoped to create was under constant pressure by persons approaching
our cordon , the majority of than I sense were truly grieving and upset and
confused, looking for their friends and family. Alot of than were not helped
in their grief by than being drunk.   The officers on this line were placed
under a tranendous strain for a number of hours, having to cope with the physical
and mental abuse aimed at than by these relatives.

           Re:   Hillsborough incident


           We understood their grief. We understood their need to know if their loved
           ones or friends were inside, we understood their frustration, it didn't help.
           They expected that we would have a list of the dead and expected us to
           allow everyone of than to freely wander past our cordon to search for their
           loved ones. We explained to than the position that to allow anyone past
           the cordon at this time who was not there for the purpose of saving lives could
           prevent such lives being saved.

           This gained a mixed reaction, seme persons accepted our sound advice, but
           others physically fought to get through the lines and had to be repelled.

           Throughout ray period on this line constant comings and goings took place
           involving the injured. Their exit was severely hampered by the selfish
           attitudes of a number of these liverpool supporters.

           The constant barrage from grieving relatives continued , arranganents were
           made for than to be transported via bus to Hamilton Road Police Station
           and this seaned to assist the situation. Relatives were at least able to
           find someone who could possibly assist than.

           However, it should be noted that prior to this an Inspector had set up a table
           outside our line and this had assisted us because we had been able to direct
           all such enquiries to him. This did defuse the situation to a certain extent.

           We ranained in situe at this cordon until being relieved at 18.15 hours.
           We then regrouped at Claywheels Police Garage and we were transported back
           to Doncaster and then Mexborough.

           My whole Serial I could feel was in a deep state of shock, no one spoke
           very much during the journey and on reaching Mexborough Police Station
           I could see everyone was sickened by the enormous tragedy which had befallen
           us that day.

        Dear Sirs,

        You .will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
        reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
        in fact put in as evidence.

        However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
        and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
        I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
        I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem .
        report of your client(s).

        The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

              a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                      subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                      they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

              b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                      conselling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
                      legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
                      in which solicitors may be engaged.

              c.      Subject to the,-ia-l2¥§, they are to be kept confidential until
                      they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

        I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
        of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
        assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
        each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
        above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
        I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
        reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
        the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

        The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is ^5p. per sheet (total £
        Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

        Yours faithfully,
                                           \

Dear

Re:
I refer to my letter Reference SLP/JT/H/OO3 to which I have
not yet had a reply.

Nevertheless, I have written to you in accordance with the
terms of letter Reference SLP/JT/H/006 which is attached
hereto.
If for any reason you do not represent the bereaved family
or are unable to communicate with them, I would be grateful
if you could please let me know by return, so that I may
then if possible get in touch with a representative member
of the family.

 I would also be obliged if I could have your reply to my
 letter Reference SLP/JT/H/003 as soon as possible.


 Yoursjf^faithfully, ^

purpose     of the Inquest I would be grateful^ if you could please let
me know     as soon as possible whether you in fact represent your client
for the     purpose of the Inquest.

If you do could you also please let me know who you actually represent.




Yours faithfully,

                At    least        two    police          officers         travelled with                each PSV          so    t hat     t h e ir

                During        the    t i m e we w e r e          at      the    railway          station Liverpool                f a ns    were

                 I liaised wit h                Inspector          Harper         wh o   was      supervising           the N o t t i n g h a m

further         assistance,                    I then          travelled         to      the H i l l s b o r o u g h          Ground

arriving            at Fertistone R o a d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y                         3 . 0 0 pm        (1500).

When walking                  along       Penistone              Road    towards          the       gymnasium            there          were

very        few N o t t i n g h a m           Forest       supporters            waiting            to     go     into       the    gro un d.

I believe            these          had att en de d              in the       h o pe     of    being          able      to    buy a

ticket         at    the       ground,          but       ha d    been       unsuccessful.

I went         into       the       ground,          as    I approached                the     gymnasium             door         I wa s     met

by C h i e f        Inspector             Sumner          who     a s k e d me      to    t ak e        s om e    serials          to     the

West        stand where              there       wa s      a     pitch       invasion.              1 set         off    with       a number

of     other        officers             to    deal       with       this     incident.                 Some      officers          were

from my         previous             serials,             others        were     not.          On walking               into       the

playing         area          I saw       that       the       game     was    s t il l       in    progress            in f r o n t       of

the W e s t         stand.

The     c r ow d w a s         shouting          and       roaring and              1 saw          spectators            were       still

coming         ov er      the       fence       of    the        playing       a r e a.        As we          got    past         the

halfway          line         I saw a          police          officer        run on          to    the       pitch      from       the      West

stand        and     go       up    to    the    re f e r e e .         I then         t ol d my         officers            to    form a

cordon across                  the       pitch       to    sweep        the    spectators                ba ck      towards         the W e st

stand.          T he      West       stand       terracing              is    fenced          in a n d        divided         into

sections            by    iron       railings.

As     we    started           to    sweep       them          back     and approached                   the      fence       of    pen 3,         I

sa w    fans        crushed          up a g a i n s t          the w i r e     mesh.           Some        people        were       reaching

through         the       fence          screaming             and    shouting           for       us    to h e l p      them.            1' w e n t

up to        them        to    tr y a n d       reassure             them     and      realised            then      that         so me    of

them ap peared                 to    be       dead.        Whilst        up at         the     f ro n t       1 realised            that        the

crowd were               st ill      pushing          forward           and    crushing             the       people         at    the

fro nt .         I saw         people          lapsing           into    unconsciousness                      before         my    eyes.

It w a s       not a d e l i b e r a t e             surge       and     on    looking             out     into      the      crowd        it

appeared            they were             all    leaning             forward and              this       w as     creating          a slow

momentus            of    crushing.              I stood             up on     the       front          and      shouted          loudly

"Push       back,         y o u ’ re         crushing          peo p l e          at    the     fro n t " .       X also            made    a

whatsoever.                   Other          officers          by t his               t ime    had    jumped          o n to     the      small

wall     and were              gripping             the w i r e             mesh       and were        shouting             in a s i m i l a r

way    to m y s e l f .

People         at    the       back          of    the    crowd were                   being        pulled       up    into         the    stand

above       them         and       I ha d         fears       of    someone              being       trapped          o nt o     the      spikes

of    the      separating                f e nc es.

I continued               to       shout          a n d all        I could             see     were    staring           faces          which

were     not        responding                to    our       requests.

The    tunnel            to    the       rear       of    th is         enclosure              did    not     appear           to    be    blocked

at    this         time       and a space                had       been          created.            All    it n e e d e d w a s           for    the

crowd       to s t a r t           to m o v e       back       and          it w o u l d       have    helped          to      relieve          the

pressure.

I wa s      conscious               that          there were                no    police        officers          to     the        rear    of    the

crowd.

1 made         a transmission                      to    control             to a s k         for    officers          to      c o me     in f r o m

the    rear         of    the       stand          to    get       them          to    pull     back,       to    do w h a t         was

required,            but       I h ad         no     recollection                     of t h e m     responding             to      the    call.

You    will         appreciate                that       due       to       the       shouting        and     screaming              and    people

milling            around          on        the    pitch,          it            was     near       enough a sheerimpo ssi bilit y

to    h e ar       the    radio              even       though          I         he 1d it n e xt           to my        ear.

I stood            back       to    t a ke        stock       of    the          situation.            Immediately                  in f r on t       of

me    were a         number             of    people          trapped             on the        f e nce     in a        l a rg e     pile.        I

saw    that         the       gate       to       the    number             3 enclosure              was    now       open       and      officers

were     in the           gateway             one       of w h o m          I i d e n t i f i e d w as        Chief         Superintendent

Nesbit.             He    ha d      a number             of    officers                with     h i m so      I remained                in situ.

1 sa w      that         some       officers             were       near          number        4 gate        giving           assistance.

People         were       sti ll             climbing          over               the     f e nc e    and     coming           o ve r the t op of

number         3    pen.           We        assisted          them               to     the    p l a y ing      track.

I then made              a     request             for       bolt      cutters        in an          effort          to    create          another

opening         into         number           3     terrace.           Again        I do       not       know       if    this       message

wa s    received             or     if    in        fact      t h e y ever      came       to       our       location.              I th en

sa w    police         officers               and       spectators             kicking          at       the     fence      to m y         right

and     by     pulling            the     wire          back     they        created           an    entrance             into       this

enclosure.               This        s t i ll        being       pen      number          3.        I immediately                went          to

th is    space         and        started            to a s s i s t       in b r i n g i n g         people          out    from          the

enclosure             o nt o      the     playing             area.

Y o u will         appreciate                 t h at     some       of    the       bodies          that       were       removed          from

the     enclosure              were       either             unconscious             or    d e a d a n d as              officers          came          to

the     entrance             to     carry           people       away        I was telling                them       to    see       to    them,

to     g ive    what         aid     they           could.

Casualties             were         building             up    on      the     pitch       behind             the    goal       area and             I

told     officers              to    take          them       further          on to       the       pitch          so as       not       to    c ause

obstruction              for        ourselves.                 Whilst          we    were       helping             people       one m a n who

wa s    conscious              became             trapped        in the w i r e            and whilst                we w e r e       trying             to

assist         him     people            were        jumping           on h i m a n d          over       him and          other          people

who     were       trapped,              to       get    on    the       pitch.           I do       not       blame       them       for       this,

so me    of     them were                in j u r e d ,       s om e     had    cuts,          they       ha d      been    trapped             for

so     long     that         once        they        became         free       they wa nte d              to     get      out    of       that

situation.               The        young          m a n wa s       eventually             freed an d move d                    on    to       the

pitch,          I continued                   to     h e l p at        th is    location             where          both    regular

officers           and       special              constables             were       involved             in    carrying          people             away.

Spectators             and        police           officers            were     involved             in r e m o v i n g         the       bodies

from     this         particular                  a r e a.     I was         conscious              that       one       young       man,       a

Liverpool             supporter,                  was    stood         up a n d      the       pile       of     c a s u l a t i es was

above        his      k ne e s .         Until          then     I had         not    fully ap preciated                        the       enormity

of     the     tragedy.

I then         sa w    t ha t       the       enclosure             was      now empty              of    casualties             but was

full     of     police            officers              and    the       remaining spectator s .

I looked arou nd                the a r e a          of    the       goalmouth            where        I s aw St.           Johns

Ambulance          people         and      police          officers               involved       in g i v i n g         various          type

of artificial,              respiration.                   An a m b u l a n c e          had    come        down     the      pitch          to

number       3 enclosure.                  I then          noticed            t h at     the F i r e        Service         were        in

attendance          with        some       of    their          members            walking       about        with       oxygen

bottles          which      they were            giving            to    people          wh o   required           t h at     service.

I then       became         conscious            of       s om e     ho st i 1 ity        between           the P o l i c e        officers

and    spectators            in the            pen a n d        told         the    officers           to    come       out    of       that

area    onto       the      pitch         and    they          did.          I remained          in that           area       of     the

pitch       as    they      did.

I remained          in th at           area      p u r e l y as          a    containment              exercise          when

suddenly          I be came          aware       of a s k i r m i s h              in the       number         3 enclosure.                   I

looked       round and            saw a s t o c k y             built         uniformed          police          officer           running

out    of    the    enclosure.                  He    h a d his          head       in his       hands.            He    was       not

wearing          a helmet         and      he    ran       o nt o       the       pitch.        T wo    other        officers

followed.           1 w as        unable         to       speak         to    them       but    I understand                t h at      they

had    been       into      the      enclosure             with         a Scenes          of C r i m e       Officer          to     take

photographs           and       t hi s     had       upset         the       spectators.

We    then ap pe ar ed            to      be    in a s t a t e           of       limbo.        Officers           were       stood

about       in g r o u p s      on     the      playing            area .         Spectators           were      st ill       ripping

down     boardings           to m a k e         makeshift               stretchers.              I then          started           to

re-group what               was      left       of m y         serials            which     would       be 5       sergeants             and

'15 c o n s t a b l e s .       All       of    us,       without            exception,          by     th is      time       were       in a

state       of    shock .         Police         officers               were       walking       about         the      pitch        crying

and    1 ensured            that       they were               comforted            by    other        officers.

Whilst       I was       on the           pitch a number                     of    supporters           k ep t     trying          to    pick

an argument           w i t h me          stating          that         it w o u l d      not    h ave       happened          if

Liverpool          had      been a l low ed               to    use      the       la rg e r    stand.           I pointed              out

that     this      was      nothing            to do w i t h            me    and      t h e y all      accepted            it a n d         s a id

appeared            to me        that       they      only w a n t e d           to a r g u e »

I later         attended              at P e n i s t o n e        Road      to      load       the L i v e r p o o l      f ans       onto

the    bus      to       return        to      the S t a t i o n .          In the m a i n            the    spectators               were

very       very      s u b d u e d as          were       my    officers.              So      far as       1 recall            only     two

bus    loads         left        t ha t     location.                I put       my      remaining          officers            onto     one

of    the      b u se s    where          they       sat       in s i l e n c e .

Whilst         I was       stood            outside            on    the        pavement a young                 man    came       to me, a

Liverpool            supporter,                and asked             for    the       directions            to    the     Northern

G e n e r 1 Hospital              and       how      he    could make               enquiries          regarding             his

f ri e n d .        1 started             to    obtain          details          of      the    casualty          number         when        one

of    his      friends           starting            shouting             " I ’ve     told you         not       to    speak       to    those

bastards.                You     bastards            did       this,       murderers".                He    then went            on     to    sa y

we    had      opened           the     gates        and       had    caused          the      probl em .

better         to    ignore           the      r e m ar ks,         not    knowing          all     the     fac ts ,      than

supporters.

At    no    time         d id    I see         any    of       the    club       stewards           in the        ground.             I have

referred            to my        problems            with       the       r adio      but w o u l d        add    that       everyone

appeared            to    be     so     engrossed              in t h e i r      respective            duties          that      they        did

1 h a n d l e d m a ny ,           many        casualties.                 Some       had      lost    their          l o wer    garments

whilst         being        in the          crush,         others          ha d we t        themselves,               been      sick,        so

            Many young          officers           responded             to    their       responsibilities                    with       vigour

            and     de te r m i n a t i o n and were            a     credit         to    the S o u t h          Yorkshire             Police.

            Some      climbed         over      the     fence       into       the       pen    to    lift        people       out       and    on

             occasions         gave? a r t i f i c i a l       respiration,                whilst           others      had        to    stand       on

             the    f e n ce   and     shout       at    p eo p l e    to      pull       back.

             The    things      that        really       stick        in m y m i n d w e r e           -

             1.                A young          policewoman coming                   up    to me a n d a s k i n g              what          she

             could       do-        I told      her     to    get     the      crowd       to    p ush       back.        She       then       left

            me     and    ran up       the      fence        nearly       to    the       top a n d was            shouting             and

             s c r e a m i n g at    the     c r o w d in her         determination                  to get        them       to    resp ond .

            2.                 This     wa s     the d e p t h      of    bodies          that       ha d    b u i lt    up        in the       w e 11

             of    the ter r a c i n g .

            My     own    feelings          are    that       I shall          never       forget           the    helplessness                and

             frustration             I f el t     when       I went       to    the W e s t          stand»

             Here     1 am,     a well           paid    professional                with       nearly 28 years                    service          who

             has    at te nde d and             been    involved          in m a n y       public           order       situations             and

             attended many              courses         to    improve          my    professionalism,                    yet       here       I was,

             when     I was     most        needed       by the          community,             when        I could       h a ve        given most

             help,       thwarted          at    the    frist       hurdle          by    ’a fence'           with       strands          of w i r e

             approximately             one       eighth       diameter.

             I could       touch       them,       speak       to     them and            nothing           mo re.

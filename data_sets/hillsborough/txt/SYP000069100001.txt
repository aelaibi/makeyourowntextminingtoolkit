               I am a single roan living at the above address with my father.



               I am a Liverpool FC supporter and o n Sa t u r day 151 i~~i A p r i 1 ? 1969

               (150489)         I went to Hillsborough football                                ground Sheffield for the FA
*    A
               cup semi         final match against Nottingham Forest,,



               I travelled         by c o a c h f r o m X i v e r p o o i     to S h e f f i e l d .          The c o a c h company

               about     10.15 am       (1015 h r s ).



               1 made the. journey with my friend
                                                                                                    V

                                                                                               31336

We d i d n 5t make any s tops at a 11 on the journey to the mat ch buX/ were

held up by traffic delays               in Manchester near to Old T r a f f o r d .            We

arrived     in Sheffield at about 2 pm (1400 n r s ).                      We parked our coach

about    1 mile from the ground near                 to the r a i1way station.            I w a 1kea to

to the ground with                      .   During the journey I witnessed supporters

dr inking alcohol        from cans on the way to the ground?                      this   included

both supporters groups,,              I didn't witness any disorder during this

time.      We arrived at the ground at about 2.30 pm ( i y / o                      hrs),      We

star tea to queue at the Leppings Ln end turnstiles.                             There appeared to

be masses of people hanging about with no signs of order or queues,,                                        1

saw only one mounted Police officer at                       Che turnstiles        directing      tans,,
We queued for about           15 minutes with the             crush being quite tight.



1 went straight through trie turnstile arid handed my ticket to a

steward,,     1 retained the stub section,,                   The value of my ticket was £6,

0 0 (s i     p o u rids) f o rt Ine L e p p i n g s L n S t a n d i n g area.   I a m a sea s o n

ticket      holder & got my ticket from Anfield,,                    1 entered the       courtyara

area with                 X wasn't      very busy at this s t a g e .            I had   been to

Hi 11 sbo rough De-Pore & knew where               to go so we made our way to the left

hand corner section as you look at the pitch,,                           This   part of the

terrace was only half full.                 The two cent re sections              looked busy but           .

didn't take muc h n o t i c e .



  got    into this     penned area to the             left at S.37         (1437 hrs)    exactly

oecause     I remember      looking at the clock.                At no stage up to this             pairs

did I witness any fights              or disturbances.



The match kicked off on time and about 2 ~ 3 minutes                              into the game

noticed people were scaling the perimeter fence from the two sections

directly behind the goal mouth.                    1 thought there was fighting              in
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    S133fc
there.        I saw two supporters             run onto the pitch and talk to two of the

players,,        1 then saw a Police officer                  run onto the pitch and talk to

the    referee.        He stopped the game and ushered off the players.                              There

was a considerable              crowd on the perimeter track at this stage with

people spilling onto the pitch.                       I still     couldn't see why and what was

go ing on „        I c 1 imbed over t he sec ur i ty f e nce ont o t he /i rat:k t o see

what was going on,,                          also tried but was stopped by a Pol ice

officer.         I walked towards the goalmouth and saw a fella 1y 1ng on the

floor.     He appeared to be dead,                he was blue        in the fa c e , people were

trying to give him the kiss of life,                       out    it wasn't working.            I didn't

see his face but he was quite fat wearing a black tee shirt.                                        I think

with black tracksuit bottoms.                     I went back to _______ I and told                           he

climbed over and joined m e .                 We walked back to see if we could help.

I saw some        people      carrying hoardings with               injured people on.



we went over          to some     people who were          carrying one and helped                      IT



three Journeys           carrying Just         injured people over            to the Spion^jytip

end of the ground.               we   left t hen's in the care of Saint J ohn *s AiTiDU.;.ance



carrying       it.     on the 4th journey back we piCKea up anolner                          injureo

carried him across the pitch,                   on doing this his head fell                 back off t h e

hoarding so someone held it and supported it as we ran.                                   We managed to

supporters were             turned back b y a P olice officer,,                   Someone       in our pen

rushed the gate and Knocked the I3olice officer over and the                                        people.,,

well    some of them,            returned to the terracing,,                  I stood there             3.n a daze

officer          if I could leave and return,                 out he told me to leave all

together as the match w o u l d n ’t be re p l a y e d .                   I went    back to the

terracing          to make sure and left the ground after a loudspeaker

announcement.             This would be at about twenty to five                        (1640hrs)»             We

got outside the ground avid queued for the phone,,                                 The queue was too

bad so we asked a local                  resident        if we could use his           phone which we

did,,     After a while we returned to the                        coach and sat on it for about

an hour.           One of the      lads on the coach was missing                    so we went to a

boys    club or s o m e t h i n g , and tried to get some information.,



we   left        some   time   later     to      return home.

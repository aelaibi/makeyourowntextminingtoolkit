Mr Greenwood
Mr Mould



I attach a copy of a letter from the Rugby Football Union which
raises a number of issues. I shall be glad of your views on the
issue of evacuation time mentioned in the third paragraph.
Mr Mould and I have seen the new stand: it is very large indeed.
It is made almost entirely of non-combustible material (steel and
concrete). Although there are plastic seats and a number of
executive boxes, the risk of fire must be very low.

Should we be giving firmer guidance on evacuation times?   The
difference between evacuation times of 4 minutes, 5 minutes or
6 minutes may not seem very large, but the difference in terms
of requirements for staircases may be very significant.

In a case such as the Twickenham stand, which is on 3 levels, are
we justified in proposing an evacuation time for the whole of
the stand which I think holds 13,000 people?        If phased or
partial evacuation were envisaged,       I suspect that lower
evacuation times could be achieved with smaller numbers of
staircases.

I am also a little worried that this correspondence implies that
the fire authority, or the safety authority, is only now asking
for a change in the evacuation time when the stand is almost
complete.    Surely these issues should be addressed at the
planning stage? Does not this suggest that we should have some
clearer yardsticks in the Green Guide between the minimum
practical time of 2 \ minutes and the maximum of 8?

I shall be glad of your advice before replying to the RFU.

Dear P e te r ,


Thank you for the v i s i t by David Mould and y o u r s e lf .           I hope you were
reasonably reassured by what you heard and saw.

As promised, I a t t a c h a rough d r a f t of the l e t t e r I proposed sending to
our seven member clubs who have grounds designated under the 1975 Act.
P lease feel fre e to make any suggestions or a l t e r a t i o n s you dean
a p p r o p ria te .

I am a ls o preparing a l i s t of b u ild in g work we have been obliged to
c a rry out in the l a s t year or so, o s te n s iv e ly on grounds of sa fe ty
but for which we could see no j u s t i f i a b l e grounds. We take sa fety
m atters extremely s e rio u s ly a t Twickenham but in a nurriber of m atters we
seen to have been t r e a t e d unduly h a rs h ly .          For example, we are now
advised th a t our new stand and new se a tin g have to be evacuated w ith in
f i v e minutes although I know of no d i r e c t i v e to t h i s e f f e c t .    And, as
I mentioned to you, the RFU already subscribes approximately tlm . p . a .
in terms of co rp oratio n ta x , VAT and corrmunity charge which is a
co n siderab le burden for a n o n -p ro fit d i s t r i b u t i n g s p o r t. We take a
p r id e in the fa c t th a t we are s e lf - s u p p o r tin g and we do not look to the
Government for g ran ts but i t seems g ro ss ly u n fa ir th a t we should be
p en alised in t h i s way.

 Thank you again for your v i s i t             and I look forward to hearing                from you
 regarding the d r a f t l e t t e r .


Yours s in c e re ly ,



 Secretary
DRAFT




When I wrote to you on 26th A p r i l , I mentioned th a t meeting had been
arranged w ith Home O ffice o f f i c i a l s on 23rd May when I would have the
opportunity to discuss the e f f e c t of the Taylor Report Recommendations
1-4, All Seated Grounds, on those clubs having grounds which were
designated under the 1975 Act.

This meeting has now taken place and am advised to inform you th a t no
decision has yet been taken by the Government concerning designated
grounds for sp orts other than A ssociation F o o tb a ll?and th a t no action
should th e re fo re be taken u n t i l th a t decisio n is reached.

I t is ap p reciated by the Home O ffic e t h a t conversion to a l l seating
would be d i f f i c u l t , expensive and almost c e r t a i n l y unnecessary in the
ca s â‚¬ of rugby fo o tb a ll clubs but the d ecisio n cannot be a n t ic ip a t e d .

In the meantime, p lease l e t me know i f you a re placed under any
p re ss u re by local a u t h o r i t i e s to adopt these recommendations.

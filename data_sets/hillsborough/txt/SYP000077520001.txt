            At 9.30 am       (0930 hrs) Saturday 15th April,             1989    (150489)   I was on duty

            at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for the FA cup semi final tie

            between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC„



            At 10 am       (1000 hrs)   that morning   I attended at the main briefing after

           which I received a serial          briefing.        (Serial    12).



            liyself with PC2554 H^gue were briefed to o b s e r v e tu r nstJJ. es _7j3                88

            (North stand, Penistone Rd).           Due to these turnstiles being closed
                   SS2£k,
            myself and PC Hague assisted other officers d X                     gate 0.
                                                                                           I1

           During the afternoon several attempts were made by Liverpool                          fans to

            gain entry through this gate without tickets,                     especially as kick off
                                                                       PAGE      ?.
                                                                       S2178

time approached.      The majority of these fans attempting to gain entry

did smell of intoxicants.



While      patrolling near to gate 0 I saw fans standing    in the very far

corner of the Hop nearest to the North stand urinating onto the roof

of an Ambulance      parked directly underneath the stand.



At about 3 pm C1500 hrs)      to 3.15 pm <1515 hrs)    I became aware of some

sort of incident when fans from the Kop started to leave the ground.

I only became aware of the seriousness of the incident when several

Ambulances were driven through gate 0 and to the rear of the North

stand,     as well as other   police serials.



iiyself and PC Hague     remained at gate 0 and assisted in the arrival and

departure of the Ambulance service.



Later on in the afternoon /e ar ly evening      I combined with other officers

to form a transit patrol       (PC Greenway driving)   in the Hillsborough

ar e a .



The transit patrol      then returned to the North Stand of the ground,

where along with other officers formed a cordon outside the gymnasium

area.



At 7 pm (1900 hrs)      that day I was released from duty and took no

further      part in the matter.

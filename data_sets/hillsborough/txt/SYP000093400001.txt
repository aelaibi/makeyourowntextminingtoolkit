        During         the       morning,           we    saw       very     few        football            supporters.                 The       ones          we

        did      see       were       wearing           Nottingham           colours              (hats,        etc)       and     were          no

        problem.                I did       see     two    youths,          wearing               Nottingham              scarves,           walk

        10,40        am     (1040).




        We    dealt         with       two        ambulance          calls         during            the    morning,            both     involving

        I searched               many       supporters              a n d 'found          that         many     dad       not     have       a    ticket

        for      the       match       and        the    majority          had         very       little       money.             The    ones          that

        were       drunk         were       yefused        access          to      the      b u s a s : ...because           of    the       lack          of

        manpower,               the    drunks           were    not      arrested,            unless          they        were     disorderly.




        E can        recall           Sergeant           COLTON          arreting             a    youth        for       being        drunk          and

At     3    pm     ( 1 5 G Q ),              we    were       about          to    qar    into       DHQ    for     a meal           break       when

we     received                 a       radio        message            toyiSe      making           our    way     towards           the

football              ground.




We     were        just             leaving             the    town          centre           when    we    received           another /fessage

that        serious                 injuries              were      taking          place. ^              "sere w a s     no    reply           back    to

There        was        a       lot          of    interference                    ' the           radio    and,     just       before          we

arrived            at       the          ground,             the    radi           ant        dead.         I assumed          that         the

battery            had          gone          dead,




On     arrival              at          the       ground,          we       entered           by    the    main     gates       on     Penistone

Rd.         We     stood                in    the       area       between          the        Kop    and     the    North           Stand.          lh e r e

seemed           to     be          a    lot       of     confusion               and     it       sounded     as    if       the     game       was

still        being              played.




There        were           a       l ot      of     police         officers              stood, w i t h       me    -and      it     seemed         that

nobody           knew           what          was       happening.




After        a     short                time,        we      began          to    move        down    the     ramp      and     on     the       track

    We    were       then       told       to       line       up    across          the       pitch.           As    we       d i d , a youth                   ran

    lifeless,              I said          to       PC    STOKES          that       we       should       help       him          but       he       kept

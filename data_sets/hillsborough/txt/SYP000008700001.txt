As    we    left           the       first       Aid     Room       we    walked             past       a    St    John's             Ambulance

parked          outside,                  I believe           we    had     two         ambulances                at     the      ground          but        1

only       remember              seeing          one     at    that       time.              We    were       pushing             a    trolley

They       shouted,                "We    can't."                 I     considered               that          the       man       was     dead         and

took       my       hand       out,

cannot          describe              him      in       any       more          detail,

I    got    down             from     the      wall,,             The       supporters                at       the       front        were         pushed          up

against             the       fence       unable             to       move       or       talk       due       to       the     sustained

Philip          told          me    to    go       and       get       some          wire       cutters,                 I    ran     across            the

sideline                adjacent          to       the       North          S t a n d , I saw              a    police             officer          wearing

a    flat       cap          and    holding             a walkie                talkie,              I thought                he    was       in    a

cutters,                they       are    dead          and       dying          over       t h e r e , 1'          I    indicated             towards

the    West             Stand,           The       policeman                said,          " S o r r y „ I haven't                    got      a n y , ” or

“S o r r y ,        i    can't        get      a n y , ” words                  to    that       effect,                 I can't           remember

what       he       looked          like,           1    ran          off       again       towards             the          P o l ice     Room         but.

before          I       reached          it,       I was          met       by                                 uho       was       walking          from          the

nuinoer         of    people                who     appeared             to    be    injured             to       see    if    I couldhelp

them.           They       were             not     seriously                injured       so       I moved             on.      I was

approached                by       a       supporter           who       told       me    his       friend          couldn't             feel     his

legs       and       his       back          hurt.

I followed                him          to    where        a    man       was       lying       on    his          back.        This       man     was          in

his    early          twenties,                   w h i t e , 5*8            tall,       dark,       short,             wavy    hair,          clean

shaven,          wearing                   blue     jeans       and          red    and    white             t-shirt.           Knelt          beside

this       man       was       a       policeman.               I didn't             stop       to       e Karri i ne     him,       I    could        see

that       he    was       in          pain       so    1 thought              it    best       not          to    take       chances          with        a

possible             spinal                injury       and     decided             to    get       an       ambulance,

I    saw    another                policeman              standing             closeby,             not       treating anybody,                       so       I

ran    over          to    him             and    said,        " I ’ve        got    someone             with       a    suspected             damaged

"I    d o n ’t thi nk                  I    can     get       you    o n e . ’1

I saw       some          of       the       supporters              carrying             one       of       the    advertising                boards

like       you       would             a    stretcher           so       I    ran    over       to       them       and       told       them     about

the    man       with          the          back       injury        and       needed          their          help       to    get       him    to     the

First       Aid       Room.                 They       said,        "Fuck          off,    we're             going       to    where       the

people          are       dying,             where        you       should          be."        They          had       Liverpool          accents.

I walked             away          from          them     to    where          about       a    dozen             fans    were       carrying

The    man       d i d n ’t say                  anything           but       was    looking             around          and    breathing.                     I

                       saw    a    man       lying        on    a    stretcher                face       down       crying.            I went            over       to       him

                       and    told        him    to       roll       over       onto          his    back,          having        examined               his    body          for

                       injuries.               1 eventually                got          him    to    roll          over,        raised         his       legs       and

      £j               left    him        to    await         treatment.                 I didn't              consider          him       in    immediate

          VJ           I    then    saw        a man       lying          on    the      ground          at        the    rear       of    an   ambulance                    or

                       police        van.        He       was       not    covered             and       was       not    being       attended                to.        I
          u
      ^                could       see      that      his       face       was       purple.             There           were    a    number             of

                       supporters              lying          around       this          area       awaiting             treatment             so    I thought                he

                       may    have        only       just       stopped             breathing.                 I went          over       to    him       and       felt

                       for    a    pulse        in h i s        neck.           There          was       no    pulse       so     I gave            mouth       to       mouth

                       breathed           into       him       came       out       1    could       hear          fluid       gurgling             inside          him.           I

                       throught           he    was       going       to       be       sick    so       I moved          my     face      away          from       him       but
  P   f f&        \
                       he    wasn't.            An    ambulance                man       came       over       to    me    and       said,          "Don't          bother

Also,       at       the       beginning             of    the       incident,                when          the       f a n ’s w e r e       being

                          I was        on     duty        at    the    FA    Cup    Semi          Final              on      Saturday       15th       April

                          (150489).




                          Just        as    the     game        was    starting          a       lot          of     tans      earns      out     of    the    gale       near

                          the        left     hand        corner,       behind       the          Liverpool                   goal?       and    were     sitting          or

                          lying        on     the      pitch.          Some       were       going                 back      into    the    stand        by    the    gate

                          on    the        right       hand      side       behind       the           goal          near      my    first       aid     post    at       tne

                          corner.             One      adult      took       two    members                   down          when    he    heard        there    was       some

                          trouble           near       the      other       corner.              He     then           came        back    for     the    rest       of    us.




                          a)h e n     1 got       to      where       tne    crush       was                  saw      an     o 1ois h     Rian    who    was    blue       in

                          the        face.        His       glasses         had    fallen              off         avui he         was    propped        up    against

                          the        fan    next       to      him.     I put       my       hand             in     to      feel    for    a    pulse,        but    there
                                                                                                                                                 PACE               2
                                                                                                                                                 S774A

was    nothing.            I then          moved         back          in    front       of      the         fence          to    see       if    I

could       help       anyone       but       there         was        nothing          I could              do,    I had             to    stand          and

watch       helplessly             as    the       people            in     front       of     me      started              to    dxe.




Someone          then    said,          “G e t     some      wire           cutters",             so     I    ran       up       the       pitch          to    a

Police       Officer          who       looked         to    be        in a       position             of     authority.                    I told

him    that       we    needed          some       wire      cutters              because           the       people             behind          th e

Liverpool          goal       were       dead       and      dying.               His    reply           was,       "Sorry             Love,          I

don't       have       any."




I started          to    run       up    to      the     First            Aid     room        but      was        met       by    the       members

in    there       half     way.          I returned                  to     the      pitch       and         by    this          time       (only          a

I started          to    give       first          aid      to       p e o p l e y t f i Ah     crush         injuries                to    the       chest

and    ribs.           I d o n ’t       remember            how       m^rfy^ p e o p l e          I treated                 before          a    fan

came    to       find    me    because             his      friend           couldn't            feel         his       legs          and       was       in

pain,       so    I went       to       this       m a n ’s a i d .             He    was       lying         at    the          side       of    the

pitch       saying       his       back       hurt.          I       immediately               suspected                a    damaged             spine

and    went       to    find       an    ambulance,                  leaving          instructions                  with          a    Police

Officer          that    the       fan     was      not      to       be     moved.




I found          another       Police            Officer             and     asked       for        an       ambulance                to    be

radioed          through       because             I had         a    suspected               damaged             spine.              The       Police

Officer          said    no    ambulances                were          on    the      pitch         and       said          he    c o u l d n ’t g e t

one    for       me.     1 went          to      some       fans          carrying            ari a d v e r t i s i n g           board,          b ut

they    told       me    I should             be    where            they       were     going,              which          was       with       the

dying       fans.        I decided               that       my       skills          would       be      better             put       to    use       on

someone          who    had    a    chance          of      surviving                rather         than          those          which          would

die    no    matter        how      hard         I tried             to     save      them       because            of       the       severity                of

their       injuries.

                 b o y ’s         transfer           to       hospital.




                  I     then        returned          to       the       pitch       but       by    this             time       the       injured          and       a    lot     of

                 the      dead          had     already             been       taken       off.              1    returned                to    the       first       aid        room

                  I     would        like       to    add          three       things.              1 he         first          is    that          I could          taste

                 alcohol             after       giving             mouth       to    mouth          to          the       above          mentioned             patient,

                 and      that          when     the          breath       I had          blown          into             his    body          was    "exhaled"              I

                  could           hear       fluid        washing          about          as    if       the          patient             was       about       to    vomit.




                 Also         while          I was        on       the    pitch       stood          with             a    small          group       of    St       John

                 nursing             members          a       fan    came       towards             us       and          said,       "Look          ladies,          I d o n ’t

                 want         you       to     take       this       badly       or       the    wrong                way,       but       there          are       people

                 The      final          thing        I would             like       to    add       is           nat       the       police          did       a    good        job,

ground.       I w o u l d say that           the    crowd was about 300 strong
                                                                            A~
W h e n we got        to the area of              road outside the Leppings I 'entrance, we

were a l l o w e d to go where we wanted.                       It w ou ld    be about     1                (1350)    at

this    time.

        and myself went a short- distance                           from the ground and bought

some i<         to eat and               I used the       phone.     Then we w al ke d back            to    the

I /law that         in front                                  g e g r owjWi of
                                    of the tyfnstile was a large                                       crowd.      The
                                                                                                   C
crowd was       full       from      the    tu r ns ti le    back    to thg^«wrought       iron g a t e s . At

that    stage       I did not            think    there was a n y j X i n g     out of the ordinary.                 At

that    stage       I thought            it was a bit unusual            that    there were        no o rg anised

queues.

I jo i n e d the back            of the queue about              level   wit h the wrought              iron

gates.       Then     I became aware              that    the   crowd behind was getting                    larger

and    I was    being        pushed forward.              I found myself         forced to the middle

between       the     turnstile at           the gates.         I could see       people       crushed up

agai n s t    the turnstiles.               There     did not appear          to be any        people        going

thro u g h them.

At    this    stage      the     crowd was         packed tight and           it was     uncomfortable. I

was    having       d i f f i c u l ty    breathing.        It was    tighter     than    I ’ve ever

e x p e r i e n c e d before.       There were           people scr ea mi ng      that    they     couldn't

I could see           t,wo m o u nt e d J?Tficers, one a S er ge an t                 the other a

Constable.        They were        both on thp? edge of the                       crowd towards        the     river„

they were shouting               to the            wd to get          back but       it was     out          control,

they     could do nothing.               I could not move                 in any directiorf.          One    of    the

O ff ic e r s    rode    into    the     crowd to try and force them back,                          but     he got

trap pe d by the weight                of the      crowd.

Then     I saw     two more m o un t ed Police Of j> .cers arrive at                          the edqe         of the

crowd by the            river.    I think        o n / jf them was a woman Qffij^r

At    this stage         the    crowd was R e a l l y          tight,       people w e r ^ s c r e a m i n g      that

they     c o u l d n ’t breathe        some     of the girls were                 shouting    for help.           To be

quite     honest        I was    beginning          to panic because               I just     could not move

and was         havLng    d if fi c ul t y breathing.               It was     like this      until about 2.

55p m    ( 1 ^ 55),      because       I looked at my               watch.    There     did not seem to be

any provement            through the          turnstile,            all    the while     it was building            up

from     behind.
                                        Ao\@.
I saw a uniform Police                     nstajyi'e on foot               over    the other     sj/tfe of the

low barrier           by the^^/iver a t Ch^? side                   of the^tj^fTst'iles.          I saw him go

towards         a gate    on the       riq 'jp A fa f    the    t u r n s t i l e s . I saw him talk         to a

steward,        who      had a or>amge bib o n . I d o n ’t know where he came from but,

I saw him by the < p t e

actually         by it,    because        the     low barrier             by the turnstiles was              holding

people      back.

At    first      it was a slow trickle                   of people         passing thro ug h when the word

began to spread that                the gate was               open and       people were shouting the

gate was open.            I saw        the P o li ce ma n try a n j / ^ t o p the           first

people      that were          going     thro ug h but th^y. just went                 past     him,

O n c e v Ln s i d e   the area        behind the stand was                  quite free and you were

able     to walk a ro un d quite                 freely.       I went       to the toilet.

I saw that             the gate was          still      open,    but       by now there was only a few

people       coming t h r o u g h .

I remember as              I went      to the toilet             looking         into the tunnel         and   it

se em e d quite          uncongested.

After      I returned from the toilet                         the tung^l          was   full    of ifrtfople moving

through        it.                                                                              '

I looked through the                   tunnel       and saw the            pitch and that was where all

the     crowd was          going.      I saw that the end of the tunnel                             at the terracing

was     packed but            I thought          that   the terracing must                open out a ll owing you

to go to the side.

].' thought         that      the    tunnel       was            nly way onto           the terracing.         I

did not see any Po li ce                    or St                by the tunnel            entrance.

As    I went        thro ug h thfrtunnel                it was    full      of    people    but you      could move

down and to the yifght. I felt as                             if my feet          had   come ofr the ground.

T here was          nothing         I could do about             it,      I was    just thrown forward.                 I

came     to a stop            in the       square ma rk ed E4 on tp fe              grill.

As we stop pe d            it was      u nb el ie v ab l y t ig ht s /y o u        just    could not move at

All a r o u nd me       people were        screaming        for help.        I could not move rny head

a ro un d    properly because            of the     pressure       but    I could see that         some

peoples       faces jwere bright           red and that           people were        begijtftinq to be

to    pull    people out         from    the     front. ..

I remember          the game was         s tilj^^eing        p l a y e d , I was not watching      it I

was    just       concentrating         on standing        up and trying           to work out how        I was

going       to get out.        I was     convinced        if I fell        over    I w ould die,    I really

feared       for my safety.

I saw an a m bu la nc e          come onto        thjr pitch but          I was still       crushed and

unable       to move,        even th ou gh p e o p l e     were    getting        out of the    pen the

pressure          did not     seem to ease off at all

I saw that          the gate from our             pen onto 'the^/pi t ch was open and              people

were    going       t h ro ug h they were g e t t i n g^ f ml l ed out.            They were    obv io us ly

             There        was     someone         rubbing my back and            I slowly got my             breath back.            I

             T here was arlot                of    people    helping       to get the        people     out over         the

             fence.        I saw a girl about                18 years       being     passed over the           r a il i n g s,       it

        kT   was      obvious         she was       dead.    I have seen dead people                  before and this                girl

        &    looked as           if her       neck       had been broken.

             I g r a b b e d hold of her                 together with some others                      we    passed her             body

 jjtP        down towards              the gate a nd she was               taken onto J t ne         pitch.    I stood at the

               erice and we just                  kept    pulling       people     ovej/'the fence and          passing

             them       in a human           chain onto the             pitch.

 f                h a n d l e d at     least       two    people who were           dead,    and many more           that were

''           unconscious.              The    pen was       o b vi ou sl y b eginning        to empty and you              could

             see      p i les of 3 y 4 nd 4 bodies              just      lyj,ng on the       steps     dead,

             T hen      I saw                 he had been          i      he Pen 3 w it h me,          he    came         rough the

                                                   -------         I have     no    idea how      it was      opened,          but    I

             can say that whe n                   I had got >aVer the            fence    it was shut.

                        and     I went       down onto       the       ctfftch, through an open gate.                I w an te d to

             help where              I could.

             I could see that                 there were a lot of dead                   people      on the    pitch with

             their       faces        covered with Police               tunics a n d / t h i n g s    like that.

                        an d    I helped where we           coyld, maki/rfj sure people were alright and

             seeing        if they were             injured, just y^enerally helping. I w ould say we

             were       doing        this    for about       30 minutes.           I can't    h on estly      remember

             because           I was          a daze.       I suppose       it w^s shock.

             About 3.45»lfi I was a ware                    that a Poiy'ce line was               put across         t

             On the halfway           line,     it was made       up of about    100 officers,        I could not

             see any        reason for        this at the time.

PRIME MINISTER



     FOOTBALL SPECTATORS' BILL AND SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


Miss Sinclair's minute attached proposes that you seek further
information from Mr. Ridley before agreeing to his proposal
that the National Licensing Authority should be administered
through a quango rather than through part of his Department.
The timetable for the Bill is such that there is not time for
an extended exchange of minutes with Mr. Ridley.   In my view,
the paragraph on pages 3-4 of Mr. Ridley's minute and the
information on staffing provided in Miss Sinclair's note
provide the basis for a decision,


Agree his proposal for a quango provided he builds in
safeguards to stop empire building (principally by choosing
good people)?

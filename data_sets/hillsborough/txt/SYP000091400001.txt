N o r t h S t a nd a nd the        h alfway     line on the          pitch.

At a time         I can only estimate             to have         been a bout       two or three m i nu te s

a fter    I had seen the            players      leave      the     football       pitch     in the area

a r o u n d the goal at          the L e p p i n g s L an e      end of the ground.

At this time            the N o t t i n g h a m F ore st    s up po r te r s at the S p i o n K op end of

the g round were            chanting and jeering.                   I cannot       remember what           the

chants and jeers were,                 but they were             o b v i o u s l y d ir e ct e d at the

L iv er p oo l    fans who were s pilli ng             out of the t erracing at the L ep pi ng s

Lane     end of the g ro un d onto the               pitch.

At a bout        this time about          two or three m in u te s after                   the   players had

left the         pitch my a t t e n t i o n was      f o cu s ed on the L ep p in g s Lane              end of

the g round at the L iverpoo l                  s u p p or t er s who we re pos i t i oned a r o u n d the

a r ea   in front of the goal.                  I saw one Live rp oo l            s up po r te r s   break away

from a g roup of these s u p po rt er s who were                        p os it i on e d    in front       of the

goal     on the S o u t h S t a n d side.           This      s u pp or te r    ran out of this g ro up of

fans a nd s p r i nt ed a cr os s         the    centre       of the      pitch towards          the S p i o n Kop

end of the g round a nd the                 chanting a nd jeering N o t t i n g h a m F orest                    fans.

This young man ran up to the area just                              in front of the goals at the

S p i o n Kop end of the ground,                 he s to od       in this       p o si ti on facing the

N o t t i n g h a m F orest    sup porters.        I saw this y oung man then                    raising     both

arms on about            four o c c a si on s give         "v"    signs w i t h both hands             to the

Nott ingham F orest            s u p p o r t e r s , these g es t ur e s       by this y oung man

r es u lt ed     in an a n g r y    r eaction from the N o t t i n g h a m F o re s t            supporters.

The young man had not been                    in this       p os it io n for very           long w h e n    I saw

two P o l i c e m e n    running     towards      this young man,               the P o l i c e m e n were

running towards             him from the S ou th S t a n d side of the ground,                          both

these P o l i c e m e n were w ea r i n g        helmets.

The young m an who             had been g e s t i c u l a t i n g at the           crowd having         seen the

r e action he created turned a r o u n d a nd s t ar t e d to run back a c ro s s the

pitch towards            the L e p p in gs Lane      end of the ground,                trying        to dodge
                                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                                 S3566

              past the two P o l i c e m e n who were            now trying     to stop him.

              Both Policemen            caught    this      young man    in an area a r o u n d     the centre          of

              the    pitch,      the young m an was a n g r y beca us e as the              p ol i ce m an    caught him

              one    poli ce ma n p os it i o n e d to either        side    of him,    he was s t r u gg l in g

              tryng to get free,              I saw this y oun g man hit out w it h one of his

              hands.          I can't    remember w h i c h one,      but he hit the P o l i c e m a n

              p o s i ti on ed on the S o u t h S t an d side        of him k no c ki n g    the P o l i c e m a n ’s

              helmet      off as he struck           him,    1 cannot    be sure w h i c h part of his a rm or

              hand struck         the    policeman.          B oth P o l i c e m e n then took a firm hold of

              the young man and w a l k e d him off                the   pitch towards       the   a r e a of the

              players         tunnel    although     I did not see w he re       they a c t u a l l y took       him.

              I never a c t u a l l y saw the young mans face                 I can only d es c ri b e        him as a

              w hite man a ged          I w o u l d estimate a bo ut 20 to 25 y e a r s , he w a sn 't very

              tall     about 5 * 7 “ and slim in build,              he had blonde hair            that      I think was

              b elow    collar     length a n d sc ru ff y        looking.     I think he may have              been

              w ea r i n g a white Tee        shirt,     1 c a n ’t really     remember a n y t h i n g      else about

              his    clothing.

              I cannot         be any more       precise a bout      this    incident    because       due     to the

              passage of time the             incident       is now vague      in my memory.

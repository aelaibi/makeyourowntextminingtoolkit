On Saturday                   15th April             1989         I was       at     t he     ground          and       employed              as     usua

 about           2'0      clock          about      200       to 3 0 0        supporters            came          through             my tu rnstil

 After           2 ’0     clock          there      was       a   steady          flow       of    supporters                    coming          through

 the       turnstile                at      about     S.30pm           there       was       a    constant              queue          of    people

 culminating                   in a l o t      of     crushing              inside          my    turnstile                 from about               2.45p;

 onwards               un t i l     after       the        match        had    started.             This          was        the       worse         match

 ground            because             of    the     crush          some      supporters            were          unable              to    t a ke

 tickets               from       their        pockets,             they      also        pushed         through             two       together           an

proportion             of    t he      fans       had      been       drinking              alcohol,               I could         tell     this

by    the    swell          of    alcohol           on     their       breathe              their       violent          and       abusive

remarks          towards          me     in f ac t         I was       frightened                  I feared          they       would       get

into    ffiv a r e a        of    t he      turnstile            I have           never        experienced                this       at    anothe

football           match         that       I have         worked          at*

After       the       match       had       been     stopped           fans        were        coming          from       inside          the

ground       and       back       to     the      turnstile            and        threatening                 to    k il l    me     I could

only     think         that       was       because           what         they    had       witnessed              and what             state

they were             in.        I obviously               became          aware        t ha t      something             serious          had

happened             inside       th e      ground         but       I did        not       know what.

I recieved             a verbal             message           which         was    passed           down       the       line       of

turnstile             to    shut        the       outer       gate         and    when        the       abusive          started          again

against          us    I collected                al l     my    tickets           up        put    them       in two         bags,        then w

decided          together           to      go     out      to   the        outside           of    the       ground         and     pushed           tl-

'C      gate         which       was     op e n .        I saw         two       ambulances              and a        fire      engine.

Then        four      or    five        bodies          lying         on    the    ground,              there       was      people

attending             each       on e       I did       not      stop       I carried              on    to     the      stile       room.

There        was      at     least          one    ambulance               now    giving           mouth        to m o u t h

 resusctatian               and        some       fans      were       also       gathered              round       s om e     of    the

 people*             What        struck       me     was       that        none        of    them       had     many         clothes       on.

 One    of       them a male                had    j u st      boxer        shorts.               I could          not      say w h e t h e r         th

 people          were       dead       or     not*

 At    the       stile       room        I handed           my       tickets           in,    I was        totally            shocked           and     3

 was    told          to    go    home.           I did         not    see        or    hear       of     any      ticket          louts        that

 From       my       position           I did       not       s ee    gate        'C        being       opened         or     close,

 Prior        to      2.30pm        I was         approached               by     six       sevewn        eight        times        and     offer?

                                                 STATEMENT



I f ________________           of                                                                      wil 1
say as follows:-


I    was    born         on




I    have    been a turnstile operator for 8 or 9                                 seasons     and        am
therefore experienced.                      I became involved with the club as some
of my friends already worked here before.                                   That coincided             with
short       time       working           at work and I             began     to     watch    football
again.        I    became more involved and I now never                               miss    a        home
match.


Before       the commencement of each season, a meeting is                                   held        of
all the stewards, turnstile operators and gatemen at the                                            club.
This       meeting          provides            forthe        registration of       turnstile
operators          who        all        receive              a   pass. I    took     two    passport
photographs             along to the meeting and collected my ID card.                                     I
am also given a pass book with receipts for each match attended
and     match          day instructions               printed inthe back.               I    am        also
given match day instructions separately.


A briefing session also takes place at the meeting relating                                               to
safety.           As      far as I am aware this was introduced                             after        the
Bradford          City        fire disaster.                  The meeting lasts a           couple        of
hours       and is taken seriously by all those attending.                                    A        video

of     the Brad^erfd dinarster/ti^ shownAand we receive talks by                                         the
police       and        the        Fire Brigade.               The procedures        for     fire        are
explained          and        also the position of the extinguishers                              at     the
ground.           Any       alterations            in emergency             procedures       are"       also
explained.


I now turn to the events which took place on 15th April 1989 at
Hillsbrough.              I had been asked to arrive at the ground                                earlier
                                                    - 2 -




than usual and I arrived at about 11.20 am.                                I reported to             the
Stiles       room     which is located near the                    players         entrance.           I
report       to     aI                   i^s^gnsd^a. s H p - f rom u n y .^.booklet                 and
handed      - it-'-in,.     I     was     then        allocated        a       gate.     The        gate
allocation varies from match to match.
                                                                   I had a good              idea     of
what the crowd was going to be-like.


After I had been allocated          I walked round under the
south stand to the Leppings Lane turnstiles.   There  is no
choice with regard to turnstile allocations but I recall that I
was       working on the same section last year for the same                                   match.
I     was     given a key to open the turnstile as these                               are     locked
when        not in use.          I opened my turnstile in order that I                          could
let       the others in.           The doors all open inwards and                       once        mine
was       open      I could let the others in also.                        It is       possible       to
bolt the turnstile from the inside for safety.


I arrived at the turnstile at about 11.55 and noticed that some
turnstiles           had already opened.                  They were being_manned               either
ready        to     open   u p    o r   had already opened.                I    J^rt" "inside        the
turnstile           with the counter passing to the left of me.                                I     was
working           back to back with the turnstile operator in
          There is a wire mesh above the counter to protect me                                      from
 the supporters.

 I    opened        up to the public straight away                         although      there        was
 hardly        anyone      about.         People began to              trickle         through,       the
 turnstile.


 I did not have .-a- very good .view out of- the. turnstile- a n d it was
    the     same    behind me.          There is a frosted glass window                        in     the
    section        at the back of the turnstile and I could not                               see     the
- compound vefrjL w e l l                  -----—     *     —...   -
I could see a crowd just building up in front of me but I could
not see how far back it stretched.


I     knew that this was to be an all ticket match and                              i    had          been
told to take                   :ickets.     These are standing only.                    As far              as
I can remember                  these     were   blue     and     mauve       for        Liverpool
supporters             and     yellow      and    brown         for — Nottingham                 Forest
supporters.


Last     year we had been told that we could accept                            tickets                 from
the     wrong          end     of the ground.      This year we           were          told           that
                                                                                        L~ • * i s.. •'C.     -■

there       was a segregated section at the kop end                        for          Nottingham
Forest       fans.           We were therefore told to allow some                       supporters
through          with Nottingham Forest tickets and to send some                                    back.
It was the police who issued those instructions.                                I do not know
the identity of the police officer but I noticed that he had                                                  a
beard        and         was wearing a flat cap.            He was on           duty             inside
 the compound.               At this time the ground was very quiet and there
were very few people seeking to gain entrance.                                There may                have
been about 5 people with Nottingham Forest tickets but this was
 really a very small number.


 I    did        not     accept any money from supporters                 wanting              to           buy
 entrance.             Money was offered to me but was not handed over.                                       I
 told supporters that no money would be accepted.                               If money                    was
 offered,          at this, time, I was able to turn people away.                                 Up         to
 2.00       pm     the ^c4rr gradual ly built up.                 I     was     counting                    and
 numbering             tickets as I collected them.              Up to 2.00 pm                 I        took
 less than 300 tickets.                 I was bagging them up as I went                            along.

 I    then pressed a pedal with my foot to operate the                                  turnstile.

normal semi final crowd although it was a bit slower than                                     last
year.           The       crowd gradually built up until about 2.30                      pm    and
 after         that it began to get much bigger.                    Things began         to    get
much        worse         and, indeed, this was the worst crowd I                      had    ever
 seen.         People were getting crushed into the gates.


 There came a time when I could no longer see any police outside
 the        ground.          All I could see were the bodies               of    supporters.
 Once the supporters were coming through the turnstiles                                  quickly
 I       was    no        longer able to count and number the                tickets          as    I
 collected               them.      At this stage I had no time to              turn         people
 away.           Some peopl e ’s arms were crushed against their sides                              so
 that          they      were    unable     to get their       tickets       out       of     their
 pockets            or     had great difficulty in doing so.                 This       had        the
 effect          of slowing things up and made the situation                         worse.          I
  noticed           that     many were drunk and were abusive                and,       at     that
  time,         a     lot were threatening me with             violence.           I    estimate
  that'the time would have been 2.45 to 2.50.                           The situation              was
  getting           worse.       No   one   was offering me money          at      this       stage
  because           I had no option         but to let them            pass into the          ground.
  I      could        not contact the police inside the                 compound        at     this
  stage         as I did not have           the time to open my door            in     order        to
  attract the attention of the officers on duty.


  people were screaming at me as they came through the turnstile.
  They         seemed        to be crushed but not injured.                Supporters          were
     trying         to squeeze through the turnstile in twos                    and,         indeed,
     that      is something which had been happening earlier.                           It is       an

     old trick.

     I    hear.d vthe: roar of the. crowd .and .assumed: that rthe: - game .,-•must -

     turnstiles            from the outside of the ground.               By now things              had
- - g o t s o -'fead-                                  'p e o p l    t-hrotigb-^ ■ 'l-’^ e^ltrc-ted
a        ticket if I could but if not I was just         letting       supporters
through.           I     remember in particular seeing one woman            who     was
absolutely             terrified.     Other supporters coming     through          were
frightened and abusive.


I        did not notice anyone climbing over the         turnstile          building
or,        at least, I did not hear anyone climbing over.              There        did
not appear to be a great deal of noise but the supporters                          were
shouting.              The   supporters were not trying to      jump    over        the
turnstiles themselves.


Ail of a sudden the crowd simply disappeared.


My        next job was to attempt to count tickets.          There were            more
than I had ever seen before.               I started to count them and             then
the order came from the ga^emen to close the outside gates.                          By
that        time       the gateman had been told by a steward          or    by     the
police that there was hardly anyone outside the gates.                       I could
just see two or three mounted police through the turnstile.                            I
did not notice anyone else at all outside.


I        knew that something had gone wrong as I was trying to                    count
my tickets.             Supporters started to bang on the turnstile window
and        make threats towards me.         By now it was about 3.15.               They
were threatening me with violence.               I could not see any              police
anywhere.


I        was    working on a stopping gate.       This means that           the     gate
 stays open for late comers.               It would have been my job to             keep

The five of us working turnstiles                         decided to collect               our
tickets        together, uncounted, and to leave the                     turnstiles.         I
recall       that I had two full bags of tickets to count.                         It      was
impossible           for me to stay in the turnstile to count                    them.       I
was    becoming            frightened by now so x        bundled all        the    tickets
into     two     bags.            I usually fill one cash          bag    with     counted
tickets.        Each cash bag is issued with two receipts.                       One     goes
in     the     bag        with tickets and the other          is    attached       to      the
outside.        On this occasion I had two full bags but only one set
of     receipts.           I eventually handed them in to the               stiles       room
but     I do not know what became of them thereafter.                        I    seem      to
remember that all the tickets were put into a large sack.


It     was     apparant          that we were unable to walk back           across         the
compound        to        the    stiles room because of the         presence       of      the
Liverpool        fans.          We therefore decided that we would               all     exit
out     of my gate to the outside of Leppings Lane.                        We could        not
see     turnstiles
                                   We   came out    of   my    turnstile          into     the


occurred.


We walked to the outside of gate C and took our badges off.                                 We
saw ambulances and fire engines and people lying on the                                ground
foging attended to by friends or ambulance men.                          They hardly had
any clothes on and I could see no clothes on the ground                                beside
them.One man was lying on the                      ground in just his            pants     and
socks.          I assumed that the rest of his clothes must have                         come
off in the crush.


We     walked        round       to the stile room to hand           in    our     bag.s     of
 tickets.            We     put them down and told the office              what     we      had
 seen.         Iwent home at about 3.30 to 3.40.               We were all in total
 shock.                                 . . . .

I    was not aware that C gate had opened as my    view    from     the
turnstile was restricted.     I did n ot see the crowd surging from
the tunnel.


I    know that there were police stationed on both sides      of    the
turnstiles     and that they were certainly there early on.        Some
of the police officers took off their top coats and put them in
my   turnstile for safety.


I    have been interviewed by and have given a statement      to    the
police.


This statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief.

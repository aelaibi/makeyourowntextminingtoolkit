Dear Mr Atkins,

I am,compiling jnformation about the construction of all-seater stadia for
British football clubs, and wonder if you could supply me with informaqtion
which would greatly assist my research.
It would be easier if I list my requests as follows:
a) Was the Football Trust set up directly by the government, and what is its
   address?
b) Why doesn't the government provide more money to help with the stadia-
   rebuilding programme taking into account that most football clubs (especia­
   lly the smaller ones) cannot afford to convert their terracing?

c) why are only football grounds affected, and not the stadia of other sports?    j-f~jT)
d) has the ministry compiled data which detail the individual changes and
   costs to each league club involved? May I have copies of any such data?         Up 7
e) who comprised the Taylor Committee?                                            tto       .

f) What sort of penalties will the government inflict on those clubs who are
   slow to, or who cannot, implement the changes you demand?                      /to

g) What level of support does the government feel it has achieved from i) the
   general public ii) football supporters in general iii) the football league
   clubs for the proposals set out by Lord Justice Taylor?
h) By what time does the government expect to have all-seater stadia in
   operation?

i)How does the British government view the level of investment that the
iItalian government put into stadium-rebuilding for the 1990 World Cup? What
   is stopping the British government from following suit?

Thank you for answering my questions: I want to be able to understand properly
the reasons for the government's stance on these matters, and I look forward
to hearing from you in the very near future.

                     Yours sincerely,

Between        10.3G      (1030)       and   10.45am         (1045),     we     left      from St Peters

Church,      Kirkby,        and we        d i d n ’t stop until about S miles                      outside        of

S heffield,         at a pub,          but   I can't         remember        the    name       of tne     pub or area.

We all       went    into        the    pub for a drink.

We had t r a v e l l e d via the P e n n i n e s               and even up tc tna                ground we         did

not    qet     into any          traffic     problems          causing delays.

The    pub wa went           into,       w h i c h was a very s.r.a;,              one.    was a i.so s erviv";g

We a r r i v e d at        the gr o u n d at 2. 4 0           pm   {14 4 u ).

On arrival           at    the    ground,       unlike         last year,        there were         no organised

 queues,       there was          just a mass           of    people     from L e p o m g s        Ln    into     the

 turnstiles.

 From    the     junction          of L a p p i n g s Ln to the          ground        leading      to the

 turnstiles,           there were a number                   of    police     officers         on duty,     including

 about 6 moun t e d           pox ice of iicers.

 T did not see any                 stewards        on duty but         there were              so many    people        it

 was    difficult.

 At    the L a p pings Ln point                 of the       ground,     the mounted             police were

 letting        100 to       150       people     t h r o u g h a cordon at a t i m e , but the number

 of    people        trying       to get     to    the    turnstiles was so great                   that    I felt

front were          pushing           back an d      those at the                back were        pushing          forward.

By this       time,       S t e v e n R O B I N S O N a n d me had got through the                            cordon          but

The     f o ll owing      process          by the m o u n t e d officers                  was    to        close    the

turnstiles          nearby,           tnere w ere           too m any      people         in a confined space                   and

 just got          the    turnstile          c;osn.         This    turnstile           was     one of       the    first        tnrst

 On going          through the            turnstiles           there were           no signs telling you where

 the turnstiles and the                         tunnel       leading       to behind the goals,

  I then went            through          tne    tunnel       and went           into    pen one or two                 (rignt

  of the      tunnel           on   leaving       it)    and there was              no problem going                    through

  the    tunnel      at ail           just      before       the    kick off,           about E . 5 5 pro (1435).

Neither     did      1 see an y o n e     drinking         in the ground.

I made my way from             pen    1 or £ back           in front           of     the West S t a n d by the

opening     of the       tunnel,      this w o u i d       be about o •03 pro ( 1305*) «

There was      then a roar           from the        crowd and a surge of                    people       from    the

tunnel    which       pushed       into    pen 4 down to P7 on the griu you have                                 shown

me.

A- this     time      it was a b s o l u t e       chaos.            i did not       see any      ot     i»hs

barriers      break ana         I dorrt      think     I was          near any that            did break.

I had taken up roy position                  ori gnally              in can    '1 at ajcui £,35p:T! { 1453),

Havim:: m oved        into     pan 4,      I did not            know anyone          araunu ka and,

although      it was        chaotic:,      I did     not witnes-: any                direct     fighting         or

disturbances          to    cause    any     problems           at    that    time.

(1'305).

I believe       the     crowd      surge was        caused           by the    roar when Liverpool                had

had an attack           on the Notts Forest                goal.         Ev e r y b o d y wa n t e d     to see what

was     going on.

ynen     this surge         o c c u r r e d with    people           panicking        and    i tried toc i x;,ia

 over the     perimeter            fencing    onto     «ne       pitch.        As     a re^Uit      uv une

 over    I received a br o k e n nose               but     I    am not       sure now t'ni* injury was

 sustai ned

 On getting          onto    tne    pitch    ! was     crying          in fea-        and a l t h o u g h   I didn't

 see    someone       die    1 saw a youth,          in his           late    teens      he- would       be,    lying

 in the     six yard         box and       1 knew he was              dead.         He was    lying on m s

 back,     his eyes were            open and ins           face was. covered                in b.i.oou.

 I said to a Police                Officer,     " H e ’s d e a d , " but the Police Officer

 said,     " N o , h e 's n o I .“

 1 was     taken by a Police Officer                   to the          first aid         point so        I did not

 assist anyone             on the    pitch.

          to panic             or    pass-out       or be     c ar r i e d or knoc k e d to the ground by such a

Wh it e Hog% e Pub and drank the                 cans,    I had 2 cans and the others              had 4

cans      &afch I think,        at about 25 past 2           we star ted walk ing down         towards

the g/ound,          ev e r y b o d y seemed to be       in high spi rit s singing       but      I

d i d n ’t see any vi olence              or drunk ene ss whi lst wal kin g      to the ground.

We a r r i v e d at the en trance            to the tu rn st il es at about 25 to 3.

                     one of his fr iends and                              went off to the No rth

S t a n d t u rn st il es and       I stayed wi th                   and the other friends                 of

                   On arrival        at the t u r n s t i 1 % / there w e r e n ’t any queues at all

just a mass of fans trying                   to get through,                    backed off at              this

point and         I pushed my way th ro u gh ythe crowd wi t h the other                 lad in

fact we went to the side of the turns til es wh en all                          of a sudden,           at

ab ou t    10 to 3 I saw the blue               conce rt in a gates open and        I just     ran

t h r o u g h w i t h a load of other fans,              it seemed the only wa y        in and         I

thought       that    I w o u l d miss the kick off           if I didn't.       Out sid e   the

ground      I did see Police              on ho rseback    I think 2 maybe 3 and a couple on

foot      but they c o u l d n ’t do /a nyt hin g        there w e r e n ’t enough of them t h e r e .

Once      I got    inside the gr ou nd          I knew    I w o u l d n ’t have to hand my ticket

in a n d    in fact      I s t i l / have the full         ticket w h i c h   I want to keep.               I

just      foll ow ed the       ctyowd once      I was    inside,    and   I went thr ou gh the

tunnel      onto     the tei/races.          I went to the         left hand side of the goal.

I had no pr ob le m s / g o i n g along          the tunnel and        I d i d n ’t see an y Pol ic e

or S t e wa rd s at the start of the tunnel                   or    in the tunnel    dir ec ti ng          us,

            When    I got onto the terraces                 I realise that       it was full         but   I c o u l d n ’t

            get    out     if I w a n t e d to and     I was forced down towards the front of the

            ter r a c e s .     I found my se lf     tra pp ed agai nst a        crash barrier the            crowd

            then seemed to crush a r o u n d me and                 it was    like a vice sl ow ly           closing.

            I c o u l d n ’t move my right arm an d I was fighting                        for breath.        I was

            pe tr if ie d and      I really thought           I was going      to die.        I found that         I

            c o u l d n ’t move and the        pressure was         coming from all          sides,    e v e ry bo dy

            was    sc reaming and sh outing at the Po li ce                  or an y b o d y to help us.           I

            found myself          side on to the b a r r i e r , just before               I was    pushed aga in st

            the barrier.           I was    sick and        I realised that       I had been sick all              down

            the bloke standing             next to me,        I did ap o l o g i s e to him and he did

            a c k n o w l e d g e me but he was      in a really bad way,             he was fighting            for

            breath and screa mi ng           out for help whe n he            could.       All     of a sudden

            there se emed to be a slight move men t                   in the     crowd and he d i s a p p e a r e d

            from my view and al mo st             i mm ed iat ely    I became aware          of the fact that               I

            was    standing       on s o m e b o d y and    i/i must have     been him but          I cannot      say

            for    sure,

                                               I ^fcouldn’t do an yt hi ng about stand ing on him if

            it was him but           I m a n a g e d to ease my way round the edge of the barrier

            and    I got      in front     of it,    the     crush was still        on at this        point      but    I

            found     I could breath s l i g ht ly better.              I noticed some Police                pulling

            fans over the fence             in front of me.          A f t ^ r -* about    10 minu tes     the

            pressure        seemed to relax and I mana^^S'd to work my way over towards                                 the

            gate and I f ound myself              in f roijjeof the fencing and               it had been ripped

            upwards.          I tried to      c 1 im by th ro ug h but a P o l i c e m a n stopped me at first

            but after he was sh ou t e d ^ at              that   I was hurt he       let me through.             I then

            went and          lay down on the       pitch so I could get my breath back,                      I then

            got up and a P o l i c e m a n told me to stay down if I was hurt                          but    I told

            him I was alright,             I also    told him people were dead on the terraces

              but he d i d n ’t seem to do anything.                 I then went over and helped fans

              rip the a d v e r t i s i n g    hoardings     d o w n , we then    carried an    injured fan

              down to the first ai d area,                when we star ted        carrying    him he seemed          in

              pain and was semi           conscious and g^cining           he wasn't making an y sense,

              but by the time we got him toy % h e                first aid he wasn't mov ing            he may

              have    been u nc on sc io us      or h^/could have       been d e a d .    I just don't         know       I

              a n d one of the people helping                carry him was        his mate.     His mate

              st op p e d wi t h him and        I went    back and I then saw people who were

              o b v i o u s l y dead and the      rest were being t re at ed by the Pol ice and St

              Johns A m bu la nc e     I couldn't        do any more and         I went and sat down by the
    S ^|"
              corner flag.         Eventually          I heard a loud speaker an no un c e m e n t       telling

              us the game        had been a b a n d o n e d and    I left the ground and met up with

              my mates and we went              back to Liverpool




              I have thought about what                 hap pe ne d that day and      I think that wh e n the

              d e c i s i o n to open the gates was made they should have                     put Pol ice      or

              S t e wa rd s   on the    inside to direct        the fans away from the tunnel                 and the

              centre of the terraces              because they must have known that the                  central

              ar e a was full,         if this had been done          I am quite      sure nobody w ou ld have

              lost    their     lives.        I also    think that the     pens at all        grounds    should be

              removed and the front fences                  removed or better        larger gates       put    in.

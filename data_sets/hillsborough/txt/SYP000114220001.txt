               Packed       m e a 1 was         provided         and    eaten       in     the   stand       p r ior     to    taking        up

               Positions          were       taken        up at    the       turnstiles          in      plenty     of    tim e      for     them

               opening       at    12     noon.           One    turnstile          opened       up at       about       1 1 . 5 0 am,       they

              were     all    open        by a b o u t      12. 1 0     pm.

               Initially          I was         paired      up w i t h PC          3066     Huckstepp         at    the       turnstile

               nearest       the       barrier,           furthest       away       from      the     wall.

              Once     spectators               began      to    arive       the    numbers         were     low    enough          to a l l o w

               that    EVERYONE           was       searched       before          entering         the     ground.           Other-

               off i cars     on       the      serial      made       arrests        for     various        offences          committed           by-

               persons       attempting              to    enter       the    ground.

              The     first       arrivals          at     the    ground, w e r e          generally         very      good     humoured,

               sober    and       caused         few      problems.

As    the       numbers          arriving           at   the        turnstiles          began        to    grow      - from about

2    pm    onwards,         the      searching             of       spectators          became         selective               - but       the

atmosphere            was        a / i ? ral ly still, good.

At    t his      time/^the           number          of P o l i c e        Officers           on d u t y       had    decreased             at

these       tuB^rstiles            due     to       prisoners             having       been arrested.

    t 2.3D       pm   or     t h e r e a b o u t s,      the        numbers       at    th e gates             s w e lled

considerably.                    Many     of    these          late       arrivals           were    Worse       for       drink       but,

may       not    be   classified               as    dr un k .        They       were        singing       and       chanting          and        ■

began       to    push       from        the    back,          causing          congestion           between          the       barrier

and       the    wall       on    the     approach             to    the    turnstile.

Further          problems          were        caused          by    numerous          supporters              working          their       way

to    the       turnstiles           and        fin di ng that             they        had     no    t i c k e t at all,         or        that

they       ha d a      ticket        for        a n o t h e r part of            the    gro u n d .

Many       Liverpool             supporters              had    bought          their        tickets       -from the

Nottingham            area        where        they       lived,          but    they        wanted       to    stand          with    the

Liverpool             supporters,              not       with       the    Notts.       i~   a rest.

ground,          even       though        there          tickets          were    for        the    Notts       I- o r e s t    kop    end

outside            of       the    barrier          and        tried         to    force          themselves             in at       the

turnstile.                   This       caused        a great            deal          of    trouble          - . resulting           in f i g h t s

people         were          getting          hurt.

A    number         of       children             were     lifted            out       of    the       crowd and          carried

Of. the        drunken             youths          trying          to    push          in at       the       front       of    the

he      had    no       idea w h e r e            he was.            I had         pulled          him       out    of    the       crowd       twice

already,            he       had       been       assaulted             several             times       by    other       spectators                but

still         continued                to    make     for       the      turnstiles.                    He    was                                    I

             became     yiolent        when       prevented            from        entering    the   tunnel.

             Once    the    game      was    abandoned             and    the      majority     of   spectators          had      left

             rejoined       other      members          of m y      serial.

             police     officers           pushed       up a g a i n s t      the     gates    and   the    walls,,      and      for

             the    barriers.

             If    I had    been      in    charge        outside         the      ground     1 would      not    have      hesitated

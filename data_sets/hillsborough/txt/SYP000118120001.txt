                    positions            in        the       ’m o u t h *       of     the       entry       to    ground        and        the       Leppings          Lane

                   On     reaching                Leppings          Lane          I    immediately                noticed        that           there       was    a

                    large         number           of    Liverpool                supporters             in       the    area.          They          were    just

At    12.20       pm    together                with          Police       Constable             2902          Roberts          we       spoke       to       a

loud    noisy          crowd       of          fans       who       were    stood          on    the       footpath.                 It       was

ascertained             that       two          of    the       youths          w e re     selling             tickets          for       the

semi-final.              They          were          both       arrested             and    one       of       the       youths          had    twenty

original          semi-final                   tickets          and       £760.00          in    cash          on    his       possession.                         *

The    youths          were       arrested                and       escorted          to    the       Police              room       where          they

were    processed             and          detained.                 One    of       the    youths             was        later       released

after    a    Verbal          Caution                and       escorted          from       the       ground.

At    1.15    pm       the    same             date       I    returned          back       to       the       Lippings             Lane       end    and

joined       my    Serial.                 I    immediately                noticed          that          the       turnstiles                were    now

open    and       although             a       small          number       of    fans       were          entering             the       ground,          a

large    number          of       fans          were          unconcerned             and       content             to    crowd          around       all

over    the       foot paths               and       roads.           A    number          of    fans          were       drinking             from

beer    cans       and       singing             football             songs.

I    joined       the    other             Police             Officers          to    stop       the       fans           from       drinking                      ?

alcohol       and       tried          to       move          them    off       the      road        towards              the       turnstiles.

Although          some       were          co-operative,                   there         was     a    large          number          who       were        now

getting       quite          drunk             and    abusive.              I     know      for       a    fact          that       on    a    normal

match    day       these          youths             would          have    been         arrested              but       the    sheer          number

of    drunken          fans       in       the       crowds          would        not      have       made          this       feasible.              The

crowd    was       getting             large          and       noisier          by      the     minute             and    they          were       still

content       to       stand       around             everywhere                instead          of       going          into       the       ground,

the    turnstiles             were             comparatively                quiet          considering                   the    large          crowd.

At    approximately                2       pm    the          Leppings          Lane       road       was          closed       for       safety

reasons       and       as    a    result             a       few    minutes          later          the       entire          road       was       now

filled       with       fans.              Along          with       other       officers             I was          totally             involved

in    attempting             to    control                the       crowd       by    encouraging                   them       to    enter          the

ground.           The    mounted                officers             were       also       having          a       trying       time.

At    2.35    pm       I was      alerted                 by    a    loud       noise       coming             from       Leppings             Lane

approximately                fifty          yards             from    the       turnstiles.                    I    could       see       that       some

On    reaching          the    Police             Room       I    took       no       further         part          in    this          matter                and

North       Stand       I was       unable             to    get       outside           to     my    Serial.                 I    saw

Inspector          Woodward             at    this          location             and     as     per       his       instructions                      I

commenced          duties          at    this          location.

It    was    obvious          to    me       that       the       large          crowd         outside          the       turnstiles                      was

becoming          increasingly                uncontrollable                      as     fans        were       spilling                into          the

ground       from       the    top       of       the       turnstiles                and      those       coming             through             the

turnstiles          were       highly             emotional             and       gasping            for       air.

Some    were       aggressive                in    their          mood       and       threatening                  Police             Officers

with    physical             harm       and       some       were        crying          and     shocked             but          they       were             all        (

seen    an    old       man    fall          to    the       floor          in    the        crowd        and       for       almost             ten                     1

again       and    she       felt       that       he       was    still          on     the     floor          whilst             everyone                   was        j

standing          all    over       him.                                                                                                                                 j

I    then    heard       that       the       gate          ’A*    was       being           momentarily                 opened             to    prevent                |

I    then    went       through             the       gates          *A ’ a n d          jo i n e d      some          of    the      Police

Officers          in    my       Serial          on    Leppings                Lane.           There          was          still      a    large

number       of    people          outside             and          it    was       obvious             that       a       large       number           of

them    had       no    tickets.                 I was          involved             in     moving            the          fans      without

tickets       away          from       the       ground             when       I    heard       a       radio          message            requesting

urgent       assistance                in    the       ground.                 I went          with       other             officers           into          the

ground       onto       the       pitch          near       the          Leppings           Lane         terracing.

I    first    of       all       thought          that          a    pitch          invasion             had       taken           place       as       a

large       number          of    fans       w e re        present             on    the       pitch.          A       few       minutes           later       I

noticed       that          Police          Officers                wre    pulling             the       perimeter                 fence       down          and

some    fans       who       were       injured             were          being          brought          onto             the     pitch.           I

hurried       to       the       assistance                of       these          fans     and         although             initially              the

injured       fans          were       m o re     shocked                and       out    of    breath,                I    realised           that

this    was       far       more       serious             as       lifeless             bodies          of    fans          were         be i ng

removed       onto          the    pitch.              I attempted                   to     resuscitate                     some       four        young

men    but    they          were       already             dead.

I    then    assisted             other          officers                and        fans       to       carry          these dead men                   from

the    pitch       at       the    Leppings                Lane          end        to     the      area        near             to t heg y m n a s i u m .

I must       have       done       this          several             times          when       I was          instructed                  by   a    senior

officer       to       remain          with       one       of       them.

At    4.10    pm       the       same       date       Dr.          Corpen          attended             and       certified               the      death

of    Graham       Shaun          Wright,             17    years,             I    then       remained                with        the     deceased

u n t i 1 6.SO         am    on    Sunday,             16th          April          1989.           I    then          accompanied                 the

deceased          via       ambulance             to       the       Medico          Legal          Centre             where         he    was

documented             and       left       in    the       care          of       the    mortuary             staff.

I    went    off       duty       at    6.43          am    the          same       date.

             On S a t u r d a y    15th A p r i l 1989      (150489),       together with five friends,              I

             m a t c h between Liverpool            Football        Club and Nott i ngham Forest.



             I am a supporter             of Liverpool       F ootbal L-^.1 u b , I have been attendi ng

             both home and away fixtures                    regularly since        I was about      sixteen years

I a c t u a l l y t r avelled to the game without a ticket                 but    I was due to

meet a friend outside             the Leppings Lri entrance          to the ground,          who    had

got a ticket          for me,    the ticket was a six           pound ticket for the

L e p pings       Ln terraces.



I travelled to the game wit h the following                      people,    who j/e re all

                  Xe re rice MOORE,                                        Liverpool   .




I don't          know any more    details     regarding       the above addresses          or any

telephone         numbers.



All    six of us t r a velled to S he f fi e ld together            in a van belonging             to

                       we   left Liverpool         at about    10.30 am    (1030).



I can't          remember what    route we took other           than we went by M anchester

and through a lot of villages.



W he n we started our           journey we stopped         in Liv&fpol      at a cash and          carry

and we      purchased a case          of   lager    c o n t a i c a n s .        ■,



As we were driving             by Mant^hester on a m o t o rw a y we were held up             in very

heavy slow moving             traffi/ and once a gain we were held up on a m o t or w ay
■4                       v
just    outside Sheffield.             On this motorway,         the one just outside

Sheffield,         we were     held up for about one hour           between about          12.30 pm

(1230)      and     1.30 pm    (1330),     the traffic was       hardly moving,       everyone was

                                                                                                              53201

           getting       out of their        vehicles and walking about and                  chatting.        It was

           w he n we were stuck            in this       traffic jam that two or three of the

           people       I travelled wit h m a na g ed to buy tickets.                     I c a n ’t be sure who

           amongst       the six of us had travelled to the game" without                         tickets.          I

           think Paul H EW I TT S QN and maybe              one of the yohers mana ge d to buy s p a re

           tickets       from other Liverpool             s u pp o r t ers/who w ere also      stuck       in the

           traffic       j a m , but    I can't    say for sur



           As far as         I was aware       once we a r ri ve d at the ground and              I got my own

           ticket,       then      I believe we all        had tickets        for the game.



           We a r ri v e d    in     S he f fi e ld at   I think about        1.4^   pm    (1345),    we    parked

           the    van    in a side street          very close to the ground,                I can't    say what

           the    name of the          street was.



           It took       us about      five minutes        to walk     to the q / o u n d , we got to the

5-0        L e p pings Ln end of the gro und at about                  1■50 ypm ( 1 3 5 0 ).     At this time

  - *— ‘   there were a lot of              people around the groyrid but                 it wasn't    too    packed

           by the       turnstiles.         There were other          supporters     standing and sitting

           had all       gone,     we had given a lot away to other supporters                        stuck    in the

           traffic       jam.



           My se l f and Paul H E W I T T SO N walked away from the entrance                      to the ground

           after a couple of minu te s               to see    if we    could find an off-li ce nc e            to

           buy some       cans of       lager.     We went     off on our own and wa lk ed up a hill

           for only a couple of minutes when we found a little grocery shop which

           sold    beer.        They only had a few           cans    left,    all   their stock       haty been

                                                                                                33201

iold.     We bought about 4 or 5 cans of S te l Aa Artois                        lager



Just    after we had      come out of the shop,            Terence M OORE          came up and

joined us.      Me,     Paul    and Terence      sat outside       the shop drinking our

cans,    there were quite a few people sitting                    by us, we all           had a bit of

a sing song,       it was a nice         happy atmosphere.          I    m w     no signs     of any

trouble and a lt ho ug h a lot of             people were    drinkAng           cans of beer     like

we were,    I never saw anyone who              1 w ould say was drunk,             everyone     just

seemed to be happy singing and excited.



We   sat outside      the shop w ith the other            supporters       for about half an

hour and then we wa lk ed             back down towards      the ground.



I can't    remember      seeing m any Police about           until      we got      close to the

ground,    we   never    had any sort of escort.             I can't           remember   seeing any

Police    giving directions           to the supporters,          it just seemed          that all

the s upporters were           following      each other    down t^sw^rds the ground.



We got down by the entrance                 to the ground Jrn Leppings Ln at about 2.30

pm (1430),      maybe a bit         later    I can't be /ure.           When we got there

myself,    Paul H EW I TT S ON and Terence MOO/ E           sat on the bridge over the

river    by the ground entrance.



T here were     no queues at          the tau^nstiles at     this       time,     about 2.30     pm

(1430),    just a mass         of   people.     This mass    of    people s tretched back

from the    turnstile      entrance and beyond the outer                  gates,     w hich    I think

were    open.   At this        time    there were masses      of    people walking along

L ep pings Ln and across            the bridge where we were sitting and joining

onto    the mass   of people          heading   towards    the turnstiles.

            There was          such a crowd at the turnstiles we decided to sit on the

            bridge and wait                 for    things to quieten down before we tried to get                                  into

            the ground.              Myself,       Paul     H E WI TT SO N and Terence MOORE all                     had tickets

            for    the Leppings Ln standing area                                 (t e rjra.c e s ) .

            The    number of people                 by the turnstiles                    d i d n ’t seem to be reducing,            by

            about 2.45          pm (1445)           we were       s\till sitting                on the bridge a nd the mass
                                                                   \
            of people was                 now building       up back beyond the outer gates and towards

            the    road.



            I can't       remember           how many       but    I saw some P o / i c e m e n on horses                  just

            outside       the outer           gates,       they were              shouting at           people to get      back and

feUCd       I think       they were           trying       to organise               things       but they w e r e n ’t doing any

            good,    there were too m any                   people       in that area for them to organise.

            There were          other P o l i c e me n rni.ng 1 ed/i n wit h the                        crowds and two standing

            right    next      to the three            of u s U ^ f the bridge.                        I c a n ’t remember

            seeing any stewards                    outside    organising                 the    crowds.



            At about 2.50                 pm (1450)    the three             of us had decided that we w o u l d n ’t

            be able       to get           into    the ground before kick off time                            because of the

            number       of    people        trying    to get          in.



            The    s i t uation by the              t urn stiles was                hectic,       it a pp ea re d that     people

            were    getting          frust ra te d because              nobody seemed to be getting                      into the

            g r o u n d and because               it was    getting          closer         to the k i c k off      time     people

            were    becoming annoyed.



            A couple          of minutes           later,    I c a n ’t be sure of the exact                       time,     between

            about 2.50          pm        (1450)   and 2.5 5       pm <1455),                I heard Terence M OORE say
                                                                                                                  PAGE            6
                                                                                                                  S3201

              that     someone was        going      to open a gate.        At this         time   I was     talking to

              other     supporters and as far as                I can remember Terence M OO RE and Paul

              H E W I T T S O N went    off together.         I d i d n ’t a c t u al l y see them go.          W hen    I

              f i n i s h e d talking     I turned around and they had gone.                       I cannot say         in

              w h i c h direction they went.



              That     was the     last time         1 saw Paul HEWITTSON.             I cannot       be sure     but    I

              think Paul had probably drunk about                      eight    cans of       lager    like the      rest
                    x-—  i— ■ '     -    —                                         ■■                     ■- ——       '■ '
              of us.      As far as           I am aware when        I last saw Paul          he was    in good

              health.



              I never      saw any gates            being   opened,    the only gates          1 saw open were           the

              t u rnstile     gates



              After     Paul and Terence             had gone,      I joined onto          the mass of       people and

              w o r k e d my way forwards           towards    the terrace       turnstiles.           I was    being

              crushed      in the mass         of    people   but    I m a na ge d to get      in thro ug h a

              turnstile,       I handed my ticket             into the turnstile             operator.       I c a n ’t be

              sure what       time      it was when         I got through the         turnstile,       but    I think        it

              was     just after the kick off.



              I got through the turnstile and the first tfvfng I saw was the entrance
                                 OVt"                   ' p l<Sr7s/5> )NK3i<£h£
              to the tunnel.  I never saw any signs^vo darect me to the terraces,

              but     everyone was        running towards           the tunnel       and    if there    had been

              signs     I probably w o u l d n ’t have seen them anyway.



              W ith    everyone        else    I was   running towards         the          'ance to    the tunnel,           I
CAT           can remember         seeing      some P ol i ce m en and I thiad              Rewards    in the a rea

              inside the turnstiles and towards                      the tun (/l entrance,            the Police were

O T A K / vD . ,iire c ting   people      towards      the tunnel

                                                                                                              S3201



         W ith    loads       of other    people,    I can't       estimate       how many,       1 ran into the

         tunnel,        as    I got   into the tunnel        I could see the             pitch and       I could see

         the heads           of the   players     on the    pitch as they were             running about.



         I would        estimate      I got about a quarter              of the way along          the    length of

         the     tunnel       and everyone       in front    of me started slowing down and

         e v e n t u a l l y we all     came to a halt.           People were       still    coming       into the

         tunnel        behind me and this          started a crush             in the tunnel.        The tunnel

         was     packed with people and wi th in a very short                       time of       corning to a

         halt     the    pressure       from behind started to             increase      quite suddenly,              the

         crush was           increasing and wi th in about              two minutes       I was    pushed along

         the     length of the tunnel             and out onto the back             of the terraces

         I had been to the 1968 semi-finai                    and       I h^d ex pe ri en ce d     crushing       but

         not     so severe,       so once       I got onto    t           ck    of the   terraces        I deci d e d

         to move        over    to my    left and forward,



         I had been           pushed down the       tunnel and          into    the back of       pen number          four

         (4),     I m oved over         to my    left and started          to move forwards          down the

         terraces,           the further    for ward    I moved down the terraces                  the    less

         c rushed       I became,       until    I e ve nt u al l y ended up in a position m ar k ed                   1/2

         on the a t t a ch ed grid         plan    (exh.no.       1)    (ref.        1).     When    I 'got to

         this     position,       a l t h ou g h the area was          very full    of people,       there was

         not much        crushing.



         Just     as    I got to this       position,       I remember F           er Bi-ARDSLb.¥ hitting              the

         cross     bar,       just as he hit the        cross      bar thej        was a surge       forwards at

n   /,   my position.            I went    forwards about a couple of steps and as                         is usual

         in a surge           returned backwards almost                to the    position    I had been          in

           before the        surge occur r e d .



           B efore B E A RD S L EY had hit    the        cross    bar and whilst working my way

           forwards and down           pen number        four    (4)    I had      looked    into    pen number

           three       (3) and   I had seen that          people       in that      pen were more         tightly-

           packed together         than we were          in pen number            four   (4).



           At   no time did        I witness any sort of disorder                    or any other         unusual

           i nci dent occurring         on the terraces.



           Just after B EA R DS L EY had hit the                cross bar         I remember      the game       being

           stopped.



£ v W S    As the game was stopped,           I saw people              trying      to      imb over      the
0'/fcu2_
           perimeter       fence   in pen numbers 4 and 3 to get <jmt-o the                         pitch.      At   this

           time    I    didn't know myself what           they were       doimj      this for.           I could hear

           people       shouting and screaming at the P o l i c e / o n the track                       by the   pitch

           to open up the gate           in the     perimeter          fence.       When    I heard all         these

           people shouting and screaming                  I realised something serious                    had

           happe n e d .



           There were        quite a few    people getting              out   q   $/pen four      (4)    onto    the
                         CAT"    Or*rr£-S>  A T              jAsaJO*£l
           pitch,       the gate in the perimeter fence w a y open, I went                          out onto         the

           pitch through this gate           to     look for m ^              iends.



           I d o n ’t remember        seeing anyone        in pen number            four    (4) who a p p ea r ed          to

           me to be        injured.



           As soon as        I got out onto        the    pitch I saw Terence M OORE and he told me

           that    people had died.         I haven't           got a clue what            time   it was when          I
                                                                                                   PAGE     9
                                                                                                   83201

got out onto the              pitch,



Once    I met        lerence M O O R E , we had a look a ro u nd and met

                      and                          who were also        on the   pitch.



We had a look about                for Paul H EW I TT S ON but         could not find him.          After

a time,       I ’m not sure how          long,      we all went        up the Royal H a ll i ms hi re

Hospital        to    look for P a u l .       Terence MOORE had said that Paul                 had been

crushed on the terraces                      It wasn't       until about midnight         on the    same

day the                              told us that Paul H E W I T TS O N had died.



To the best           of my knowledge          I did not       pers on al ly witness a ny d e a t h s , I

did not assist any of the dead or                       injured.



The    only things          that     I can say whi ch I think w a s ^ factor               in the

deaths    or     injuries was          the    lack of o r ga ni sa ti on outside       the ground and

also    inside        by allowing       too many       people    ir^o the     centre   of the

t e r races .        I did not witn ess a ny th in g           opr that    day whi ch I cons ide r ed

to be a criminal             offence.



After    the match was             stopp ed    I got/the       impression that the Police

didn't    have a clue what              to do,      jjmey were    very slow      in opening up the

gates    to     let    people      out, /At f/rst whe n         people were      trying    to   climb

over    the    perimeter        f e n c e \tOyAjet• out onto the          Ditch the Police we re

pushing       them back        in.



The    only thing           I want    to add       is that    I have    been to hundreds and

hundreds       of football           matches at numerous          different      grounds and       I have

never seen so m any             people       let    into a ground without         having    to show a

ticket.       I cannot u nd er s ta n d why the Police                 had to open up the gate and

the    back        r o utes.             Whilst          driving            towards              Sheffield           I saw a few

Liverpool              fans        travelling               by     car      but        I di d       not       se e a n y     drinking           of

alcohol.               We    drove          into       Sheffield              and       we       parked        in a s i d e        road        near      to

a    park        and    very          close       to     the       ground.              We       arrived         there       at    about        2.40pm

to 2 . 4 5 p m .            We     saw a few             police          officers                bu t    we    received           no     directions

or    escort           to    the       ground.              In f ac t         we w e r e          walking           with     the       shoppers.

We w a l k e d         into L e p p i n g s            Lane        an'             x    th e      bridge.            As we        got     outside

the    ground           I saw          two     police            ho r                  They       were        head     to    head and           the

officers           were          trying       to       stop        people          from          going        in/towards           the

turnstiles,                 but we          either          walked          around           o                                            As    I

walked           through           the      outer        gates          I realised my                    friends        were       no     longer

with     me a n d           I went          in w i t h        a mass          of       people.            I saw a           lot    of     people         on

top    of        the    walls          by    th e      turnstiles              because              of    th e      crush,        I presume

they     were          trying          to    get       out       of     it.        There          was     rumours           going        around

that     they          were        going      to       close          the     turnstiles                 and     people       were        shouting

that     it       c o u l d n ’t be          full        as      they       ha d       got       tickets         and another              rumour

was    the       m a t c h wa s          going         to     be      delayed.               I managed              to m o v e     do)4r\ the

side     by       the       fencing          to     the       ri y ^ r      and        I noticed              the    large/gates               were

g o i iVg t o w a r d s          some       turnsMles,                  but    the          next        thing       I know        I ’m    in a

tunnel.            Thats           how      confusing              it w a s .           As       I walked           down     the       tunnel,         it

was    th e       only way             I could           go      because           of       the     crowd,          I noticed            o n / person

on    th e       floor       and       people          were        treading             over        hiny; it wa s            impossible              for

anybody           to    stop and             help        him       because             of    the'“p u s h .          I got        to     the    en d     of

the    tunnel           and        I tried          to      look       for     a good             viewing           poin t    but        I wa s

pushed and              forced           i n t o pen 4■/                I eventually                    came     to a s t o p          immediately

behind a           large           man      near       to     the      dividing              fence        and       just     over        halfway

down     by a          rail.           I think           the       game       had a l r e a d y           been       stopped.             I

couldn't           even          tell       which        way Liverpool                      were        playing.            The    man        in f r on

of me        managed             to    turn       slightly             and     was          screaming            to me       to    push        back.

               I said        there       was    nothing             Ic o u l d       do.        I could       see        he       wa s s t r u g g l i n g .

               His    eyes     were      almost          r e a d y to        p o p oul/»          I said       to        him       to get          under          the

               rail.         He    bent       his    knees          and      w e n t \d/wn, he          never          managed           to     get     back

               up.      I    tried       to    get       him       u p but      he    was       too    heavy.            Whilst I was                 stuck

               there        I noticed         young       children and                  girls         being       physically                lifted        over

               gate.        The    crowd a p p ea re d               to    be     still         coming       in.        I saw          people

               climbing        over       people         stuck        in the           pen u s i n g     their          heads          or     shoulders

               to    c l i m b /acc/oss        to    the       front         to      get     out,      people          were       being         lifted            up

               into    the     seated area               from        the     back       of      the    pen.        I wa s         being         crushed

               and after          about       10 or       15 m i n u t e s           I managed          to w o r k       my way             across        the

               rail    towards          the    left       side        and       eventually             I moved          away        from        the     bar

               and    I managed          to m o v e       down        the       passageway             by a       couple          of     feet       but       I

               was    still       being       crushed.             The     crushing             carried       on       for a b o u t          another             10

               minutes       or    so,     then      it a p p e a r e d           to    be      easing       and       I went          towards          the

               corner       post    direction.                 I ca n        remember            climbing          over       a     fence.            I then

               walked       up a    couple          of    steps           through          a gate       and       on to       the        pi t c h .       I

               managed       to    get     h e re    at a b o u t          3.40pm.              I had    seen          peopl^' in the                 pen wh o

               appeared       to    be     unconscious.                    I also          saw    some       on    the     pitch.               I saw a

               policewoman          crying          and       I asked           her     what      had    happened             and        she       said

               s h e ’d h a d a     report          that       5    people           were       dead.

               This    really       upset       me,       I walked              around          for    10 or       15 m i n u t e s           in a      state

               of    shock.        I then       saw       the       man who            had      been    in f r o n t       o f me           in the        pen

               his    trousers          were    down          to    his      thighs.             He    was    lying        there            u n c o ry^ jz i o u s ..

               He    had a    friend with                him who           wa s      crying       over       him.        Together               < d { th a

               people       were    lying       on       boards.             Th e      m a n we       took    in s o r t          of     come       around             .

             people.          I believe           his     name             was                 but       I ’m    not       sure.     I walked

             back      out    onto     the       pi t c h .           I saw      no d i s o r d e r      or a n y         criminal    acts        only

             a   lot    of    heated arguments,                            I saw more         people         being         fetched    out        of    the

             minutes         later.         There       was           a definite          lack      of m e d i c a l        facilities           and

             the    gates       or    fences        should             be    designed         to    enable           a better       escape.            1

Footnotes:
   1 The tables show figures calculated on the basis that the same individual is claiming benefit in both March and April I989.
   z To protect people who would receive less benefit overall as a result of the change in benefit rules, transitional protection is provided as
follows:
         Long-term protection: for people m supported lodgings who receive care and support from the landlord.
         Up to 52 weeks: for families in hotels who are not sponsored by a local authority.
         Up to I3 weeks: for any other person on YIS or ET, or aged 25 or over, or a vulnerable person aged under 25.
         No protection: for fit, unemployed people aged under 25 who were previously subject to time limits.
   3 Actual housing benefit entitlement would be calculated by the local authority by deducting from the overall changes given, of£55, £44 or
£33, the appropriate amounts in respect of meals, fuel and other ineligible items to arrive at the eligible rent, which they may then restrict if
they consider it to be unreasonably high. The actual eligible rent could accordingly be higher than the £23 suggested resulting in a higher level
of housing benefit payable.
For the purposes of these tables, housing benefit entitlement has however been calculated on the basis of the suggested rent of £23 (which it
is assumed does not include the charges for water, laundry, cleaning, or any other ineligible items), and eligible rates of £3.20 (£4 less 20 per
cent.).
   * Disposable income has been calculated by deducting the following expenses from the gross income of income support, housing benefit and
YTS allowance (as appropriate):
        -- Overall charge of £55, £44 or £33 respectively;
        -- Travel expenses of £2.50 (for YTS participants).
   s It has been assumed that the individual
        a. is eligible for income support under regulation I3A of the Income Support (General) Regulations 1987; and
         b. was exempt from board and lodging time limits by virtue of paragraph 16(4) of schedule 5 of the Income Support (General)
           Regulations 1987, which was in force immediately prior to I0 April 1989.

Dear Mr Page

Hillsborough Disaster - 15th April 1989

As one of the Home Office Pathologists involved in the examination
of the victims of the d!saster I write to thank you and the officers
of the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service for the considerable help that
was provided on the day. Having been involved in the M1 aircrash
earlier in the year, I was able to offer some advice on the actual
organisation to be followed on the Saturday evening, so that
the distress to the bereaved relatives could be kept to a minimum
during the identification procedures.

The Officers of your service provided every assistance at all stages of
the procedures, and I wished to express my admiration and thanks to
you and your Officers for your help.
Yours sincerely

                 Pilgrim through this barren land;
              I am weak, but thou art mighty,
                 Hold me with thy powerful hand:
                   Bread of heaven,
              Feed me till I want no more.

              Open now the crystal fountain,
                Whence the healing stream doth flow;
              Let the fire and cloudy pillar
                Lead me all my journey through:
                   Strong Deliverer,
              Be thou still my strength and shield.

              When I tread the verge of Jordan,
                Bid my anxious fears subside;
              Death of death, and hell’s Destruction,
                Land me safe on Canaan’s side:
                   Songs of praises
              I will ever give to thee.

SILENCE


PRAYERS AND THE LORD’S PRAYER

CHOIR:

      Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our hearts;
      shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer: but
      spare us, Lord most Holy, O God most mighty,
      O holy and merciful Saviour, thou most worthy
      Judge eternal, suffer us not, at our last
      hour, for any pains of death, to fall from thee.
                                   Purcell (1658-1695)

THE HYMN:

1 Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;          3 I need thy presence every passing hour;
  The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!         What but thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?
  When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,        Who like thyself my guide and stay can be?
  Help of the helpless, O abide with me.             Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.
2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;   4 I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless;
  Earth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;      Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
  Change and decay in all around I see;              Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy victory?
  O thou who changest not, abide with me.            I triumph still, if thou abide with me.

                    5 Hold thou they Cross before my closing eyes;
                      Shine through the gloom, and point me tothe skies:
                      Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;
                      In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!
II FOR THOSE WHO WERE INJURED AND THOSE WHO ARE
      BEREAVED~ AND FOR ALL WHO CARE FOR THEM.

PRAYERS
THE HYMN:
  The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want;         3 Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
     he makes me down to lie                         yet will I fear none ill;
  In pastures green; he leadeth me                 For thou art with me, and thy rod
    the quiet waters by.                             and staff me comfort still.
2 My soul he doth restore again,                   My table thou hast furnished
    and me to walk doth make                        in presence of my foes;
  Within the paths of righteousness,               My head thou dost with oil anoint,
    e’en for his own name’s sake.                   and my cup overflows.

                              5 Goodness and mercy all my life
                                  shall surely follow me;
                                And in God’s house for everymore
                                  my dwelling-place shall be.
THE ADDRESS:       The Most Reverend John S. Habgood, D.D.
                   Archbishop of York, Primate of England and Metropolitan.


THE HYMN:

         God is Love : let heav’n adore him;
           God is Love : let earth rejoice;
         Let creation sing before him,
           and exalt him with one voice.
         He who laid the earth’s foundation,
           he who spread the heav’n above,
         He who breathes through all creation,
           he is Love, eternal Love.

         God is Love : and he enfoldeth
           all the world in one embrace;
         With unfailing grasp he holdeth
           every child of every race.
         And when human hearts are breaking
           under sorrow’s iron rod,
         Then they find that selfsame aching
           deep within the heart of God.

        God is Love : and though with blindness
          sin afflicts the souls of men,
        God’s eternal loving-kindness
          holds and guides them even then.
        Sin and death and hell shall never
          o’er us final triumph gain;
        God is Love, so Love for ever
          o’er the universe must reign.

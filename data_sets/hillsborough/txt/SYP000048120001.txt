        HILLSBOROUGH IM3UIRI


        Thank you for your kind letter of the 30 August 1990, and let me say
        from the outset that X have arranged for a copy to be sent to the
        individual officers you have highlighted and a copy will be placed
        on their personal files. X have also arranged for the letter to be
        drawn to the attention of everyone involved in the Inquiry.

        The month of August has not been a particularly good one for the
        West Midlands Police and it is very encouraging to receive written
        appreciation of their professionalism.  I know that they taice a
        pride in their work and that people who taice the trouble to write
        and thank them do a tremendous amount of good, especially at a
        sensitive time like the present.

        I have the feeling that the Inquiry will continue to impact on the
        Force for some time. Inquiries for the coroner have commenced and
        a small team is supporting Mervyn Jones.

        On a lighter note, I have no doubt that the view from your office
        window in Cumbria is far more pleasant than the one from Nechellsf

        Kind regards.

             HILLSBOROUGH - INTERIM REPORT II

             I have pleasure in enclosing an interim report we have prepared which
             you may find of interest.  It is forwarded to you on a strictly private
             and confidential basis.

             The report, which is a revised copy of one prepared for Lord Justice
             Taylor in June, represents our best understanding at this time, of what
             occurred at Hillsborough.  Consequently it should not be viewed as the
             definitive statement on the incident, but rather as a guide.  It will be
             noted that at present we have been able to position eighty eight of the
             ninety five deceased mainly by video and photographic evidence, but also
             by plan and statement evidence.

             We are still continuing to process the evidence already obtained into
             the HOLMES computer.  This is likely to continue into early December.
             Shortly after that we should be able to draw more definite conclusions
             and subject to advice and direction you give, be ready to identify those
             to be interviewed and the questions to be addressed.

              In forwarding the report may I once again invite you to visit our
              Incident Room at Nechells in Birmingham at any time and see at first
              hand the work being undertaken by our staff. I am sure you will find it
              most useful.

              In the meantime if there is anything with which you think I can help
              please do not hesitate to contact me.

              I have copied this letter and the accompanying report to the Police

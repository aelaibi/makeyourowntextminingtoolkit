               On Saturday,         15th April,       1989    (150489),       I came on du t y at 8.30 a.m.

SERIAL 21

On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I came on duty at 8.30 a.m. (0830) at the

D.S.G.    Office.         Briefing was         at   10.00 a.m.       (1000)      in the North Stand at

Hillsborough,         as our      duties   that      day consisted of policing                  the F.A.    Cup

Final Semi-Final, between Liverpool and Notts Forest.                                Three senior officers

spoke during briefing which was concluded around 10.30 a.m.                                     (1030),    upon

which the serial went back to the Police van where a snack was taken in car

park.

At   11.15     a.m.     (1115)    as    stipulated,      the       serial      was    placed     in    the West

Enclosure at the Leppings Lane end as a standby serial, where we remained

for 55 minutes approximately and only prior to leaving this area did a few

supporters        start    to enter      the    ground       at    the    Leppings      Lane    end.      These

numbers, however, were minimal.

The serial        received an order to              go to the turnstiles onPenistone Road at

12.10 p.m.        (1210) inorder to supervise the entrance of                           Nottingham Forest

supporters         onto     the    Spion   Kop.        Upon       arrival       there were      fans    already

queueing at           turnstiles       of whichthe majority were open and the rest were

subsequently opened on our arrival.

The Forest fans were generally very well behaved and orderly and made an

effort    to      get    into the      ground in     good     time       and    at no    time    were    there

excessive queues of people waiting to enter the ground.                                 One thing that was

very evident throughout our duties on that section of the ground were the

numbers      of    Liverpool        supporters milling            around openly requesting              if any

supporters(which were             of   course       Forest    fans)            wanted to   sell       any spare
tickets.         Some    Liverpool   supporters were        on Penistone Road          with tickets

because a section of the kop had been reserved for them.

During the course of my duties on the turnstiles I had cause to eject                            one

youth on ground regulations.               This youth, along with two others, were from

Liverpool and had         made several attempts to gain entry via the turnstiles on

Penistone Road without a ticket.              Two youths got in obviously by paying the

turnstile man and the third youth had handed over money and got in when I

told     another    officer   on     the   other    side   to   stop    him.     The    youth   from

Liverpool was taken to the Police room and after his details were submitted,

he was ejected from the ground.               His details were recorded by myself but

lost during the events that followed.                Turnstile duties were resumed and it

was obvious again the Forest supporters were making a conscious effort to

get into the ground.

At 3.00 p.m.       (1500) we were directed to the gymnasium under the North Stand

and once     there, were given orders              to proceed along the trackside           at the

North Stand, but         at no time was I told what was happening.

Upon reaching the Leppings Lane fencing, instructed to make a cordon along

touchline of pitch as numerous fans were climbing the perimeter fence and

were spilling onto the pitch.               They looked in distress and obviously some

were hurt but initial thoughts were only of pitch invasion.                       No orders were

given except to keep cordon and get fans off pitch and into ground again,

during    this     all   the players and officialsleft playing                 area.More fans

spilled over the fence and it was obvious something serious was occurring

but still no orders had been given, it was mayhem.                     I didn't personally have

a radio, but those who did around me were in the same position as myself.

As fans passed us they were saying people were dead and being crushed.                           By

this time officers had taken things on their own and began making their own

decisions, myself included.            I made my way to the fence and there saw one

dead man of quite heavy build and in mid 20's being passed over the heads of

other supporters.
Myself and Police Constable 2372 Justice went to an open gate and climbed

across a small gap and jumped into the terracing of Pen Four where the dead

youth was.         The kiss of life was given to him but it was no use, looking

back I can't see why we bothered because it was obvious he'd been dead a

while.        Officers on trackside were told that we needed an ambulance and it

was    then    that     along with      supporters,        the perimeter fence was pushed and

pulled,       then it gave way,          creating a hole big enough for the passage of

persons.       The body was passed out and onto the trackside by which time fans

had filtered back and spaces appeared on terracing.                                I climbed out of the

gap and went onto the pitch and began administering basic first aid as quite

a few other officers did.               Again, another obviously dead youth was placed on

the pitch and along with Police Constable 2304 Crookes, kiss of life given,

no use again, why did we bother?                    All    the time things were happening and

emergency services began to arrive, but still I wasn't aware of any specific

orders    given.         Liverpool       supporters       and    Police    then      began       breaking       up

hoardings      to use as makeshift              stretchers and those dead and injured were

carried across the ptich and round to the gymnasium.                           When the situation had

eased    our     unit    re-grouped      and     were    stood    on   reflection          looking      useless

because no one was telling us what to do now the situation had cleared.                                        We

were     stood    on    the    pitch,     me    personally       feeling      so    inadequate          and   not

believing      what     had    happened.         Supporters were        hailing          abuse   at us        from

terracing.        I can't say now how I felt, except numb.                     Eventually directed to

rear of Leppings Lane, but prior to that, two announcements were made, one

by    Kenny    Dalglish       appealing      for   co-operation        etc.,       and    one    over    tannoy

system saying match had been abandoned and for supporters to remain orderly

and leave ground sensibly but to keep tickets for replay.

Once    at rear of Leppings Lane all                    fans eventually dispersed and one fan

walked     past    our     serial       in     obvious    distress      and        shouted,      "MURDERERS,

MURDERERS, YOU'RE ALL FUCKING MURDERERS".                        It was then I realised some of

the enormity of what had happened.                  Duties then consisted of mobile transit

    patrols and went off at 8.30 p.m. (2030).

    Looking    back       thoughts    obviously     come      to mind   and   some    are    clearer than

    others.     The main one that causes me still distress is why weren't orders

    given     and    if   so    why   weren't    they    passed   on    and   why    didn't   someone   in

    authority take the situation in hand and take command of a disaster as it

    turned out,        instead of doing nothing or so it appeared,                    as it was normal

    bobbies took it upon themselves to organise and implement the orders given

    by themselves.

    One last thought is that, personally next to work, football is my life but

    after   that      Saturday's      debacle,    I doubt       it will   ever be the same.          When

£   people are packed into cages like animals with nowhere to go, panic sets in

    which happened at Leppings Lane and with animals only the strong survive,

    the rest die, just like those 95 at Hillsborough.

    We did our best, our job, what we get paid for.                     The first point applies but

    the other two don't , that is not what happened on Saturday 15 April 1989

    (150489)        around     3-05 p.m.   (1505)    and onwards.         Yes   we    deal    with sudden

    deaths but not 95 en masse.

    When we stood around and even doing initial work during the disaster, blue

    shirted bobbies were getting abused, blamed and mocked, it wasn't our faulty

During        the    course          of    my    duties          on    th e      turnstiles,              I had          cause         to

eject        one    youth       on     ground,        regulations,.                 This          youth,       along        with           two

others        were      from        Liverpool             and    had       made     several          attempts              to     gain

entry        via    the      turnstiles              on    Penis tone            Road        'without      a    ticket,,               Two

youth        had    handed          over       money       and       got    in     when       I told       another              officer           on

the     other       side       to    stop       him.           The    youth        from       Liverpool             was     taken           to

the     Police       room       and       after       his       details          were        submitted,             he    was         ejected

from      t he     ground.           His       details          were       recorded           dv    myself          but     lost           during

the     events       that       foil o w e d .            Turnstile           duties          were       resumed          and         it    was

obvious          again       the     Forest          supporters             were        making       a    conscious               effort          to

get     into the ground,,

At     3.00      p.m.     (1500)          we    were       directed           to    the       gymnasium             under         the       North

Stand, a n d        once       there,          were       given       orders        to       proceed       along           the        trackside

at     the    North       Stand,          but    at       no    time       was     I told          what    was       happening.

Upon      reaching           the     Leppings             Lane       fencing,           instructed             to    make         a    coraon

along        touchline          of      pitch        as    numerous           fans       were       climbing             the      perimeter

fence        and    were       spilling           onto         the     pitch.            They       looked m             d i s t r e ss and

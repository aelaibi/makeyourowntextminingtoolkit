                                            location with PC Pitt.                  The        gate men a sk ed us       if we

             could stay at that             point     until     half     time.      As they e x pr es se d        concern

             that      in previous m a tc he s a tt em pt s         had been made and had s uc ee de d                   in

             persons getting             into   the   ground without             paying       by jumping     over    the

             turnstiles.          As there was          still    quite a large                group of   people     outside

             we     remained there.

             I c a n ’t state        for   definat e whether           it was      before        three   pm or after

             three      pm but     I can remember           there   being at        least two a n n o u n c e m e n t s

             di re c t e d to fans at the Leppi ng s Lane                  end to stop            pushing.

                                                                                                    S3049

The game      s t a r t e d and a few         people Notts       fans,    came to us and a sk ed           if

they    could     leave       the    ground.        I asked one    lady what was the matter and

she just      said that, she didn't want                 to remain there after           the b ah aviour

she had seen.            We    let           them out.

PC Pitt      then       went and had a look at the game and                   came back and         said

that    it looked as           if there       had been a pitch         invasion.       During      this

time there was a lot of m ov ement                     of the    ground staff.         The N ot ts    fans

in the S pion Kop were                chanting       boo-ing and hissing at what was

h ap pening at the other              end of the       pitch,   at the time this confirmed

what PC Pitt             had said was         happening.

O nly a few minu t es           later a Si Johns A m bu la nc e man             came to us and a sk ed

if we    could       let him out,           he d i d n ’t say or give any        i ndication of what

was    really going on,              on the    pitch.     W he n he    returned we f ol lo we d him

to the small           gate    in the       corner    of the S ou th Stand that gives access

to the track area.

I was    stood       looking a r ou n d the          pit and    it was    only now that       I realised

that    s o mething other            than a pitch       invasion had happened.              I saw a

really fat man with no ys'h i r t ^ o n „b e i n g carried down the                    field towards

the gym end by 8 people ofv^T makl's4wrft stretcher.                             I think     it was       one

of the hoardings.

PC P i t t and myself           then went onto the             pitch and joined up w it h another

serial,     facing       towards       the S outh Stand.          A number     of   lads,    I think

they were Liverpool                 fans,    came    past us and started         pulling     the

hoardings       from the side.

As time m o v e d on we m ov ed              further    up the edge       of the    pitch towards          the

L e p p i n g s Lane    end all       the time       people were      being   either    carried on the

h oardings      or     physi c al ly    carried       down towards       the gym end.At       one    point

the fans      in the S ou th S ta nd star te d to boo and hiss at

the Liverpool           fans    on the       pitch this    caused them to become a g i t a t e d

and a g g r e s s i v e and a lot of them made as                 if they were       going towards
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          S3049

the fans         in the S o ut h Stand.

We were       then d ir ec te d to form a                 line across       the    pitch    I think     it was

on the Notts             side of the half way               line.     The       chants and hissing         kept

on from the Spion Kop.                     A g ai n Liverpool        fans who were on the             pitch

became      a gg ra v at e d and a gg re s si v e and made a short                   charge    towards      the

Sp io n Hop en d »

This      ended     quietly and as             I a sk ed them all          to    calm down and go back

towards       their       own end,       I could see that man y had been crying.                          A lot

were      shouting        towards      the Notts          fans    things    like d o n ’t you know whats

h ap pened       "Our     lads are       dying up there."

I then heard             that     there were         something      like fift ee n dead.           I c o u l d n ’t

believe       it.        The    figure     kept      going up and up all            the    time,   we were       on

the    pitch.

E v e n t u a l l y we    re gr ouped w it h our serial              and set about          the task of

trying      to get the fans              to    leave      the    pitch and help them          in any way

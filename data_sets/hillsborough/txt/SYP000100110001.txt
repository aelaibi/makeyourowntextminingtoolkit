POLICE CONSTABLE 78




BARNSLEY DIVISION, PENISTONE SECTION




I am a Police Constable, number 7 8 , of the South Yorkshire Police, currently

stationed at Penistone Police Station, which is part of Barnsley Division.

At 8.30 am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I paraded for duty at Penistone Police

Station     as    part    of    a     serial      for       duties    at     the    F   A   Semi-Final       between

Nottingham       Forest     and     Liverpool        due      to   be held         at   Sheffield     Wednesday's

ground, Hillsborough.

Police    transport then conveyed myself and others to Wombwell Police Station

where we later liaised with other 'B2' officers and boarded a Police Transit

van   and   were     then      conveyed      to   Hillsborough Stadium.                     After    an   in-depth,

initial briefing on the logistics and strategy to be implemented on the day,

given by both uniform and CID Senior Officers, all serials then took a small

snack    type meal        in the North Stand,                 where    the    previous        briefing had been

held.

At    approximately       11.30       am,    after      a    further       briefing      by    Inspector,     I was

deployed,        together      with    the   rest       of my      serial,         inside     the   ground   at   the

Leppings    Lane     end behind turnstiles 9-16.                       The serial Sergeant was Police

Sergeant 1757 Burns.              He informed us that we should work in pairs behind the

turnstiles       with female          officers     deployed          behind    the majority of males,              on

searching duties in accordance with the Inspector's previous briefing.

From roughly 11.30 am until 1415 or thereabouts, the passage of individuals

into the ground was sparce with very few people coming into the ground.                                           The

ones that did come into the ground between these times appeared to be family

types in good jovial mood.
As I say,         there   continued      to be a steady                 flow, albeit sporadic, of people

through      the     turnstiles       into        the     Leppings        Lane    enclosure.         However,     at

roughly 2.15 pm           that    same      date,       there began a profuse build up of people

outside      the     ground      entrances          to     the     Leppings       Lane     end.      Through     the

activated      turnstiles        I   could        see    a large        gathering       of people    outside     the

ground who were very tightly packed against each other.

I as an individual member of my serial, continued with searching duties at

this   time.        Presently,       as more           and more people filed in through the busy

turnstiles,        I was      approached          by     several       Liverpool    supporters       who    claimed

that   the        situation      outside      was        becoming        rough    and     unruly,    with    people

starting to push and shove each other outside.                              This situation continued for

some minutes,         and I remember stating to a colleague                             that I knew something

was about to happen, that we would be having some trouble of some kind.

At   approximately         1430      that     same       date,     I    saw that        several    young men     had

started to enter the ground by scaling the outer perimeter wall and roofs of

the nearby turnstiles.

They   were       repeatedly      told       by    myself        and    other     officers    to    refrain     from

climbing in this way.                The Liverpool           supporters declined to take heed and

regardless of care, continued to enter the ground in this way.                                        It was seen

by myself that a vast majority of these persons, together with others that

had entered by the more conventional means of the turnstile,                                        were smelling

heavily      of    intoxicants.          I    saw       several        attempts    by    officers    to eject or

arrest these persons result in failure, due to the vast numbers congregating

at the time.          Officers were trying to control the whole situation, which by

now was becoming chaotic and, as a result, persons without tickets may have

entered on to the terracing.
At approximately           1450,    I saw to my left in the Leppings Lane enclosure to

the    rear    of    the West      Stand and Leppings Lane               terracing,      a man whom I now

know    to    be                   , 18   years,    b                                    of

         , Liverpool 14.            He was involved in an argument with WPC Pearson about

whether or not he had got a ticket to see the football match in the ground.

He became      agitated and started abusing the WPC                        and so I intervened.          As a

result of                 conduct    and his inability to produce a valid ticket of any

kind,    he    was       escorted     towards      the    Police        room,    with    the     intention    of

expelling him from the ground.

During this time, I was joined by Police Constable 853 Burke who assisted me

due to               disposition, that meaning that he was struggling.

At one stage,                struggled violently and as a result,                      I was thrown to the

floor a n d w a s            heard to say,       "Come on lads, come on", with the intention

of    inciting       other    Liverpool      fans        into    a     fight    with    myself    and   Police

Constable Burke.

Eventually,         after getting myself off the floor,                         was placed in the Police

room.     I remember at the time of falling to the ground that I'd better get

up or else I'd be trampled to death or at best, badly kicked.

After    lodging              my    prisoner,      in    the Police       detention room,          the normal

procedure          for   prisoners    was   followed,           with    regards    to    documentation       and

searching.

I then t o o k | t o          the Police cell bus which was parked outside, and it was

then    that       I realised      that   some   form of disaster had occurred,                    due to the

vast number          of bodies      and   injured laid outside             the Police room inside the

ground.
Myself    and Police          Constable       Burke   then tried           to locate      our Serial Sergeant

1757    Burns.         We    were     unable    to    do       so,   and   now     in   retrospect,         this   was

probably due to the chaos caused inside the ground on the Leppings Lane end.

After    trying       to    gain     access    to   the pitch/terracing             areas      via    the -eppings

Lane    North       West    Stand     area,    Police Constable            Burke    and myself r e t i m e d        to

the rear of the West Stand.

It was here          that I was approached by a doctor who stated he wanted to know

where all the          injured were.           I escorted him to the rear of the North Stand

outside       the    gymnasium        area,    where       I    then   assisted         in    the    treatment      of

casualties.

At     1610   or     thereabouts,        I     left    the      gymnasium        area    due    to    all    of    the

casualties having been conveyed to hospital.

I then returned to the rear of the Leppings Lane area and tried tc console

members of the             public.      At    this time, most people were                    though distraught,

nevertheless         understanding of the Police situation.                             Others,      however, some

smelling of drink, were more abusive stating the cause of the disaster to be

the Police action, or in-action as the case may have been.

At roughly 1700 all Police personnel were mustered in the North Stand where

Serial Sergeants after debriefing could stand their respective serials down.

At 1830 my serial was stood down and I returned to Barnsley.

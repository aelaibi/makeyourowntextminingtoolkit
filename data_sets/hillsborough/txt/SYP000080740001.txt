it     became        necessary           to      instruct          the       supporters           to    keep       footpaths           c l ear

as     they        were       causing       an    obstruction.                  Where        possible          I instructed

people         to    go       inside     the      public          house and           consume          the     drinks       in the

inside         the       bar    and    then       left       p r ior        to P o l i c e     arrival.

The     footpaths         outside          the     public          house        had a very            large       number        of    pint

glasses         just    strewn        about.            I sa w      empty Pils              lag e r    bottles,           empty

wine     and     cider       bottles           also    discarded              onto       the   footpath.            As      some     of

th e    supporters           began        to m o v e     off       towards          the     football         g r ou n d ,      these

glasses         and    bottles        were       b e in g     kicked          and     tripped         over,       which        in t u r n

caused      them       to s m a s h .          I sa w s o m e       of    these          supporters          stumbled           on    the

bottles         and    due     to   the        obvious        danger,           staff       inside         the    public

houses      were       requested           to a t t e n d      outside             and     clear      up    the    d e b ri s .




Three     members         of    staff          complied with              this        request         and went        outside

with     cardboard           boxes        and    bin sacks           and        set      about      clearing         up     the

broken      glass.           I understand               the    bar       wa s      then     asked      to    close.            At

this     point        people        then       began asking              myself          and    other       officers           where

they     could        find a n o t h e r        public        house       which          was    being       used     by

Nottingham            supporters.               I was        not    giving          them any          replies        to     this

question         and    told        them,       in v i e w     of       the     time,       that      they       should        be

attending         the     ground          to    start        finding          their        g a te   entrances         and

standing         in the        queues.           As     they       began        to w a l k      off    in the       direction             of

th e    ground,        I saw a        lot       of y o u n g       men    carrying             cans    of    lager        in    packs

of     f our.     I would           describe          these        fans       as    very       boisterous          but

manageable.



From     this     location           we    then       returned           to     patrolling            the M i d d l e w o o d        Rd

intoxicants.                  These         supporters               were         both     standing and               sitting          in a n

area      which        forms          part        of       the    car     park       for    the      premises.              Inside       the

bar a r e a        again         it wa s          very       full.           We    had     responded          to      this       location          as

the     result         of a          call        or    complaint             from a        local       resident            about       the

behaviour             of     certain             fans.



Again        I s aw        the       footpath              and    parking          area     wa s     strewn with                litter       such

as     h al f    eaten        sandwiches,                   fish and           chips       wrappers         and       numerous          lag e r

bottles          and       pint       glasses.               These        vessels          were      again      being           kicked       over

and     tripped            over       by     fans,          causing          them     to    smash.          Th e      staff       at    t hi s

public          house        were         requested              to a t t e n d      outside         and    cle a r        up    the    mes s ,

which        they      did.           A    lot        of    these       f a ns     were     in m y      opinion            drunk,       but      due

to     the      l a rg e P o l i c e         presence,              were       reasonably            orderly.




Whilst          walking          through              the    crowd        of      people       outside        the      public          house,       I

wa s     pointing            out      that        they       had a fair              walk      to    the    ground          and    that       they

should          be m o v i n g        off.            My    comments           were      ignored and            some        Liverpool

fans      remarked             to me         that          'The     g am e     would       not      be s t a r t e d       until       they

were      all      i n s id e . "          I pointed              out     to      them     that      they     c o ul d      not    be    sure

of     t ha t    and again                told        them       to s t a r t      making        their      way       to    the    stadium.

Some      f an s      d id    eventually                   drink     up a n d        begin       to w a l k     in the           direction

of     the      stadium,             making           comments          to     the    effect         that     the      Police          should

drive        them      to     the         ground           in the       Police        vans.




I noticed             that       a    number           of    fans       were       carrying          bottles          of    cider       or    cans

of     lager.          I stopped                 some       of    these        fans      and     told      them       they would             not

be a l l o w e d       into          the     stadium             carrying          alcoholic           d r i nk s .        The    replies

from      some        were       to       t he    effect          they would             have       drank     it      by the       time       they

reached          the       g r o un d .          Some       of    them       even went           onto      parking          area and

started          to    drink              th e    contents           of      the     cans      and     bottles         rather          than

risk     having           the        drink          confiscated.




As    the    Liverpool                  fans        slowly          started        to    drift        down Wadsley              Ln     towards

the    ground,            our        serial          moved          off    to     X/ft& b o t t o m     of W a d s l e y L n a n d

again       full         of L i v e r p o o l            fans,                               outside       the    building

drinking.                An    officer              at     this      location           had a r r e s t e d      a Liverpool

circumstances                  leading              to     the a r r e s t        of    this       youth     I am      not      familiar

with.        On      seeing             this        officer          with       his     prisoner,          I got       out      of     the

and     prisoner.                  As    this        y o u t h was         being        placed        into     the     rear       of    the

Police       van,          I wa s        surrounded                 by a p p r o x i m a t e l y      fifteen        to    twenty

Liverpool            fans,           some         carrying           opened         cans      of    beer/lager,            some        with

pint     glasses              of     beer/lager               which        ha d     obviously           been     purchased             from       the

Park     Hotel.               Those          fans        began       to    prod me           a n d at    first       I thought           they

were     going           to a sk         why        we     ha d     just     placed          the y o u t h     in the        va n

obviously            under           arrest.               Instead         they were            pleading         with      me     to a sk         the

youth       in the            va n      to    give         up his         ticket,        stating         that     many       of      them     had

not    got     tickets               f or     the        football          match.            I told      them     the      ticket,           if

the    youth         h ad      one,          w as    his      property and               not       for me      to d i s p o s e        of.



They     t h e n a s k e d me                if     I knew anywhere                    they     could      obtain         tickets,           to

which       I told            them       'No".             I then         got     into       the    Police       van and          the    youth

was    conveyed               to     the      Police          r oo m      for     processing.              My serial            then went

from      th e      ground          controls^room^x^fur                      unit       attended             tiy f L e p p i n g s    Ln       end       of

the      stadium.              On     our    arrival              we    set a b o u t           c^owd/ffinjyol              duties         a     large

number         of       people        of    both       se x e s ,       including               crtj/ldrrn/ werg. n o w               spilling

out      of    the       stadium           exits       and        beginning             to      congregate             on the        road and

footpaths               immediately              outside           the       stadium.                I sa w     that     some        of    these

people         looked          very        dishevelled,                 some,          including             young      men,     were

crying,            some       had     no    shoes        on       their       feet.             As    more      and more         fans

spilled            from       the     stadium          I realised                 t ha t       something          very serious                 must

have      taken          place        inside          th e    stadium.




I had         no    personal           radio          a n d Serge                          nson       was      the     only Offi c e r              in

f r o m me         as    we    ha d    spread          out        trying          to    usher         the      crowd a wa y          from        the

main      gates          of    the     stadium.               More          and more            people         were     leaving           the

stadium,            these        all       Liverpool              supporters.



I approached                  a youth        of a b o u t          eighteen             years         w ho    wa s     very    pale        in

colour         and appeared                 to    be     staggering.                    I t oo k       hold       of    him and a s k e d                if

he w as        alright.               He    seemed           not       to    know       what         was     happening         or     where          he

was      and       he    virtually           fainted              into       m y a r ms .            I dropped          the    youth           to    one

s id e    of       the    entrance           gates           and       sat    h im      down.




I wa s        joined          by o t h e r       youths           who       informed            me    he was         their     friend and

he    had      travelled              with       them        to    the       ground.             These        youths        spoke         with

Liverpool               accents,           they       were        angry       using            obscene         language        and

screaming               about       the a l l o c a t i o n            of    standing            areas        for L i v e r p o o l        fans.

The      youth          I h a d sat         down appeared                    to    be      conscious            and     I asked           h im      if

he w a n t e d     to    go    to H o s p i t a l ,       he    declined            and asked          his       friends          to    get

him a w a y       from     the      a r ea.




The    crowd       by n o w w a s         massive.             Other       Officers          h ad a r r i v e d a n d            were

trying       to    control          the     crowd.



I could       hear       much abuse              being     h u r l e d at        the      Police       Officers             by y o u n g

men    leaving          the g r o u n d .



As    I helped          the y o u t h I h a d        tended          to    his        feet,       having leanedover                    him

to    pick    him       up, I w a s       punched         in the          back        by a y o u t h       r u n n i n g past      from

a section          of    the     crowd.            I got       the y o u t h        I w as    tending            to    his       feet     and

on    turning       s aw s o m e         youths      struggling              with      each       ot h e r.       O ne      of    these

youths       was    trying          to    break      free       of    two      other        youths         who    were

restraining             him.        He    wa s     looking       at me         and     shouting            'You m u r d e r i n g

bastards          have     caused         this',        repeating            these        words       over       again.           Other

members       of    the       crowd       began      to    shout          similar         comments          and       obscenities

at    myself       and     other         officers.             The    youth         I had      tended         shouted            back     to

someone       in the          crowd       t ha t    it w a s n ' t        rny f a u l t     (the      fault       of     myself).



The    crowd around              me      were      becoming          increasingly             more         hostile.              I s aw

more    and more           people         limping         and    being         helped        out      of    the       ground       exits,

by bot h      Police          and     other        supporters.               I knew         the    situation             in the

ground must             have     worsened.              I tried           telling         people       in f r o n t         of me       to

get    away and make                room      for    other        people         to     leave      and      for a m b u l a n c e s          to

be a l l o w e d    in.       I was       met      with    further           hostility,             both verbal                  and

physical.           I was        p u n c h e d at       by a n o t h e r       youth and           blocked            the    punch        by

placing       my    forearms             in f r o n t     of m y      face,         then     beer      cans       were       being

thrown       from       other       members         deeper        into       the      crowd,       but      fortunately                I was

not    struck.           I kept          pleading         with       them      to     get    w el l    away and make                   some

room    for       the    injured          to    be    f e r r i e d a w a y.          Some      people         just      i g n o r e d me,

others       shouted        obscenities               and       threats          of    violence.             By    no w a m b u l a n c e s

were    beginning           to a r r i v e       but     the      crowd were             still        very        hostile.




During       what       I could          only    describe             as    mayhem,        I had          p e op l e    running          up

to me a n d        expressing             their       concern about                   telephoning            home       to    let

relatives          know     of      their       safety.           I told          them     to    get       well        away    from          the

ground and          to    go     to      local       resident's             houses       and ask           their        permission

to    use    their       telephones.                 I had       numerous             people     making           this       request          as

to    the    location          of     telephones            I advised             all     of    them       the     s am e     as

they    would       obviously             eventually             find       telephones           and also              it w a s     a way

of    getting       people          to    leave       the       area.




I was       then a s k e d       by a u n i f o r m e d          Police          Inspector           to    go a n d      join       a

number       of    other       Officers          who     were         lined       up on        the    se r v i ce                  inside

the    ground       area       which        runs      between          Leppings           Ln and Penis^one                    Rd.        I

did    not    know       the     Inspector            but       I had       now       become     detaji

joining       the       line     I saw a number                  of    bodies,          approximately eleven

people,       and       these       were       obviously          dead.           I now        knew       t h a t ^rFTe s i t u a t i o n

The    ambulances           began         taking        injured            people       a w a y as        medical        staff

tended       the    bodies          behind       me.        A    number          of    Police        Officers           were       then

released          from    screening             the     bodies,            myself       included.




Some    Officers          were        sent      back     to      crowd       control           duties        at L e p p i n g s         Ln

and    I and        three       or    f ou r      other        Officers       were     instructed        to    go    further

along     the       service          road        to w h e r e    BBC     television          vans    were     p ar k e d .      At

this    location           we     joined          a number         of    other       Officers       frowning a b a r r i e r

to    stop       people        walking           from     the Penistoneyftid e ^ j y r a y e            of    the    service

access       for        ambulances           to     leave.                             ^



I was     also          instructed           by a n       Inspector           whom    I did    not     know    to    c o ve r      an

entrance          / exit        gate        which       gives      access       onto    Leppings        Ln    terrace

preventing              anyone       without          authority          onto    the       terrace.      From       that

position          I could         see       the     emergency           services       working       frantically

carrying          away      injured          and what           appeared        lifeless       bodies        from    the

terrace          areas.



The    rest        of    the    stadium           was     by    now     emptying       with    some     sections

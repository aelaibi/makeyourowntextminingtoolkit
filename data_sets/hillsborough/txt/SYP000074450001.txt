              F o r e s t at Hi 1 lsbj»rough,             Sheffield.

              We t r a v e l l e d t6 the m a t c h by t r a i n y from B e d f o r d a r r iving                   in S h e f f i e l d

              at about          12.30     pm   (1230).          The      t/ain was        quite       full w i t h both

              Liv e r p o o l    and Forest Fans.                  The      fans on the train were               very well

              be h a v e d and     I only saw a few drinking                        from        cans but    nobody a p p e a r e d

              drunk.

              As we     left      the     railway s t a t i o n          in S h e f f i e l d   the    police at the            railway

a rrived at the ground                        about     1 pm ( 1 3 0 0 ).

W h e n we     first arriv^edTat the ground the a t m o s p h e r e was good and

a l t h o u g h there was a lot of fans about                          it was       not    crowded.

A number         of fans were          drinking         beer    from     cans but a g a i n no one

a p p e a r e d drunk.         I noti c e d whilst           on the      bus a lot of public houses

had fans         outside       drinking.

Although         I tra v e l l e d from B e d f o r d to S h e f f i e l d            neither rryCelf or Shane

had a ticket           for theJ(^i5atch.             I have been to a few other                      big games and

have m a n a g e d to M i y a ticket                 off other         fans       or touts.

F r o m our arrival            at the Leppings              Ln End at about               1 pm (1300)        we spent

the     next     hour and a half asking                  other        fans       if they had spare           tickets

an d    looking       for touts,         but we       ccmJrtfn't find any.

W h i l s t we hunted for              tickets/!        noticed that              loads of o t h e r ^ s u p p o r t e r s

we re also         trying      to buy tickets            but    I d i d n ’t see an                  nanage to buy

one.         We wa l k e d     up a n d / d o w n     Leppings         Ln during          this     a l t h o u g h the fans

were      noisy      I didn't       iee any disorder of any kind.
                                                             ■x'"’.
Du r i n g    this    time      I noti c e d       poli c«»/bf f i cers          on horses        controlling       fans

at     the turn s t i l e s      but    I c a n ’t/say       I_ saw a n y         in Leppings Lane.

S h o r t l y after 2 .30          (1430)         Yo 2.3 5 pm (1435)              I had given up hope             of

buying a ticket                so we wertl through the gate                       that takes you          to the

tu r n s t i l e s w i t h     a hope        that     s o m e h o w we m i g h V ' g e t     in    tosee the match.

to m o v e , and you just               had to go where               t h e /mass went.

I was        in the middle          of the         crush,    but jAdn't            feel    in danger and the

crowd was         still       in a good mood.

          Although        I c o u l d n ’t see the t u rnstiles            I imagined that           people where

          going    in but more and more               seemed to be          piling      in from behind.

          I was    trap p e d     in this     crowd up until             I heard the whistle             go for the

          start    of the match.             I w o u l d say from 2.4 5           (1443)     to this       time     I

          w a s n ’t really aware         of what was going on a r o u n d as                  I was     too    crushed

          to take m u c h notice.

          At a bout       the time     the whis t l e went          the m a i n body of the            crowd moved to

          my    right and       I w a > ^ € a r r i e d along    in it to a large            conc e r ^ > w a T t y p e   gate

          w h i c h was    qjy^n.     I was    carried       in the       crowd thro u g h n,his gate and

          a c r o s s am open are a towards a tunnel                     at the    rear of the stand.                   This

          body of fans was m o v i n g            quite quic k l y and          I was more        concerned with

          keeping my footing              than where        I was      going.

          The    next     thing     I know    I had       passed t h r o u gtyOie       tunnel with o u t a n y t h i n g

          unusual       h a ppening a n d     I went w ith S hane           to the      right hand side of the

          centre       fence    into the      right       hand   pen l^efnnd the goals.

          I w o u l d say we were          in the first Jalatch of fans                 through the gate and

          the tunnel and w h e n we ente r e d the                  pen    I was      just   relieved to be               in

          the game.         At that       stage     the    pen was       full   but    I stood and w a t c h e d the

          game    in reasonable           comfort     for a short          time.       I w o u l d say a lot of

          fans    that went         thro u g h the gate was            the same as       us,    had no tickets                 but

          just    happy to be         inside.

          A f t e r we went       through     the    tunnel we m a n a g e d       to move      several yards              to

          the    right and a few           rows     forward      (as     I have    indicated on the grid on

          Page    5).

          After    the m a t c h was a few minu t e s             old     I felt a sudden surge                forward

          caused by a mass            of fans       pushing      in from the back.              This surge took me

          f o r wards     but the space        behind filled up and                I was unable          to get         back.

          I suddenly        felt     fear and a feeling             of    panic and being d i s o r i e n t a t e d

          took    over and        I was    s e p a r a t e d from Shane.          I some h o w got m o v e d to my

          left    to    position 2 on the grid.

At   the same         time that       the massive      st^fcie took    place and       I was    pushed

down the terraci ng               I real is ed 1    it people were         falling     to the    floor

a n d as   I was       pushed forward          T rnnlH ■PppI hnrfips under mv feet.                   It was

impossible          not   to tread on them.            I cannot     say how m any       people

fell    but    it was quite a number.

I had to use all my s t r e n g t h to a v o i d falling myself and was                         not

altogether          sure what was h a p pening a r o u n d me          it was a matter          of

looking after myself.

At about       the time       the m a t c h finished       I was    pushed and       pulled a

m a n a g e d to    climb onto the         fence and onto the track               Th

s u s t a i n e d was a knock                                                   face




br e a t h back



over    the    fence      onto the         ick.



                                                       no notice    of a n y thing     other    than my

own survival              Whe n    I was   on the        tch   I    ticed a lot of        police

officers       helping        to get    fans over       the fence a n d doing all         they       could

to help the           injured.

A fter about          10 minutes       I met    up w ith S hane an d after about a not h e r             15

m i n u t e s at about 3 .30          (1530)   we both     left    the ground and made           our way

back    to the        railway station.

As we      left the ground            I noticed a lot of fans              in Leppings Ln argu i n g

with    police who         seemed to take          it, without argu i n g       back.     It was about

this    time       I learnt       from some     fans   that    there   had been 2 or 3 people

killed,       and     it was only at        the    railway s t a t i o n    I realised the       full

extent.

I w o u l d say       I was    only    in the ground a few minu t e s           before    the    disaster

o c c u r r e d and    I climbed the fence at about                the same time the m a t c h was

              stopped.

              I cannot say a n y thing about          how the matter was      dealt with as    I was   too

              sh a k e n to take any notice and w h e n         I recovered   I spent all   the time

              help i n g    people    over    the fences.

             Whilst        on the    pitch    I saw nothing    I would   class as a criminal    offence.

           At 0845 hrs Saturday,                     15 April       19S9,     I commenced duty at Doncaster DHG

attention to Wadsley Lane at yf'ts -----------------------------------
                                    junction with Middlewood Road,           as

that corner appeared to Jkfe a congregating point for the Liverpool               fans

as many were coming Mo the ground from Wadsley Lane, a f j , € r      visiting

licensed pr emi sesrand an off-licence further up                road.  About 90%
                /
of the fans tbfat passed by me were d r ink i n g #.int o:< i cants from cans and

bottles a n / also bottles of wine,             .‘were drinking from open

vessels £ bviously taken from the (£tff>l i c house,      these I took from the

fans, many I warned re their conditions as in my opinion they were

drunk/and would be turned away from the gates.

Between about 2 pm and 3 pm (140Q-15QQ) m ost of the fans came down

Wadsley Lane in large gang-^T chanting football           slogans, most were

worse for wear for dr i/fk.        None of the PCs on my serial    had a personal

radio,    only PS 2305^L o m a s possessed o n e .   As he was standing with me I

heard some of t^e radio traffic.                            /

Abnout 3 pm >H5QQ) that 6 A y I could see what w/re still hundreds of

.Liverpool^Supporters yh Leppings Lane waijyfng to get into the g r o u n d .

Shortlyyi    heard a rXdio message that >£d me to believe that the kick

off hid been delated until 3. ;15 pjj/< 1515) to allow/the fans into the

g a m e , before i j   started.   Shortly after that I/heard a number of

messages    (at A east three)     from Supt. Marsjaal 1 to the match control

room which ^founded urgent,        to the effs-dft that he wanted the gates

opening ay the Leppings Lane entrajprce to the West Stand because of the

large nuipber of Liverpool jsuppcj/'ters trying to get in and that he

feared |/hat people would bV^injured dr killed due to being crushed at

the ent^rsMice.        I now know that eventually those gates gates were

opened.     Shortly after that I heard a radio message that all available

officers attend inside the ground at the perimeter fencing.             It was

obvious to me that at this stage something was drastically wrong.                   I

went down to the ground at the Leppings Lane entrance to the West

Stand where with other officers         I was instructed by an inspector       <1
                                                                          PAGE        3
                                                                          S2210

don't know who)         to form a cordon across the entrance to prevent any

further supporters entering the ground.           A cordon was formed but there

were only a handful of fans wanting to get in, which did not

necessitate the large number of officers there.            I then heard a number

of messages to the Liverpool         f a n s , over the ground tannoy system to

move back as people were being crushed at the front of the stand.

During this time the fans outside the ground were becoming aggressive

and shouting at us because they were not allowed into the ground.

Sometime       later I went   into the ground i,nto enclosure No. 3 of the West

Stand there were about 50 fans in the enclosure shouting and jumping

up and down.          There were a large number of people obviously injured

lying on the pitch being attended to by police officers and St. John

Ambulance perosnnel.          I went onto the pitch and assisted with first

aid to a number of people with minor         injuries.    A number of people I

checked showed no signs of life and to me as a layman were dead and

far beyond any assistance         I could give including resuscitation.

Both the injured a nd dead were being carried to the first aid room by

police and fans.          This room being situated under the North Stand.         I

then went to the North St a n d where the situation was chaotic.          I tried

to assist to make space for the injured and co-ordinate the St. J o h n ’s

^taff who were visibly shocked but doing their best to attend to the

injured, who were being brought to the area by Police and fans.

I then went back to the West St an d which was empty and ^ssisted some

fans    carrying an injured fan to the North Stand I was aware that

objects were being thrown at us from the West Stand and people            in that

stand were shouting abuse at us.          After assisting to take that man to

the first aid room,         the first of the ambulances arrived.     I then went

onto Penistone R o a d , to try to keep the road clear for further

amb u l a n c e s .

Sometime       later I was ordered to the Leppings Lane entrance to the
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S2210

         stand to supervise supporters leaving the g r o u n d , which I did.    We

         were subjected to verbal abuse from the fans as they left the ground.

         The mood of the supporters being very hostile towards the Police.

         When the Stand was clear I was instructed to return to my original

         point on Middlewood Roa d to prevent any disorder.       This   I did with

         other officers.

         Sometime   later we all   returned to the ground where   I again assisted

         with traffic control on Penistone Road,     until about 6.30 pm (1830)

         when I entered the ground and shortly after my serial was stood down.

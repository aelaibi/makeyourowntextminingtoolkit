                            SATURDAY,          15 A P R I L    1989.



                            At 8.30 a.m.           on duty at Doncaster P o l i c e S t a t i o n                 .in uniform,        then

                            t r a n s p o r t e d to H i l l s b o r o u g h football         ground.

                            I was       in serial          28 paired up wit h Det e c t i v e C o n s t a b l e 40 T o m l i n s o n

                            an d the       serial      S e r g e a n t was Police S e r g e a n t 240 8 Wilson.

                            The    briefing        in the ground was               not very       loud an d serial          28 sat

                            towards        the top of the            stand.        I did not hear m u c h of the b r i e f i n g .

                            I did however            hear      the e v a c u a t i o n    procedure an d u n d e r s t o o d     it.

                            II a.m.        took up point at j u n c t i o n of L a p pings                  Lane and L e a k e Road.

                            The   busy period was                from 12.30 p.m. w i t h Liverpool                   s upporters

                            trav e l l i n g    up a n d d own L e p p i n g s Lane           looking for tickets.               I w ould

                            say that        the majority,            nearly all           the Liverpool         supporters,          had been

                            drinking and m ost of these had had a good drink.                                      Groups were mill i n g

                        about           drinking,          carrying 4 packs              of beer and      it was extra strong

                            beers,       Newquay,          S t e l l a Artois,     cider,      bottles      of wine      etc.

                        F r o m 2 p.m.            onwards L e p pi ngs Lane was                packed w ith Liverpool

                            supporters,           traffic was          finding      it d i fficult        to    pass thro u g h the          crowd

                        A      lot of the L i v e r p o o l          supporters withcrut tickets b e l i e v e d they w o u l d

                            be a l l o w e d    into       the g r o u n d at kick          off time as        it had h a p p e n e d    in the
past at other             grounds.

At 3 . 0 0    p.m.    a loud      cheer went up,             o b v i o u s l y the game had started.

This    caused the L i verpool                 s u pporters     to start      jogging and qu ic k e n the

pace to get          to the     ground.          Just after        the game had s t a r t e d a group

of six me n from N o t t i n g h a m            came to me and said that               the gr o u n d was

full and there was              t r o u b l e , also     that    they had six tickets               "seating"

only to find six L i verpoo l                   s upporters      sitting      in their      seats and

produced ticket             stubs    to prove          it.

I was    left at L e p p i n g s L a n e / L e a k e Roa d on my o w n , whilst D e t e c t i v e

C o n s t a b l e T o m l i n s o n went for       his meal.        It was apparent             that    there

was some kind of trouble at the ground and I was updated by local

residents.           At 3 .15     p.m.     1 went       to the Leppi n g s Lane          stand,        I did not

enter    the ground.            At this time there were a number                       of Liverpool

suppo r t e r s   outside       the ground offer i n g             violence,        accusing      the Police

of being m u r d e r e r s and a lot of verbal a b u s e .                     The highest          rank that

I saw was an          I n s p e c t o r , no    instructions we re given an d                it was a

c o n s i derable     time after         that      I r e a lised that there were                f a ta lities

inside the gr o u n d and            I did not know what               had    caused this.

At   no time      did I hear         the e v a c u a t i o n mess a g e      over the t a n n o y .       In

fact    I heard onl y one mess a g e                  that was     to ask     for    calm as      the re had

been a serious             incident.

As for       radio    communications,              I did not have a radio and did not have

access       to o n e .    H o w e v e r , every Spe cial Con s t a b l e           I saw did.

After    11.30 a.m.          I did not see any s t e w a r d s .              I never      saw or handled

any dead b o d i e s .

OBSERVATIONS

There were        lots of drun k e n L i verpool                s u p p o r t e r s , a great    deal   of

tension and a nger            outside          the L e p p i n g s Lane end.        The a t m o s p h e r e

could be       cut w i t h a knife.

It is my o p i n i o n that          the       late   coming     rush by s upporters wit h tickets
                                                                                        PAGE    3
                                                                                        R 199

            and those want i n g   to get   in without   tickets   caused the   rush.

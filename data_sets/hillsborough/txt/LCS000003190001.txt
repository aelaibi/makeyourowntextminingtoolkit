Dear Peter,

                     Re: Hillsborough Assistance Knit

     Blank you very much for your letter of 10th January and the enclosed cheque
for £30,000 towards the costs of co-ordinating the response to the Hillsborough
Disaster.   It is more than a generous donation and I would like to thank you and
the Directors of the Club most sincerely.

      Following the tragic events at Hillsborough all of the Local Authorities
have made direct service conunitraents.  The co-ordination of this activity and the
servicing of the staff groups is a complex task, hence the need for the Assistance
Unit.

     The work we have all undertaken is to be evaluated by the National Institute
for Social Work and they may write to you advising you of their interest. 1 have
atressed to them the excellent co-operation and help we received from yourself and
everyone at Liverpool F.C.

     Again my sincere thanks on behalf of all the Social Services Workers involved,
for the donation.   I shall ensure that your wish for there to be no publicity is
respected.

     With best wishes.

                                  Yours sincerely,

 Dear David,

         You may recall that following the terrible tragedy
 which occurred in our F.A. Cup Semi-Final Match at Hillsborough
 last April we publicly stated that we would not make profit from
 continuing to play in last season's F.A. Cup Competition.

         The Football Association have only recently advised us
 of the final financial details of the Semi-Final and Final
 Matches and we are enclosing herewith cheque for £30,000.00 being
 a donation to the Hillsborough Co-ordinating Group from out of
 the nett balance.

         We would prefer that no publicity is given to
 donation.                                                                              social m    vm     bspt.
                                                                                              My**#»ooL

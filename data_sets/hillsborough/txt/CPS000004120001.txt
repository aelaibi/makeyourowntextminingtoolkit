            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

            Thank you for your letter of 1 February 1990 acknowledging the proposed
            timetable for the submission of the final report on completion of the
            criminal investigation. I have sent copies to Mr Williams and Mr Birts
            as well as the Police Complaints Authority.

            I also acknowledge receipt of your copy letter from Mr Patrick MP.
            Whilst I do not believe any useful purpose is likely to come from a
            meeting - we have had previous communications with this MP - I have
            arranged for one of my senior officers to see him in the very near
            future.




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                  ,Lloyd. House,.Birmingham

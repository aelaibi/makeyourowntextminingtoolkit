 Architectural and Structural Engineering Design: Rod Robbie & Mike Allen
 Architects and Engineers: The Ran Consortium. 40 University Ave., Toronto, Canada
 Design/Build Contractor: Ellis Don Ltd.

 The RAN CONSORTIUM: is a joint venture made up of:
 P Mne/Sane Architects Inc.*
 /.-.jeleian Allen Rubeli Limited Consulting Engineers
 NORR Partnership Limited Architects Engineers
 (♦Robbie/Young + Wright Architects for future stadium projects.)
 The consortium was formed to design and build the Robbie/Allen**award
 winning design for the retractable roofed Toronto SkyDome stadium.
 For work outside Canada - RAN International has been established.

 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION:

 Innovation:     The extensive use of computer generated and solid geometric analytical modelling
 has allowed the design professionals to systematically assess and confirm accurate sightlines for all
 sitin g in the stadium. The marriage of architecture and engineering in this project has been
^ p ip le te and highly successful. The strict requirements of the complex structural design of the
 roof and its supporting structure have been integrated with the equally important functional and
 aesthetic demands of such an enormous structure. Hie new standards of stadium and retractable
 roof design established with this facility will revolutionize future development of stadia throughout
 the world.                                                                                 6

Versatility:     This is a multi-use facility providing the following:

        a venue for major league baseball, 53,400 seats, 42,000 between foul poles
        a 55,500 seat venue for Canadian Football (the field for CFL football is slightly larger than
        soccer, and 62% larger than (US) National Football)
       Club with 5,800 fully upholstered seats. 161 private boxes each with its own seating
       balcony
       a venue for concerts for 10,000 to 67,500 spectators
       150,000 square feet of exhibition space with connection to the Toronto Convention Centre,
       using the stadium field
       Skyvision, the largest scoreboard/replay screen in the world 10.6 x 34.8 metres (35* x
       115’). Over three times the size of any other existing stadium video scoreboard,
       the first 350 suite luxury hotel to be fully integrated into a stadium, including 70 suites
       directly overlooking the field,
       a 600 seat tiered restaurant with all seats looking directly over the field,
       a 350 foot long bar overlooking the field, a Subway Bar, Homeplate Bar and a Hard Rock
       Cafe,
       a health club with squash and racquetball courts, a gymnasium, swimming pool, and a 680
       metre running track,
       offices for the Toronto Blue Jays Baseball Club and the Ontano Stadium Corporation, as
       well as other companies associated with the stadium

         a full TV station for Dome Productions and two large press suites, each with
         accommodation for 106 media representatives
         A Family Sports and Entertainment area surrounding the north east comer, SkyPlace.

FACTSHEET:

The SkyDome is the key project for the human and urban renewal of the Toronto waterfront and
railway lands.

Financial Statistics: The SkyDome is owned by a unique Consortium of public and private sector
partners.   Funds have been provided by the Government of Ontario, the Municipality of
Metropolitan Toronto and 28 private corporations. It is operated by the Ontario Stadium
Corporation, a crown corporation. The SkyDome will have 200+ days of full operation per year.
The project will have created an estimated 12,000 person years of employment for the Province of
Ontario upon the completion of the project.

Roof: The revolutionary rigid retractable roof is constructed of tubular steel parabolic framed
arches with a skin of single PVC membrane on thermal insulation and precoated insulated acoustic
steel deck. The roof will span 205 metres (674 ft.) at the widest point and will be 87 metres (285
ft) above the ground at centre field. The roof can be opened or closed in 20 minutes with 100%
   the field and 91% of the seats exposed to the open sky. The retraction of the roof involves
W th linear telescoping and rotational nesting movements.

The roof panels which are 4.2 metres thick contain 6348 metric tonnes of structural steel and
covers an area of 3.24 hectares (8 acres). Movement of the roof panels is carried out by 54, 14
ton to 40 ton bogies, electrically powered along rails. Very close construction tolerances had to be
achieved in order to ensure the success of the movement system.

Strict safeguards against roof truss failure have resulted in design requirements that prevent
progressive failure in the roof structure, as has been seen in other types of roof systems. A thirty
(30-) foot hole may occur in the roof structure, without progressive failure. The loads blocked by
the hole would be transferred down alternate pathways into the structure then into the ground.

Construction: The Design/Build Contractor Ellis Don Ltd. under the leadership of Don Smith,
George Davis and Walter Woloshyn have undertaken to build the SkyDome in 30 months. Co­
ordination of a crew 1000 workers comprising approximately 15 subtrades, 16 cranes, both
stationary and mobile, ranging from 15,000 to 400,000 tons, as well as the constant flor of
enormous amounts of construction material has been a constant challenge.

The opening of the SkyDome in Spring 1989 will coincide with the 100th anniversary of the
opening of the Eiffel Tower. Excellence in design was heralded in the 19th Century, in the 20th
Century, excellence in design must also satisfy rigorous standards of applied function as well. The
Toronto SkyDome is a shining example of both excellence in design and innovation and function
grounded in sound economic viability.

                  I am here today to suggest the Lime has arrived

      for construction of a major domed stadium in the United

      Kingdom.
                  And, I would argue, the best model available —

      the only major stadium with a fully retractable roof -- is

      the SkyDome, nOw undsr construction on th® Tftfftnfo

      waterfront.
                                    4-via nood I® hptft.     While we in Toronto

      are subjected to uncertain weather conditions,                         including

      winter snow, no weather in the world is more unpredictable

      than Britain's

                      The recent rain-out of the men's tennis final at

      Wimbledon demonstrated mu a L dira.Statically hcv disruptive irhe

       elements can be to international sporting events staged in

       not insignificantly, hundreds of corporate sponsors —                               are

       often deprived of television signals because weather

       intervenes.          That is no longer necessary in the case of

            The answer is a stadium along the lines of the SkyDome,

       which next spring will begin offering a venue of

       spectacular appeal, where athletic events and shows will be

       staged          on schedule —        regardless ot tne-weather.

         1.      Whv Build A Retractable Roofed Stadium.

                 With very few exceptions major sports should be played
                 out of doors before a live audience.

                 The advent of sports television, both nationally and
                 internationally has created the sports star and super
                 star — and consequently made professional sports very
                 costly to run.

                 To pay, TV must operate to strict schedules, and meet
                 its audience obligations to advertisers.

                 To succeed professional sports clubs must
                      a)   Win — hence, expensive players
                      b)   Maintain large live audiences — to make
                           money and improve the TV spectacle.

                 Open-air stadiums are weather dependent.

                 Stadiums with fixed roofs eventually lose "gate"
                 income.

                 The solution to the dilemma of watching sports out of
                 doors, maintaining game and television schedules, and
                 hence, income is the retractable roofed stadium.


          2)     What Will It COSt.

                 The cost is greater than a fixed roof and is extremely
                 design dependent.

                 SkyDome is costing about £20 million more than a fixed
                 root ot comparable size (ovet o
                 project could pay for it in two years (i.e. the extra
                 cost).


           3)    Roof Structure.

                 Mike Allen, my structural engineering partner and
                 designer of the SkyDome roof and building structure,
                 and I believe that the only fully retractable roofs
                 (that leave na structure over the stadium when open)
                 which are structurally and economically practical are
                 of rigid steel construction.

                  Hence, the SkyDome design.

                  Because of wind, snow, ice, rain and earthquake forces,
                  retractable roofs should be of conservative design.
                  The forces to be handled especially in high winds are
                  very rare

                  Roofs should be fail-safe.

                  SkyDome can open and close in sustained winds up to 40
                  mph in 20 minutes, and can be closed in sustained winds
                  up to 60 mph.

     4) i s I t Saf e-
            The SkyDome is extremely safe.

            It is designed for a life of 100 years-plus.

            It is designed for one in 100 year return wind periods
            — three times as long as the Ontario Building Code.

            Fail-safe design has been used.  That is, the roof has
            been designed to handle severe localized damage without
            progressive collapse.

            None of the roof elements have to move on inclines when
            operating — removing the risk of spontaneous
            run-aways.


      5)    Copyrights and Pateafcfi-

            SkyDome and its stadium design is protected by world
            copyrights held by the RAN Consortium Architects and
            Engineers, Toronto, Rod Robbie and Mike Allen and by,
            U.S., EEC and Canadian patents held by Rod Robbie and
            Mike Allen.


      6)    Brief O u t line of skvdome Financing and Outline C o s t a .

            The Toronto SkyDome is owned by The stadium Corporation,
            of Ontario — (STADCQ)•

            President and Chief Executive Officer —          Charles
            (Chuck) Magwood.

            The corporation (STADCO) is owned 56% by the Province
            of Ontario who have underwritten the financial risk of
            building the retractable roof — and — 44% by 28
            corporate partners (private) sector.

            This is a unique business arrangement for building a
            major public facility in North America.

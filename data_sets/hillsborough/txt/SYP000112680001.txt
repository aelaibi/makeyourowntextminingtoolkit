                 The    parade        for    this      event at D o n c a s t e r       was 8.45am.            After   briefing we

                 b oar d e d    vehicles           including        double    decker      buses     from S o u t h Y o r kshire

                 Trans port.           My serial           number was 29,          my S e r g e a n t     was ^ ^ ^ 2 3 0 ^ L o m « ,

                 We a t t e n d e d the        s ta d i u m and after         briefing         I went      to M i d d l e w o o d Road

                 j u n c t io n w i th L e p p in gs         Lane    in company wit h PC                1758 W i n f i e l d and

                 stayed at this              l o c ation throughout.

                 H o w e v e r , at about 2 . 4 0 p m this             date     I noti c e d a large            number     of

                 L i verpool         fans were w al k i n g          towards L e p p i n g s Lane from various

                 d i r e c t i o n s a l t h o u g h having         had a drink         they did not appear                to be

                 drunk.         They      r e m ained      in groups        causing      traffic        to stop due to their

                 large     numbers.            I looked down towards                 the ground and             saw a vast

                 amount        of    people         trying    to get     into     the    ground.

                 At 2 . 5 5 p m t o g ether w i t h PC W i n f i e l d on the                  instructions          from PS Lomas

                 we went        to the L e p p in gs          Lane    entrance,         the    report we had was             of the
                                                                                                              PAGE

crowd    pushing and some were                 being       crushed.

Oft   arrival    at th e entrance wit h other                   officers we            formed       a cordon and

refused     entry     to other         supporters.           I. was    only at this              p o s ition a

s h o r t time w h e n the first a m b u l a n c e arrived.                    The      cordon broke to

a ll o w the a m b u l a n c e entry.           I thou g h t    someone must              have been        injured.

As the a m b u l a n c e      e nt e r e d the ground         I saUf some L i v e r p o o l         supporters

were    blocking      i t ’s way,       I left the          cordon to         pull     them out of the way

thus a l l o w i ng   the a m bu la n c e       through.        W h e n the a m b u l a n c e       passed         I

looked up a n d saw a m a n              c a r r y i ng anot h e r man out of the_West^_stan£

tunnel,     although          he did not have a Po l i c e                helmet     on     I

was anot h e r     officer.,         whose     d e tails     I do    noj1_ k n o w .      I ran to g i v e ^ u m

a s s i s t a n c e a n d as we       rested    the    inj ured down onto               the ground,           this

of Ti c e r~~sa i d vT h e r e ’s hundreds more               in there dead,              or     injured’.             I

ran    into the       tunnel      and    could see the game was                  s t ill        in progress.

Assisted        a n o th er    offi c e r    to carry out a           man age d about 23 years dark

straight        hair and wea r i n g a navy kagoul,                   he    a p p e a r e d dead.        We

carried       him out      of the       tunnel     and also         placed him onto               the   ground and

t ried to       revive     him to no avail.                 A bear d e d man who            said he was a

doctor     looked at          him,     an d after a brief            e x a m i n a t i o n he said he was

dead.      As more and more              of the       supporters          came out,         they were

shouting        at the Po l i c e       saying we          caused all this.               The    extent       of    the

 incident       was   not apparent.             I could not           see any stewards              present.               I

did not       have a radio and at that                  time     there were            no s u p e r v i s o r y

o f f icers at      hand.

At the time of dea1ing with injured persons and bodies X did not

 think    of any      fears      or feelings.           I was       too     busy trying           to help          cope

w i t h the     situation.            However,     when      r e quested       to assist          wit h other

 duties    by s u p e r v i s o r y    officers       who    later     had     the s i t u a t i o n under

 control,       I felt        drai n e d and bewildered.

 On    reflection,         I can only        place     the     blame       on the Liv e r p o o l       supporters

            late      comers    for w h a te ve r   reason,    for   pushing     their way     into the

            ground.       H a d they       listened to o f f icers      i n s t r ucting   them not   to force

            their way      into      the    ground too   quic k l y this       tragedy w o u l d   not hav e

            happened.          The   blame    lies w h o l l y on their     shoulders.

*A* DIVISIOU.
GYPSY LIAISON OFFICER.
DATE OF APPOINTMENT 20.5.71*.


 AT 8aa ON SATUBDAY 15th APRIL 1989, I ATTENDED 'A* DIV. DHQ. TO COMMENCE DUTY,FOR OK THAT
DATE,TOGETHER WITH OTHERS,WE WERE ON PUBLIC ORDER PATROL,TO ATTEND HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL
GROUND FOR THE F.A. CUP SEMI FINAL, LIVERPOOL VERSUS NOTTINGHAM FOREST., KICK OFF yPM
 PROMPT.


 THE PARADE FOR THIS EVENT AT DONCASTER WAS 8.45.®».     AFTER BRIEFING WE BOARDED VEHICLES INCLU/
fDING DOUBLE DECKER*BUSES FROM SOUTH YORKSHIRE TRANSPORT.     MY SERIAL NUMBER WAS 29 $Y SERGEANT
 WAS P.S.2305. LOMAS, and INSPECTOR FOR THE SERIAL WAS INSPECTOR HUMPHRIES FRO* A.3.


 WE ATTENDED THE STADIUM AND AFTER BRIEFING I WENT TO MIDDLEWOOD ROAD JUNCTION WITH LEPPINGS
 LANE INCOMPANY WITH PC.3758 WINFIELD. AND STAYED AT THIS LOCATION THROUGHOUT.


 HOWEVER, AT ABOUT 2.%0.PM THIS DATE I NOTICED A LARGE NUMBER OF LIVERPOOL FANS WERE WALKING
 TOWARDS LEPPINGS LANE FROM VARIOUS DIRECTIONS ALTHOUGH HAVING HAD A DRINK THEY DID NOT APPEAR
 TO BE DRUNK. THEY REMAINED IN GROUPS CAUSING TRAFFIC TO STOP DUE TO THE THEIR LARGE NUMBERS.
 I LOOKED DOWN TOWARDS THE GROUND AND SAW A VAST AMOUNT OF PEOPLE TRYING TO GET INTO THE GROUN


 AT 2«55pa TOGETHER WITH PC WINFIELD ON THE INSTRUCTIONS FROM P.S. LOMAS WE WENT TO THE
 LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE, THE REPORT WE HAD WAS OF THE CROWD PUSHING AND SOME WERE BEING
 CRUSHED.


 ON ARRIVAL AT THE ENTRANCE WITH OTHER OFFICERS WE FORMED A CORDON AND REFUSED ENTRY TO
 OTHER SUPPORTERS.   I WAS ONLY AT THIS POSITION A SHORT TIME WHEN THE FIRST AMBULANCE ARRIVED.
 THE CORDON BROKE TO ALLOW THE AMBULANCE ENTRY. I THOUGHT SOMEONE MUST HAVE BEEN INJURED.
 AS THE AMBULANCE ENTERED THE GROUND I SAW SOME LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WERE BLOCKING IT'S WAY,
 I LEFT THE CORDON TO PULL THEM OUT OF THE WAS? THUS ALLOWING THE AMBULANCE THROUGH.
WHEN THE AMBULANCE BUSED I LOOKED UP AND SAW A MAN CARRYING ANOTHER MAN OUT OF THE WEST STAN?
TUNNEL, ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT HAVE A POLICE HELMET ON I COULD SEE IT WAS ANOTHER OFFICER,
WHOSE DETAILS I DO NOT KNOW. I RAN TO GIVE HIM ASSISTANCE AND AS WE RESTED THEINJURED U N
DOWN ONTO THE GROUND. THIS OFFICER SAID THER'S HUNDREDS MORE IN THERE DEAD, OR INJURED.
I RAN INTO THE TUNNEL AND COULD SEE THE GAME WAS STILL IN PROGRESS. ASSISTED ANOTHER OFFICER
TO CARRY OUT A MAN AGED ABOUT   S& YEARS   DARK STRAIGHT HAIR AND WEARING A NAVY KAGOUL, HE APPE»
ARED DEAD, WE CARRIED HIM OUT OF THE TUNNEL AND ALSO PLACED HIM ONTO THE GROUND AND TRIED
TO REVIVE HIM TO NO AVAIL, A BEARDED MAN WHO SAID HE WAS A DOCTOR LOOKED AT HIM, AND AFTER
 A BRIEF EXAMINATION HE SAID HE WAS DEAD. AS MORE AND MORE OF THE SUPPORTERS CAME OUT, THEY
                                                                                 (L'pfr
WERE SHOUTING AT THE POLICE SAYING WE CAUSED ALL THIS. THE EXTENT OF THE INCIDENT WAS
NOT APPARENT. I COULD NOT SEE ANY STEWARDS PRESENT. I DID NOT HAVE A RADIO AND AT THAT
TIME THE! WERE NO SUPERVISORY OFFICERS AT HAND.

AT THE TIME OF DEALING WITH INJURED PERSONS AND BODIES I DID NOT THINK OF ANY FEARS OR
FEELINGS, I WAS TO BUSY TRYING TO HELP COPE WITH THE SITUATION. HOWEVER, WHEN REQUESTED
TO ASSIST WITH OTHER DUTIES BY SUPERVISORY OFFICERS WHO LATER HAD THE SITUATION UNDER
CONTROL I FELT DRAINED AND BEWILDERED.

ON REFLECTION, I CAN ONLY PLACE THE BLAME ON THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WHO REMAINED AT
THE PUBLIC HOUSES UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AND OTHER LATE COMERS FOR WHAT EVER REASON, FOR
PUSHING THEIR WAY INTO THE GROUND. HAD THEY LISTESKD TO OFFICERS INSTRUCTING THEM NOT TO
FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE GROUND TOO QUICKLY THIS TRADEGY WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENS!). THE
BLAME LIES WHOLLY ON THEIR SHOULDERS.

At    the      start          of m y      duties,           at     1 1 . 1 3 am      there         was    a very           fe w    f a ns    of

any    s u p p o r 1 1 ng          team       t o b e see n .

At    about         midday            fans       started           toa r r i v e .       All        fans were             in g o o d    spirits

with     no      h i nt       of    trouble           at    all.

Soon     after           midday          I no ticed many more                     fans        a r r i v i n a X To me              they

seemed         to    be       going       in a n y         direction         w i t h L i v e r a d o 1 fans               walking           from

the    area         of    the       ground        towards           Claywheels              direction.

Many     fans        were          asking        if     there       were     puh#       open and where                     they were.                I

also     noticed              fans       of    both        per suat i ojr hav i ng             no    tickets             and asking

where       they         c o u ld     get      them,

At    about         12.30          pro I n o t i c e d         a / ifot of     fans         were     carrying              dr i n k .       I saw

There       were         also       a f e w /arts wh o              were     definitely              drunk         and were             being

helped         by    friends.                 jeut s t i l l the m o o d wa s               good.

about       3.30         pm         so/l c o u l d h av e a meal               break.

At    a b o u I 3 .0 0                    I h e a r da h u g e roar            fro m t h e c r o w d          in s icse the g r o u n d ,

so    I a s s u m e d JLhe            ga m e     ha d      started.

At    t hi s     time (the            streets              were      st ill full        of pe o ple, t hi s                 time        in a

hurry       to      get       to    the       ground.

From     my      position             I could           see       the    other       en d     of    the      s t r ee t , w h i c h         was

also     patrolled,                   and       I. c o u l d      see all      the    f an s       were      r u s h i n g to       get      to

the    ground,            this        being       the       Leppings         Lane        entrance.

At    about         3.30       pm     I realised               something          was       not     ri ght        at     the      g r o u n d as

the     crowd were                 quiet        but     I d id       not    know      wh at.

Shortly          after         Liverpool              f an s      were     coming        up    to me a n d             saying        things

like,       "How         does       it    feel        to     be a m u r d e r e r . !!         The       f a ns    were        obviously

very     u ps et a n d             i n t ear s .

At    one      p o in t       I could           see a      lot     of a m b u l a n c e s         leaving              the g r o u n d ,     ftom

                  d r iver,      attendants,                 g iv i n g h e a r t m a s s a g e .

                   I then        realised          something             serious         h ad   o c c u r r e d a n d was        about     to     l eave

 £   a d i o   ' stopped         them        from       fighting.           This         changed my           decision        to    go a n d      I

                  decided        to     stop       in    case       something            similar       occurred.

                  This     sort        of    occurrence             happened         regularly            afterwards          until

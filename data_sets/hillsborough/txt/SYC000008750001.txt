        Dear Sirs,

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.     Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my r e s p o n s i b i l i t y ^ select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing toyou
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to                           my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
          names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
          to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

          I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          heard from you by the end o f J ^ ^ b e r I will assume you have no names to
          submit.

          Yours faithfully.

                 Dear Sir

                 Hillsborough - Mrs Ann Wright
                 We act for Mrs Ann Wright mother of Gary and Stephen Harrison
                 who died in the Hillsborough tragedy on 15th April 1989.

                 We should emphasise that we do not act for the immediate
                 families of the deceased.   We are bringing a claim on behalf
                 of Mrs Wright.

                 We should be most grateful to receive a copy of the post-mortem
                 report.  We shall of course be responsible for your fees
                 in this matter.

O                 We look forward to hearing from you

            Sira,

*»»      M T       B     M    M                               h.'.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not* to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure -feat this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

 Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

Dear Sirs,

Re:        Gary Harrison (deceased).
 Thank you for your letter of the 8th of August.

 I enclose a letter Heference SLP/JT/H/EM/OOI which deals
 with the question of the release of the post mortem
 reports to you. On that basis, I enclose the post
 mortem report. If you cannot accept it on these terms,
 please return it unused.

 I am not clear whether you represent your clients in
 connection with the Inquest proceedings.

 As I am anxious to sort out the legal representation
 in order that I may know who to communicate with, I
 would be grateful if you could please let me know as
 soon as possible whether or not you are instructed
 in connection with the Inquest.

 If you are so instructed, I would be grateful if you
 could please let me know who precisely you represent.

 Finally, I would be grateful if you could please let
 me know whether you intend to associate yourself with
 the Hillsborotgfc Steering Committee group of solicitors.
 This is of course a matter entirely for you, The purpose
 of my inquiry is to try and sort out which firms are
 within the group and which will need separate communications.

  I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

  Please quote our reference.

             \Dear Sirs,
()
                  Ton .will be aware that X do not normally release post mortem
                 IReports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
                 'm fact put in as evidence.

                 However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
                 and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
                 I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
                 I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
                 report of your client(s).

                 The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

                         a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                                 subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                                 they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

                         b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement

o                                conselling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
                                 legitimate purposes in conneccfcion with any legal proceedings
                                 in which solicitors may be engaged.

                         c.      Subject to the.'ca.fe2l<J§, they are to be kept confidential until
                                 they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

                 I have your request for the post mortem report to ha.n<j in respect
                 of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the                                             ■ ■ '
                 assumption that you will confirm that the report in respe,ct of
                 each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
                 above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
                 I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
                 reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
                 the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

Dear Detective Superintendent Beechey,

       TTTTjTiS'BQRQTTGH DISASTER - BODY FILES.


As agreed with Mervyn Jones, I am contacting you in connection
with any detailed amendments which I think perhaps should be
made to the files.

I have already mentioned to Inspector Tobe that the summaries
are fine, my only reservation being because they are in the
third person and do not contain quotes may give rise to perhaps
some extra questions from solicitors. However, as the format
has already been settled, and I believe that the majority of
cases have already been drafted, I do not think that there is
very much we can do about it at this sstage.

 I have now managed to read through several files and would
 nice to draw the following points to your attention:-




                                                                                     cont'd

                                              C O R O N ER


                      Telephone: SHEFFIELD (07421 738721       12th .March       19 90.

                                                        2

There are one or two other points in some of the statements, at
least in one of the statements which I do not find quite right,
but they are not relevant as far as these Inquests are concerned
so I will not refer to them.

Decgged Reference No. 3. Gary Harrison.

Page 16 of the statement. The statement from Simon Wei gold
seems patently incorrect as the body appears to have been identified
to him initially by number only, the full identification not having
taken place until the Sunday.

I think that this is probably just wording but it might be
better at some point to correct this.




For the next few days I will not be at the Medico-Legal Centre
but you will be able to contact me at my home where I will be
a good bit of the time.


Yours sincerely,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

PERSONAL


Dear Mike,
     During a discussion early on in the development of the fund you mentioned
the possibility of assistance with service provision.   % comment then was that
it was assumed that the first call on cash should be directly from the people
involved.   You indicated that in Bradford a grant had been given to the hospital
burns unit.

     We are now seeking to finance the services post-Hillsborough. The attached
report agreed by the nine Local Authorities most affected m s agreed in principle
and as you can see cost £350,000 per annum*   Direct services sill cost at least
£1 million per annum. This totals £4 million over the next three years.

      I felt you should be aware of this and perhaps either now or in the future
tshen you are clearer about the likely levels of income and expenditure you might
consider 'asking a payment towards services from the residual resources if incase
grossly exceeds expenditure.

     It uould be of enorrsous assistance if you could let iae know whether you think
this is a possibility.

                                 Yours sincerely,




                                 Director of Social Services.

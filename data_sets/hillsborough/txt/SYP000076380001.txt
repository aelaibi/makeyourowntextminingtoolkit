           did    I see anyone           d ri nking alcohol            in the     ground.

           1 noti ce d that          before       the    kick      off that     the wings          of the W S tand were

           the W S ta nd were            very     full.

           I could see           the m id d le       of the W S ta nd was            getting       fuller and fuller

           but    the     crowd was       in a good mood.              I could see them moving                 back and

           f or w ar d singing and that,                 but      I d i d n ’t see any        crush at this          stage.

           (1502)        when    I saw the        first      fans    trying     to get        over the       fence at the

           front     of Pens 3 and 4.                I thought at         first      that     it was      just a bit of

           crowd trouble.           The     fans      kept     corning over and             because    of    people    on the

           pitch     the m at c h was          stop pe d at 3 . 0 6 p m       (1506).        The   fans     kept    coming

           over.     I d i d n ’t really         know that          s om ething      really bad was wrong,              until

           I saw an a mb u la n ce          come     onto the        pitch.       The a m bu la nc e        came

           from     the    corner       of the Kop and             the N Stand.         I

           saw    people        lying    on the       pitch at this           stage.        1 still    didn't      know how

              Whe n    I saw one        person who a pp ea r ed to be dead being                      carried       on a

              b i l l b oa r d by others         I knew but         some    serious    had h ap pened so            I made my

              down the Kop,            to the front.          I c o u l d n ’t get    out    so I turned a ro un d and

              went     back to the Kop entr a nc e                 on the    right    hand side.        By this       stage

              there were         people all          over    the    pitch on the W Stand side.

              I got out onto            the    pitch on the          corner    of the Kop and the N Stand

              wh e n   I got     there,       I could see          people    being    carried on a few stretchers

              and more         billboards-        I c a n ’t really         remember m uc h detail            about    the

              people      I saw there          but    I think       I remember       one    fan lying on the           pitch

              by the Kop and the N Stand.                     I remember       he was wearing a green and

              white      striped shirt.          There were          people a ro un d him wit h other                fans and

            that car but I d o n ’t know all the names and addresses,

            We set off from                at about       11.45pm and travelled disrect to

            Sheffield via the M 6 , M62 m o t o r w a y s .        We were held up q f\ a few

            occasions on the motorway bytause of road works and                                 sheer volume

of traffic.     This   put us back by about an hour on the journey and we

arrived in Sheffield outside the ground at about 2.40pm.

We drove past the ground along Leppings Lane and went to find a

parking space.     The    crowds outside the ground were normal      for a match

of this kind.

We parked the car on a small          car park past where the Liverpool Coaches

were   parked, about     10 to 13 minutes walk from the ground.         We then

walked back to the ground some of the others went ahead of us because

it was near to kick-off       time.    This left just myself and

walking together.        We had tickets for the North Stand.       My sons and

three of the others had tickets for the W Stand and my nephew had a

ticket for the terraces.        There were plenty of Police between our

packing position and the ground.          They were at road junctions on

either side of the road and were stopping traffic from going              into the

side roads.                                                    stiles at 3.5pm.

There was a                                                     and just the odd

fan going in                                                    to us have you

got tickets,                                                  directed us to a

blue swing t                                                  stiles.     A

Policewoman and a Policeman by the gate opene#4^it and let us through,

c 1 os i ng it agai n behind u s . We saw a tu^fiel ahead of us and walked
                            -rcwN/,£_(_    ty z L ^ rr '^rA-rvoj)
towards i t . I looked through the t y m e l and realised That we were

behind the goal.       I would see tl^ft the players were on the pitch.              I

could also see people standing on the perimeter of the pitch between

the goals and the fencing at the front of the terraces.            We only had a

quick glance and I thought that the game had been stopped because

people had gone onto the pitch.          We then came back,   through a gap in

the wall   between the rear of the West Stand and the turnstiles.               We

realised that we were       in the wrong section to get to the North Stand

so we went to a stewards       hut in the corner.    A steward came out and
                                                                                            PAGE      3

              after we ex plained to him that we had tickets for the North Stand he

              opened a little gate and let us go through,*^At this stage I still had

              my ticket     in fact and had no^^>r^Kiuc<^*'i t at all to a n y b o d y .   We then

              found our way into the North Sta^ra quite easily and found our seats,

              The time then was abpdt 3.10pm and I could see utat the players had

              all gone off t h e / p i t c h .   I could see lots o ^ p e o p l e and police on the

              pitch and st^ll thought that thei r had erobably just been a bit of

              crushing^and that the people had b e irn brought onto the pitch to

              releive    it.    The central area of the terraces did look extremely

              crowded.      I could see people at the back of the pens climbing over the

              side fencing and others being lifted into the stands above them.

              We c o u l d n ’t see the front of the pe j&     because there were a lot of

 „    _/      Police and fans on the pitch inf/ont of the fencing which obstructed
CAT/
              our view.        I could see how ev af that some fans were climbing the front

O 'f& J L ,   fencing to get onto the pir^ch.           At the far side of the goal area from

              but the Police on ad"r side of the goals were just standing there.                 I

              thought that the Police were just trying to regain order and that the

              game would be re-started.            I saw a lad lying in the goal mouth who

              appeared to be hurt.          He was folding his arms to his body and rolling

              around as though he had been crushed.             Over the next 10 minutes more

              and more    people came onto the pitch and were           lying down on the pitch.

              At about 3.20 pm I saw an ambulance            come onto the pitch from the far

              corner of the ground between the North Stand and the Spion Hop and go

              over towards the Leppings Lane end.             At about the same time I saw a

              lad lying on the pitch on our side of the goalmouth and I saw someone

              put a coat over his face.           This was when I first realised that there

              were fatalities.        Someone     came into the North Stand and I heard him

              say "Theres      people dead in there".        I said to him "How do you know" He

              replied "I've just        come out of there".       It was   clear to me that he
                                                                           PAGE          «

meant that he        had been in the pens at the back       of the goals at the

Leppings Lane end of the ground.        At about the     time that the Ambulance

came onto the pitch I saw that people were being carried on what

appeared to be stretchers across the pitch towards the same point of

the ground from where the        ambulance had come. I then thought about           my

nephew        .      I knew that he had gone into the       terraces at Leppings

Lane end and so I decided to go and find the Police Incident Room to

see   if          tad been involved*    I went down,    out of the stand

and saw a po 1 i ceman in tbre passageway whi ch runs a 1ong the^back of the

with his/face      covered with a co a t .   I then saw farther on, two rows

o p /r injured people.   There were fans atteriding to the injured giving
/
the 'kiss of life' and chest massage etc.         There were about four or

five police officers standing in a group doing nothing to help.              I.

looked at one of the bodies who was about the same build as                    nd

uncovered his face to see if it was him.           Thankfully it was not

I then walked along the lines of injured people to see if                   »as one

of them but he was not there.          I thought that    I ought to do something

to help because some were moaning and were not getting attended to.                  I

went over to a policeman and asked him to get some medical help.              He

said that he had no radio and I told him that he had^fietter find

someone who h?ui then.      One of them then walked^^way presumably to try

                     them.     One of     the injured that had just come in collapsed on the             floor

                     and I went to        him and hel#red him to the side and sat him up by

                     the wall.      He    was asking for a drink of water.          I was trying to

                     comfort and reassure him.             One of his friends asked a Policeman if he

                     could have a drink for the lad but he just said "wet his lips."

                     He then walked away I then went to a Police van to see if I could get

                     a drink for the lad but before I got there                 I saw another young    lad

                     about    16 yrs old who was unattended.              He was sitting on the floor and

                     just shaking        I asked him "Are you alright"           He wouldn't   reply - he was

                     crying and in a bad state of shock.                  I thought I would try and get

                     a blanket to cover him up.              I again looked towards the Police van and

                     saw a Policeman get out of it,.               He was in shirt sleeves and was

                     wearing     l e a t h e r ^ o o t s annf areeches.   I thought that he must have been

                     throat with his right hand and pushed me b a c k w a r d s .           I went back onto

                     the     tea-urn and got scolded by           hot wajrlfr down the back of my legs

                     Three or four other policemen               intervened and restrained him.       Another

                     one     took hold of me and I said "He's having a cup of tea while people

            _ . „are         dying."     He said OK - Just go away."           I walked back and attended

              walked away and spoke to another group of uniformed Police Officers,

              the same ones     I had initially spoken to about moving the bodies.              I

              again asked    if the bodies     could be moved because of the effect they

              were having on the young        injured fans being brought      in.   One   said that

              they were using the Gymnasium.          I then assisted q j M r   fans in carrying

              the dead bodies on the boards over to the^ehtranee to the Gym which

              was only about 4 or 3 yards a w a v ^ I      didn't see any of the Police

              helping at all.         I took afcfStTt 4 bodies over to the Gym and the Place

              was then clear of dead bodies.          More Police were arriving and also a

              couple of first aid people.         The Police cordoned off the area to

              prevent other people coming        in and all the injured were being attended

              to.   There appeared to be some sort of order being restored to the

              situation and I then decided to go back to the Stand to see if

              was still t h e r e .    When I got there he had already left.        I also then

              made my way out of the stand and left the ground into Leppings Lane at

              about 3.40pm.      I walked back to the car and when I got there saw that

              my sons and my nephew             and       i;ere already there.      None of them

              had been hurt at all.

              I did not need any treatment for ip f legs when I had been scolded.

              They were red for a day or twoyfhats all.           I don't

              blame the officer as it was/'a very stressful situation and different

              people    reacted in different ways

AEW y         1 ^ee 1 that the Po liquefaction at the      incident room was totally

C O M M I T   disorganised.      The/e appeared to be no type of disaster plan of action

              at all.    Medical      facilities were non-existent.    This     in my view

              resulted in there being more fatalities

              than there would have been with better organisation and proper medical

              facilities.    (Signed)

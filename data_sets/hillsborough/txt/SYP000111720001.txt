                       Harries-Road                then       walked          to       front          of       ground          at    Penistone

                       Road       .

While           crossing          the       road       serial       stopped             by       a    Superintendent                      who       was

listening              on       his    radio.           There       appeared                to       be    some          confusion.                 We    were

then        told,          " T h e y v re    on    the       pitch,       get          in    there."                 We       walked          into       the

ground           via       the    Spion          Kop    end    and       onto          the       pitch          perimeter,                on       looking

towards           the       Leppings             Lane    end       of    the       pitch,             1    saw       a    large          number          of

fans        on    the       pitch,           I    presumed          that          there          was       some          sort       of    public

order           situation             taking       place.           We    then          started                to    run       along          the    pitch

towards           the       Leppings             Lane    end       and    the          serial             then       became          dispersed.

Myself           and       Police       Constable             2135       Edwards             stayed             together.                 On       our

arrival           at       that       end    of    the       ground,          a    large             number          of       fans       were

walking           on       the    pitch.           I was       situated                approximately                      at       the    edge       of

what        was       happening             at    that       stage       and       was       telling                the       fans       to    get       off

the        pitch.           A    Sergeant          then       told       myself             and       Police             Constable             Edwards

to        form    a    cordon          across          the    pitch,          which          we       did' a l o n g           with       a    number

of        other       Police          Constables             who    1    did       not       know.              I    still          at    this: s t a g e

Had        no    idea       what       had       happened          and    was          trying             to    control             the       fans       on

the        pitch       and       tell       them       to'get       off.           I    could             see       that       there          was    a        •;

a    stretcher            and       a    number                of    Liverpool                   fans    had          approached             shouting,,

" T h e r e ’s      people          dying          in          there       why          a r e n ’t      you       h e l p i n g ? 11        Most,       of    these

people        appeared              under          the          influence                   of     alcohol.             I    then       decided              that

I was        serving           no       useful             purpose             where             I'was       and       together             with        Police

Constable               Edwards, moved                         towards          the           goal.          I    remember             talking           to

about        six        persons          who       were             lying        on         the       ground?          but       these       were        not

i n j u re d , ,    just       shocked.                    1    then       saw          a     youth      aged          about       2D       years,

laying         on       the    floor          who          was       panting                strongly             and    c o u l d n ’t , g e t

breath.             I    talked          t o-.him,              tried          to        calm         him,       whilst          doing       so     I

signalled               for    a    S t . - J o h n ’s              Ambulance                 lady      to       come       to    him       as    well.

The     youth           was    still          having                difficulty                   breathing             but       was    still

panting,            a    stretcher              then            arrived,                 he      was    put       onto       the       stretcher              and

was     taken           away.           It    was          then       t h a t ..I b e c a m e            aware          that       a. l a r g e         number

of    persons            had       gone       by       on       makeshift                   stretchers,                some       with       coats           over

their        faces.            Although                I       knew       people              had      been       injured          I was          still

unaware            of    the       true       scale             of    the        incident.

Myself        and        Police          Constable                   Edwards                continued             to    help        the w a l k i n g

wounded.                There           were       a    large             number              of      wooden advertising boards

strewn        across           the       penalty                area.           The           fans      with          these       were       told        to       put

them      into          one    pile          and       to       wait        for          us      to    call       for       them,       thanking              them

for     their           work       done       already.                    By    this             time    most,          if       not    all       of     the

bodies        had        been           removed.                 Even       at          this time            I    did       not     now what             ha d .

occurred            or    the           enormity               of     it.           I    had          seen       persons          being carried                   on

makeshift               stretchers              but            thought           that            these       were       injured             persons           not       ;

dead      ones.           I    did       no^       corne            into       contact                with       any    corpses             myself.

Some      time          after       I    do     not            k n o w 'how             long,         I was       approached                by    Chief

              Superintendent                     Nesbit,          who          told    me    to    tell       the       fans       on    the    pitch       that

           . t h e        game    was    off          and    to       start          leaving       the       pitch.           This       I    did    until

              about         half       the       number          on    the       pitch       had       left,       I    then       joined       other,

               colleagues              who       had    formed             a    cordon       across          the       pitch       ^t    the    halfway

               line.                             -                                                                 ’■

               I was        then       told       by    Police             Sergeant          Taylor          to    go       ba?k    to       Rawson    Spring

              Road         to    assist          in    getting             the       Notts    Forest          fans          away    from       the

               ground.            It    was       only       at       this       late       stage       while          talking          to    Police

              Constables               from- t h e          serial             that    I    learned          of    the       enormity          of    the

      ■        disaster           and     the         number          of       deaths       involved,             which       at    that       stage       was

              about         70»

              After         the    traffic             was       clearedwe                 made    our       way       to    Claywheels             Lane,

               where        after       grabbing             a    bite          to    sat,    were       transported                to       Rawmarsh       and

               went        off    duty       at       7.30       p'.m.I         did    work       at    the       semi-final             the    previous

               year,        our    serial             worked          at       the    Hillsborough                Shopping          Centre          some    mile

               to     a    mile    and       a       half    from          the       ground,

               I     have       only    one          observation                to    make    on       the    events          at    the       game,       and

               that        was    the     lack         of    communication                   whilst          inside          the    ground.           I    did

               not        know    what       was       going          on,

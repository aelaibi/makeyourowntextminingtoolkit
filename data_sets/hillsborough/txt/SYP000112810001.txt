Over the period at the match the fans were in good humour and sober until about 2.30pm
when there was a big rush of fans at the turnstiles and many appeared drunk.
I had little contact with the stewards except when the gate separating the est Stand
from the North Stand was opened. They said they hadbeen told to open it. I had no
radio and was not in contact with an officer with a radio.
To my knowledge I did hot handle a dead person. However I cannot say if the persons
helped are dead or alive.

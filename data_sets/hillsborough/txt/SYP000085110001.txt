The    second       incident        was a report             of two     special       constables          outside

licensed         premises        in N e e p s e n d       requesting      assistance?          on arrival         we

found       no problems,          just a small             group of Notts Forest                  fans    being

noisy?       boisterous          but    otherwise well             behaved.          There was       no need for

us to take any a c t i o n or                  remain at        the sjztfxw and w^iresum m y

taking       place     but at       the     request        of the      licencee,       we ente r e d the

premises         to assist        him     remove a 11 customers                   in order    to    close.        This

Neepsend        from where we             could monitor           fans and traffic moving a long

P e n i s t o n e Road towards            the    ground.

At    this     time    I heard         partial        radio messages,             I did not have a           radio?

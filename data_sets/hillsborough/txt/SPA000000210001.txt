RESOLVED - That the decision of the Panel on the various a lle g a tio n s be as
f o l 1ows:-

Allegation a:             t h a t on April 18th Miss L.M. communicated information
                          about the Hillsborough Tragedy to Mr. N. Bennett, a BBC
                          j o u r n a l i s t , such disclosure being in d i r e c t contravention
                          of in stru c tio n s which she had received over handling the
                          police response to questions from the media - appeal
                          allowed.

Allegation b:              t h a t the information so imparted was obtained in an
                           unprofessional and unauthorised manner, i . e . , from another
                           member of the press - appeal allowed.

 Allegation c:             t h a t on the 5th J u ly , Miss L.M. contravened an in s tr u c tio n
                           over the release of information to the media r e la tin g to
                           the tr a n s fe r of police o f f ic e r s who had close involvement
                           with events a t Hillsborough, namely by releasing
                           information to Mr. M. Sharp a j o u r n a l i s t - appeal
                           dismissed. However, in the view of the Panel, t h a t
                           punishment of dismissal for gross misconduct was too
                            severe. The P an el's decision i s t h a t a w ritte n warning as
                           to Miss L.M.'s futu re conduct i s appropriate. In reaching
                           t h i s decision the Panel noted t h a t Miss L.M. expressed
                            genuine re g re t fo r c e r ta in statements made to Mr. Sharp.

think        the    m atch was            just       kicking       off      and     the      crowd were             screaming              to

get     the       gates       open     because         the    turnstiles                w e r e n ’t l e t t i n g       people

through           quick       enough.           It w a s     packed and             there        were        peo p l e     with

Once     the       crowd        knew      the    gate       was    open       they       all     just        rushed        through             it,

there        were       no    stewards          and    no    one     taking         tickets.               I went        in,       through

the     rush       of    the       crowd      and     was    forced         straight            through          the     tunnel          until

X a ot       into       the     stand and            could     see      some       of     the    game.           1 h f.ta .rd .    the

barrier.            Th e      fella       stood       b e h i n d me,       pulled my            feet       from       under         the

barrier           but    my     training         shoes       came       off.        I scrambled                 over     the       top     of

P en n i s t o n e Road.        I recall     that    on the     journey \       saw a large         number       of

Football         fans,      w i th both red and white           colours,       outVirde      public    houses

on the      route.          I was a m a z e d at the       number    of    people who a p p e a r e d       to be

d r in k in g .      One    strange    thing      I remember was          that the     people    outside

the     pubs,     as well as        drinking       from gL^s’S'es'7 h a d \ j a c s           cas           beer

and     I also       remember      seeing    crates       pf b a t tered    b^er,     standing,       outside

the     pubs,      in p o ssession of the           foot)

I saw no actual               trouble,    violence,        rowdism or damage           being    caused,         but

as    the   fans saw the                                 a number made       gestures        at the vehicle,

On our arrival              at ^'t-fcie ground we went       to the       directors     lounge,       where we

s t a y e d until about          14.«<pm.         I had not     in fact got a ticket             for the

match,      but the         club s e cr et ar y    provided me w i t h one for a seat                 in the

u n co ve re d     part     of the S ou th Stasidr the seat           I had was        I think E.15.

Fr om where          I. sat    I o v e r l oo ke d the terraces at the Leppings                 Lane    end.

Wh en    1 took my seat            I remember       I looked at the Hop end and thought                         how

packed      it was,         by c om p a r i s o n to the L e p p i n g s Lane     terrace,      w h i c h even

as    late as        14.45pm seemed to have a number                  of empty spaces.              1 had no

reason to take muc h notice                  of what was        happening       in the       crowd as       I was

not aware          of any      problems,     arid I recall         that    I watc h e d the teams

corning onto the              pitch kicking        irKand then whe n the m atch kic k e d off.

The     game      had been      in progress        for 5\jr     six minutes,          when    I noticed

that     someone       had     run onto     the    pitch frohi the Leppings Lane                end.        1

im m e d i a t e l y thought       it was a pitch          i n v a s i o n y and, crowd trouble,        I

remember          I saw the L i verp ool          goal    keeper    pushing     the    fan to the       side,

and     indicating          to him to     leave the        pitch.

This     incident          brought my a tt en t i o n      to the Leppi n g s       Lane     end of the

ground,        and    I saw     people    trying to        climb over the         front      fence,    it

looked to me at that                time as       if it was a pitch           invasion.        I saw

stewards         up on the       front    fence,     making     signs      to the     crowd to go back.

My view was           from a     point    close     to the Police Control              Box w h i c h was
                                                                                                    page         :
                                                                                                       S2039

just      on my       left hand side and        level with me.           As    I have said from what
     %


I could see at about 3.06/7/2.                      I still    b e l ieved what was            happening

was a pitch            invasion.

The      ne;:t thing         I saw was a Police Officer,             an Officer        not a C o nstable

run onto        the     pitch to the     referee,      as the m a t c h was        stopped,       shortly

a fter     that,       I saw that a small        fence    in the       front    fence had been

opened and            people who were       either    dead or        injured were        being    carried

out      onto    the    pitch.

I realised then that what                had gone on was             serious    because        I saw a

c i v ilian man with a Polic e Officer,                  treating a man on the                 pitch,    they

were       pressing up and down on his               chest as        if they were        trying    to get

his heart            to start again.        I would describe           this    fan,    as a White        Male,

in his early 2.0’s,              he was wearing a dark           tracksuit wit h multi              coloured

patches         on     the shoulders     and bottoms of the           trousers.          After a short

time       I saw       the civilian man       pull   the tracksuit        top    over the        fans    face

as       if he was dead.

I stood         in     the stand from       -15. 10pm to about       16.10pm     and     all    that    time    I

saw fans         being       carried awa y from the L e p pings         Lane     end     of the ground,

most       by fans and Police          on the ad v e r t i s i n g    boards    that had been taken

from the side            of the    ground.      I did see some amb u l a n c e men wit h

stret c h e r s       but,     very few of them.       I only    remember        seeing    two

a mb ul a n c e s     come     onto the pitch the     first     one    that     parked be h i n d       the

goal      was a St Johns Ambulance,              I remember          thinking     that    it had a job

to get      to the L e p p i n g s Lane      end,    due to the        people on the           pitch.

I beleive            that everyone    was    taken by supri.se by what                happened,        but as

soon as         it was       realised what    had happened,           everyone     including

Stewards,            Police and fans     got stuck       in and helped all             they     could.

One      incident       I recall was     seeing Supp o r t e r s       from the L e p p i n g s    Lane       end

of the       ground      run up the pitch as         if they were         going    to at t a c k       the

fans at the Kop                end, but to prevent      this a line           of Police    came        onto

                                                                                                    S2039

            the      pitch to seperats    the   two sets    of fans,   and    prevent     this from

         , happening.          I w ould estimate      that this   incident    occured at about 3,

           30 p m but     I cannot    be sure   this    is accurate.

           The       one thing    that sticks   out    in my mind    is that as     late as    14.50pm

            there      still   a p pe ar ed to be space on the terrace at the Leppings               Lane

            end,     and that a large     number      of fans must   have a r r i v e d   late at   this

            end of the ground.

                                                                                                    SIGNED

                          Dear Dr. Popper,

                          Please find enclosed letters and stamped envelopes for the Jurors
                          of the Hillsborough Inquest.

                          At the end of the Hillsbpsough Inquest you spoke to the Jury aBout
                          the effects of seeing and hearing painful details about the disaster.
                          You suggested to them that should they find it necessary they could
                          approach their G.P. or speak to a Social Worker. I was very pleased
                          that you gave details of how to make contact with Mr. Webber at this
                          Department in Open Court at the end of the Inquest.

                          It is important that Jury members have contact numbers of confidential
                          help should they wish to use them now or in the future. This is
                          because it is recognised that it can take time for reaction to events
                          to emerge. Also, as the ending of the Inquest was particularly
                          distressing to those present in Court, the Jury may not have noted
                          the information you gave out regarding help available j&o them.

                           I would be very grateful if you would read the enclosed letter tod
                           send it on to members of the Jury so that they have the information
                           you gave in Court in writing should they need to refer to it in the
                           future.

                           If there are any difficulties concerning this request will you please
                           contact David Webber, Senior Principal Social Worker.

                           Thank you in anticipation for your help with this matter.

                           Yours sincerely,

                          Dear Juror,

                          I have asked Dr. Popper to send you this letter following his remarks at
                          the end of the Hillsborough Stadium Inquest.

                          As a member of the Hillsborough Inquest Jury over the last year you often
                          saw and heard painful details about the disaster. There may have been
                          occasions when you felt distressed by what you heard.

                          If any of these experiences have remained with you or they are affecting
                          your personal life you may want to discuss this in confiidence with
                          someone. As Dr. Popper said in his closing remarks, you can do this
                          either by contacting yofflr G.P. or you may wish to talk to a Social Worker.
                          If you would like to talk to a Social Worker now or in the future
                          please write or telephone me on 734856 or 734855. If you write, please
                          mark the envelope "Private and Confidential". Depending Â®o your wishes
                          I will put you in touch with the Social Worker from the Department or
                          another agency who were involved at the time and following on the disaster.

                           I can assure you that any contact you make with myself and with anyone
                           subsequently will be completely confidential.

                           Yours sincerely,

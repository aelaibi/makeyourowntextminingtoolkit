              At 0830 hours, Saturday                         15 April       1989 (1504-89), I commenced duty at

              Main St Police Station,                        to commence duties at Hi 11sborough regarding
                                                                         /
              the semi-final                football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

              I was attached to Serial 3 6 ;/in charge of this Serial was Police

              Sergeant            1829 F R A N C E .        I travelled to Hillsborough in a transit with

              other Officers from C1.

              Our duties were to be at Wads 1ey Bridge Station and to escort

              Liverpool            fans arriving at that station to Hillsborough.                           We took up

              our      post at about                1113 hours.      The train was not due until              1440 hours

              or thereabouts.                      During the time between our arrival at the station

              and the arrival                 of the train,          I saw a considerable number of Liverpool

              fans walking up the                      road (away from Hillsborough);           some asked us where

              the nearest             pub was that was open.                   We tried to deter the fans and
                                                                          PAGE    2
                                                                          S2234

requested they returned to Hillsborough,        some complied with this

request,    others continued up the road.      Also   large numbers of fans

were walking down the road w ith packs of beer and drinking f rom the

beer    cans;
            some were noisy and in high spi/its.          /
                               N ijLlfJO  /             /
About '1345 hours I was with PC31S3 TRCEK/near to the station when I

heard an assistance       call coming from a large Gateway/Supermarket

further up the road.       We did not attend this call as we were too far

away and shortly afterwards the assistance was cancelled.

I could see large groups of fans sfit on the banking outside the

supermarket.       All the time the number of fans was increasing and some

were drinking and getting nois/fer.       Numbers of fans had tried to gain

access to two public housgs yrsear to our location,       but these were

boarded up, although some people were gaining access,          these being

regulars.       The landlords were turning fans away from their premises.

About   1400 hours,    the special train arrived/f the fans who alighted

were very quiet with no rowdiness at all.         Some were searched but as

far as I recall,      nothing   intimidating or unlawful was found on

anybody.        I certainly did not discover anything untoward on the people

I searched.

The fans were asked to form up on a piece of waste ground near to a

public house       (the name of which I cannot recall). There was a short

delay whilst all the fans were gathered together?         the delay was

minimal and then,      together with some Mounted O f fi ce rs , they were

escorted to Hills bo rou gh.     These fans were very orderly and were not

in the least troublesome.        On arrival at the Ground at about 1420 hrs,/

the fans arrived at the Ground and entered orderly.           There being no/

more special trains,      we remained at this location,    this being Lepipings

 nm

Leppings Ln at this time was very busy with fans.           I recall a senior

Officer    (I don't know who)     requesting that due to pedestrian traffic,
                                                                        PAGE            3
                                                                        S2234

that Leppings Ln be closed to traf fi y, to avoid any accident.          The

mood of the fans at this time was tMat they were very noisy,           a lot

were drinking from beer cans and a lot of them were asking other fans

if they had any     ’spares*.     I took this to mean spare tickets.     There

was a lot of milling about by a great number of fans near to the gates.

I recall one man approaching me with his son who would have been aged

about   10 years;   the man informed me that he had been queueing to gain

entry to the Ground with his son,        he had hold of his son's hand and in

his other he stated he had his tickets.         He told me that someone had

jostled his son and in a reflex action,        turned to protect him; as he

did so,    someone else had stolen the tickets from his hand.        He did not

know who they w e r e , his son was obviously upset.       He realised there

was nothing I could do about it; he was not bitter about the incident,

merely disappointed at the behaviour of the so called fans.

As time progressed, Leppings Ln was getting more and more congested

with fans;    I noticed that only PSV's were being allowed down Le p p i n q s

Ln,   these making only slow p               e to the amount of fans.      As

kick-off time approached,        th.         emed to   be getting worse.        I can

recall a senior Officer,        Insi         IS I think,   using a loudspeaker

on a Police Land Rover m a k in              1 to the fans to stop pushing

and to form orderly queues,        these requests were being ignored.      The

Mounted Section were then requested to move nearer to the turnstiles

in an attempt to restore some             nee of order to the crowd.

Together with other Officers              equired to try and join the

Mounted Section to assist thet             as aware that a lot of the fans

had been drinking and the mood was getting decidedly ugly as kick-off

time approached.      I cannot recall seeing any stewards.       Although I had

my radio switched on,     I could not hear a great deal of what was being

said due to the noise of the crowd who were getting noisier and

noisier.     I can recall seeing a number of fans climbing up a wall and
                                                                                  PAGE         4
                                                                                  S2234

gaining access to the Ground gver the turnstiles

As 1500 hours came, I could yhear a shout from inside the G r o u n d ,

obviously as the game starj/ed; this caused the fans outside the Ground

to redouble their efforts at gaining access to the Ground.                    The mood

of the fans was turning decidedly ugly./ A short time later, a further

shout went up in the Ground which was/obviously too much for the fans

outside to bear, and a further surge was made.              I do not recall seeing

any gates being opened.        I did not hear any order given to open the

gates because the noise where I was made it almost              impossible to hear

the radio.

A short time later I saw a number of my colleagues running towards the

Ground.     I ran too.     I then heard a voice on my radio say,            "Every

 vailable Officer to the Ground immediately".              On gaining access to

the Ground I saw a lot of people on the playing area and what afppeared

to be panic at the Leppings Ln end.           I made my way to the per/meter

fence,    by a gate to the right of the goalpost,          looking t o w a r d ^ j i ^ ^ o p

end.     I assisted some people out of this gate.           I then saw PC SCHQLEY

of   *F* Division carry somebody to            fence.     I assisted getting this

person out and onto the pitch,        /s    I recall    it was a young lad that

had been brought out.        PC SCHQLEY then went back into the crowd;               I

followed him up to the fence that separated the two parts of the

Ground.     I could      see a number of people   lyiry# in the bottom by the

fence w ith other        people treading all over/them.        Some of the people

lying there were obviously dead or dyijpfg.            PC SCHQLEY and myself then

assisted a number of people over the/fence, some of the fans passing

them over to us,      some fans on our side of the fence also assisted us.

We took a number of bodies to the gate in the fence and passed them

through to other       Officers.    I do not know how many people I got over

the fence,    I know that some were        already dead and that some were

injured.     I also recall    that on some of my trips back to the fence I

                                                                                       S2234

             was kicked or punched by some fans who were directing their anger at

             us.     I recall   people shouting,    "It's your fault you black bastards".

             To be fair there was a number of people assisting us as well.              I also

             recall telling people to leave some people who were obviously dead and

             to pick up and help others who were obviously alive but injured.

             These    included children and young women.       Not a decision I would ever

             like to have to make again,      because obviously I am not qualified to

             make such a decision from a distance of over          10 feet away.

             After what seemed like eternity we appeared to have got most people

             out.     At this time I was with a Police Sergeant          (I do not know who he

             is).     We were the only two Officers      in this part    of the Ground asfar

             as I could tell.      The mood of the fans there was getting extremely

             ugly and they were      (in my opinion) about to turn on us.        We moved onto

spc' ' f the p«ch.
       IA    0 nce on the pitch I ass i stecf/wi th    First /Aid to some people.    I placed

             my anorak over one dead mam.          I assi.s/ed another Officer (I do not

             know who)    render the   kiss of life yb a man I     can   only describe as

   0     5   being    overweight and   aged about 50.      I recall he   was placed in a

             St. Johns Ambulance.       Eventually, at the request of Ch i ef

             Superintemi^nff^NESBIT, X assisted        in coaxing uninjured^fans off the

             pitch.     I recall two fans getting      extremely upset at one of our plain

             clothes video men as he was filming the W Stand^area.             They thought he

             was the Press.      Eventually they were led off the pitch.

             I then rejoined the remnants of my Serial         in the N Stand supplying

              coffee/tee etc.     to colleagues in a state of shock.

             Eventually we were stood down,         returning to MSPS at 1900 hours.

D.O.S.

D.O.B.




On the 15th April 89 I travelled by coach on my own down to Hillsborough            I

to watch the ocmi-final of the F.A. chellenge cup between Liverpool, and

Nottingham Forent.     The coach arrived at Hillsborough at about, 1410 hours

and I decided I would shuffle in with the crowd.




I wulked in through the turn^tilf»s find retained my ntubb and then

joctled aiy way through the tunnel and found mynelf pushed up to the railings.




Ky chest   wag   forced tight again©t the railing and I was gulping and gapping

for air and almost was o n the verge of      blacking out when ayounger       lad

picked :nn up by my anklon and that ie all I r e m e m b e r .




I regained conciousneors by the Cola flag and a man helped me to the hoardings

adjoiftin.?, +v'.e outer wall and watched them pumping another man'e chent and

covering dead peoples faces.

I had lost ray r-hoe and decided to have     a look for it.      I found it and

just sat: there for about an hour.




I left the ground and arrived horn at around 2 p.in.

I was unable to telephone my family ae the queuen were far too large

at the local telephone.      I   had to go straight home and arrived home just

after G o'clock.      My wife wan waiting for me and understandably was

distraught an wa p.    my non.   My chest was hurting badly and my uhoulder

was also hurting*




At the prcont. tine my non and wife are not speaking to me because

of the stress of the whole situation and al«o my unwillingness to talk

about the whole situation.




My solicitor h;ifi adviBed me to &ee my doctor for advice on counselling*

I intend to do this aa I do n o t feel 1 can continue in th<a present

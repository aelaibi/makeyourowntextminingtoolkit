      Dear Sir

      Hillsborough Disaster                                          •’

      Mr Gareth Williams QC and Mr Peter Birts QC are retained by
      the Crown Prosecution Service to advise in this case.

      I enclose a copy of a letter which I have today received from
      the West Midlands Police investigating officers.  In addition
      to the letter I also enclose copies of the items which were
      enclosed.

      It is possible that Mr Birts and Mr Williams have received
      copies of this documentation direct from the police and the
      purpose of this.letter is simply a belt and braces exercise.

      Yours faithfully

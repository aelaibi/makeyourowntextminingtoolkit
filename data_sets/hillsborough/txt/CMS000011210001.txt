Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Minister for Sport which
has been transferred to this Department in view of our
responsibilities for safety at sports grounds.

I enclose a list of legislation and guidance issued by the Home
Office on the subject of sports ground safety since the Wheatley
Inquiry of 1972. All of these publications are available from
Her Majesty's Stationery Office bookshops. General enquiries to
HMSO can be made by telephoning 071 873 0011. Mail orders can
be made by writing to HMSO, PO Box 276, London, SW8 5DT.

I hope this information is of use to you in your project.


                                                                   Yours sincerely


                                                                  Steve Bilbe
                                                                  (Fire and Emergency

Dear Sir or Madam

I am writing to request your help.   I am 15 years old and I am half way
through my GCSE courses.

As one of my options I have chosen to take P.E. I have to do a personal
study on one particular area of sport, this will earn me up to 25% of
my final grade.

Being a very keen football fan and supporter I decided that I would
investigate into one aspect of football, there are a lot of people at
my school who are doing studies on the History of Football so I wanted
to do something a bit different, I came up with the idea of Ground
Safety at football matches, and I would be extremely grateful if you
would be kind enough to send me as much information as possible on
this subject, and a guide to safety specifications at football
matches.

This would help me immensely and I would be very grateful for your
help.

I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

Yours faithfully

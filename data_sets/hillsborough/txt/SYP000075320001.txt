                  I am a single man and I live at the above address with my girlfriend,

                  I am a Fire Fighter with the London Fire Brigade and have been in

                  London for about 6 years.                       I am originally fronyifiverpool and have

                  been a Liverpool supporter all of my life.

              On Saturday 15th April                        1^9    (150489), I travelled frim m f parents’

                  home    in Liverpool i^itt/my two b r o t h e r s ^                     ^ncj                , and a

                  friend,          I, t<f Hi 3/ls bo rough for the F.A. Cup semi-final between

              Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                           We travelled by car and encountered

                  heavy traffic at the end of the M63 in M a n ch es te r.                           This caused quite

                  a lengthy delay and the delay was made worse by a new by— pass that was

                  badly signposted.

              When we arrived we parked in a road,                              near to an ambulance station,

              about one mile from the Ground.                           This would be at about              1.50 pm to




                                                                                                       OfW^-       H.
                                                                           PAGE       2
                                                                           S 19 3 8

2.00 pm (1350-1400).     There were Police Officers about but we just

followed the crowds.      In the same road as the ambulance station there

was a public house alongside the river.         We stopped there for a drink

but   it was packed,   so we had a drink and then made our way to the

Ground.    We arrived there at about 2.40 pm to 2.45 pm (1440-1445),             at

the Leppings Ln end.

There were no queues,     just a large crowd of a few hundred people

waiting to go in.      There were Police there but they did not seem to

know their way around the Ground and consequently were not much help,

through no fault of their own.       They were trying to help.      I did not

see any stewards outside the G r o u n d .    There appeared to be one

letter missing from above the turnstiles,         possibly ’B ’, and the

turnstiles were not clearly marked.

There were no orderly queues to the Ground turnstiles but we managed

to gain entry eventually.      I handed my ticket over and the stub was

ripped off by the steward.      I saw people climbing in over walls and

they looked distressed.      I think it was more to escape the crush

outside than to gain entry for nothing.

There was a steward at the foot of the stairs,         just inside the

turnstiles   leading to the seating area and he directed me to my

seating area quite well.      The only disorder     I witness at this    point

was a man who was in someone e l s e ’s seat with a standing ticket.

That was comparatively minor      incident,    an argument between the

steward and that supporter.

The   crowd below at this point was extremely crowded and packed, the

time being about 2.45 pm (1445).       The players had come onto the pitch

at this stage.

I became aware of t h ^ fact that more and more       people were coming into

the stand below(a^l the time.       The crowd appeared to be moving

forwards slowly in a swaying movement but not backwards.
                                                                              PAGE      3
                                                                              S1958

At just about kick-off t i m e , I noticed fans        climbing over the fences

from the left and right.        I noticed that a gate in the fence had been

opened a nd people were filtering out to the left and right.                My first

thoughts then were,    oh no,   not a pitch invasion.        We're going to get

banned from Europe for life.       T h a t ’s what   it looked like to me,     people

were getting out of the gate with such urgency.             Because of this the

Police were lining up facing the crowd,          but were not reacting to the

situation as it was.     I think they thought there was going to be a

pitch invasion.     The game had started by this stage and I was keeping

one eye on the game and one on the incident below.

At about 3.DS pm (15DS)    I saw a man lying on the gr ou nd, with a bare

chest,    to the rear of the goals,    behind the right post.       I think it

was a supporter who was giving frantic heart massage to the man, and

the way that it was done,       it appeared to me that the man was possibly

dead.

I saw the St. Johns Ambulance       people running down the side,       towards

our end, and they went to another man first who was lying on the other

side of the goals.     I was too far away t o ^ i v e     descriptions of either

of the men.                                 /

By now,    the play had been halted fry a Police Inspector grabbing the

referee and the players    left/Clpe pitch.

I was only realising by this stage what exactly was happening and I

sat down,    put my head in my hands and thought,         I ’ve got to do

something.     I decided to make my way down to the pitch to help so I

walked to the back of the seats and down the stairs,            the same way that

I came up.     I suppose that is through my Fire Brigade training that

you always go the way you had entered.          I got my green First Aid card

from my pocket and placed it in my teeth,            in order that people would

let me through,    and they did.     I went down the side of the stand where

I saw a fire engine.     The firemen were entering the Ground through the
                                                                                            PAGE        4
                                                                                            S 19 5 8

               turnstiles area.         I saw several   people laid out to the left of a

               tunnel,      on the floor;   they appeared to be dead as no-one was tending

               to them.

               I went down the tunnel towards the pitch and this was relatively empty

               other than Police Officers.          I came onto the terraces and just ran for

               the front, my main aim being to get on the pitch to help.             I d i d n ’t

               notice anything in the stands as I was concentrating on helping.

               I got to the gate in the fence and two Policemen pulled me up onto the

               pitch.       I went to the rear of an ambulance and introduced myself.               I

               asked for any equipment they could give me to use and they told me to

                look around and see what I could do.          He gave me a St. Johns Ambulance

               armband to wear which I put on.           There were that many people    laid out,

               there were not enough people to deal with them. I went to a man on the

                left hand side of the six yard box, Liverpool         end, who was purple in

                his late 4 0 ’s and he had light grey hair on top.         I think he was

    NiO/ ,(    wearing jeans.

     ujl)      There were so many bodies around and I checked some for signs of life

               but found none.         I c a n ’t remember details of them all.   It was then

                that    I remember starting to help rip up the advertising boards to

               start ferrying the bodies to the other end.

               During this time,        I saw a fireman in his T-shirt and leggings working

               on a man in the Nottingham Forest penalty area.            I ran up to him and

               saw that he had an oxygen cylinder with him.           The man on the floor was

              / f n h i s ,30’s .   The fireman was doing both heart massage and mouth to

               3 0 ’s with dark hair.       He was quite Y l i m a nd was wearing a white

went to the corner of the pitch between the N Stand and Spion K a p .

I met this male and female nurse who were from Liverpool,                    working on a

male in his S D ’s.      There was a guy named        j       who was standing over

them shouting,       " H e ’s not dead", and       panicing.    He said that he had

dragged him from the crowd,          the man       on the floor. They then gave up

on the man;       he was also d e a d .   I went to a     man I thought to be a

doctor and asked what I could do.

I generally       tried to straighten people up,putting shirts over                their

faces,    etc.    I then asked another doctor         if he    needed help and he          said

that he needed a defib.          I knew what he meant and went to find one.                      I

went to where the ambulances were,               I spoke to a high ranking ambulance

man who told me that an emergency tender was on the way so I went to

tell   some doctors.

I took a dead body into the gymnasium with some other supporters and

then looked back towards the door.                I saw a struggle at the door as a

Policeman and another man were trying to help a man into the door.                           I

thought he was dead and helped him through the door and placed him to

the left of the dead bodies,          behind a partition.

I knelt down to see if he was okay and a doctor came up and said was I

a friend.        I pointed to the armband and the doctor said,              keep an eye

on him.     I kept hold of his pulse and realised he                was alive. I had         my

doubts that he would stay alive.             I     reassured him by ta            o him

and telling him to breathe.           He told me his name was

from Southport, Merseyside.           He appeared to have heavy crush injuries.

I asked if he was with anyone and he said no.                  I asked for his      ’phone

number and I wrote        it on a programme.        He asked me to stay with him so

I did, and generally tried to reassure him.                Eventually I saw him into

an ambulance and told him I ’d 'phone his Mom.                 I d i d n ’t think h e ’d

survive.

I d i d n ’t want to go back in there as I d i d n ’t want to see anyone else

         then left the stadium and ’phoned the lad's mother.           I found a young

         lad who told me his friends were missing and I reassured him and took

         him back to his coach.       Unfortunately the seats where they should have

         been were empty,   so I left the lad with the coach driver and left.

         Earlier on in the afternoon,      just before the kick-off,     I took two

         photographs of what was happening        in the stand below (Ref. No.

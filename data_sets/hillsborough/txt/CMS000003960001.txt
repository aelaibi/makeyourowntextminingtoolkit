Dear Mrs Battley
I enclose a copy of a letter we have received from our sports
counterparts in the Portuguese Ministry of Education.    As you
will see they are asking if they can translate into Portuguese
and publish Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster. Perhaps you could let me know if
there are any problems about this particularly regarding
copyright.
Yours sincerely

                        Dear Peter,


                                           Thank you very much for the report by Lord Justice

                          Taylor on the Hillsboronght Stadium Disaster.

                                           Can we translate and publish it in Portuguese?

                                           To see you soon in Strasbourg.

                                           Cordially yours,
em eplgrafe.

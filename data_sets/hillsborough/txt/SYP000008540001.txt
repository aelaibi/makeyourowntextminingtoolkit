             We      r e m a i n e d at          this     position       until         shortly            before     kick     off.        The

                                                                                                                                               S75SA

           think        the     person        that        called          us    over       was    a Steward and            my    father

           approached              him    leaving          me       in the          corner       with   the    others.

           As     far a s       1 ca n        remember          a man          aged       about    SO years         wearing          a    black

           leather           jacket       and       had a L i v e r p o o l           accent       came    over      to    the       cor ner .            I

           think        someone          brought          him       over       to    the    corner      and    I saw       that          he    had an

           injured ankle                 which       resulted             in us       sitting       him    down      on    the       wall          in

           front        of    the     North         Stand.           I sat          next    to    him a n d    somebody          then          said

           that        he w o u l d      have       to    go    to    the F i r s t         Aid Room       for      treatment             but       he

           refused           and    stated          he w a n t e d        to w a t c h      the    match      as    he    had    paid a great

           deal        of m o n e y      to    do    so.

           The     man was          quite       happy          to    sit       on    the    wall    but    suddenly            the       match          was

           stopped           and    this      man        decided          that       he    now want e d       to    go    to    the       First          Aid

           Room.          This      resulted             in m y s e l f        and    another       Cadet      carrying          him a wa y              to

           th e    First        Aid      Room,       or     rather         walking          him    slowly      to    the       First          Aid Room

           At     no    t ime      did    I see          this       man    being          abused    by a n y       Police       Officer             or

           any     other        person and               I left       him       in the       First      Aid Room          so    that          he    could

           receive           treatment.

Dear Sirs,


PAUL BRIAN MURRAY DECEASED AND ANTHONY JOHN MURRAY OF
                          STOKE ON TRENT. STAFFORDSHIRE



We act on behalf of the above named Mr. Anthony John Murray in respect of
his claim for damages regarding personal injuries sustained in the Hillsborough
Disaster.    Mr. Murray attended at the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club on
 15.4.89 with his fourteen year old son Paul.       Unfortunately Paul died in
pen three of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.        We believe that you
are holding the original ticket stubs of both Mr. Anthony John Murray and
Mr. Paul Brian Murray and we would be grateful if you would be good enough
to supply us with copies of these as soon as possible.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,
KNIGHT & SONS

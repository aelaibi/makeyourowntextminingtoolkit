             I am                                                 I am a single man living at the above

             address with my parents.



             At approximately 11.30 am (1130 hrs) Saturday 15th April,                       1989

             (150489),               I travelled in a car, as a passenger along with\ [ t h r e ee other
                                                                                                 I

             people.                The driver was a work colleague of mine,                          ye

             were travelling to Sheffield to watch the semi final ¥   match between
                                                         c a t :
             Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.  I am a fan of Liverpool football

             club.             We travelled along the M62 motorway and we had a continual

             journey without stopping anywhere on route.



             Approximately 15 miles outside Sheffield, we were caught up in slow

             moving traffic.                      We arrived in Sheffield at about 1.45 pm (1345 hrs),
                                                                                                   PAGE         2
                                                                                                   S1636

              we parked the vehicle near to an Industrial Estate, about 1 mile from

              the estate.      We had a waLR of about 23 minutes to the ground,                   during

              this walk,     I saw a s m a / l   amount of fans,     drinking from cans along the

              route,    but not an axrassive amount.           The pubs appeared to be closed.



               ’
               e arrived at the entrance to the ground at approximately 2.15 pm

              (1415 hrs).      As we got to the entrances,           I was looking for

              turnstiles     '8', which was the turnstiles on my ticket for Leppings Ln

              standing.     There were no queues outside t h e s e ^ u r n s t i l e s ,     it was just

              a huge mass of people trying to get to the tmrnstiles.                       At the right

              hand side of the turnstiles,            I saw a m o u njn?d Police Officer,       h e was

              shouting directions to the mass of p^opjfe, but either people d i d n ’t

              hear him or d i d n ’t want to hear.         I diBn* t see any other Police

              officer or any stewards at all outside the ground.                    I eventually got

              to a turnstile, where I handed in my ticket and got into the ground.

              I noticed that at 'B’ t u r n s tiles/ only two turnstiles w « e                open.



              Once    I got inside the ground,
                                             I saw a sign above a /unnel directly in

              I went to Hillsborough,            to the football match             year,    I remember

              standing     in one of the side pens,        I d i d n ’t\kntjf   where I was going,        but

              I was with a group of friends who knew wher^/to go.                    On returning this

              year,     I couldn’t remember where to go, so just followed the one and

              only sign visible,



              I walked along the tunnel,            to the Zens, which I now know to be pens 3

^0.'£     tunnel.     At about 2*30 pm <1430 hrs) V j 2.40 pm <1440 hrs)                  I took up
Pe   n
          my match viewing position in Pen 4 . / When I got into the pen I stood
 H        near to the back of the Pen. T\ was quite full, at this time,                     but I

          d i d n ’t feel that it was abnormal: for a cup-fi.nal mat ck.             Not long

          after I took up this position,      I noticed the pen abetting fuller all

          the while.     It got so full,   I was being moved forward closer to the

Ctosjj)   front of the pen, until about 2.55 pm <1455 J^rs).               I felt a crowd

          s u r g e , which sent me further forward,    the /urge d i d n ’t move back I was

          pinned against a barrier in the pen, t l W p r e s s u r e was maintained not

          enabling me to move from the barrier.          I v,ajj            The top of the

          sarrier, my feet were on the ground,         but I was^across the barrier

          leaning forward with the upper part of my b a a y .          My chest was crushed

          on the barrier and my arms were pinned at^my sides,               the pressure got

          more and more intense.      I screamed for people to help, as were other

          people screaming.     I remember,   biting a marts arm who was in front of

          me,   he was also crushed in the crowd although he was not on the

          barrier.     I bit him hard to attract his attention,           he turned his head

          and I pleaded with him to help me,        but he was not able to.               A boy next

          to me was crying and screaming for help,          he asked me to help him.



          The pressure got so intense so much so that my feet left the ground,                        I

          remember looking at my feet and trying to put them back onto the

          ground, without success.      I could not stand the pressure any longer,

          the pain was so fierce and breathing became difficult,                 I   then

          remember,    feeling that I should give up,       I just couldn't          take the      pain

          and pressure any longer.      I obviously feel urynjnscious, the nent thing

          I knew I was on the football     pitch,    in a p r j / c a v e r y position.    I was

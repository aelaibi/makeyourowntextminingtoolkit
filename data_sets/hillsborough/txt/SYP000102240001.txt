At 9• 30am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I was on duty at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
for the FA Cup ^emi final tie between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC.
At 10am that morning I attended the main briefing after which I received a Serial briefing.
(Serial 12).
    Kyself with Police Constable        Lodjge were briefed to observe tumstyles 73-88 (North
    StandtFenistone Road). Due to these tumstyles being closed myself and PC Lodge assisted
    other Officers at Gate 0.

    During the afternoon several attempts were made by Liverpool fans to gain entry through
    this gate without tickets,especially as kick off time approached. The majority of these
        fans attempting to gain entry did smell of intoxicants.

         about 3pn to 3 .15pm I did become aware of some sofrt of incident when fans from both
    factions starting leaving the ’Kop’.
    The seriousness of the incident was confirmed to me when I saw injured and a ’body’
    brought to the rear of the North Stand, as well as a large amount of Police movement
    through the gate*

    I remained in situ at the gate with PC Lodge and assisted in the arrival and departure of
    the ambulance service*

    Later on in the afternoon/early evening I combined with other Officers to form a transit
    patrol (PC Greenway driving) in the Hillsborough area.

    The transit patrol then returned to the North Stand where, along with other Officers foraed
    a cordon outside the Police Rcon/gymnasium area.

    A t 7pm that evening I was released from duty and took no further part in the matter.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

I confirm my conversation with you today about your briefing Lord
Justice Taylor about your consultancy on the National Membership
Scheme under the Football Spectators Bill. We agreed that you
and Mr Colin Metcalf would come here at 9.30am on Wednesday 29
November. Present from our side will be Lord Justice Taylor, his
two Assessors (Mr Brian Johnson, Chief Constable of Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard Maunder, Professor of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne), me and
Jonathan Sweet. As I said, we will have an hour and a half, and
would very much like to use the opportunity for am informal
discussion, concentrating on the principles of the National
Membership Scheme, and the requirements which you are including
in your tender documents. We are less concerned with commercial
considerations, and more with the practicality and feasibility
of the proposed scheme. We have to hand the Arthur Young report
of December 1988 and the Arthur Young queue modelling report of
February 1989. It would be very helpful to have in advance the
tender document. As I mentioned to you, Neil Kinghan is happy
for us to have this, but you may want to confirm that with him.

Please let me know if you will need any facilities here,
otherwise we look forward to hearing from you in due course.

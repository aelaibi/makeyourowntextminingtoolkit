            On S at ur da y' 15th April              1989 I went to Sheffield to the Football

            Match at Hillsborough    erpoo 1 v Notts F.nrpstr
                                               M I
            I travelled up with my brotrer              and two friends.                         I had a

            ticket for the West Stand as did my brother                             We had paid twelve

            pounds for these tickets.

            We entered the ground without too much problem, although there were

            a lot of people outside the ground we managed to push through to the

            turnstile.

            We entered through the West sfr-artd turnstile handed in the tickets

            stubs to the Steward.

            We got            into the Courtyard area and found our seating area without to
                                                                                            V

         much problem.

         Just before kick-off      I saw a fella standing   in pen 4.    He was a white

         man.   He had dark short hair.      I c a n ’t describe anything else about

         him because its been two weeks now and I was quite a distance from him.

         It was about 2.55pm,      I saw this man go blue   in the face,   I thought he

         was just going to pass o u t , I saw other supporters trying to pass him

         out to the front.

         The next thing   I knew was that the crowd moved forward and I saw this

         man fall down hidden by the rest of the crowd.         I d o n ’t know if he got

         up again or if he died.

         I d i d n ’t see anyone else fall on the ground,    but I later saw people

         lying on the pitch with coats hi ddi ng the i r faces so I pressume they

         were dead.

                                                                     '          SI GfslED

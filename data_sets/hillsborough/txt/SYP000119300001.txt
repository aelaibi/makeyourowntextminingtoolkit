               I commenced duty at 9.45 am and was allocated duties on the perimeter

               track.   After meal I took up a position on the "Kop" end in front of

               number one gate (10.45am).      The gate at the junction of the "Kop" and

               the South stand.      At this time the serial Sgt. was PS Chapman and

          fa   Insp. Darling had overall control of the ground contingent.           The

               briefing before the game was carried out by Chief S u p t . Duckenfield

               and in the company he stated that "there would be no provision for

               the kick off to be delayed".

               During the build up to the game the Notts Forest fans at the "Kop end"

               appeared very well behaved and appeared to be inside the ground much

               earlier than the Liverpool supporters.

               During the build up to the game several Liverpool supporters on the

               "kop" came to the front fencing and asked to be taken to the Leppings

               Lane end, provisions had been made to accommodate the Liverpool

               contingent on the raised area of the kop adjacent to the North Stand.

               We were told that provisions had been made to accommodate up to 1,000

               Liverpool fans in this area and I was approached by up to 100 such

               fans who were directed accordingly.

               During the build up to the game I saw Ch.       Insp. Beal on numerous

             only saw Insp. Darling twice.        I did not see Ch. Supt. Duckenfield at

             all after the briefing.

             I f e e ^ ^ h a t 4 hours before the game 20 officp'Ps on -aes-iifteter track

             duty was excessive,    I feel that officers could have been better

             employed on a mobile patrol duty checking pubs etc in the local area.

             At 2.30 pm the Kop end was almost full,       I noticed that the Leppings

             Lane end was empty in comparison.

             At about 2.45 pm eight Liverpool supporters ca%e X °        the front of the

             Kop and asked to be transfered.        The Kop end wpa,^ ftJ.' out full and it

             was obvious to the Nottingham supporters that the fans were from

             L i ve r p o o l .

             The fans came to number 2 gate policed by 446 Groome.           At this time

 /n   .
             Insp. Darling was walking past and PC Groome asked what he was to do

             with theffl'f PC Groome had opened the gate and was going to escort

             them on the track to the raised section on the Kop.

             Insp. Darling instructed PC Groome to move the eight fans through the

             Nottingham fans to the raised area.        This incident taking the fans

             across the Nottingham fans just about the full length of the 'K?$>>•/

             I appreciated the danger of one PC doing this and I followed PC

             Groome into the crowd.        However when we reached the rear of tfye

             terracing by the turnstiles,       I was requested by a turnstile operator^

             to assist him, he was having trouble with Liverpool fans trying to

             climb over the turnstile and threatening violence.

             When I ^/d dealt with this I made my way back to the track,           and at

             this '^/me I heard messages over the radio as follows:         ’OPEN THE GATES

             repeated on numerous occasions and then "THE WALLS GOING,           OPEN THE

             GATES QUICK." and I also heard on the radio         ’DELAY THE KICK O F F , PUT

             IT BACK TO 3.15."

             There was a pause and a reply came over the radio          ’THERE ARE NO

I could see that the centre pen of the Leppings Lane end was full but

the outer wing sections were empty by comparison.

The p a y e r s   came onto the field and the game fcicked-^ofcf

After a few minutes play Liverpool almost scored at the Kop end, and

from my position on the track it appeared that chaos had broken out

at the Leppings Lane end.         Supporters were spilling on to the pitch

and I saw S u p t . Greenwood run towards the referee and the game was

stopped.

We were instructed at that time to remain in s^Ltu;nacing towards the

Nottingham fans.

At this time it was chaos on the radio with much of the conversation

being shouted and it appeared that no one realised what was

happening.

I still tfiought it was a pitch invasion and w h e n a Nottingham

supporter jumped onto the pitch he was escorted from the ground.

 I saw numerous Liverpool fans on the pitch taunting the Nottingham

fans and the Nottingham fans, also unaware of how serious the

 incident was were shouting and taunting the Liverpool fans.

Because of the supporters on the pitch someone,         I d o n ’t know who,

decided that officers form a line across the pitch along the halfway

 line to keep the supporters apart.        At this time I was still not

 aware of the severity of the incident,         I thought a fence had

 collapsed with a resulting pitch invasion and was still expecting the

 game t o^dontinue.      It w a s n ’t until the Ambulances came onto the pitch

 and tixjt supporters started tearing up advertising hoardings to use as

 stretchers that I realised that persons were injured.

 Chief Inspector Beal then instructed several officers,            including

 myself to go to the rear of Leppings Lane end to assist with crowd

 control and Ambulance reception.        When I arrived I saw numerous

Liverpool supporters milling around in Leppings Lane.  The area
 o f'
 '         ;
smelled like a brewery numerous supporters were obviously the worse

for drink,    some of them were very drunk and could hardly stand.       With

other officers I assisted in clearing the terraces and then after the
     'S V                        •                        i •■
match I returned to the North Stand for the de-briefing.  I finished

duty at 6 pm.

X have worked numerous big games at Hillsborough and have policed

Liverpool supporters several times including one previous occasion

this year.

The vast majority are decent and well behaved but as on previous

occasions there is an idiot minority that drink heavily and cause

problems.     On the previous occasion Liverpool attended in January I

arrested a very drunken supporter who had found his way into the

Sheffield e n d .

In concludllon I feel that this semi-final was not as well organised

as on previous occasions.       There appeared to be a lot of officers

doing nothing,      as we were on the track, and could have been better

employed.     I have found out that manpower was reduced by 10%, this

obviously had an effect.       And also several public houses near to the

ground were open and serving up to kick off time,      surely they should

have been advised to close or serve only to regulars.

On a previous occasion this season when Sheffield Wednesday played

Manchester United in a League game I was a g a i n working perimeter

track when in company with PC 2289 Green we informed control of a

build up, of Manchester United supporters on the Kop with Sheffield

supporters,     with PC Green I went out onto Penistone Road and there

were no officers working on turnstiles and Manchester suppportes were

building up outside the ground.       We informed control on several

occasions but nothing was done.       When Manchester scored the

inevitable happened the Manchester contingent started to celebrate

an^ia fight,took place when several people^were arrested.      It does

not appear that any lessons were learnt from this,    clearly manpower

shortage at the Kop end was responsible for this problem.

I also feel that more details could have been passed over the public

address system to late supporters and Police to keep supporters calm

and informed.

In conclusion it would appear that the Liverpool supporters for

whatever reason arrived much later than the Nottingham fans and they

appeared to all congregate in the centre section of the Leppings Lane

stand.

From what I saw after the game it was obvious that numerous Liverpool

supporters were the worse for drink,   from past experience I know that

at a NORMAL match those people would not have gained entry but would

have been either arrested or refused entry.

I know that speaking to other officers who were on turnstile duty

that they had to allow people into the ground who normally would not

have gained entry.   I was told of 4 officers covering 5 turnstiles             .

and that to take 2 officers away to arrest someone would have

severely depleted the strength.

My previous comments regarding the Manchester United match I believe            ,

are relevant to this game.   Obviously Liverpool supporters had                 i

bought tickets for the Nottingham end,   I genuinely feel that if the           !

           Lane end,    provisions had been made to accommodate the Liverpool

only saw Insp. Darling twice.                I did not see Ch. Supt. Duckenfield at

all after the briefing.

I feel that 4 hours before the game 20 officers on perimeter track

duty was excessive,             I feel that officers could have been better
employed on a m.obile patrol duty checking pubs etc in the local area.

At 2.30 pm the Hop end was almost full,                I noticed that the Leppings

Lane end was empty in comparison.

At about lf.45 ^pm eight Liverpool supporters came to the front of the

was obvious to the Nottingham supporters that the fans were from

Liverpool.

The fans came to number 2 gate policed by 446. Grooms.                       At |his time

Insp. Darling was walking past and PC Groome asked what he ^ a s to do .

with them.          PC Groome had opened the gate and was going to esedrt

them on the track to the raised section on the Kop«

Nottingham fans to the railsed a r e a ^           This incident taking the fans

across the Nottingham fansi jast?abbut'the full                  length of the Kdp.

I appreciated the danger of one PC doing this and I followed PC

Groome        into the crowd.      However when we reached the rear of the

terracing by the turnstiles,               I was requested by a turnstile operator

to,assist him,           he was having trouble with Liverpool          fans trying to

climb over the turnstile and threatening violence.

game to continue.         It w a s n ’t until the Ambulances came onto the pitch

and the supporters started tearing up advertising hoardings to use as

stretchers that 1 realised that persons were injured.

Chief   Inspector Beal then instructed several             officers,    including

myself to go to the. n a r       of Leppings Lane end to assist with crowd

control and AmbuXari|ft. reception.          When I arrived I saw numerous                 |

         The vast majority are decent and well behaved but as on previous

          problems.               On the previous occasion Liverpool attended in January I

         arrested a very drunken supporter who had found his way into the

               shartSage at the Kop end was responsible for this problem.

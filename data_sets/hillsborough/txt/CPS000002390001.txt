R -V- DPP EX PARTE DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Thank you for the draft Skeleton, which I have faxed to Chris Newell and Stephen Wooier for
their comments. I only have two points to make as follows;

(i)        3(1): there is no mechanism in the Magistrates’ Court for challenging the issue o f a
           Summons other than by summary trial/committal proceedings. Judicial review is not
           available because the prosecutor is not a public authority.

(ii)       Paragraph 4; should we make it clear that in developing the policy the Law
           Commission’s report was irrelevant (indeed I do not think it even existed at the time). It
           was not mentioned in the decision letter because the DPP necessarily agrees with
           everything in the Law Commission’s report, but simply to draw attention to the
           fundamental principle.

I hope this is helpful.

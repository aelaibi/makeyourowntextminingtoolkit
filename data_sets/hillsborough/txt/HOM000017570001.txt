       FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL - SECOND READING

       You will recall that a copy of the draft opening speech was sent
       to the Home Secretary on Friday.   I now enclose, as requested, a
       copy of the Minister of Sport's draft winding-up speech together
       with the draft speech to move the Instruction to Committee on
       safety.

       2.   Paragraphs 4 and 5 have been amended in manuscript. The
       suggested changes, which link the idea of any safety amendments
       to the Bill more closely to recommendations by the Taylor
       Inquiry/ have been agreed by DoE officials.

       3.    You mentioned to Mr Watts earlier today that the Home
       Secretary wished to know what the Department of Environment
       Ministers proposed to say if asked about progress on the
       introduction of all-seated accommodation at football grounds.
       4.   DoE advise that the line they intend should be taken is:-

            "There is a case for moving towards all seater stadiums at
            major football grounds.    The instruction to the Committee
            will make it possible to consider an amendment to this Bill
            to move in that direction.

            We are now talking to the football authorities about the
            best way to take this proposition forward.   We have made it
            clear to them that we would not be seeking to introduce a
            blanket requirement for all clubs to convert their grounds.
            Nor would we expect the major clubs to convert their grounds
            at a stroke.'^

       5.    Would you let me know if the Home Secretary is content with
       this.



                                                              D J MOULD

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL - SECOND READING


I attach a draft wind-up speech, prepared by Mr Lee, for Mr
Moynihan's consideration.   The draft is in the form of an
introduction and a conclusion, with a number of additional
paragraphs covering points that may be raised in the debate.
These include, inter alia, the points listed on the attached note
which the Minister requested following Third Reading in the
Lords. We expect Mr Howell's closing speech for the Opposition to
be very hostile; the opening paragraphs of the attached draft go
some way towards a reply in kind. We will, of course, provide
additional briefing as necessary from the box, which will include
Home Office officials from the police and safety divisions.

I understand that the Speaker is content for the Instruction to
the Bill Committee on safety to be debated with Second Reading.
It will, however, have to be moved formally, after the vote on
Second Reading. The procedure will be for the Minister (or the
Secretary of State) to move the Instruction formally. If MPs wish
to speak, a debate will follow (not time-limited) and the
Minister will respond to the debate. A draft speech for him to
use in doing so is attached.

The Money Resolution will be taken after the Instruction. A copy
of the Resolution is attached. The Minister will move it formally
and then reply to any points raised in debate (45 minutes
maximum). Financial issues are covered in the draft paragraphs
for the wind-up speech.

The Minister may wish to discuss at Monday's Round-Up meeting.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL:              SECOND READING




Draft closing speech for Mr Moynihan



1.       Before       commenting     on     the   points       that      have   been     raised

during   this     debate      I would       like to      say how much           I share      the

sympathy which hon members have expressed for those affected by

the Hillsborough disaster.              My visit to the stadium following the

tragedy will remain with me as an occasion of great sadness.                                 The

Government      has    not    rushed    the passage            of    this   Bill   following

Hillsborough.          We have paused for a decent period to mark our

respect for those who died and were Injured.



The Opposition's contribution



2.       We   have     heard    a   predictable         speech       from   the    right *hon

Member   for Birmingham,            Small      Heath,    long       on   criticism     of    our

plans to tackle football hooliganism and precious short of Ideas

and   constructive       proposals        of    his     own.        There   has    been     some

progress,     at      least     some      members        opposite        appear     to      have

recognised that there Is a problem, but they are still at a loss

when It comes to what should be done about It.



3.       It was much the same when they were In Office all those

years ago.       In 1974 the right hon gentleman said from this side

of the House that Incidents of violence at football matches "must

be eradicated In the Interest of public safety".                                He set up a

working party on football crowd behaviour.                          Whatever was achieved
as a result one thing is certain;                     the hon Member's Government

failed   to     take    the    necessary      measures     to   eradicate     football

hooliganism.



4.       It is interesting to note the right hon Member's remarks

in 1977 when he announced all ticket arrangements for Manchester

United's away matches



         "I know that most of its supporters will understand

         how important it is in the long term interest of

         their own club and for its supporters personally,

         that we eliminate disorders and make the support of

         our national sport the pleasure that it ought to

         be.       Football      clubs        might     also    suffer     some

         financial disadvantage but again my working party

         believes that this is a price that must be paid in

         order to overcome the problem.                  On the other hand

         we believe that,        if the sporting public feel that

         they   can     once   more   attend     these     matches     without

         fear for their own safety,              this might well bring

         back to       football many people who are undoubtedly

         staying away at the moment".



Total attendance at Football League and FA Cup matches in 1977/78

was 30 million.         Ten years later 1987/88 saw total attendance of

21.5 million.         It is only in the last three seasons that we have

seen   signs     of    containment       of    hooliganism       and     increases   in

attendances.
5.           In advocating the merits of the Bill today I am happy to

echo what the right hon gentleman said twelve years ago.                                            The

Bill        will     ensure         that people         can     attend    football       matches     in

safety        and    enjoy the match              in a pleasant              rather    than hostile

atmosphere.               And it offers a real opportunity to attract lost

support back to the game.



What if Taylor says the membership card will lead to delay and

crushes outside the ground?



6   .No    point     is       served      by    trying    to     anticipate       what    Lord

Justice Taylor might recommend and it would be improper to do so.

We must await his report.                        The Government has made it clear all

alongthat           the       scheme       will    not     be    implemented          until   we    are

satisfied           about      the     technology        and    that     the    scheme will        work

effectively and efficiently.



Has not the Minister already pre-empted Taylor by saying that it

is        inconceivable         that      his    inquiry       will    oppose     the    membership

scheme?



7.           No.          I    cannot, nor        would        I wish     to,    anticipate        Lord

Justice Taylor's report.                        I stand by what I said,                  I would be

very        surprised          if    he    were    to     oppose       the     scheme    given     our

commitment to not introducing it until we are satisfied it will

work well.
through!!!!* turnstiles.               "Any delay caused by membership card may

increase queueing time substantially and many people may not be

admitted until well after the scheduled kick-off time.                            The extra

time required to admit everyone would increase between 16 and 48

minutes."



8   .      Hon Members have had the opportunity of seeing that the

technology exists to ensure that the scheme will not result in

delays.      Some systems do not require the card to be handed to the

attendant or even leave the hand of the owner to be validated.

No one needs to be turned around in a queue and thus create a

jam.      If there is any problem about a card it will be looked into

once the person is inside the ground.                         I repeat,   the Government

has no intention of introducing the scheme until we are satisfied

that the technology will work.



The Ministers answer to a PQ from David Alton on 24 April:                               "The

timetable for the Football Spectators Bill will allow the House

in       considering       the        Bill     to      take     account    of     relevant

recommendations        from       Lord       Justice    Taylor's       Inquiry    Into    the

Hillsborough disaster."



9.         My Rt Hon Friend the Secretary of State has made it clear

that the Bill was amended on Third Reading in another place not

to      anticipate   but         to   take     account    of    Lord    Justice   Taylor's

Inquiry.       The Bill provides the framework for the scheme;                            the

scheme itself comes           later.          We have     so amended the Bill            that

Parliament will now have two opportunities to debate the scheme
before it is introduced and in the light of Lord Justice Taylor's

report



But Parliament will not be able to amend the scheme



10.      The      right    hon     gentleman         is    never    satisfied.         We have

amended the Bill to provide not one but two opportunities for the

House to        debate     the     scheme       after       Lord    Justice      Taylor      has

reported.         The     scheme       will     be        drawn    up   by     the    football

authorities.        We will        approve      it but we want            it    to be      their

scheme and as football friendly as it can be.                           Surely it is right

for the football authorities to prepare a scheme that best suits

football's interests, within the framework set out in the Bill.



What will the role of the police be in drawing up the scheme?



11.      The     police     have     a   vital       contribution        to    make    to    the

detailed       scheme.      It   has     been    the       Government's       intention      all

along    that     the     football       authorities         should      consult      ACPO    in

drawing up the scheme.             We are taking steps to ensure that this

consultation takes place.                ACPO will of course be free to give

their views       to the Secretary of State on                     any scheme which is

submitted for his approval.



Trevor     Philips,       League's       commercial          director     quoted      in     the

Guardian 13 June:          "talk of free installation is nonsense, there

is going to be a significant cost to football - up to £40M."



12.      Until the detailed scheme is drawn up and a choice is                              made

about the sort of technology to be used any figures quoted as the
cost of the scheme can only be pure speculation.                     I understand

that   a amber    of    companies      would   be   prepared    to   Install   the

technology   free      of     charge   to   football    in     return    for   the

membership fee.        The enormous benefit the scheme will bring to

football is that for the first time football will have a national

list of its customers.            This will enable football to understand

its customers and to market itself properly.                 This in turn will

lead to greater financial viability.



How do you square what the PM said in her letter of 21 June to

Martin Edwards, that the intention is that the scheme will be up

and working at the beginning of the 1990/91 season, with what the

Secretary of State said about timing?



13.     It is entirely desirable, as the PM said, for the scheme to

be in place at the beginning of the 1990/91 season.                     My Rt Hon

Friend and I have made very clear today the scheme will not be

introduced until we are satisfied about the technology and chat

the scheme will work effectively and safely.             This might mean the

scheme might not be ready to run until the              early months of        the

1990/91 season.



Will the information supplied to the FMA by members of the scheme

be safeguarded under the Data Protection Act            1984?



14.    We have made it clear all along that we are committed to

the principle that          the   information supplied by applicants           and

members of the scheme should be fully protected under the Data

Protection Act.     We have taken advice from the Data Protection
Registrar on how best to achieve this and amended the Bill in the

other plAce to make absolutely clear that the rights of members

of the scheme are fully protected.



The amendments to the Bill on how people can make representations

against the FMA1s discretionary membership bans                       infringe civil

rights.



15.      The    amendments        we   have    made    are    the     result   of    our

consultation with the Council on Tribunals.                   There is no question

of removing people's rights.               Representations would normally be

made in writing though we do not rule out the possibility of the

occasional oral hearing in an appropriate case.                        The procedure

will be simple, speedy and fair.



You have rejected a registration scheme for dogs but press on

with one for football supporters.



16.      Football      supporters,      unlike    dogs,       are   responsible      for

their    own    actions    and    should      behave   better       than   potentially

dangerous      animals.     Dog registration would do nothing to deal

with irresponsible dog owners - my Rt Hon Friends the Secretary

of    State    and   the   Home   Secretary     have   announced       a   package   of

extended powers to deal with dangerous dogs.



Financial Implications of the Bill: the money resolution.



17.      The House will be aware that later this evening I shall be

moving a Money Resolution for this Bill.                     it might therefore be

helpful if I say now a few words about the public expenditure
implications of our proposals.                  First,    I should make quite clear

that it.|» for football to finance the scheme and to benefit from

the considerable commercial opportunities it presents.                           The cost

of    the     Football       Membership      Authority,         the     installation      of

equipment at grounds and the issue of any membership cards will

be met by the football authorities and not by the public purse.



18.      But we do expect the measures we are introducing to give

rise to public expenditure of about £2.5 million per year.                                In

the   main     this       will    be   necessary   to     cover    the    police,     Crown

Prosecution Service, court and legal aid costs that will arise as

a consequence of the new criminal offences we wish to introduce.

This estimate does not anticipate any income there might be from

fines imposed by the courts but we have taken into account the

likely      cost     of    operating      the    designated       reporting      agencies

created under Part II of the Bill.



19.      Hon members will also appreciate that there may be some

implications        for     public     expenditure       from   the     requirement    that

designated football grounds should be licensed.                         Clause 11 of the

Bill provides that the functions of the licensing authority shall

be carried         out    either by my      right hon       friend or by a person

appointed by him.                Any expenses incurred in administering and

enforcing the licensing function can be reimbursed through the

fees charged for the issue of the licences.



Closing remarks: the need for the Bill



20.         Football      hooliganism has not        gone       away.      It   remains   a

major problem both at home and overseas.                    The Bill was introduced
because of the need to take further powerful measures to tackle

       prgjp W i on both these fronts.                     That need remains.            We need

look    no     further    than       the    serious     incidents        of    violence which

marred the end of last season,                   after the Hillsborough disaster,

to see that hooliganism continues to bedevil football and there

is an overwhelming case for further action to deal with it.                                          I

dont want to be forever talking about the police keeping the lid

on    the    problem     and    at    what     cost.        We    must    add    the    powerful

measures contained in the Bill to the package of anti-hooliganism

measures already in place if we are to tackle the roots of the

problem.        If we are to defeat the menace of hooliganism we need

the    national        membership       scheme       and    restrictions         on    hooligans

travelling abroad - and we need them now.



21.      We     have    heard        much    about     how       wrong    it    would        be   to

anticipate Lord Justice Taylor.                      I entirely agree.               It would be

wrong for me to speculate on the timing or the content of his

reports.        His is an independent Inquiry and his reports are a

matter for him.            If he should comment on the question of the

national       membership       scheme,       then     it    is   right       that    Parliament

should decide whether to proceed with the scheme, in the light of

his comments.          The amendments we have made to the Bill in another

place will provide Parliament with the opportunity to make that

decision at the appropriate time - after we have seen his final

report.



22.      But    there     is    no    case    for    delaying       until      we     have    Lord

Justice Taylor's report.                   I emphasise again that Part I provides

a    framework     for    the    national        membership         scheme;      it    does       not

introduce the scheme.                If we have that framework on the statute
book and Parliament decides to proceed with the scheme when It

has seen what Lord Justice Taylor has to say,                we can have the

scheme fJMpfrace during the season that begins In August 1990.                If

we were^pit delay we would throw away the progress we have made

this session.       We might have a new Act of Parliament by August

1990 but It would be unlikely that the national membership scheme

could be In place for at least another year after that.



23.       The Bill would mean that at home,         for the first time, we

would have a really effective means of keeping the hooligan out

of football matches.         It would also provide the means to restore

our tarnished Image abroad.            Part II of the Bill would empower

the courts to prevent convicted hooligans from travelling to                 key

matches    abroad    and     the    membership   scheme   would    enable    the

football authorities,        the clubs and possibly tour operators to

restrict ticket sales to matches abroad to members of the scheme.



24.       Decent football supporters - the vast majority of those

who go to football matches - are as frustrated as anyone by the

continuing blight      of    hooliganism and violence       that   Is   ruining

their game.     At the heart of the Government's determination to

tackle the hooligan problem Is our wish to see genuine supporters

able to 9 0 to the game In safety and return home In the same way.

We want to see the day when local shopkeepers and people living

In the vicinity of          the    football ground no     longer dread match

days.     The national membership scheme can bring this about.                It

could bring back many many supporters who have been lost to the

game and It could also attract a greater family audience.                   This

Bill can break the link between football and violence and return

our national game to its true supporters;            it is imperative that

we see it on the statute book this session.
POSSIBLE POINTS OF OPPOSITION ATTACK AT SECOND READING


Ministerial Quotes

A number of Ministerial comments may be quoted back at Ministers

Radio Interviews

1) The Secretary of State was interviewedon Radio        4' s   'P M '
   Programme on 20 April. The interviewer said:-

      "It is conceivable that Lord Justice Taylor will come
      out at the end of his investigations and say that
      there should not be identity cards for fans, that it
      would have caused more problems and the effect of it
      could probably be to lead to a greater crush outside
      a football ground.  That is the argument".

To which the Secretary of State replied:-

      "Yes, it could indeed”.

The interviewer then said:-

      "But if Lord Justice Taylor came out against this
      measure would you still go ahead with it if that was
      the case?"

The Secretary of State said:-

      "That's a hypothetical question.      Let's see what
      happens.  I think it is for the Government to decide
      what it proposes to Parliament, not for the people
      who conduct inquiries into disasters to have the last
      say".

The Secretary of State also said in reference to Lord Justice
Taylor's inquiry:-

      "We may not accept his advice,    but at   least let's
      hear it”.

2) Mr Moynihan was interviewed on Radio 4's "The World Tonight"
   on 20 April 1989 and was asked what would happen if the Taylor
   inquiry opposed cards for fans. The Minister said:-

      "I think it is inconceivable that he will say that...
      We will not implement a national membership scheme
      until we are totally satisfied the technology exists
      so there will not be a build up of crowds outside the
      ground.  That technology does exist.    There will be
      no delays."

Parliamentary Question

Mr Moynihan replied to a PQ from David Alton MP on 24 April.      The
reply stated that:-

      "The timetable for the Football Spectators Bill will
      allow the House in considering the Bill to take
      account of relevant recommendations from Lord Justice
      Taylor's Inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster."
Points of Detail


During V p r Report and Third -Reading debates on the Football
Spectator® Bill Noble Lords expressed the following views which
may be the substance of criticisms at Second Reading.


At Third Reading


   Lord Graham on Parliament's opportunity to twice debate the
   scheme, post Taylor:-

     "...what the Minister has offered the House is that
     when the FMA has produced a scheme, and when the
     scheme has taken into account the Government's views-
     they having studied the report of Lord Justice Taylor
     whose views they may or may not accept-the House will
     then be invited on one Motion, without an opportunity
     for amendment, in two debates of a general character,
     to approve an action by the Government.  That is what
     we are being invited to do in substitution for proper
     scrutiny by parliament."

  Lord Harris on the involvement of the Police with the scheme:-

     "Will the police have the right-a statutory right-to
     be consulted before this scheme is implemented?...the
     answer to that question at the moment is no they are
     not.   However, is it not important in the light of
     the    report  from   Lord Justice   Taylor, ...that
     Parliament should have the opportunity to satisfy
     itself on the important matter that the police should
     have a statutory right to be properly consulted?
     That is only one of the many issues which will be
     left unresolved when the Bill leaves this House.”

  Lord Harris on the right of a person banned from the scheme at
  the FMA's discretion to make written representations to an
  independent body:-

     "Many would...find themselves unable to put their
     representations in writing.    Those representations
     would be passed to a body of men before whom, as I
     understand it, the accused would not be guaranteed
     any    right of audience.    I have rarely heard an
     argument which strips people of their civil rights on
     the grounds of administrative convenience...”

  Lord Wallace on the cost implications of the scheme for small
  clubs:-

     "It has been said by the Minister that the cost to
     small clubs...will be eased because the installation
     costs will be met by the proprietors of the equipment
     who would sell the addresses of the people on the
     register.  I can assure the House that the Football
     Association has been told that not a single firm is
     prepared to install its machinery free of charge."
   Lor      aham on the consultants Arthur Young's views   on the
   pas      u f supporters through the turnstiles:-

      "Arthur Young made a series of assessments, but Its
      main conclusion was that:      'Any delay caused by
      membership   card   may    Increase   queueing  time
      substantially and many people may not be admitted
      until well after the scheduled kick-off time.    The
      extra time required to admit everyone would Increase
      between 16 and 48 minutes.'"

   Lord Knights on the police view of the scheme and emergency
   situations:-

      "It Is the fear of many people, as expressed today,
      that the result of the scheme will be to create on
      more occasions the very scenes we saw at Hillsborough
      with large numbers of spectators seeking admittance
      at the very last moment.   It Is for that reason that
      the  police are seeking      to ensure   that proper
      arrangements exist to abandon the scheme on a
      particular occasion If danger Is perceived.”


At Report


  Lord Graham on seeking to guarantee football supporters' bodies
  membership of the FMA:-

     "I believe that the supporters clubs deserve to know
     that there are some Members of this House who are
     prepared to create a place for them at the top table,
     and that there are other Members, Including the
     Government, who believe that that Issue should be
     left to charity and chance.    In my view It Is not
     good enough..."
FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL



INSTRUCTION TO COMMITTEE - DRAFT SPEECH FOR MR MOYNIHAN



"To move,       That    it    be   an    Instruction        to    the    Committee      on    the
Football    Spectators Bill             [Lords]    that     they have power            to make
provision in the Bill relating to any aspect of the safety of
spectators at designated football matches."



1. Mr Speaker, I beg to move the Instruction in the name of my Rt
Hon Friend, the Secretary of State for the Environment. I should
like to deal with a number of points that have been raised in
this debate.


2. In his speech moving Second Reading of the Bill, earlier today
my   Rt   Hon   Friend        recognised       that    it   was    the       Hon   Member     for
Holborn     and    St    Pancras         who     had    raised      the       idea    of     this
Instruction       to    the    Committee         during     Business         Questions       last
Thursday.       The     Government         have        responded        by     tabling       the
Instruction       and   it     has      become    increasingly          clear        throughout
today's debates that the idea was a good one because safety is an
important consideration in relation to this Bill.


3. I do not accept the argument that dealing with safety matters
in this Bill is a poor substitute for withdrawing the Bill and
starting again next year, when Lord Justice Taylor has reported.
I am delighted that the House agrees with me and that                                   it has
given a Second Reading to the Bill. It would be inappropriate for
me to rehearse the arguments                   in favour of proceeding with the
Bill now. Those arguments have won the day and the Bill has been
committed to a Standing Committee.
   4. Since we have a Bill this session, it is clearly desirable
   that we should take such steps as we can to enable us to prepare
   for the outcome of        Lord    Justice Taylor's        Inquiry. This
   Instruction will allow the - Standing Committee to consider
  amendments for that purpose. My Rt Hon Friend outlined the
   framework for one amendment that the Government has it in mind to
  ,          _  ,       J\ U r     v       Xu          ■u -O to
  bring forward. £jTt          «ot take -us-irrfco-fiow torritory beyond
  that— of— the— existing— Safety— of— Sports Grounds legislation; it
      , T "7      ,            VU,                  C ^v^J
  would be complementary to wwfe^legislation.        '


  5.    Local authorities   are  responsible  for   issuing  safety
  certificates under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. The
  Home Secretary has powers to issue directions about the terms and
  conditions of safety certificates but he has no enforcement role
  under the Act. We ifvfeend— to propose an amendment to give the
  licensing authority to be established by the Football Spectators
      Ti Wjl                                        'w\
  Bill^powers for two purposes: the first to enforce^any directions
  which the Home Secretary may make, if for example Lord Justice
  Taylor should recommend that a particular matter should be a
                                                                ffe. 4,-bJ
  mandatory component of a safety certificate.-— The— purpose^— I-
  -emphasise*— is— not jto anticipate Lord Justice Taylor, but to
i prepare for action on his report.r ^ h e — eoaond—      —of t h e
/ licensing authority would be to monitor local authorities' role
L in issuing safety certificates. ~0       •ftdr ^          w TV»'*^
  W \*
  6. I thought it right that the House should have some idea of the
  amendment which the Government was thinking of bringing forward
  if this Instruction is approved. But the proper time to debate
   S      < X #\J
  trie ^ amendment will be   in Committee when it is drafted. [If
  pressed I do not think    that it is helpfulto begin speculating
  about the nature of the   licensing authoritynow. If it is to have
  responsibility for safety matters, it must,        I think, be a
  different body from the Football Membership Authority, though
  they will clearly need to work closely together. We will put a
  proposal to the Committee to consider.]
Precedent for the Instruction

6A. I understand that Erskine May quotes a number of examples of
Instructions from the House to a Bill Committee to enable the
Committee to consider the possibility of extending the provisions
of a Bill to objects not strictly covered by the subject matter
of the Bill but which are cognate to its general purposes. The
recent precedents quoted in Erskine May all arose in Bills
proposed by Labour Governments, the most recent being the
European Assembly Elections Bill 1977-78. In raising the idea for
today's Instruction, the Hon Member for Holborn and St Pancras
was following a good Labour tradition. [If pressed I understand
that none of the recent precedents quoted in Erskine May involved
an Instruction taken at the same time as Second Reading but that
there is no reason why the Instruction should not be moved on the
same day. Given the importance which the House attaches to safety
matters, it seems sensible to take the Instruction as soon as
possible.]


7. Mr Speaker, this Instruction will enable the Committee to
consider safety matters. It is a response to a proposal from the
Opposition [and, it is clear, to the wishes of this House]. I beg
to move.

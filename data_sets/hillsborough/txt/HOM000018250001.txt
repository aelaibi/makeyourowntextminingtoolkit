Five years ago, in conjunction with NEO Electronics in Lancashire, we developed an electronic scanner
which accurately records each person that passes through turnstiles.
The unit was first installed and tested at Doncaster Rovers Football ground and we are enclosing a copy of
the letter from the Club.
This unit can be installed to existing turnstiles, with no modifications necessary to the turnstiles, so avoiding
excessive costs to the Clubs.
The units can be portable if required and individual units may be linked to a master unit in a Control Room
giving constant monitoring. This would enable the persons in charge to have a constant up-date and control
of the various situations that might be developing.
In view of recent occurrences connected with spectators, we feel that these units would prove of benefit to
the Clubs.
We would greatly appreciate your comments.

          Dear Sir,
          I refer to recent installation of the turnstile scanner recently carried out
          by yourselves.
          To date it has more than proved and substantiated the usual method of turnstile
          reading currently operated and has indeed reaffirmed accuracy in recorded
          turnstile admissions.
          The savings shown by the accurate recording would more than cover the capital cost
          involved within a period of three months per unit installed. We would have no
          hesitation in recommending this type of installation to our colleagues in the
          Canon League.
          Yours faithfully,

    Your letter of 3 Mav to Colin Movnihan, with one from Mr T McGregor of
^ M c G r e g o r Associates Dunfermline, has been passed to the Home Office.        I am
    replying in view of mv responsibility for the Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975.


    I am grateful to you and to Mr McGregor for his ideas about pitch perimeter
    fencing and for his offer of assistance in their development.      We shall bear
    this in mind.


   The Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor is now looking into the causes of the
    tragedy at Hillsborough and considering ways of preventing such an accident
 .. happening again.   I am, therefore, arranging for a copy of our correspondence
  ; to be passed to the Inquiry so that it is aware of Mr McGregor’s suggestion
  4 and his observation on the crush barrier arrangements.

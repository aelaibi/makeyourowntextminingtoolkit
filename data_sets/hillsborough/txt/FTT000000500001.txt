Mr Lee explained how the Council's future rested on securing
access to new funding from 1 May. He reminded the meeting
that at separate meetings with representatives of the Council
the Trust had explained that it could not contribute towards
running costs but would be prepared to consider providing
support for the publications programme. Mr Wharton, who had
attended these meetings, referred to        the value of the
Council's publications.     It was agreed that the Trust could
not become a major funder of         the Council but that a
contribution of £10,000 should be made towards the cost of the
Council's next publication.
It was open to the Council to approach the Trust for further
support in respect of future publications but the meeting felt
it unlikely that it would be possible to provide financial
assistance of the order of £150,000 - £200,000 which the
Council was seeking.

Executive and National Coach presented a progress report on
the Football in the Community      Scheme.   Nine full time
community officers were in post and it was intended to
increase this figure to twenty by 1994. To achieve this it
was hoped that the Trust would consider further grant aid as
follows:
                1992               £300,000
                1993               £350,000
                1994               £450,000
                                £ 1 , 100,000
The SFA Council intended to contribute £1,192,000 towards the
cost of appointing the 20 new officers, bringing the total
joint funding from the SFA and Trust for the complete scheme
to £2,392,000. Once the scheme was in place, self-sufficiency
or new partner arrangements would be pursued.
Scottish Sports Council
19.   In the absence of Mr Alstead and Mr McDonald, prevented

POLICE AUTHORITY (ORDINARY MEETING)

18 JUNE 1999

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO POLICE OFFICERS IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS


(My handwritten notes of the item)

WJW -        This updates (the position) since the special meeting in February.

             (Went through the detail of how this has built up)

             Since (last) report:

             Garett's acting on overall budget - working within that:

             •             Specifying legal teams
             •             Discussing hourly rate (blended rate)
             •             Doesn't stop us controlling hours
             •             Number of legal advisers to attend hearings
             •             Up to committal only (Counsel)

             HFSG have introduced a lot of new evidence

             NOTES

             Proposing to retain Garrett's for a while longer. Will then review.

             South Sefton : Have agreed costs from Central Funds. The
             principle will apply to other stages.

200    people           through             the     turnstile.                    Between          2.15pni a n u           2.35pm        it    was

the    turnstiles.                      I    could       not       see       the       crowd        outside          the    ground           from

where       I was         standing.                    I noticed             that       the        fans       were    becoming           irritabl

and     aggressive                 to       get    into       the       ground.               I    could       hear     fans       shouting

"what       the         hell       is       going       on    get       a    move       on".            They     were        not       singing           th

The     people           in    the          gangway           leading         to       the        windmill       were        being       pushed           u

against            it    from       the       people           outside.                At     one       stage       during       this        period

three        fans        entered             my    turnstile                with        tickets          for    the     West       Stand.

These        were        blue        in      colour.               I told          them       they       could       not     enter       and        they

said     there's              no    way       we        can    get      back           through          the     crowd       outside.            This

was     at     about          2.45pm.               I took          the       tickets             and    knocked        on       th*     window          to

 ticket        as        far       as       I know.           I was          not       offered          any     money       by     any       fans     to

 gain        access           to    the       ground,          and          I did       not        take    any       money.         As       the    time,

 was     gettng           closer             to    kick       off       time       it        became       obvious          that     the       fans

 were        being        more          crushed           from       other         fans           outside       the     turnstile.                 When

  got    to        my    turnstile                at    the     time         I opened              up   there        was    two        police

  officers              outside             the     ground         who       were        frisking             supporters           and       directir

  them       to     where           they         should        go.          Inside           the    ground          I saw     three          police

  officers              who    were          standing              near       to       our    turnstiles.               During          the     busy




                                                                    3

                                                                                                                                   B '1302


            period    the        two'police              officers          appeared         to    disappear,        whether       they

            were    pushed        away         by   the       volume       of    supporters          or    wnat    I d o n ’t    know.

            After    all        the   supporters               suddenly          stop       coming    through       the    turnstile         «

            police        officer,         a    constable,               told    us    to    lock    up,    which       I did.     I ther

            collected           all   my       tickets         up    and       took    them      around     to    the   South     Stand

            after     I had       taken         the      reading          off    the    counter.

            During        the    time      I was         on    this       turnstile          I had    no    violence       or    threats

            of    violence        directed            towards            me.     The    only      thing     was    I had    a    lot   of

            verbal        abuse       thrown        at    me.        I went       to    the      South     Stand    by w a l k i n g

            all     the    way    round         the      back       of    the    North       Stand    to    the    Spion    Kop    and

            into     the    South       Stand         via      the       players       tunnel

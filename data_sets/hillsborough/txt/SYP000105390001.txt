 Richard Albert Hit toe.
Police Constable 2323
Dinnington Police Station




At 8.0am Saturday 15 April 1989 I paraded for duty at Dinnington Police Station, shortly
after which I was transported to Hillsborough football ground along with other officers
 in Police transport.


Upon arrival at the ground we were briefed and I was attached to serial 57•


After briefing and meal I worked a foot patrol duty from the Five Arches public house,
 Halifax Road to its junction with Moonshine Lane together with Pc 3237 Hislop. We
 remained on this duty until 2 .50pm when we started to return to the ground.


Upon entering the ground from Penistone Road we were immediatly dispatched onto the
 perimeter of the field opposite the Leppings Lane end of the ground. Initially I could
 not ascertain what was happening but when I realised I assisted with an unknown male
 officer to rip the perimeter advertising boards down and went to assist the injured at the
 Leppings Lane end of the ground. The perimeter boards were being used as stretchers.


 Whilst at this location I was ordered by a senior officer to move back into a line across
 the centre of the field and to remain there.This I did.


 Vihilst at this location I could see plenty of officers still at the Leppings Lane end of
 the ground.


 I remained there until after the ground was emptied and then took up duties in a
 personal carrier patrolling outside the ground until about 6.0pm. I then attended at
 Claywheels Lane Traffic office where I was transported back to Dinnington Police Station*

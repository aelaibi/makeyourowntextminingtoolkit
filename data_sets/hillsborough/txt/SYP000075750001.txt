               I indep e n d e n t l y        booked a place          on a Parties Travel             coach from

               L iver pool          to Sheffield.

               On the         coach     I met a man          named    ’J o h n ’ who     is from Old Roan,           near

               Aintree,         L i v erpool    who was travelling               to the M a t c h with his           son    I

   lOj&eaJL    d o n ’t know the son's              full      name    but   I had met       the father       on the        coach

               j ou r n e y    to H i l l s b o r o u g h the     previous year.

               On S a t u r d a y      15th April      1989       (1540489),        we   left Liverpool       at about           10.
                                                                                                               P AGE        Z

3 0a m   ( 1Q 3 Q ).     We did not stop en-route                     to S h e f f i e l d for any       reason

wh i l s t   travelling        on the motorway,               about       half way between Liverpool

and S h e f f i el d the       coach was d e l a y e d , and we were                   travelling at a slow

speed for about             twenty minu t e s           I do not know the                reason      for    the

delay.       The       coach a rr i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d at about           1 . 4 5 pm ( 1 3 4 5 ) . The

driver       parked      in a line of other Liverpool                        supporters        coaches      in a

side     road about         ten minu t e s walk from H i l l sborough.                      I did not see any

p o licemen on the mai n                 ro sljK leading to the ground.                   I saw that        the      pubs

on our       route      to the gr/(und were             closed and            I d i d n ’t see any supporters

d r i nking alcohol.                /

As we wa l k e d to the ground                   I saw fans          singing and the a t m o s p h e r e was

exciting       but      I did not see any fighting                        or drunkeness.

managed       to walk       through between s u pporters                      to the turnstile without

too muc h      trouble.         Walking          to the ground             I recall      seeing a couple             of

p o l icemen on the street                 corner,      but    I cannot          recall     seeing any

po l i c e m e n or stewards             outside    the Lepfxings Ln turnstiles.

knew where         to go from my             previou      /isit.            On that occasion,            the    1988

FA Cup semi-final              betw e e n L i v e r / o o 1 and           N o t t i n g h a m Forest.      I arrived

I did not have any t r o u b l e / a c t u a l l y             entering          the ground and          I entered

I did not see any other                    gates    other      than the          turnstiles        open. I      handed

my m a t c h ticket         in at the turnstile                and retained the stub

section.         Inside       the       ground   I d i d n ’t look for            or notice any signs

d i recting me          where        to go,   and                went straight towards           the central

tunnel         under    the West Stj3rffd,

Upo n entering           the    ca'lvtral tunnel          I did    not see any       policemen o r

full    with>people            but    I was able      to move       quite     freely.      The   tunnel

itself was dark and the only                     light was from the              pitch end of the

t u n n e 1.

Once     inside        the ground       I didn't      see any trouble            involving       supporters

and    I d i d n ’t see any with alcohol.

I went         through the tunnel             and onto the terrace             behind the goal with

"John*         and his    son.        Upon emerging         from the tunnel          we went      to the

right     of the        central        fence which          was from         the perimeter fence      up to

the m outh of           the tunnel           into Pen       3.

We made         our way     forw a r d down the terracing,                        I went right       to the

perimeter         fence     at       the front of the        pert.-'At this          time it was      crowded

in that         particular       pen but       not uncorn_|€rtable.            At the front,         I found

there were a l re ad y alot              of fans ^ f V e a d y      in position so           I m o v e d back

F rom about 2 .4 0          (1440)      onwards,      J noticed that more and more

s upp o r t e r s were     coming       down th£ terrace            from behind.         Some were

managing         to duck       under    the    barrier      behind me,        and get     into    the area

    It became more and more                 crowded until,          the    cf'Ushing settled for          two

    three minutes.            W hen the         players   came^xfut onto the           pitch there was          a

    big surge forward from the back.

    I d i d n ’t actually see the jj^arfne kick               off,    because at a b o u t 2.5 5 p m

    myself     to the fact          I was       being s u ffocated but the man beside me kept

    telling me       to breathe        I was       just    being held        in the    crowd.

    Just    prior    to the kick           off about 2 . 4 5 ~ 2 . S 0 p m    (1445)    — (1450).    I ’m not

    on along      the track.         I didr/t       see any other          policeman or any stewards

    on the     track.        As    I was    being    crushed     I remember thinking             "well,    this

    is i t ’ and     I thought        I was about          to die.        At one stage     I could see

    the    perimeter        gate    open and       people were/ b e i n g      pulled o u t .     I think

    I sat on the terrace and saw/ o t h e r                  people were        being    pulled over       the

    to open space.            I went       dawn a couple        of steps       to an open gate onto

         properly and          I saw a man sat            crying       near to me.

         After 2-3 minutes             Joh n and his son came to me and                         put a coat a r o u n d my

         shoulders.           Almost    immedi a t e l y      I noticed a St.               John's amb u l a n c e woman.

         She    told me to take deep breaths,                       but       I was   sobbing and still

A Q jd
         frightened       I began to          look about me.

         I saw about          six feet away,          a white         lad,      either      in his    late teens or

         e ar l y twenties wit h            collar     length sandy             coloured h a i r .       He was wearing

         t-raininq shoes,           blue    denim jeans and a tee-shirt                       possibly white          lying

         flat    on his       back.     1 saw one u n iformed m a n , I'm not sure                        if it was a

         p o l iceman or a St.          John's       a mb u l a n c e m a n    leaning      over the y outh and

         pounding       his    chest.        The youths         tee shirt           had been pulled up towards

         his    neck.     The youth's          face was         blue and his eyes were                 closed.        I'm

         not    sure how       long    the attempt was made                    to   revive     him but    I then saw

         other    supporters.           Some o n e     then covered the youth's                   face wit h a jacket

         or    coat,    and he was          then    carried away,              I think on a a d v e r t i s i n g

         hoarding       or stretcher.              I w ould     not be able           to    recognise     the youth.

         Thereafter       I saw at          least another           four       people      lying on the     pitch w ith

         others a t t e m p t i ng     to    revive them.             It quic k l y became more and more

         po p u l a t e d wit h    people     lying     on the        pitch,        some sitting,        some walking

         in a daze and others                running about           helping.           It seemed to be          complete

         choas and       it seemed to go on for ages.                          I can't      put a time     on how         long

         I sat on the          pitch but       I was      led off together with John and his                          son,

         hot    drink and         I began to        calm down a little.

         I was    still       faint and       I was     event u a l l y t aken to the             coach w h i c h

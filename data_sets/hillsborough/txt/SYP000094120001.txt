               On S a t u rday          15 Ap«ri 1 1 9 89      (150489 )         together          w i t h m y IsaXher

                             and    uncle                             I went        to H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l         Ground

               Sheffield           to    see   the      semi   f i na l    between Liverpool                      and Notti ng ham

               F orest.

               We a r r i v e d     at     the L e p p i L a n e           end and         by     this     t i me    there       was     a

               crush       developing           in f r o n t   of    r^e     perimeter            gates.

               I saw a mount ed                police     officer         ancNhis       Horse        being         pushed around              by

               the       crush,     and     I motf-frd out      of    the w a y       because          I did        not w a n t      the      horse

               to    tread        on me.

               I then        saw a ma n         in a     red   c a r d i g a H vs h o u t i n g     something            at   the m o u n t e d

               Police        Officer.

               The       Policeman         then    leaned      over a n d        c u ffe               across        the      face     and       head.
                                                         C/yT                  £ViD:
               I have        been       s h o w n a v i d e o r e c o r d i n g of the            incident          Exhibit       No
                                                                                                                                  PAGE          2
                                                                                                                                  S3838

             and     I h av e     pointed          out    the m a n     in the     red     calNdigan a n d         t he P o l i c e m a n

             leaning         o ve r    and     cuffing       him.       The    number      on t h e \ y i d e o    time    wa s     1147.

             The     other      thing        I remember         wa s    seeing    a supporter             stagger       onto      the

             pitch around              the     time      the m a t c h w a s    being      stopped        he a p p e a r e d   to    be

             dazed.

             He    staggered           from       the P e n 4 d i r e c t i o n    into     the     penalty area           and      then

             across         towards       the N o r t h S t a n d .         A Po li cem an went           up to     h i m a n d was

             then       joined        by a n o t h e r    Policeman and           they     got     hold      of   the   supporter

             and     part      dragged         him     off   t he    pitch and       put    hi m    back      towards      the      pen     I

             then       lost    sight        of    them.

             I would         describe          the y o u t h as        stocky around mid             twenties,          and appeared

             to    be    holding         one      of   his a r m s     as   though    he    ha d    h ur t    himself.         I cannot

             describe          the     two     policemen        other       than wearing           uniform.

                                                                                                                               SIGNED

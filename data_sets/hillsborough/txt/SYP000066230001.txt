           I live at the above address and I am a s up porter of Li ve rp oo / F o o t b a l 1

           Club.     It was my intention to go and watch the semi final of the F A

           chal1enge cup on the 15th April            1989 (150489).                  I did not have a

           ticket but I know a person named                              who normally has some spare

           tickets.

           On the 15th April      (150489)    together with                                     Of

                                               iru                           w h o ’s address     I don't

           know.      I travelled by tr ai n/ to Sheffield.                  We left St Paneras Railway

           Station at about      10.45 am    (1045 h r s ) that morning and ar r ived at

           Sheffield main station at about            1 pm <1300 h r s ).

           Once at the station the three of us and another man who we had met on

           the train hired a taxi which took us to Leppings L n .

           We got to the ground at about 1.30 pm (1330 h r s ) and we then walked to
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S1049

the local    railway station to meet the football special to see ____

to purchase a ticket from him.

I did in fact meet             and purchased from him a ticket for £10,

The ticket was a standing      ticket for the Leppi ngs Ln stand with a face

value of £6.     He had the other spare ticket which

purchased.     This meant that         was without a ticket and so we

wandered around asking      people for a ticket as sometime there are

spares for sale.

We were unable to get        ticket so we made our way to the entrance

point   in Leppings L n /   My entrance   point was     *B ’ but this was not

clearly marked and /I was     initially outside entrance          'A*.    I was at the;

entrance at 2 . 4 0 /:>m <1440 hrs) and there was no queueing but a mass of

people surrounding the entrance       point.    Whilst outside the ground I

was jostled about and younger       persons were getting crushed.               As

hadn't got a ticket he and                stayed outside arm I made my way to

the turnstile.     As the crush got worse outsidfe I / a w         people      climbing

the walls and getting over       into the grounc        Ouiside    I saw three

policemen on horseback and a couple of policerr/en stood by entrance

*B *.    I could hear the police on horseback shouting to people to get

back and they seemed to be using the horses           in an attempt to get

people back.

Once    I had got into the ground througly'the turnstile           I was aware of a

mass of people coming from my r ig h t/and I looked around and saw that

they were entering through a gateway which was marked exit oiythe

inside,   the gate had obviously been opened by same means.                   /I was not

aware of any police or stewards just         inside the t u r n s t i l ^ .    When

inside the ground I more or less got carried along with the                    crowd

towards a tunnel    in front of us through which I could see the                  playing

area.     I am positive that at this time the players were on the pitch

and the match had started.        I subsequently got carried along               into the
                                                                             PAGE         3
                                                                             SI 049

tunnel and through it.         At this t ime/l w a s n ’t crushed but the tunnel

was full with some forward movemeryC.             I then made my way to the left

at the end of the tunnel as I w a / on the left going through it.                 I was

then in the pen known as pen 4;

When    I was    in pen 4 1' was    in a total   crush and in fact was not facing

the    pitch and I was unable to turn around because of the crush.                From

entering the tunnel and pen 4 I was engaged in a general forward

movement and was facing        in the wrong direction for the majority of the

time.     I could sense a slow build up of intense heat and I was soaking

wet as was my clothes.         I was unable to make any movement and was

carried along with the        crowd.     I had/no control    over which way I was

going but the movement was all forward with no backward movement which

is what usually occurs when the / r o w d goes forward.          As I was facing

the tunnel,for some time           I could see that although the crush was

getting worse all the time           people were still   forcing their way into

the pens.        I was aware that the game had stopped but hadn't seen the

players    leaving.     I eventually ended up by a barrier and subsequently

turned     around and I could see a crowd of people on the front of the

pitch.      On my right I was aware of a man and a woman aged about 30.

The man was shouting for help as the woman appeared to have fainted.

1 think she was wearing jeans but I c a n ’t remember what else.              I do

recall    her shoes fell    off as she was lifted and passed over peoples

heads to the front and subsequently over the barriers onto the                playing

area.     I could see on the pitch side of the barrier           police, ambulance

men and supporters       help to pull     pesple from the pens onto the      pitch.

I then climbed onto       the barrier J6y me and scrabbled over the top of

people      to the front barrier aiy3 a policeman pulled me over and I was

able to get onto the pitch. / \          lay down for 5 to 10 minutes to

recover from the crush.            I was asked by numerous    people   if I was

alright.        When I sat up I could see people       lying on the grass and
                                                                                       PAGE         4

others   running around.

I felt a bit better and I got up and joined about 4 others and a

steward to hold an advertising board.                     We then went towards    pens 3 and

4 by the goal mouth and helped people                 in trouble onto the board which

we used as a stretcher.           W/ carried 3 people one at a time towards the

Spion Kop End on the        lef^ handside from the pitch.                 We left the people

there to be attended ts

The fourth person we got to            was on the right of the goal            outside y e n 3

and inside the     penalty box.            He was   lying face up w i t h a    policeprans

coat over him.     This shocked me           greatly as      I w a s n ’t aware that   people

had died up to     that    point.      The persons brother was witn            him shouting

"Help m e , help me,      its my brother."           We    carried the m./n to the same

area by the Spion Kop and the brother was o b v i o u s l y ^ n deep shock.                     I

ca n’t recall what he was wearing,              the dead man that is.

We then did a couple more journeys and after that I just                       walked away

and sat down by myself.           I know now that           I was obviously    in shock.        I

was just     crying and distressed.

1 then thought about                [and             and started to look for them,

The announcement was made that the game was off and the Leppings Ln

end was deserted.

I then heard my name being           called and saw                 and         in the West

stand in the seats.        They     came down to me on the pitch and we

subsequently left the ground.               We telephoned home from a nearby/pub

and then made our way home.                I arrived at about      12.15 am (1215/ h r s )

I had found out from                that he infact          paid £20 on the turnstile to

get in the ground and he and                        aent into the seating area because

the terrace was full.

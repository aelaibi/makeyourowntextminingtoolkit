            We arri v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h at 9.40am                (0940)        and paraded      in the-North'

            stand       for brief i ng at         10am         ( 1000) „•

            On    completion of the              briefing we           remained           in the N orth stand where we

            consumed a packed meal.

            At    11am    (1100)       I commenced duty at                  the junction of L ea k e - R o a d and

            Leppings Lane             in company with DC 2399 Wren.                          The   purpose   of our      duty

            was       to prevent       non-residents             from entering Leake Road and                  non­

            residents          cars    from     parking         in this      street.         Barriers were      placed

            across       the    junction to restrict access.

            for       the first       hour    or so things were               quiet       but   fay -about\ ,12.30pm

            (1230)       fans mostly Liverpool                   were walking along Leppings Lane                     towards

            the ground.             The    fans were well            behaved       but a significant           number were

            carrying       cans of beer,            bQ.tt.les of wine            or       cider.    Some were       standing

It was also          noticeable       that many having            reached the          ground were

walking     back along         Leppings Lane asking               directions          for the      coach

other    fans asking          for    ‘s p a r e s '

By 2o* clock         <1400)    the flow of fans along Leppings Lane was

continuous and traffic was                   having      d i f f i c u l t y making    progress,,

o d v i o u s 1y been drinking.             I thought       to myself       at the      time      it seemed

that many of these             supporters         had tried       to get .’as much a l e 5 as

possible       down their       necks       before      the start        of the match.

a l l e w a y that    leads    to some       bungalows        and following           a complaint           that

supporters were          using       the alieway as a            toilet,        .i. positioned myseif

at the mouth of          it to prevent            further      nuisance,,        whilst         I was

standing       here    I saw one youth stop               i n Jt_eppi figs Lane and he began to

urinate     openly      in full       view of everyone.              I moved towards              him      but     he

ran off     his actions         cheered by other              supporters.

D uring my time         at    this    location        I was    visited      by my serial           sergeant

Police Sergeant W i l s o n and also my serial                       Inspector whose              name      i do

not know except          that       n e was .based at W o o d s s a t s .         He spent a fair

amount     of time      i n company with us.

I was    not     in possession of a radio and was surpri|js^"to see Special

C o n s t a b l e s who were    patrolling            in pairs    eNs^r^wi th the        latest         personal

radio.

At 3o * clock        (1300)    the     crowd had dwindled            to just a few out up to 3 pm

(1500)     the    flow of supporters              had    retnairsed continuous.

At 3.05 pm (IS 05)           together witn my serial                I n s p ect^o r i^oejg a n        to walk       to

Claywhee'is Lane         for    lunch       leaving DC Wren on the junction.

As we walked along Leppings Lane                        I could hear messages                  on his Police

radio    but    c o u l d n ’t hear what was           being       said but       it was       obvious       by the

tone    of what was          being        said that    there were          problems          somewhere and we

listened       carefully.            We    then heard a message              to the effect            that

e veryone was      required on the               running      track.

On hearing       this we        immediately          turned     round and began to walk                   quickly

back    to the L e p pings Lane              end of the       ground.         Whilst         we were making

our way back       the       Inspector a t t e m p t e d      to    contact Police             control       for

instructions       but       could not        get    through.        The messages             that were       being

t r a n s m i t t e d sounded to me to be very                b a a l y ■g a r b l e d =     I saw that other

o fficers were also             hurrying along L e p p i n g s Lane               on foot and          in vans.

On    reaching.the Leppings Lane                    end of the ground             1 saw a large           number

of o f f i c ers.waiting.             Instructions       were      given to form a cordon across

the Leppings L a n e .e n t r a n c e .

There were       vary f e w .supporters about at                    this time         outside       the

ground,        These    supporters were ushered outside                         the        cordon   line.

At this    time    no one        knew what was          happening          or what          had happened,

some officers          knew that the game              had been stopped as                   1 h4ard them

tell    supporters          t his.

Whilst    I was standing              on this       cordon    I overheard a c o n v e rsation to

the    effect    that       there were        casualties       inside       the ground and even

people    aead.        As    1 seemed to be serving                 no useful         purpose       together

with PC E l 27 Smart            1 mads my way          into    the Leppings Lane                end of the

g round by way of the turnstiles.                       On making my way across                     the   open

concrete area          I saw     people       lying    on the ground a p p a r e n t l y unconscious

being    tended by others,                also   others who a p p e a r e d to be              injured

It was my       impre s s i o n that there            had been some           sort         of fight    between

certain amount                   of. abuse           from the            crowd.

On      reaching           the a rea at the                      rear    of the            goal mouth      in -Front           of the         West

stand,         I      saw that there were a number                                of        bodies        lying all          over       this

area,           I     realised then that something                                of        an extremely serious                    nature

had h a p p e n e d .

There were a large                          number          of    civilians           on the         playing area some

a ttempting              to    resuscitate                  unconscious            people          other     evacuating people

by using              boards       torn from the edge of                           pitch.

The      situation was absolute                              chaos,         I saw at this                 time a p p r o x i m a t e l y

15 bodies              lying       in the area at the                       rear of the goalmouth,                             1 ..then
                                                                                                                              ,    _v       ,..........
went      to the gate                that       gives access                from the             pitch to p^udocn: iil wnere

I could see codies                          lying      towards           the      bottom of the terracing,

together              with other              officers             I helped                toremove       these bodies             through

the gate              onto      the running             track.           This       evacuation was               done         by

officers              carrying         the body to the gate where myself and some other

policemen took                   the        body arid manoe u v r e d                  it through the gate,                         !he body

whilst          this was            going on civilians were                                screaming abuse at                  some

There was no d i r ection or                                control        at this end of the                    g r o u n d , .the

whole        thing was              just out of control                          with       people        picking        up bodies''

 putting             them onto          boards and                carrying          them away.              We had no              idea

where         the       casualties were                     being       taken .to»

There was a point when the spectators                                               in the West sta-nd began jeering

and      roaring and                i feared that                   there would               be a full        sca^e         pixels

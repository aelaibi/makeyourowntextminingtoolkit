<2-/6. i ~ ^ O n     Saturday, 15th April 1989, I performed duty in connection with the

    /A   %     F .A. Cup Serai Final tie between Liverpool and Notts. Forest played at       i

               Hillsborough.
               I commenced duty at Barnsley at 9 am and drove a Police personnel

               carrier full of officers from Barnsley to the ground, arriving at

               9.30 am.     We all attended at the briefing in the North Stand before
                                                                                             t
               taking up our points in the ground.     I , together with other officers

               from B1 sub division was on Serial 14 under the direct supervision of

               PS 1341 Crawford, our duty before the game being to search persons

               entering the ground via turnstiles A to 6 which are situated at the

               rear of Leppings Lane.     Our brief was to search persons for things

               such as weapons, bottles, cans and large flags and banners etc.

               Following the main briefing we were briefed in detail by our Sector

               Inspector, Inspector White.     This briefing took place just before 11 am

               on the terracing at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.     Following

               this we took up our positions at the turnstiles at around 11.15 am.           •

visits to the refreshment bar area which is situated at the South end

of the rear of the Leppings Lane terrace.                     This was to ensure the

safety and security of the persons working there and was deemed

necessary because at the corresponding match in 1988 a robbery had

taken place.        My attention to the refreshment bar area at first took

the form of frequent checks with the staff, then returning to my

search duties, as trade at the refreshment bar was slow.

Persons began entering the ground via the two available turnstiles

more or less as soon as they opened.                   These persons were searched as

they entered in spite of the fact that they had already been searched

by other officers outside the ground.                   The mood of the people who

arrived early was friendly and none, to my knowledge, objected to

being searched.         I had occasion to remove property from presons on

entering, but the objects taken were made up only of one large

banner, two cans of pop and a small miniature bottle of 'Bells’

whisky in the shape of a bell.                These items were appropriately marked

with a label and placed in the property store - no one objected to

their property being taken from them.

From the time when the turnstiles opened persons entered the ground

at such a rate that it was possible to                  carry out a good search of              J

each.    There was no rush to get in and                the mood and atmosphere
                                                                        !
remained friendly, assisted perhaps by the fact that it was a fine day.j

goods without paying.     From my position I could see across the

enclosure to where my colleagues were engaged on searching duties and

as time passed, as is always the case, persons began arriving and

entering at a faster rate, but initially the crowd did not seem to be

anything out of the ordinary for such a match.

At approximately 2.30 pm it began to get busy and I saw through the

turnstiles which were approx 30-40 yards away that a crowd was

building up outside.     Persons outside the ground were being forced to

wait and it did not appear to me that they were waiting in set queues.

It seemed more like a large crowd which had developed as opposed to

large numbers of people queuing in an orderly manner.     There was a

great deal of shouting and chanting and a kind of "hum" that one

sometimes gets in a large crowd.     I left the refreshment bar area to

return to the turnstiles to assist my colleagues.     It continued to

become more and more busy and the searching of persons entering

ceased in order to allow persons to enter the ground without causing

further delay or Inconvenience or causing a crowd to buiId up in the

enclosure inside the turnstiles.     The crowd outside had now become a

crush, a sea of people which stretched as far as Leppings Lane

itself.    Persons who were entering were becoming more and more

aggressive in their attitude towards us.     They were complaining that

the crush outside was not only unbearable but dangerous.     There were

persons of both sexes and all ages who were in danger of being

crushed.     Their mood was such that I feared that one of us may be

assaulted.     It is quite possible that this feeling amongst the fans

was brought about by the conditions outside the ground and brought on

by genuine fear of being crushed.     Several persons told us this and

they were assured that Police Officers,    including mounted officers

were on duty outside the ground deputed to control the crowd.       I saw

several people climb into the ground over the wall above turnstiles

had come to the match anyway and were intent on getting in somehow.          !

Several persons who were entering were saying that someone would be

seriously injured or crushed to death unless something was done to

relieve the pressure outside.     The turnstiles could not cope with

such a crush.     The area between the turnstiles and the rear of the        !

stand filled with persons who made their way towards the Leppings            ;

Lane terrace and stand.     It was not possible for me to do anything

about the persons who entered over the wall due to the numbers who

were present, they simply jumped down and disappeared into the crowd.

Many of the people who entered at this time had been drinking.       This

in my opinion tended to inflame their anger and made them more

aggressive and I genuinely feared that sooner or later one of us

would be assaulted.     The sheer number of persons made it impossible

to consider arresting or ejecting the persons who were drunk.       My

impression was that these persons had in the main arrived late at the        I

ground, having been in local licensed premises drinking but this by

no means applied to all.     The mood had changed from being good            |

heard messages passed over the tannoy asking persons waiting outside

to be patient and that there was room inside the ground.      These had
little effect, if any at all.    Persons entering the ground were, on

occasions struggling for breath, particularly the older ones amongst

them.
Shortly after kick off time I went with other officers into the

ground where we were told to attend on the track in front of the

Leppings Lane terrace.    We entered via the first gangway of the South

Stand.   On emerging I saw a large number of persons on the pitch.          It

was obvious that something had occurred.      The chants that greeted us

on entering were critical of the condition of the ground.      It seemed

that the whole of the Liverpool end was chanting "shitty ground,

shitty ground, shitty ground." to the tune of "here we g o , here we go

here we go." as is chanted by most footbal1 crowds.      My first

impression was that the supporters entering late had become so

agitated that they had invaded the pitch.      I was soon to learn that

this was not the case.    I was greeted by a scene that I can only

describe as one of horror.     I went immediately with my colleagues to

the track at the Leppings Lane end of the ground where we tried to

assist persons out ofthe terrace area via the      gates in the perimeter

fencing.   I was principally   engaged in the two southern most pens,

marked ’S ’ and ’C S ’ on the ground plan.   Many people were crushed up

against the fencing and I could see that a great many were struggling

for their very lives.     Moreofficers arrived and we all tried

desperately to rescue    these people.   Many were shouting for help.

Other people who managed to get through the fencing were wandering

about on the pitch in a state of shock, many in tears, many were very

angry and agitated perhaps in the circumstances understandably s o .

To their credit others were helping evacuate the pens.     We were all

hampered by the fact that the gates were narrow, so much so that
                                                                     PAGE     6

there is only width for one person to get through at a time.

Pressure continued to come from behind.    All I can imagine is that

people at the back were so concerned at being able to see that no-one

realised what was happening at the front.
                                                                                  I
Officers were making frantic signals for persons to stop pushing and              j
                                                                                  i
to move back.   Several persons were helped out of gate n o . 2 onto the          i
                                                                                  j

track.   Some were injured but none seriously.       The greatest problem

was around gate no. 3   and along the length of the perimeter fence. I            :

saw one youth who forsome inexplicable reason was swinging from a                 i

girder under the roof   of the West Stand.    Some of the persons on the          :

pitch were aggressive towards us, we became the butt of their anger.

Persons of all ages and both sexes were brought from the pens and

laid on the pitch.   I could see that in the 'CS' pen persons in front

of the fence on the terrace were pi led on top of one another,

crushing the unfortunate ones who had fallen or been forced to the

ground by sheer weight of pressure from behind.        Others were squashed
                                                                             i
up against the fence.    As persons were freed from the pen it became        :
                                                                             ]
clear that there had been   a great loss of life       although at this stage

I thought it would be in the region      of 20.

Many officers were trying to rescue    persons trapped and my personal

feelings were of helplessness as I saw persons crushed up against the

fence or under persons who were trying to get out.        Helplessness

because in spite of being so close, close enough to touch it was

impossible to help them out because of the narrow gates.        Persons who

were only a matter of feet from the     gates were unable to get out.

The casualties were being   treated by S t . Johns     ambulance staff and        j

many persons came and identified themselves as doctors and nurses.                j
These persons undertook a   lot of first aid treatment.      I brought            j
3 persons from the terrace who were    unconscious amongst others who             I

were able to walk, although injured.    All 3 who required emergency              j

tratment were dealt with by persons who told me that they were

trained medical staff and I returned to see if I could help the

trapped persons still in the terracing.     Recovery of the victims was

now so slow, or rather it seemed slow because it was hampered        by the

narrow exit gates.   The pressure on the fence began to ease and it

became easier to recover casualties and it must be said, also recover

the dead.   The rescue effort was helped by a senior officer, I believe

Chief Supt. Nesbit who tried to co-ordinate Police efforts by using a

megaphone to get us to work as a team as opposed to a group of

individuals.   I saw, initially, only one ambulance and I believe that

was one operated by St. John’s although ambulances did     attend,    asdid

the Fire Brigade to assist in the operation.      The need was for     oxygen

to revive persons and to help those who were unconscious.     Oxygen

was in short supply and really only arrived when fire service

personnel attended with rescue equipment.     Advertising boards were used

as stretchers for the dead and injured.     Bodies lay on the turf with

clothing covering their faces.    The whole scene was one of absolute

horror, one which no-one whatever their professional training or

background could possibly be trained to deal with.

As the terracing began to clear I saw one ofthe barriers in ’CS ’          pen

had been bent completely over and broken.     The pressure on the

persons at the front must have been tremendous and I experienced
                                                                                     i

Many were angry and were abusive towards me and my colleagues.        To

some extent I understand the reason for this.    By that I do not mean

that I feel the Police were to blame but I do understand what the

persons must have felt and understand that they had to take it out on

someone.    Eventually the announcement was made that the match itself

had been abandoned.    The ground began to clear and we went with the

supporters into Leppings Lane towards their transport before

returning to the North Stand.     It was while speaking to a colleague

there that I realised the enormity of the tragedy.     I learned that

there were 74 bodies laid in the gymnasium.

Whilst in the North Stand I was able to reflect on what had

occurred.    What I have written before was my account of the incident

as it developed.    To sum up I feel, without wanting to lay blame at

anyone’s door, that I should make my own personal feelings known.

I, like many others, have been a football supporter all my life.        I

have been watching footbal1 at Hi 1lsborough    since before 1960 - in

fact ray    mother informs me that I went to my first match at 3 years of

age - some 33 years ago now.     I am a Pol ice Officer of 15 1/2 years

service and I have worked many football matches, four or five of

which have been serai finals, including the corresponding match

between     the same teams last year - although on that occasion I was on

duty inthe refreshment concourse in the West Stand.     I have   also

attended many matches, mainly at Hi 1lsborough, many with large gates

and I have always felt safe there - indeed my wife, 12 year old

daughter and 9 year old son regularly attend with me.     None of us

have ever had cause to feel unsafe at the ground.     In view of the

foregoing paragraph I feel in some ways qualifled to pass an

’informed’ opinion.     I keep abreast of football matters and am

conscious of the safety aspect from both sides of the fence, as it

were.
I know that the capacity for this match was 54,000 I also know that

Sheffield Wednesday F.C. is a club which has staged important matches

for a number of years, including semi fina1s and staged last year’s

ticket affairs with oneticket being sold        for each seat or                 j
corresponding place on a terrace.     The capacity is governed by local

authority, fire regulations and police and I am sure that the ground

can hold more than this figure, but it is kept at the figure for                 j
safety reasons.     I do not wish to enter into the argument over ticket         |

allocations but I am convinced that if only these persons with

tickets had gone to the game then this tragedy would not have occurred.

I cannot put a figure on how many attended       without tickets   but it was

a large number, it must    have been for such    a crowd to formoutside

the ground.    The crush outside was such that persons who were entering

were injured and in genuine fear of their lives.        1 feel that if the

pressure had not been released then someone would have been seriously

injured or indeed killed outside the ground.        Unfortunately the effect j

of opening Gate C allowed persons to enter at a fast rate, as opposed            ;

to a steady flow through the turnstiles.        The crowd flooded across         j

traditional that the crowd is at its most dense in the area behind               ]

                                                                                 i

that when X passed the entrance to the 'S’ pen it looked full and                s

people were craning their necks to see when I got onto the track that            j

pen, although crowded, was not ful1 to capacity.        The 'OS’ pen on the

contrary was jammed ful1.     It is quite possible that the surge of

people into the terrace via the tunnel put pressure on the people

already inside, who were forced to sway forward putting pressure on

the barrier and the persons at the front.       Perhaps if the terracing

had not been divided into pens then the crowd could have spread out              (

more laterally, filling spaces in pens ’S ’ and ’N ’ which although

crowded were not full.    Unfortunately the pen fencing prevents

lateral movement.

I also feel that drink had a large part to play.    It is traditional

to "have a couple of drinks" before a game but some persons attended

at the game, obviously the worse for drink, making it a day out and

an excuse for a "booze up".   These persons seemed intent on getting

in, whatever the cost.   They were not prepared to wait and seemed to

have no regard for the safety of their fellow supporters.     Drinks

affect people in different ways but people tend to become more

aggressive, particularly when in large groups or gangs, more excited

and agitated and less tolerant and more prepared to exercise their

animal instincts to get what they want - in this case entry to the

match regardless of the safety of themselves or others.

As for the police side, I feel that we were confronted by a situation

which got out of hand and we found ourselves unable to cope with the

change in conditions although perhaps no contingency plans could have

allowed for what happened.    It would seem that more people attended

by private transport, coach or by mini bus so that they would have

more freedom than they would if they had travelled by train when they

would have been escorted to the ground by police officers.

From the grounds point of view it is assumed that all arrangements

for the match met with the approval of the local authority.     From my

own experience I know that the club is conscious of the needs of               ;

safety and public order and would presume that the ground complies             j

with safety regulations - otherwise it would not have been chosen as

a venue.   It certainly seemed to cope with the corresponding match

last year.

Having reflected on the whole incident there is not one sole factor

which can be blamed.   Perhaps it happened as a result of several

ingredients for disaster all coming together at once.    One thing that

I do know is that the seeds for the tragedy wre sown outside the

turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end.   The deaths occurred inside the

         the 20 or 30 minutes prior to kick off.   If that conclusion lays the

         blame at the feet of some of the supporters who attended on that day,

         then so be it.

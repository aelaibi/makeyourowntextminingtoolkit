I HAVE READ THROUGH YOUR STATEMENT CONCERNING THE SEMI FINAL AT HILLSBOROUGH

ON ^ > / 4 / 8 9   (130489) AND YOU MAKE CRITICISM OF POLICE OFFICERS ON DUTY THERE *

DO YOU WISH TO MAKE ANY SPECIFIC COMPLAINT AGAINST THE OFFICERS.

REPLY;       I COULD MOT IDENTIFY THE OFFICERS CONCERNED IN ANY SPECIFIC         INCIDENT

BUT I JUST WANTED TO GIVE MY VIEWS ON THE POOR ORGANISATION OF THE

MATCH AND THE INACTIVITY OF THE POLICE WHEN WE TOLD THEM ABOUT THE SUPPORTER

BEING CRUSHED IN THE PENS BELOW THE WEST STAND.              I DO NOT WISH TO MAKE A

FURTHER STATEMENT,

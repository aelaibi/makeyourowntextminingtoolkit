RELATIVES of the Hillsborough dead queued to identify
their loved ones who were piled in a makeshift morgue,
claims a Liverpool council report today.

  The force is accused of having a “ hysterical attitude”
towards hoooliganism — at the expense o f crowd safety.

conditions in the makeshift morgue. It claims relatives
were forced to wait for long periods to identify bodies; the
use of photographs created a “gallery of the dead”; the
dead were presented in a dishevelled manner in body bags.
  The inquiry questions the usefulness of the Lord Justice
Press reports on the behaviour of Merseyside fans.

For the attention of Inspector Burrows


Dear Sirs,

City of Sheffield - Scheme for Major Peacetime Emergencies

I refer to your recent telephone cofiversation with my office and am pleased
to enclose a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major Peacetime Emergencies,
as requested.

As you will be aware, the Council's functions and responsibilities are
not primarily designed to provide an emergency rescue service and its Emergency
Plan is supplementary to the Police Scheme for major disasters.

In the case of the Hillsborough disaster, the Local Authority broadcast
an appeal for trained Social Workers to attend the incident and it was
in this area of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved that the
Local Authority's services were primarily directed following the incident.
Further details of the action taken by the Council's officers can be provided
by the officers concerned, if required.

With reference to your query regarding specific emergency plans, I can
confirm that the role of the Authority does not require the preparation
of a specific plan for a major emergency within the Hillsborough Stadium.

Yours faithfy^Lly,




Acting Head of Department

Dear David,

Re: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


You will recollect that I have already spoken to you about payments
to pathologists and others arising out of the disaster at Hillsborough
on 15th April.

You will recollect that by virtue of an extraordinary effort from
everyone involved we were able to carry out seventy post mortems on
Sunday 16th April and the balance of the cases were completed on
Monday 17th April.

Without detracting in any way from the tremendous effort which was put
in by the staf f of the Medico-Legal Centre it is ■undoubtably true that
it would not have been possible to achieve this result without the very
willing assistance and help from pathologists, several of whom brought
their own teams in order to increase our capacity.

It is also true that if the hospital^ had not agreed to take our routine
cases and deal with them it would have made things exceedingly difficult.
No charge has as yet been, made     it ;would be difficult if not
impossible to resist it.

When I was first informed of this incident I thought that probably post
mortems should be undertaken by forensic pathologists and indeed a
large number of the cases were dealt with by these.

As you know in ca$es of special difficulty (which for ail practical
purposes includes all* forensic cases) a special post mortem fee is
paid of £130.10 as opposed to the standard fee of £46.50.

I have carefully considered what would be the appropriate rate in this
case and I feel that probably it is not justified to clasify all the
cases as forensic, on the other hand I think it would be proper to
recognise the tremendous effort as well as the stress and distress
which dealing with so many young people undoubtably was.

1.    I therefore would like to recommend that in this particular case
we should remunerate the pathologists by paying the standard fee of
£46.50 plus a supplement per case so as to bring the total remuneration
in each case to.f_65.-00. You will see that this is in fact 50% or so
of the forensic pathological charge.

I would be grateful if you could please obtain confirmation that the
Council will in these exceptional circumstances agree this special
payment.

I have already mentioned that several of the pathologists brought
their own teams, in particular the following mortuary staff came:

Professor Stephen Jones brought his own mortician and Mr.
was present for 12 hours on Sunday.

The Royal Hallamshire Hospital morticians attended, they were Messers
                             and Mr.                 1 .They attended
for 7 hours.

Dr. Slater was accompanied by Mr.                                                     who was present on
Sunday and on Monday for a total of 13 hours.

2.     These mortuary staff need to be appropriately                                         remunerated.

There are two further matters.

Professor Stephen Jones was accompanied by his secretary who presumably
took notes directly.  Other pathologists as far as I know used dictating
machines and no doubt their secretaries had to work very hard to get the
work typed up but they weren't present on the day.

3.   You may feel that some financial recognition for the presence of
Professor Jones' secretary on 16th April 1989 should be made.

Incidently I understand from Dr. Slater that he is proposing to fund out
of his fees the expenses for the heavy secretarial duties performed for
him on this particular occasion.  I would on the whole be reluctant to
recommend that we should reimburse secretarial costs away from the Medico-
Legal Centre.

4.   Finally there is the question of the attendence of pathologists at
the Hillsborough Sportsground on the 15th April.  On that occasion
Professor Usher was called in and Professor Stephen Jones phoned me and
volunteered to come to Sheffield, an offer which I most readily accepted.
Dr. Slater also I believe came to the scene.

I should perhaps add that their help and advise was invaluable.

Mr. D. Purchon


I have been reflecting on their attendence (particularly Professor Usher
and Professor Jones).  You will of course appreciate that no P.M.'s as
such were undertaken but I wonder whether a way of recognising their
presence and the help which they gave on that occasion would be to
remunerate them at the value of one special P.M. fee i.e. £130.10 (plus
any mileage and so on) as a recognition of the time, effort and help
which they provided on that sad day.

You will notice I have not specified remuneration for the mortuary
attendents or indeed Professor Jones' secretary.  I think you are in
a much better position than I am to quantitate these figures.

I will be very grateful if I could please hear from you as soon as
possible on this matter.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - BEREAVEMENT & SUPPORT SERVICES DIVISION
HEALTH & CONSUMER SERVICES


Purpose of Report

To recommend appropriate payments to members of the department in
recognition of their services following the Hillsborough disaster.

To recommend additional funding for the replacement of emergency supplies
and the provision of additional body trays.


Background

Following news items on Saturday 15th April, Medico-Legal Centre staff and
managers in the Bereavement and Support Services Division reported for
duty to the Medico-Legal Centre. Mr |          former manager of the
Medico-Legal Centre also attended to render assistance.

Between 4.00 p.m. on Saturday and 11.00 p.m. Tuesday these officers, apart
from a few hours for sleep and odd meal breaks worked non stop to deal
with the 95 victims and their relatives and other visitors.

For example the Manager of the Centre was on duty for a total of 62 hours
between the hours stated above and most staff worked stints with snatched
mealbreaks of 16 or 17 hours on Sunday 16th.

Very briefly the tasks performed in liasion with the police included
undressing and.admitting 95 bodies to the mortuary in accordance with
procedures; cleaning and preparing them for identification/viewing by
relatives; preparing for and assisting with post mortems, storing bodies
in refrigerated areas; receiving and comforting distraught bereaved
relatives of the victims, liaising with social workers, clergy and other
voluntary helpers and cleaning all areas thoroughly as required.

Several pathologists, their technicians plus morticians from the Royal
Hallamshire Hospital assisted the Home Office Pathologist in performing
autopsies on all the victims during Sunday ind Monday.

This was carried out so effectively and efficiently that the first
inquests could commence at 2.00 p.m. on Tuesday and the first victims
were removed by funeral directors during Tuesday afternoon - less than 72
hours after the tragedy. The remaining inquests were completed on
Wednesday.                                         .          -

Several council members, including Cllr. C Betts, Leader of Sheffield
City Council, and Neil Kinnock M.P. Leader of the Parliamentary Labour
Party, visited the mortuary during this period and witnessed the
mortifying scenes and the awesome tasks being accomplished.
                                                 -   2 -


   3.0         Comment

        3.1    It is satisfying to report that the Centre, its staff, systems and
               supplies, though placed under tremendous pressure were equal to what
               hopefully will be their greatest test.

        3.2    The staff involved are unlikely to forget that weekend or the effects of
               experiencing such stress and mental anguish and a debt of gratitude is
               owed to all concerned for their unstinting efforts and commitment to a
               task which was outside all possible expectations.

        3.3    Sadly their crucial role and unselfish efforts appeared to go largely
               unnoticed outside council circles but it would be wrong for it to go
               unrewarded, even though reward and recognition are not expected by the
               staff.


   4.0         Proposed Recompense

               In arriving at an appropriate level of recompense for pathologists,
(...)   4 *X
               Dr Popper, H.M. Coroner is suggesting the payment of a post mortem fee of
               £65 per case which is between the normal fee of £46.50 per case and the
               special fee of £130.10 per case which applies to all forensic cases and
               those of special difficulty.

        4.2    Dr Popper also suggests payments at the appropriate enhanced rates to the
               outside morticians and one pathologists' secretary who provided such
               valuable assistance.

        4.3    The part time reception staff who work long and arduous hours are entitled
               to the appropriate additional payments but mortuary staff are covered by
               an agreement whereby their normal pay rates include an element in respect
               of overtime working and they normally take time off in lieu of additional
               hours. In these exceptional circumstances it is felt that overtime
               payment at enhanced rates would be appropriate.

        4.4    Similarly four senior managers above the normal overtime limit worked long
               hours in extremely stressful circumstances and it is felt that overtime
CD             payments on this specific occasion would be suitable recognition for the
               tasks performed.

        4.5    Detailed information is set out in Appendix 1.


   5.0         Other Costs

        5.1    Under the emergency plan arrangements emergency stocks of equipment and
               consumables are held. These of course are greatly depleted and an
               additional twenty five stainless steel body trays had to be purchased.

        5.2    These trays and replacement consumables cannot be afforded from within the
               normal cash limited budget and financial assistance is requested since
               steps have already been taken to rebuild emergency reserves.




                                                                                            I
                                     -   3   -


The volume of typewritten work in connection with case notes and inquests
and the need for efficient storage and retrieval of lengthy records
necessitates the urgent provision of quality word processing equipment in
the Coroners Office. Sufficient funds are not available in the Coroners
budget this year.

In order to bring the newly installed chiller units into operation earlier
than planned to cool down the whole mortuary suite, emergency weekend work
was   required involving engineers from London at an additionalcost to that
planned.


Recommendation

That

a)the deepest gratitude   and appreciation of tht City Council be conveyed
    to those employees of the Bereavement & Support Services Division who
    worked for long hours in the reception and the public mortuary at the
    Medico Legal Centre following the Hillsborough Disaster,

b)     the additional payments totalling £10,356 .00 set out in Appendix 1 be
       approved, and

c)     these payments together with the cost of replacement consumables and
       additional body trays totalling £17,392. 54 set out in Appendix 2 be
       met from supplementary funding to the Health & Consumer Services
       Programme Committee.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
HEALTH AND CONSUMER SERVICES - PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION


1.0           Purpose of the Report

        1.1   The    purpose of this report isto   outline therolewhichthe Public
              Health Division was able to contribute towards the aftermath of the
              Hillsborough Disaster. A secondary purpose is to seek agreement to
              properly remunerate those officers who were required to work out of
              normal hours following the disaster.

2.0           The Role of the Public HealthDivision

        2.1   Themulti-functional and diverse nature of the PublicHealth Division
              resulted in the contribution of its officers in a variety of different
              ways:-

              2.1.1   Safety in Sportsgrounds - Officers from the Environmenmtal
                      Protection Unit (Health and Safety Section) contribute their
                      health and safety expertise towards the corporate evaluation and
                      control of Safety in Sportsgrounds legislation which is
                      administered through the Licensing Section of the Administration
                      and Legal Department.   Within an hour of the disaster becoming
                      known a manager from the Environmental Protection Unit was on
                      site, later joined by the senior manager in the Unit.
                      Furthermore, within the first hour liaison had been established
                      between the Assistant Director of Health and Consumer Services.

                      The subsequent investigation into the physical conditions on site
                      relevant to the Safety at Sportsgrounds aspects of the disaster
                      was co-ordinated through the Divisions staff, including using the
                      expertise of the Health and Safety Executive's Safety Engineering
                      Laboratory and the Field Consultative Group. This investigation
                      was subsequently terminated by the announcement of the Public
                      Inquiry.
"   j
              2.1.2   Sports Hall Disinfection - Officers from the Environmental
                      Services Unit satisfactory completed the cleansing and
                      disinfection of the Sheffield Wednesday Sports Hall which was
                      used as a temporary mortuary and for medical treatment
                      immediately after the disaster.

              2.1.3   Flowers and Memorabilia - The Manager and officers from the
                      Environmental Services Unit removed the flowers, memorabilia,
                      etc. from the ground for incineration to permit the scattering of
                      ashes on the pitch.

              2.1.4   Corporate Co-ordination - to ensure -that the City Council
                      maintained an effective and appropriate response to the disaster
                      the Director and Assistant Director contributed to the operation
                      of the Co-ordinating Group "established by the Acting City
                      Solicitor.   Furthermore, the Director was the Council's
                      spokesperson following the incident, pending the announcement of
                      the public inquiry.
                                          - 2-



2.2   The work consequent on the Hillsborough Disaster had to be accommodated
      by re- scheduling other work of the Division. To minimise the further
      disruption of the service, it would be appropriate to pay the officers
      involved in working out of hours the appropriate overtime rate. The
      officers involved are outlined in Appendix *A*.


0     Recommendations

3.1. That the officers involved in the Public Health Division's response to
     the Hillsborough Disaster be thanked by the council for their
     willingness to assist and for the high standard of professionalism
     demonstrated under distressing and difficult conditions.

3.2   All officers identified in Appendix 'A' being on N.J.C. conditions
      should be paid the appropriate overtime rate, for the out-of-hours work
      they completed, which amounts to a total cost of £1,140.90, to be met
      from supplementary funding to Health and Consumer Services Programme
      Committee.

            Dear Stefan,

            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

             I refer to your letter of 12th May, 1989 and to our subsequent telephone
             conversation.

             Attached for your information is a report drafted by me to the Policy
             Committee.

             Councillor Howard Knight, Chair of Finance Sub-Committee, telephoned me to
             say that the report would not go to committee in isolation since other
             Departments and other expenditure were naturally involved and    he wishedto
             eventually draw all these together as a corporate report with     total costs
             calculated.

             However, he was concerned not to delay matters and gave his personal
             approval to all expenditure contained infchis report which you   will see
             includes all your proposals.

             One item included is the word processing facility for your service as we
             discussed.  I requested £5,000 for hard and software (and training) and
                          has ordered a Professional Work Station (PWS.30), which has
             sophisticated word processing facilities, D Base III and Logistix software
             packages, which will fulfil your other information technology needs, plus a
             Laser Printer for top quality output.

                       will arrange installation and training for your staff.



                                                                                                                       /continued...

      I have received your letter concerning Mr. Williams from Rotherham.
      The amount will be paid.   It is very close to the amount we had
      provisionally calculated based on hours worked .and our rate for mortuary
      technicians.

      It would be helpful however if you could provide full names and addresses
      for the other outside morticians involved and also for Professor Jones'
      secretary so that cheques can be forwarded together with our thanks.

      No doubt you will submit details of fees for pathologists in the usual way.



      Yours sincerely,

        ADDITIONAL AUTHORISED EXPENDITURE - HEALTH & CONSUMER SERVICES


        With reference to our conversation when you telephoned me from London some
        weeks ago, I wondered if you were yet in a position to provide written
        confirmation of our discussion on this matter as promised.


        You will recall agreeing immediate payment of the amounts specified in two
        reports from David Purchon intended for the Policy Committee meeting on
        23 May 89.


        As a reminder the details are set out in the attached copies of the
        Appendices to the reports and totalled £11,497 for overtime payments,
        payments to pathologists and to outside morticians etc; and £17,393 for
        replacement and additional equipment and consumables plus some emergency
        work by air conditioning contractors.

      I understand Mr J Batley, Manager of the Medico Legal Centre has spoken to you
      regarding the temporary use of office accommodation by officers from the West
      Midlands Police.

      On the 2x June 1989, Detective Chief Inspector Ross and the Principal Admin
      Officer, Mrs           [risited the centre and discussed the arrangements. As
      you are axrare the Coroner, Mr S Popper has offered the use of his rooms at the
      Centre to enable liaison officers from the West Midlands Police to continue
      enquiries prior to the Coroners Inquest.

      Arrangements are being made for the installation of additional telephone lines
      and facsimile machine at the expense of West Midlands Police. My officers will
O     Provide their own furniture and equipment and will liaise closely with Mr
      Batley regarding installation.

      I forward this letter in formal confirmation of the arrangements that are in
      hand and thank you for the support of Mr Batley.

                 Having got the first part of the Taylor Inquiry out of the way (with
                 the report due to be published, I understand, towards the latter part
                 of next week) I am now being pressed by Dr Popper regarding the perceived

                 need      o r aadditional

                 As you know,             on the current state of the law, he is required,
                 notwithstanding the                 Inquiry,          to make his own enquiries into                                     the

                 the present Court facilities are obviously inadequate for this size
                 of matter at which there will need to be accommodation for at least
                 as many Barristers and their supporting               suDDortincr staff as there                  there were at the

                 addition, there will also be a need for office accommodation.

                 In terms of duration, it is likely that the Inquest could well take
                 half as long again as the Inquiry took, so the accommodation would be

                 I have indicated to Dr Popper that it” is unlikely that the accommodation

beneficial following other disasters is that of debriefing groups for
professionals who nave had some form of involvement, during or after the
incidents.

I would appreciate your co-operation in ensuring that the attached letters
are made available to any members of your staff who m a y b e interested in
attending the de-briefing meeting




Yours sincerely

            The Hillsborough Task Team has been established to offer professional services
            to those involved with the Hillsborough disaster and inquiry. Staff in several
            council departments were directly and indirectly involved in* the subsequent
            inquiry. It is generally recognised that professional staff connected with such
            events need to be given the opportunity to describe the tasks they undertook
            and share their experience with others in a similar position, and this is becoming
            a standard practice throughout the country. We therefore invite anyone who may
            have been involved with the inquiry to a de-briefing meeting on Tuesday 5th
            September at 3pm. This will be held in room 6 on the top tf'loor of Hillsborough
            Library.                                                  *

           RE:   THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - 15TH APRIL 1989
                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INTERIM REPORT

           The Interim Report of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry into the Hillsborough
           Stadium Disaster was published on Friday 4th August 1989. In view of the
           great sadness we all feel about the Disaster and the Programme Committees
           interest in the future management of sportsground safety I have taken the
           opportunity of preparing a briefing note for you. If you require a full
       j   copy of the report please contact me.

   1.      Press and Information Management

           The Councils immediate response to the publication of the report was to
           issue the attached press release and co-ordinate all press liaison through
           Phil Dent (Chief Publicity Officer) and Mark Webster (Acting Head of
           Administration and Legal). Mark also informs me that he is preparing a
           draft committee report for Policy Committee in September which will be
           circulated to all interested departments for their contribution. Health
           and Consumer Services will be included in those consulted.

            The media have directed the majority of the "blame" on the Police in
            general and Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield in particular.
            Headlines have included the fact that Peter Wright, the Chief Constable
            has offered his resignation, David Duckenfield has been suspended, the
            information is being referred to the Director of Public Prosecution and
            the South Yorkshire Police Authority intend to hold a special meeting.
            Although the Report places a great deal of responsibility for the Disaster
       j   at the Police's door, there is also considerable criticism of the City
            Council and SWFC. It is reasonable to assume therefore that if the media
            wish to prolong the "story" they could enjoy considerable sport at the
            City Council's expense.


   2.      The Interim Report

           My reading of the 71 page Report brought back into sharp focus the
           horrific nature of the Disaster and the excellent response by the Council,
           but in particular staff in Health and Consumer Services Bereavement and
           Support Services Division and the Public Health Division. The Report, by
           its nature contains a detailed account of the disaster, the preceeding
           events and aftermath. I consider that the Report is an accurate
           representation of the circumstances and I agree with the findings,
           recommendations and conclusions which support the findings of my officers
           who were involved in an investigation immediately following the Disaster.
           I particularly agree with the statements on the crush barrier positioning;
           the tunnel gradient; the perimeter gate sizes, frequency and not being
           properly designated as exits; and the failure to correctly specify
           capacities and systems for the control of overcrowding.
                                            -   2   -




         The Report is directly critical of the Council in statements such as:

         "The performance by the City Council of its duties in regard to the Safety
         Certificate was inefficient and dilatory. The failure to revise or amend
         the certificate over a period of three years preceeding this disaster,
         despite important changes in the layout of the ground was a serious breach
         of duty".

         "A number of serious breaches of Green Guide (this is the official
         guidance from the Home Office on Sportsground Safety) standards were
         permitted and persisted e.g. the spacing of the crush barriers, the width
         of perimeter gates and the gradient in the tunnel (1 in 6 as against the
         Green Guide maximum of 1 in 10)".

         "The Advisory Group lacked a proper structure: its procedure was casual
)        and unbusinesslike.  Its accountability to the General Purposes Panel was
         ill-defined. Decisions were taken informally and too much was left to Mr
         Bownes (David Bownes - Chief Licencing Officer). In particular, the
         decision to remove barrier 144 was not referred to the Panel and ought not
         to have been made".

         "But it is clear that the attention given to this important licencing
         function was woefully inadequate".

         It is apparent that the Council, the General Purposes Panel, the Advisory
         Group and David Bownes are the subject of direct criticism.   In respect to
         David Bownes, it is my opinion that he is a conscientious and sincere
         officer who is a capable administrator. However by his own admission
          (Paragraph 153) he was given tasks and expectations made beyond his level
         of technical competency. This arose from him being allocated the job of
          co-ordinating Safety in Sportsgrounds when the function was passed to the
         City Council in 1986 upon the dissolution of the South Yorkshire County
         Council. Consequently he sought advice primarily from the Building
         Surveyors on the Green Guide and in particular the safety of barriers,
)        perimeter fences, and capacities etc. Health and Consumer Services (in a
         minor capacity on general health and safety considerations) plus the fire
          service, police etc. Frequently advice was conflicting and inadequate but
         he was not in a satisfactory position to arbitrate from a position of
         knowledge. Although he must shoulder some responsibility, as must the key
         advisors, his managers and the polititians involved.

         From the Report I summarise the causes of the Disaster to be:-

    a)   The failure of the SWFC and the Police to prevent congestion at the
         turnstiles leading to the necessity to open gate C, and of the club who
         provided confused signs and ticketing. The situation was aggravated by an
         unruly minority who had drunk too much.

    b)   The failure of the Police when gate C was opened, to cut off access to the
         central pens which were already overfull.

    c)   The failure of the City Council to specify safe maximum capacities and
         ensure that control measures were available to monitor and control entry
         to specific pens. The Police and SWFC are criticised for their failure on
         the day.

    d)   The failure of the City Council to ensure that the layout of crush
         barriers afforded adequate protection and of the police for failing to
         quickly react to the crush in the pens and to co-ordinate rescue.

    3.    The Recommendations

          The Report contains 43 Recommendations, 28 of which should be implemented
          by the start of the new football season (19/8/89. This will be reviewed
          by the Officer Working Group. However a very important Recommendation is
          the need for the City Council to review the arrangements for Safety
          Certification and Committee accountability and to establish an Advisory
          Group.

          Although Safety in Sportsgrounds and the role   of Health and Consumer
          Services has been given a much higher profile   since Hillsborough, I am
          concerned that many of the deficiencies still   exist perhaps exemplified by
          the position with SUFC where in paragraph 157   of the Report it identifies
          that:-

           "SUFC was designated under the 1975 Act on 3rd July 1984. A Safety
    ( i   Certificate was about to be issued by South Yorkshire County Council at
           the time it handed over to the Sheffield City Council on 1 April 1986. No
           Certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United".

          To my knowledge, a Safety Certificate or alternatively a refusal has not
          been issued to date, although I understand that one will be issued
          shortly.

          If is my view that the Advisory Group should be properly established with
          clear roles and accountability identified, chaired by a competent expert
          in sportsground safety from the City Council. As originally agreed in
          April/May the function should be transferred from MEGS to Health and
          Consumer Services Programme Committee and a clear system of delegation and
          reporting established. This approach would complement the transfer of
          enforcement powers to Health and Consumer Services for the provisions of
          the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 for sportsground safety,
          contained in the draft "enforcing authority" Regulations.

          I propose to put forward my views in this Departments response to the
    i i   Policy Committee Report. However, prior to doing so, I would welcome your
          comments on my suggested response, or indeed upon any of the points made
          in this memorandum.

Sear Roger,

I enclose a photocopy of the quote from J.L. Harpham Limited.
I also enclose for your information, a copy of the <p»&e
from Audio Business Machines. This as you can see is a
lot less, but I think we have decided that we would go
for the shorthand writers.

What we need to sort out now is which of the alternatives
we select.

To a certain extent this will depend on how many copies
we are going to produce, and what decision if any we
take with regard to charging.

Can we perhaps discuss this in the near future, when
you have had a chance to think about it.


Yoiftrs(sincerely,




       refer to my conversation with you on the 4th of August
re accommodation. Can you please chase this up as I think
if we do not take decisions soon we are going to be in
real trouble with regard to a venue.

            Sheffield S3 7ET                                               27th July, 1989,

            Dear S i r ,
( .)
                                       Re Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

            As requested in your telephone conversation with our office     t
            yesterday we set out below an estimate of the cost of providing a
            daily transcript of the proceedings at the Inquest to be held
            into the victims of the above.  Our charges are in accordance
            with the agreed rates with HM Treasury Department operative from
            1st June, 1988, which are subject to an increase not yet agreed
            from 1st April, 1989.

            We would put forward two alternatives for your consideration as
            follows:

            Alternative N o . 1 :

                     Attendance Fees per day for team of 4 writers @ £234.59

                     Transcripts:  1 Master Copy for your staff to make whatever
                     number of copies you or the parties may require @ 93.80p per
                     folio of 72 words.

            We would estimate from the times of sitting per day you have
            outlined that there may be approximately 450-500 folios per day
            for each transcript. .Estimating at 500 folios per daily
            transcript we would say the cost of a d a y ’s transcript would be
            approximately £470.

            With the attendance fees and transcript, the daily cost for one
            Master Copy would be around £700 plus VAT @ 15%.

            We may have to incur travelling and subsistence expenses  for our
            reporters to attend, but we would attempt to keep these costs to
            a minimum as we would hope to use local staff.

            As you would have the copyright of the Master Copy transcript you
            would therefore be at liberty to supply transcripts free of
            charge to parties or to make a charge, which would offset the
            costs of your staff and photocopying expenses, e t c .




                                      Directors: J. L. HARPHAM, L. HARPHAM, H. DAVIDSON, N. SCOTT
Alternative No. 2 :

Our company can photocopy the transcripts and oversee their
distribution to yourself and the parties, for which the rates
would be as follows:

           1 top copy @ 78.8p per folio plus say 5 copies @ 4 p per
           folio.   Therefore 6 copies would cost 98.8p per folio x 500
           = .£494.  The total cost of attendance fees and 6 copies of
           the transcript to you would be approximately £730 per day.
           {We would propose to charge other parties to the Inquiry £10
           per copy).

By this alternative method the cost to you for our attendance
fees and say 6 copies per day of the transcript would be
approximately £730 per day, assuming an average of 500 folios per
day, but you would not have any other costs for your staff doing
the photocopying work, paper, photocopier, etc.

If you were mindedf to accept our first alternative of receiving a
Master Copy transcript each day and copying the transcripts using
your own facilities, we would warn that there can be as much as
three hours’ work in copying a large number of volumes per day,
this commencing when the transcript is available from the
reporters at around 5.30 p.m-6 p.m. or even later, depending when
the Inquest adjourns each day.   You obviously will not know how
many copies will be required at this stage, but we can say that
the Hillsborough Inquiry Secretariat were producing a minimum of
50 per d a y .

Our own preference would be to supply a Master Copy and for you
to make your own copying arrangements, but if you felt this would
overburden your office we should be happy to provide the service.

We should be pleased to give you any further details you require,
or our Mr. Davidson would willing to visit your office to discuss
the matter with you or a member of your staff.

We await to hear from you, first of all as to whether you will
require our services and if so, which of the above alternatives
you would prefer.

 Dr S L Popper
 South Yorkshire Coroner

 S3 7ES

 Dear Dr Popper

 Following our recent meeting I thought you would appreciate my
 confirming the details of the proposals we discussed with regard to
 recording the    proceedings at  the  forthcoming inquest into  the
 Hillsborough Disaster.

 We would provide you with the following facilities:-

 1)   A Grundig Model CS2000 Conference and Meeting recorder system
 together with a similar back-up system so that if necessary one machine
 can be stopped to be reviewed whilst the other is continuing to record.

 2)   3    Grundig Model 2300L Transcribing machines.

 3)   3    Brother EM1050 Word Processors.'

 4)   3    Secretaries to operate the equipment.

 The costs are based on the secretaries working for 6 hours perday and
 for 5 days per week.   Following our conversation I havebeen able to
 reduce the charges slightly and they now work out at £1942.50 per week
 for all the above services.

  I would ensure that the installation and smooth running of the operation
  is properly sorted out and cared for and that any problems associated
  with the equipment would be dealt with within the price quoted.

                                                                                                 ST.
                                          -2-




The prices assume that there will be a minimum hire period for the
equipment of four weeks ie of total cost of £7770.00 and that thereafter
should it be required the cost would be £1942.50 per week or part
thereof.

I understand that originally you favoured the idea of shorthand writers
and that subsequently you decided to review the cost of recording
equipment again. I have enclosed descriptive literature on recording
equipment and associated equipment and hope you will contact me again if
you require to pursue the matter further.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs,

            iTADITM DISASTER.

With reference to your letter of the 27th of July, you
will of course be aware that this disaster has been
referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

In these circumstances, I have decided that I will not
resume my Inquests on the 15th of January 1990 sis I had
already originally intended.

In these circumstances, I would be grateful if you
would delete the pencilled in reservation for that date.

1 am not in a position to say what will happen in the
future, but should I feel it appropriate to use your
services, then of course I will be in touch with you.

May I please say that I am very grateful for the help
and courtesy with which you have dealt with my inquiries.

Yours faithfully,




 c.c. Mr. R. Michie,
 Assistant Director, Health &
 Consumer Services.

The Hillsborough Disaster Inquests - A Brief Report for the Sheffield
Bereavement Forum Newsletter


The resumed inquests into the deaths of the Hillsborough Disaster
victims were held between Wednesday 18th April and Friday 4th. May,
for the first 2 days at the City Memorial Hall and subsequently at
the Medico—Legal Centre.

The inquests were inevitably a traumatic time for all those concerned
and especially of course the families of the victims, many of them
returning to the place where they had identified their loved ones
just a year before.

Extensive preparations were made beforehand with West Midlands
police officers who were co-ordinating proceedings for the Coroner,
working in conjunction with staff at Medico-Legal Centre. The
biggest problem from an organisational point of view was to ensure
that the needs of those attending the Hillsborough Inquests were
attended to with care and sensitivity but with minimum disruption
to the normal work of the Centre and without any neglect of the
needs of Sheffield families having: to attend following the trauma
of a sudden death.

With careful allocation of the rooms available, the welcome provision
of refreshments by the WRVS and excellent cooperation between
Medico-Legal Centre Staff, West Midlands police officers who were
individually assigned to Hillsborough families and social workers
from the Hillsborough Task Force, it was generally felt that
proceedings ran as smoothly as could have been hoped for and the
standard of practical and emotional support on offer to the families
was high.

The Coroner was very keen to ensure that detailed evidence of the
circumstances surrounding each individual death, was explained to
families and friends and ample time was provided for this to be
done. Hard though this undoubtedly was for the bereaved, it seems
to have been very important and necessary for them.   Indeed one
lady whose son had died attended almost every inquest*? feeling
that she wanted to know everything that it was possible to know
about what had happened.

We now await the decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions
as to whether or not any individual or individuals are to be
prosecuted as a result of the Hillsborough Disaster. Only then will
the Coroner be able to decide what will happen next as far as the.
inquests are concerned*

         Dear Mr. Batley,

         Re: ADDITIONAL STORAGE FACILITIES IN CORONER’S FILE ROOM - HILLSBOROUGH.

         If you would like to have a look into our file room you will see that we need
         at least two more metal cupboards to try and accommodate the vast amount of
         paperwork which these inquests have generated.

         I have spoken to David Purchon about this and he told me that you will make
         the necessary arrangements for these cupboards to be acquired. I will be
         grateful if this could be put in hand as soon as possible.

         I also think that, bearing    in mind the nature of these records,that we
         should have one set of the   transcripts bound in some acceptable form, so as
         to constitute a reasonable   and preservable permanent record.   Can you discuss
         this either with me or |     |, so that appropriate arrangementscan be made,
         once we have tidied up and   have located a complete set.

         Yours sincerely,

          Hillsborough Disaster Aftermath

          Since late Saturday afternoon I know that you have been more involved than
          any one else in Sheffield with the dreadful consequences of our biggest
          ever disaster.

          Other members of the Department, including myself, have been leading the
          investigation into the events on behalf of the Council and I have also
          been acting as the only officer available to the media until Monday
          evening's Press Conference in the Town Hall, when initial council
          statements and Dr Popper's press release about release of bodies etc. was
          delivered to the media.

          Immediately prior to the Press Conference I was able to brief a large
          gathering of City Councillors about the emergency response and of course
          about your superhuman efforts to respond with all possible speed to the
          needs of the Coroner, his assistants and the vast numbers of bereaved
          visitors to the Medico Legal Centre.

          The Leader and all other members of council present unanimously expressed
          their deepest gratitude to those involved in responding to the needs of
          the crisis and the bereaved and especially asked me to pass on their
          gratitude as soon as possible; this I certainly do together with my own
          most sincere thanks and pride in your commitment, energy and expertise.

          I regret that my visits to Medico Legal Centre were fleeting and that I
          was not able to spend more time with you but the response has stretched us
          all.

          There will now of course be a dramatic contrast between the time of crisis
          and a coming to terms with normal work again and can I urge you not to
          hesitate if you need any assistance at all. I will do my best to provide
          it.




                                                                                       To.

Dear Mr Purchon

May I, both personally and on behalf of my officers, express gratitude .for the
invaluable assistance your staff at the Medico-Legal Centre gave to us in the
aftermath of the terrible tragedy at Hillsborough Football Ground.

I have been told particularly about the expertise, sympathy and understanding shown
by the receiptionist, Mrs                    and Mrs                lin dealing with the
distressed relatives of the victims. I have written to these ladies personally, thanking
them, but I realise there are other members of the Mortuary staff who performed
equally as well but whose names I do not know, and I would be obliged if you would
pass my appreciation on to them.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mrs

May I, both personally and on behalf of my officers, express gratitude for the
invaluable assistance you gave to us in the aftermath of the terrible tragedy at
Hillsborough Football Ground.

Your expertise, sympathetic approach and understanding in dealing with so many
traumatic situations and distressed people were greatly appreciated. Your contribution
will long be remembered by the police personnel involved as, indeed, it will by all
those you helped during that difficult time.

Yours sincerely

Dear            ]

Thank you for your letter expressing the gratitude of Cantril Farm Labour
Party to the people of Sheffield for the support, care and kindness they have
shown to the people from Mersyside following the Hillsborough tragedy.

I read your letter to the Labour Group members of the City Council last
night, and I am sending a copy to various Chief Officers so
that they can pass on your thanks to officers of the City Council who have
■been heavily involved in trying to respond as far as we have been able to the
needs of people from Merseyside.

There is still a considerable amount of grief in Sheffield about the events
at Hillsborough as people felt that we failed as      hosts to our visitors.One
of the things that has provided support to them in recent weeks has been the
continuing letters and messages of thanks from people in Merseyside for the
■way in which the people of Sheffield responded.

I   hope that out of the tragic events will      arise a new understanding and
relationship between Sheffield and Merseyside.

If there is anything which the Labour Group can do   to   assist   this     process
please do not hesitate to contaict me.

Our best wishes and thanks

Yours fraternally

Dear Mr Purchon

May I, both personally and on behalf of my officers, express gratitude for the
invaluable assistance your staff at the Medico-Legal Centre gave to us in the
aftermath of the terrible tragedy at Hillsborough Football Ground.

I have been told particularly about the expertise, sympathy and understanding shown
by the receiptionist, Mrs                    and Mrs I              ]in dealing with the
distressed relatives of the victims. I have written to these ladies personally, thanking
them, but I realise there are other members of the Mortuary staff who performed
equally as well but whose names I do not know, and I would be obliged if you would
pass my appreciation on to them.

Yours sincerely

                    Dear

                     I am writing to give my thanks for the assistance you gave us in
                     the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster.  It was a very difficult
                     time for the staff at the Medico-Legal Centre and all equipment
                     and machinery were pushed to the limit. We were very grateful when
                     you were able to obtain the hydraulic parts late on Saturday night
                     as it enabled us to keep all the handling system operative during
                     the busiest period after the disaster.

                     Would you also convey our thanks to your friend who gave you so
                     much assistance in the task.

                     Yours sincerely

     Dear John,

     I have not had much opportunity to speak to you whilst the
     Hillsbrough inquests were in progress but would like to
     say that I appreciate your involvement particularly with
     the organisational aspects relating to the preperation
     for the inquests at the Memorial Hall as well as at the
     Medico-Legal Centre.




     Youys sincerely,

 CHAPTER 7



 Sum mary



 1.     In this chapter I summarise the findings which I have made.

•'2.    Before doing so I must make it clear that anyone who is familiar with the
        terrible events of 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough is bound to have great
        sympathy with the relatives of those who died and the spectators who were
         injured. I have now spent many weeks studying the evidence of what
        happened and considering the representations and submissions made by the
         families and their legal representatives. I find it difficult to imagine anything
        more horrific than that experienced by those who endured it and those who
         lost their children, relatives and friends.

         That 96 people, the majority of them young, should set out in high hopes and
         spirits on a fine Spring day, and yet within a space of less than half-an-hour
         suffer crushing injuries from which they died, is nothing less than appalling. I
         have the most profound sympathy with all the families and friends of those
         who suffered in this way, many of whom I have met. I also understand the
         dismay that they have that no individual has personally been held to account,
         either in a criminal court, disciplinary proceedings, or even to the extent of
         losing their job.

 4.      I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to them,
         especially since they had had their hopes raised that something more could be
       , done. But I cannot allow compassion to cloud my judgement. I have had to
         look dispassionately and objectively at what is said to be fresh evidence, in the
         light of the evidence which had previously been considered.

  5.    Having done so, for the reasons I have set out, I have come to the clear
       ■ conclusion that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judicial
         Inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a
         renewed application to the Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to
         exercise his powers under the Coroners Act 1988. I do not consider that there
         is any material which should be put before the Director of Public Prosecutions
         or the Police Complaints Authority which might cause them to reconsider the
         decisions they have already taken. Nor do I consider that there is any         _.
         justification for setting up any further inquiry into the performance of the
         emergency and hospital services. I have carefully considered the
         circumstances in which alterations were made to some o f the self-written
         statements of South Yorkshire Police officers, but I do not consider that there
          is any occasion for any further investigation.

  6.    None of the evidence I was asked to consider added anything significant to the
         evidence which was available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry or to the Inquests.
Video evidence

7.     Chapter 2 of this report deals with video evidence o f the disaster. My
       conclusions about that are that there is no new video evidence of it or video
       evidence which was not available to Lord Taylor, the Coroner, or the other
       authorities who examined the disaster at the time.

8..    Two video tapes which were stolen on the day of the disaster remain missing.
       They were tapes of pictures from CCTV cameras operated by Sheffield
        Wednesday Football Club. They were not police tapes and would not have
        shown anything significant. Their theft is unsolved. The suggestion that
        the police tried to blame their failure to spot overcrowding on the terraces onto
        faulty CCTV equipment is wrong. They did not blame the CCTV equipment.
        The police controllers had a good view over the terraces from their control box
        and did not pretend otherwise.

9.     The allegation that police hid videotape evidence o f the terraces is unfounded,
        and the allegation that the Coroner failed properly to pursue the question of
        this ‘missing’ police footage is equally unfounded.     Police officers did not
        give false evidence about the state of the police CCTV system at the ground,
        and I do not accept the.evidence of Roger Houldsworth, video technician at
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, that he realised from looking at police
        CCTV pictures of pens 3 and 4 at about the time Gate C was opened at 14.52
        that these pens were dangerously overcrowded.


The a ftermath of the disaster

10.    I deal in Chapter 3 of the report with suggestions that the inquest into the
        deaths of those who died in the disaster was seriously flawed, and that there
         should now be a public inquiry into what was done, or not done, to help them
         and others who were crushed.

11.     I do not consider that the Inquest was flawed. Most o f the criticisms relate to
        the so-called ‘3.15 cut-off point’. I do not agree with these criticisms. The
        Coroner considered the questions of who the deceased were and when and
        where they died at the mini-inquests, and this involved consideration of .
        matters long after 3.15. It was only in relation to the question of how, i.e. by
        what means, the deceased came to their deaths that the Coroner imposed a cut­
        off point of 3.15 p.m. He had good reasons for deciding to limit the inquiry rn'
        this way and the cut-off did not limit inquiry into that question.

 12.    Questions of whether the response of the emergency services was adequate
        were not relevant to the task the Coroner had to perform. It was suggested to
        me that the fact that Dr Walker, Mr Houldsworth, and others were not called
        as witnesses at the inquest amounted to fraudulent concealment of their
        evidence. That suggestion is false and I regard it as wholly irresponsible.
13.       Lord Taylor inquired into the rescue operation and his findings are published
          in his report. He made criticisms of the slow response of the police and
          recommendations for the future. I cannot see that any useful purpose would
          be served by having any further inquiry into the rescue operation. In my
          opinion there is no evidence of want of care by the emergency or medical
          services. Any wide-ranging inquiry into this aspect of the disaster would
          place huge burdens upon them, but to no purpose.
*


Interference with witnesses


14.       Chapter 4 of this report deals with suggestions that the evidence of witnesses
          to the disaster was tampered with, so that the truth did not emerge either at
          Lord Taylor’s Inquiry or the Inquests. These allegations are o f two types -
          that the West Midlands Police put pressure on Derek Bruder, Debra Martin,
          and Paul Taylor which affected the evidence they wished to give, and that the
          way in which the South Yorkshire Police went about collecting evidence from
          their own officers who were at Hillsborough and witnessed the disaster was
          unacceptable. I have interviewed Mr Bruder, Miss Martin, and Mr Taylor and
          have come to the conclusion in each case that there was no improper attempt
          to affect their evidence.


Mr Bruder

15.       So far as Mr Bruder is concerned, I am quite satisfied that the West Midlands
          Police, in seeking to confirm details of his statement relating to Kevin
          Williams, did not subject him to improper pressure. He told me himself that
          they did not. His statements were accurately summarised at the inquest on
          Kevin Williams and there was no attempt to discredit him.


    Miss Martin

    16.    I did not find Miss Martin a reliable witness. Her statement about events at
           Hillsborough, where she was on duty as a Special Constable, was seriously at
           variance with the account of everybody else who was there. She remains
           plainly - and understandably - deeply upset by the disaster, and her memories
           of the day and of subsequent events relating to it are vague and confused. I
           think that she gave her account of Kevin Williams sitting up in her arms and •.
           saying ‘Mom’ in good faith. But it cannot be relied upon. It contradicts Mr
           Bruder’s evidence and is also contrary to the pathological findings.

    17.    I interviewed the West Midlands police officer who Miss Martin claims
           bullied her. I found this officer to be an impressive witness. I cannot see
           that she had any reason to discredit Miss Martin, and she told me that she did
        not bully or browbeat her.   I accept her account and prefer it to Miss
        Martin's.


\ l r Taylor

18.     As far as Paul Taylor is concerned, I do not accept his evidence that he was
        bullied or intimidated by a West Midlands officer. His account of what he
        saw at Hillsborough has changed in various ways over the years, and he does
        not appear to have raised any complaint about the conduct of this officer until
        1997. I prefer the evidence of the officer, which is supported to some extent
        by the contemporary documents. In any event he had no reason to put
        pressure on Mr Taylor.


South Yorkshire Police statements

19.     I have looked with great care at the way in which the South Yorkshire Police
        obtained written evidence from their officers who witnessed the disaster to put
        before the West Midlands Police investigators and Lord Taylor’s Inquiry,
         Soon after the disaster officers were asked to write out in their own words their
         recollections of the day and of the part which they themselves had played.
         Many of these statements were submitted to Hammond Suddards, solicitors to
         the force, to advise whether they were in a suitable form for submission to
         Lord Taylor’s Inquiry.

20.     The solicitors made no comment on the great majority o f these statements, and
        in others their advice was confined to clearing up ambiguities and removing
        hearsay, comment or inappropriate language. In a very few cases, which I
        have referred to in Appendix 7, what has been excluded is either factual or
        comment in which factual matters are implicit. In these cases I think it would
        have been preferable for the factual matters not to have been excluded, or the
        comment elucidated.

21.     It was well known to Lord Taylor's Inquiry Team that the statements were
         being vetted in this way. The process did not materially differ from the way
         in which statements were taken from witnesses who were employed by
         Sheffield Wednesday FC or the Ambulance Service.

22.     Towards the end of May 1989 the South Yorkshire Police team responsible for
         collating the evidence of officers in the Force began to suggest amendments to'
         statements without referring them to the solicitors. The suggestions they
         made were on the same basis as those made by the solicitors. I have looked
         at all the statements that were altered in this way. In most cases the alteration
         is trivial. Where comment or opinion is excluded the amendments cannot in
         my opinion be criticised. In no case is the statement rendered misleading.
23,    I am quite satisfied that Lord Taylor’s Inquiry was not in any way inhibited or
       impeded by what happened. Lord Taylor was well aware of the criticisms
       made by some junior officers. His Inquiry examined these issues and he
       made findings about them which were adverse to the police.

24,    I am also satisfied that the exclusion of these comments did not affect the
       outcome of the Inquests, or the decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions
       not to bring criminal charges as a result of the disaster. I do not consider that
       there is any question of misconduct either by the solicitor who gave the police
       advice upon the statements or by the police officers who suggested alterations
       to the statements without referring the statement to the solicitors.


Other issues

Inconsistent evidence

25.    It is clear that there is inconsistent evidence about precisely what happened to
        some of the people who died at Hillsborough, Such conflicts of evidence are
        inevitable given the scale of the disaster. The Coroner did his best to resolve
       these questions at the Inquest, and I have tried to get to the bottom of some of
        those which remain and which the families of those who died have asked me
        to look into. I have not been completely successful in this. What is clear
        however is that no further inquiry involving examination of the witnesses
        could help after this lapse of time.


The Inquests

26,    The Divisional Court found that the Coroner was not biased and had no
       conflict of interest. I see no reason to disagree with that. I can find no
       evidence to support the suggestion that Liverpool supporters who gave
       evidence at the Inquest were given a difficult time in the witness box.

27.    I do not agree with the criticisms which have been made of the Coroner and
        the way in which he ran the Inquests, But I endorse the recommendation of
        the Home Office Working Group on Disasters and Inquests that the role of the
        Coroner should be limited in circumstances such as these. I have reached the
        firm conclusion that is not satisfactory to have an inquest into the deaths
        caused by a major disaster when an Inquiry chaired by a High Court Judge has
        already covered the same ground.


The police

28.    Some of the families of those who died have told me that they have been
        unable to obtain copies of documents to which they were entitled from the
        South Yorkshire Police archive on the disaster. Two families supplied me
       with material to enable me to check on this. In neither case did I think the
       complaint was justified.

29.    The investigation of the disaster by the West Midlands Police was not biased
       in favour of the South Yorkshire force.

30.    The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has on many occasions apologised for
       the disaster on behalf of his force.


Examination hv doctors confirming death

31,    Criticism that doctors who examined bodies at the ground did so in a cursory
       or inadequate manner is wholly unsubstantiated.


The state o f the around

32,    There are two questions to do with the state of the Hillsborough football
       ground which seem to me to have aspects which were not considered by Lord
       Taylor’s otherwise very full Inquiry. These questions are to do with the
       height of the crush barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace where the disaster
       happened and the overall capacity of that terrace, I do not consider that they
       give grounds for reopening the Judicial Inquiry or any other proceedings.

        Then building   on these    reflections  they were   given  the
        opportunity to identify how debriefing, counselling and support
        services can be integrated into a Major Accident Plan.


        This report has been prepared as a means of communicating the
        recommendations of the Conference to Members and Officers of
        the Area Health Authority,     City Council,  Police and Fire
        Authorities,   and  Voluntary   Organisations responsible for
        preparing and reviewing Major Accident Plans.

                    DISASTER OR OPPORTUNITY


   A KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO THE CONFERENCE ON THE HILLSBOROUGH
    DISASTER ORGANISED BY SHEFFIELD AREA BEREAVEMENT FORUM


  - Given by Bryan Craig a trainer and group facilitator in
     Family and Community Services Department, Sheffield.
           He was a member of the original F & C S
                  Hillsborough Disaster Team.


This address will attempt two things:

Firstly to define in general terms ourtask    for   to-day,   the
focus of our attention and our energy.

Secondly to suggest, propose, encourage our approach to the
task; to begin to establish something of the emotional climate
within which we might conduct to-day's proceedings.  This might
seem a rather presumptuous thing to do,     but there is some
justification in wanting to do this, because the Hillsborough
Disaster had such a great impact on the City, on the people who
were at the match, on the workers from the emergency services,
and all the voluntary agencies, including Clergy. This is even
though all the evidence suggests that much of the personal and
collective impact of the disaster was dealt with personally and
informally.

How do we come together to discuss publicly a major tragedy
which took place in our community, which focused the attention
and energies of a vast number of people on the weekend of the
15th and 16th April, but which diminished gradually? Apart from
some peaks such as the service in Sheffield Cathedral a
fortnight later, the Taylor Enquiry in Sheffield Town Hall, and
later the publication of the Report.

There has been very little collective public discussion  of the
disaster. We have undoubtedly talked about it amongst friends,
our families, informally at work, and it might have been on the
agendas of formal meetings at our workplace, but there has been
very little collective discussion in public of the disaster in
Sheffield by Sheffield people. So how are we going to publicly
discuss such a very public disaster when we do not have the
experience of sharing our thoughts and our feelings and ideas
of people, other than those that we know.

Returning to our task first.      The visible tangible product
which the Sheffield Area Bereavement Forum wants to come out of
this  Conference,   is  some  initial  thinking,   some  initial
recommendations   about  how  counselling   services  should be
deployed within a major accident plan.   In order to do this, we
must reflect on our experience of the disaster and focus it in
a purposeful direction.We will have the guidance of Rod Orner
and Jo Wright to help us to do this, but it is inevitable that
in reflecting on our experience for this purpose, we may
surface, get back in touch with, re-experience, some of the
feelings  that arose within us when we saw those ghastly
pictures on television and in the press, when we sat for hours
with a grieving family at the Medico-Legal Centre, accompanying
a distressed person looking for their friend, or relative;as we
comforted distressed and confused relatives waiting in hospital
for news of one of their family undergoing examination;or as we
waited for hours and hours at Forbes Road, Kelvin Community
Centre and later at Division Street and other places, being
there ready and willing and wanting to support, to help, but
not being needed.

If such feelings arise within us, then I suggest we give
ourselves permission, and each other permission, to share, to
show them, to express them, as a natural and inevitable part,
for some, of the day's experience.  It is not    the purpose of
the day that we should unburden our feelings, but given the
purpose of the day how can we, who are interested in
counselling, support, befriending,how can we do anything else
but allow some time and space, if it is needed, for the re-
emergence of those feelings which belong to that day.    I feel
sure that giving ourselves this permission will enhance our
final product, since it will be more related to the emotional
reality of such days which might arise in the future.

One of our responses to the disaster, and of our part in it, is
inevitably powerlessness.     The disaster struck unannounced,
unprepared for, as all disasters do, filling one with horror
and pity, fear amd compassion, and a great desire to do
something no matter how small, to relieve the suffering.    The
feeling of powerlessness,     engendered by being part of a
community, which could be affected so suddenly by such a tragic
disaster, engendered by an inability to take away the suffering
of the people that we were with, to give them back their
friends or their family member, to 'make them better'.  But the
reality is we made a very powerful response in Sheffield to
that disaster.   In the Emergency Task Team, which was set up
immediately after the weekend of the disaster,     we estimated
that about 3,000 people in Sheffield,      from voluntary and
statutory agencies, and ordinary members of the public, either
gave   or volunteered   their services   during  that weekend.
Despite the chaos, people went to the gym to help others
identify bodies, and to hospitals to trace relatives, to sit
with them while they waited, went to the Medico-Legal Centre to
accompany family members     through the awful identification
process, went to Forbes Road to receive the distressed parents
coming from Liverpool.   There was no lack of courage, no lack
of caring, no lack of compassion, and no lack of response.

The only thing that was lacking, and inevitably so at that
stage,  was  organisation and   deployment of  Counsellors,
Befrienders, Volunteers.    So people arrived, and putting their
own distress on one side, found people who needed them and
stuck with them, realising they couldn't do anything about the
whole  situation,   the whole     disaster, but   they could   do
something to help one individual or two individuals or a
family, and that's    what   they    did.    The    response  was
magnificent, it was powerful, and it was more than adequate.
We also had people, waiting to be used, and to be of service.
By so doing, we converted the disaster into an opportunity, an
opportunity to serve, to heal, to support, to care, to be
with,and   to listen.   This may sound a strange idea, but it's
interesting to note that the Chinese word for crisis - and by
any definition the Hillsborough Tragedy was certainly a crisis
- this word is made up of two characters.     One character means
disaster, and the other means opportunity.       Literally in the
Greek, crisis means turning-point, put another way, crossroads,
decision point. A crisis is such an impact-full event, that it
demands a response,and we have the choice, respond to the
crisis as victims of a disaster, or with the power to respond
to it as an opportunity.

Out of respect for the dead, the 95 people who died in the
crush at Hillsborough, out of respect for those who were
injured there, and out of respect for their families, we call
what has happened at Hillsborough a disaster.  But in Sheffield
we did not become powerless, helpless victims of those tragic
events, we turned it into a magnificent oppportunity to serve,
to heal, to support, to comfort, and to succour. All those
things we did, not because we belong to any particular
organisation, but because we are human beings, because we
cared, confronted the suffering of other human beings, and had
the confidence to do so.    We made a powerful response during
that weekend.    One Social Worker told me thatat one     stage
during the Saturday night, in the gym, she became   aware that
despite the horror and the distress of the situation, that
there was a wonderful feeling of support, care, and compassion
from one human being to another.   No bureaucracy, no forms to
fill in, everyone was equal, but with different parts to play.
She very much regretted that this expression, this feeling of
common humanity and concern, inevitably dispersed, as life
returned to 'normal'.

Immediately  following   that   weekend,  an   Emergency  Social
Services Disaster Task Team was       set up.     The voluntary
organisations met together.   The Clergy met together, and all
the organisations involved began to take stock of the effects
on their staff of the disaster.   Offers of support came in from
Kent, from the workers on the Zeebrugge Disaster, Bradford,
from workers on  the Football Ground Disaster, from Kings Cross,
from workers on  the Underground Disaster.

Arrangements were made for grieving Liverpool families and fans
to visit the ground, and to work with some of the Stewards who
had been working on the fatal West Stand.  Support was given to



                             - 5 -


                                                                    (CO
the families of the few remaining unidentified dead victims of
the disaster.    Arrangements were made to support the families
from Liverpool who attended the preliminary Inquest Hearings.
Telephone help-lines were set up.       Counselling services were
made available both for people in Sheffield, and for staff of
the various organisations who had been working in the disaster.
A tremendous amount of purposeful and effective activity took
place. But to our surprise all of the services which were set
up   after   the   event,   were   greatly  under-used,    or  more
accurately,    substantially   over-provided.     The   independent
counselling and debriefing resources made available to Family &
Community Services staff, were used only by a small minority of
those who had participated over that particular weekend.        The
phone-in and drop-in service, organised by Relate, had hardly
any   callers.      The   Sheffield   Help-Line,   operating   from
Hillsborough Library, had callers mainly wanting to know where
to send money for the Hillsborough Disaster Fund. Only a very
few were seeking help.

When the Emergency Disaster Task Team was replaced by the full­
time Task Team, especially recruited for the purpose, they only
handed over 23 active cases with whom they were working, and
since July, when that Team was set up, only 9 new cases had
been referred.   So we have to take account of this phenomenon.
How is it that so little demand was made on the services
specially provided?

Let's be honest straight away,    and say that those of us who
were setting up these counselling,      support and debriefing
services, were assuming that because people had a need to deal
with the impact of the disaster on them, they would necessarily
seek   counselling, debriefing,   and     the support   services
available.   In this we were quite wrong.   We miscalculated and
overestimated the need of counselling, out of our zeal to be of
value.

There are a number of reasons why these services weren't taken
up.  Firstly, two points about the culture of Sheffield.  There
is a strong history and practice of informal community support.
Pubs, clubs, coffee bars, families, neighbours, are the main
resources for those needing to deal with the impact of the
Hillsborough Disaster.

Secondly,  the   strong  macho culture    in Sheffield,   which
particularly discourages men from acknowledging weakness and
vulnerability in expressing their feelings.  In short that some
of the impact    of the disaster had      to be suppressed or
repressed.

Thirdly, Sheffield was the first to the tragedy, but not the
prime victim.    The prime victims were Liverpool, or rather
Merseyside.   No Sheffield people died.  Maybe in Sheffield we
felt it unfair to deal with our feelings, when people in
Merseyside were suffering so much more than we were.  The fact




                            -   6   -
that nobody in Sheffield died,      meant that there was no
justification for grieving. Dealing with our shock and horror
seemed out of place when others were dealing with grief.


We also     have to accept the possibility that people did not
need them because they were well able to cope - with informal
and counselling support.

So, the resources, the support counselling and debriefing
resources made available, far outstripped the need.   If we got
it wrong, thank goodness we got it wrong that way round instead
of providing too little.   But maybe we have to ask if what was
offered, was offered in the right way, and was made easily
available without stigmatising people.

We have all had an experience of some sort as a result of the
tragedy of the 15th April.   Let us pool our resources and come
up with some positive proposals.

             WHAT HELPS PEOPLE COME TO TERMS WITH A DISASTER?


               —Given by Rod O m e r a Clinical Psychologist at
             St. John's Hospital, Lincoln, who has worked with
           disaster victims from troops in the Falklands Islands
                  and the Red Arrows crash in Lincolnshire.


      Reflecting on the title set for this presentation, I double
      checked with the printed programme and was relieved to find its
      final element to be a question mark.         This is its most
      important element because it captures a core parameter of any
      disaster scenario and its aftermath, namely uncertainty and its
      derivative 'the situation of not knowing'.

      Even if the above question can be formulated with clarity, it
      does not follow that one substantive answer can be given.
      Although research publications are informative, as are the
      subjective reports of survivors, victims and emergency services
      personnel, the approximate truth is 'we do not know'.

      It   follows  that   a  Conference   Title  of   'Disaster  and
      Opportunity' with its three commendable objectives is as timely
      as it is courageous and constructive in intent in that it
      anticipates that experiences gained since May will be relevant
      to future critical incidents.   It probably will be, but it may
      not. Only time will tell!

      It has not been my intention to be nihilistic in raising these
      points of uncertainty by way of introduction.    From the start
      the point has to be made that in disaster scenarios and their
      aftermaths there are very few certainties.  'Not knowing' rules
      supreme and to pretend otherwise is to run the risk of not
      being appropriately prepared.    Our starting point has to be
      that the business of to-day is of 'risk reduction, damage
      limitation and anticipation of a variety of scenarios'.    Like
      the people referred to in the title of this presentation, we
      all have to come to terms with having foundations set as
      uncertainties,  rather  than the seductive allure of false
      certainty.

      At this moment many among you may be reacting with contained
      outrage.  Being directly involved in the Hillsborough Disaster
      you  know   and  can   speak  of  real,  intense,  overwhelming
      experiences that are facts.   To speak of uncertainties and not
      knowing may seem   to devalue what was and is very real indeed.
      Coming from someone who was not involved in the unfolding
      scenario, may lead you to take the position 'he was not there
      so what can he possibly know about what it is like'.

      To which I might say 'your outrage is understandable and indeed
      because I was not at Hillsborough or did not help in its
      aftermath, I cannot possibly know what is was really like'.



                                 -   8   -




'OS
Such a statement is, I should think, familiar to you.        You
probably said so yourself to those you have had to help these
last five and a half months.   But as an outsider I should wish
to make the point that at this juncture, the needs of survivors
of Hillsborough and those of ourselves who have helped in its
aftermath fuse.  On all counts there is distress, more or less
intense   emotional   reactions    followed   by   psychological
readjustments,  the main purpose of which is to integrate
experience and minimise the probability of something like this
ever happening again.    So my initial comment   to the question
asked in the title is that what helps most in    coming to terms
with a disaster is that which engenders a personal sense of
having minimised the probability of any event having such a
turbulent impact again.

We live our lives according to implied probability estimates
centred on the balance between our predictable impact on the
outside world and the outside world impacting on us.   Shorthand
terminology refers to this as our 'assumptive world': and is
demonstrated by Janoff Bulman et al (1985);      coming to terms
with major critical events is about rebuilding shattered
assumptions about personal safety, the world as an ordered and
meaningful place, and how we perceive ourselves in it.        By
implication;  coming    to terms with   disasters   cannot mean
resuming life as it was experienced pre-disaster.   Furthermore,
the impact will,     for a significant number,     be lifelong;
influencing future adjustment for the better in some instances,
but also for what is felt to be the worse by the victims, their
families, their friends, and those who try to help in           a
professional capacity.

Since the publication of a paper in Br. J. Med. Psychology
earlier this year, authored by McFarlane, it is unwise to turn
to professional therapists alone for reliable guidance about
what helps survivors come to terms with disasters.    Reviewing
the literature reveals almost equal claims for effective
interventions whichever therapeutic approach or approaches are
employed.   But in no instances is it firmly established that
the documented changes would not have occurred anyway; nor is
follow-up data reported to tell us if the effects are lasting.

McFarlane's point should be noted and remembered because it is
a key premise for disaster planning and making sense of what
this Conference is about.   To understand his conclusion paves
the way for considered action!   It is a perversity of truth to
make out that McFarlane's paper confirms the position of those
who say there is no point       in making provision for the
psychological casualties of disasters.   The reason is this: to
demonstrate a consistent therapeutic impact arising from a
specific intervention, research methodology requires that the
natural stepwise course of psychological reactions following
disasters is known.   Only then can valid comparisons be made.
At current state of knowledge the natural course of these
reactions is not formally described.    Assessing the impact is



                            -   9   -
      therefore fraught with difficulties if we stipulate that the
      type of criteria promulgated by this author always have to be
      met.

      Clinical impressions now borne out by published studies of
      survivors and victims indicate that rather than there being one
      natural course to these psychological reactions, there is great
      diversity in the stages and duration of the processes that lead
      to problem resolution; if at all.      Significantly, Percante
      (1989) publishes data indicating that relapses are a common
      feature of the long term course of people's reactions.     This
      may occur against a background of significant progress and
      treatment gains.

      The implications of what has been said so far is as follows:

      1)   In planning provision for those psychologically distressed
      and traumatised by disasters it is essential to anticipate a
      broad range of needs.  To assume a 'typical' response requiring
      a pre-determined response is a most likely recipe for failure.

      This first premise informs planners of the necessity to think
      in terms of flexible, mobile responsive provision which is not
      encumbered   by professional  lobbying,   self  interests  and
      convenience.

      2)   Those involved in responding to psychological and social
      needs should demonstrate a capacity to respond discriminatively
      depending on what stage of a post disaster scenario is
      unfolding and what the particular experiences of each and
      every survivor have been.

      3)   Resource  allocation must    be  long   term and    flexibly
      arranged to respond to changing needs.         Apart from being
      prescribed for the relapse phenomenon referred to earlier, the
      first long term studies of psychological and physical after
      effects   of  major   critical   incidents    repeatedly   reveal
      chronicity of psychological reactions.     Van der Ploeg (1989)
      tried to follow up five hundred subjects involved in major
      incidents in Holland during the 1970s and early 1980s.     Of the
      two hundred and seventy who could be contacted, one in three
      were found to be still encumbered by negative effects resulting
      from their critical experiences, continue to evince the type of
      psychological reactions as make up the criteria for PTSD, are
      generally anxious and suffer a variety of medical symptoms.
      One in eight were found to be still in need of aftercare and
      help, even though nearly all of them had had several contacts
      with professional health care workers in the period following
      the major incidents.

      4)    A fourth premise in planning is that monitoring of all
      implicated should be possible in order to identify target
      populations   most at  risk   for  chronicity of   adjustment
      difficulties.

1)   Those who do not have supportive families or who fail to
maintain open communication with family or friends resulting in
social isolation.


2)   Those who seem unable to establish new activities and
interests that are useful in replacing intrusive thoughts and
behaviour problems.


3)   Those who develop a lifestyle of frequent and regular
change seemingly without ever giving themselves time to adjust
and settle.


4)   Those  who    do not   establish    career or life goals
appropriate to their skills and abilities; and fail to   plan
methodically for the achievement of these.


5)   Those who    develop   recurrent        medical   complaints   or
generalised deterioration in health.


6)   Those who resort to long           term courses of prescribed
medication, socially sanctioned         substance misuse or illicit
drug taking.


7)   Those with histories of subsequent stressful life events.


8)   Those who    fail  to  eliminate  stereotypic       or    phobic
behaviours related to the original trauma.


With such chronicity of problems and high levels of need we may-
well ask ourselves 'what helps people come to terms with a
disaster?'   As I have argued, helping professionals have not
demonstrated a particular acumen for coming up with any one
answer; and may indeed be misguided and will lose credibility
in trying to do so.  In our failures we are not alone.

Inconveniently, at least one in three of those who experience
disasters do not know what helps them come to terms with what
they have been through.     It follows that as far as this
substantial population of survivors is concerned, there is no
known answer to the question that is the title of this
presentation.   At best we know of some of the factors that
lessen the impact of a traumatic event, and those that magnify
its effect; but the prerequisite to coming to terms with
disasters is not known.  Herein lies a major challenge which,
as it is systematically addressed, will in time fundamentally



                           -   11   -




                                                                         ICO.
         re-orientate our approach    to victims   of   disasters and health
         services in general.

         The closest we can come to getting an answer to the question is
         to ask survivors what they have done to come to terms with the
         emotional  and   psychological  sequelae    of a disaster.          A
         consistent pattern of sometimes antithetical (but co-existing)
         coping mechanism is now emerging from our attempts to learn
         from survivors.     Of particular importance are avoidance of
         reminders of the incident, involvement in relationships that
         are close and supportive, being involved in altruistic and self
         esteem enhancing activities,     plus s y m b o l i c repetitions of
         disaster experiences followed by the development of a sense
         that  the   traumatic  situation is mastered          psychologically
         (Kleinman 1989).

         Social support and self efficacy have become the buzzwords in
         recent studies of how survivors cope.       Findings are as one
         would expect in that it tells us retrospectively about what the
         copers do to cope; with social support being most strongly
         associated   with a favourable prognosis.      But the answer to
         helping isnot simply the mobilisation    of   personal or social
         supports as such.

         Crucially important   is how a survivor uses      that support
         (Solance 1989) although Murphy (1988) has demonstrated that
         long term health outcome at three years post disaster is most
         strongly associated with social network size. All the pointers
         indicate that social support is to be preferred to isolation,
         but the remedial processes of those networks depend strongly on
         the way a person makes use of it.       Whilst there is strong
         indication for showing feelings, expressing distress and grief
         with others for a time after a disaster, those who seem to come
         to terms with traumatizing incidents later mobilise help from
         their support network to contain disruptive psychological
         reactions usually through practical assistance with what is
         required to deal with life (Solomon 1989).

         Insights gained from survivors of disasters provide some clues
         as to what is helpful and what is not.   Such distinctions guide
         those who are involved in care after critical incidents.    When
         it works it works and that is fine.    But it leaves the others
         in a state of unrelenting chronicity of problems.            New
         approaches   are required   drawing on   thealready  existing
         knowledge   about the diffent elements   of   the PTS reaction;
         namely intrusive re-experiencing, hyperarousal and numbing.
         Once the functions of these disparate elements are understood
         from both psychological and biological perspectives, we can
         start  to contemplate    a considered response     to the very
         prevalent problem of 'not coming to terms with disasters'.    We
         are privileged in being presented with an opportunity to
         determine the direction of a new and emerging speciality.     If
         we can come to terms with so much 'not knowing', contain our
         fears whilst trying to limit psychological damage, we shall,



                                      -   12   -




i   oy
from our position of recognising how close we are to the
personal disaster of losing our precarious grip on life, be
inspired by new insights, greater honesty with ourselves, our
clients, and our colleagues.  This has to be the practice from
whence we develop our knowledge of what helps people come to
terms with disaster.

             DEVELOPING OUR RESPONSE TO DISASTERS


         -Given by Jo Wright a Clinical Psychologist in
      Derbyshire, who played a leading role in mobilising
           support and counselling services following
                 the Ml plane crash at Kegworth.

1. INTRODUCTION.


The task of this paper, as I see it, is to move on from Rod and
Bryan's discussion of the general effects of disasters on
people, to look, in a very real and practical way, at what we,
both as individuals, and as service planners and implementers,
do when the district in which we work, experiences what may be
defined as a MAJAX or major incident.   The theme of this paper
will explore the nature of the phenomena of a disaster, its
short and long term effects on survivors and will then move on
to focus primarily on how we can effectively structure our
responses to such disasters and what are our needs, and others,
as supporters.

Before we start, I would like to pause for a moment and
consider: why me? Why JO WRIGHT?        We probably all asked
ourselves that question at some point in the course of our work
with survivors.  Quite simply, the 'plane from the Ml aircrash
landed in my patch and, since disasters are known to produce
severe psychological sequelae in some victims, and I had worked
previously with trauma victims on a small scale, it never
occurred to me not to be involved.       That latter phrase is
probably echoed in the minds of most of us at this Conference.

So what is it, what is it about disasters and disaster work
that makes it so unique?    Disasters by their very definition
are vast,   unexpected,  overwhelming,   life changing events,
whether they be man-made or natural.   We can plan our response
to them but we can never predict exactly when or how they will
happen.  The characteristics of a disaster mean that one very
easily and rapidly feels overawed by the course of, and the
size of the events, and can begin to feel 'out of control'.
The key characteristic of this feeling may be seen to” arise
because one is dealing with a novel experience

-   demanding immediate action
    demanding unusual thought and action
    demanding a reassessment of how one sees oneself as a
    person and as a professional/lay professional
-   the psychological constructs which one uses to make sense
    of the world suddenly don't fit anymore.

The aim of Conferences such as this is designed to help us
address the issues which tend to reduce these feelings of
helplessness and powerlessness, and to help us regain some sort



                           -   14   -
of control as helpers so that we can begin to offer an
effective service of support to other survivors.      Regaining
appropriate control is not the same as bottling up your
feelings and carrying on.   It requires that one gets in touch
with and begins to accept in oneself that in many situations we
are powerless, we are helpless, but that we can be of most help
by first being there and sharing with the feelings of survivors
rather than denying these same feelings in ourselves and trying
to appear super competent.

An illustration may be helpful at this point.   It is similar to
trying to define the difference between sympathy and empathy.
Sympathy is like standing on the shore watching a man drowning
in the sea and throwing him a life belt.     Empathy is walking
into the sea and taking him the life belt. However, if the sea
is very rough (as in a disaster) or he is in a very bad way, or
you are simply in need yourself or not a very good swimmer, you
need to make sure you are well anchored and supported yourself
or you may both be swept away.   This scene emphasises that we
need to be both aware of our strengths and limitations, to give
ourselves and others permission not to be involved in disaster
work, and to see that we are appropriately supported if we are
to be effective.

Who then needs the support and help following a disaster and
what helps us to identify that they, or we, are in need?
Taylor's categorisation (1987) emphasises the fact that not
only are the passengers of a 'plane, ferry or train, the
victims of a disaster, but also included must be the relatives
and the staff, i.e. ourselves.   We are also victims, or as I
like to phrase it more positively, survivors, in any disaster-
This categorisation emphasises to us that we have to include in
any disaster plans support for ourselves, as well as support
for those who have been more usually defined as survivors.

Taylor's categorisation is based on the victims' involvement,
function, culpability and the degree of self-control.     For
example, he would define as primary victims those who were
directly involved in the disaster, such as the passengers on
the 'plane, and the crew.   Secondary victims will be seen as
the relatives.   Tertiary victims are those going out to the
crash site, emergency services, those of us who are involved
and on duty on the night of the aircrash, or the night of the
Hillsborough tragedy.

2.   POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.


His categorisation ties up quite closely with the incidence of
PTSD or post traumatic stress disorder in these people, with
30% to 40% primary victims usually experiencing PTSD, and 10%
to 20% of secondary and tertiary victims experiencing this
degree of disorder.    He also emphasises, as do most people
working in this field, that most peoples1 reactions to trauma
and  to disaster are perfectly normal.        They are normal
reactions to an abnormal situation.     Their reactions may be
acute, chronic, or often their reactions are in fact delayed
and may not occur until some 6 months after the disaster.

I don't want to spend a lot of time in this talk discussing
post traumatic stress disorder in any depth.   However, I feel
that it will enhance our understanding of the types of support
that both we and the other survivors of the disaster need, and
to also help us to understand what is going on for ourselves
and these other people, if we briefly look at what is known as
post traumatic stress.

Most people's reactions to post traumatic stress are actually
perfectly normal.    They are reactions which seem to stem from
this primary sense of loss of control, which occurs when one is
met by such a vast and overwhelming and unexpected event.   Such
reactions we can probably remember feeling ourselves, such as
fear, helplessness, sadness, longing for everything just to be
okay,   then   feeling guilty and    shameful  for having   such
feelings.    Some memories will be very beautiful, some memories
will be very painful and are re-experienced in nightmares and
flashbacks.     These reactions may be pulled together into a
definition of post traumatic stress disorder, which is defined
as occurring, if these reactions persist, for a greater time
than 4 - 6 weeks.

That is the general agreed time of onset for the disorder, but
obviously we have to be aware that different people will have
encountered different experiences in the course of a disaster,
and so the onset of their reactions may differ.


Defining post traumatic stress disorder:

i)     Recognising an abnormal stressor in   the event.

ii)    Re-experiencing the trauma in terms of flashbacks,
        dreams or a re-enactment of the event triggered by an
        associated stimulus.

iii)   Numbing of responsiveness, people and feelings.

iv)    Two or more of the following, which were not present
        pre-trauma: sleep disturbances, guilt, memory problems,
        hyper-alertness, avoidance of event triggering
        stimuli, intensification of symptoms in the presence of
        such stimuli.

People who are experiencing post traumatic stress disorder
usually feel very vulnerable and very out of control, very
insecure and may be seen to 'overreact' to situations which
normally wouldn't trouble them at all. They may have problems
with processing new information, with concentrating on or



                          -   16   -
remembering things.    They often feel very ambivalent about
social relationships and familial relationships. On the one
hand wanting to be with the family, and desperately needing to
feel supported and held, and at another level, not feeling
emotionally   strong   enough   to   cope   with   the   normal
responsibilities and practical problems related to having a
family or having any close relationship.     These symptoms of
post traumatic stress disorder affect not only individuals, but
also organisations.

Disasters have an uncanny habit of highlighting for ourselves
as professionals, as a health service or a social service, hov
vulnerable  we   really  are  and  whether  we   are   actually
functioning as an effective and healthy unit.     They tend to
highlight whether we really are taking care of our staff on a
day to day basis, whether we are letting staff be able to have
emotional problems and be able to deal with them in the normal
run of events of their job.

They highlight how good our communication is, how good we are
at helping each other out, how bound we are by red tape and
regulations.   We think back to the disasters that all of us
have been involved in.  Many people have said to me how amazed
they were at how things were able to happen so smoothly and so
quickly, very differently to how they functioned on a normal
day to day basis.

These are some of the positive opportunities that we can drav
out of disasters.

Both for organisations, and for individuals, there appeared
from the work that I did during the Ml aircrash, and from the
work  that  other people    have  done  in response   to other
disasters, certain mediating factors that appeared to encourage
the development of post traumatic stress disorder in any
individual.  As yet the results of systematic research fail to
agree about which mediating factors, if any, may be significant
in helping people to avoid developing post-traumatic stress
disorder.

The mediating factors which my research and my clinical work
with disaster victims suggested were important were:

i)     what the person experienced
ii)    how satisfied they felt with what they did
iii)   the role that they took
iv)    their personality, especially their stability with theii
        own identity.
v)     their personal history, and
vi)    the support which they received, particularly the
        professional support and whether they felt that they
        were appreciated.
      The second, fourth and sixth of this list of mediating factors
      were shown to be particularly significant in the research which
      I undertook following up the health, social and emergency
      services staff who were involved with the Ml aircrash.

      3.   DESIGNING AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE.

      Turning now to look in detail at how we can design an effective
      service for responding to major disasters, we need to look at
      two levels.   Firstly, our role as an individual counsellor or
      supporter, what we can do and what we need in order to do that
      work   effectively,  and   then  secondly,   to  look   at  the
      organisational level, at the macro level, as it were, in terms
      of how such services can be developed.

      In order to do this I think it may help if I first of all give
      you a very quick scenario of what happened on the Ml aircrash,
      in order to give you something to 'flesh out1 the issues I will
      bring up later.

      The Ml aircrash, as many of you are aware, happened on the
      night, 20.26 to be precise, of 8th January 1989.   On the night
      when the 'plane landed on the embankment of the Ml, the people
      who were involved immediately were the emergency services from
      Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire, fire, ambulance
      and police, council workers from Leicestershire, volunteers,
      social workers and lay counsellors, local chaplains, hospital
      services, and administrative and management services.      Also
      involved because of the very nature of the crash, were airport
      flight   and  traffic   control  staff,  and   British  Midland
      engineers.

      The residents of Kegworth and Ml motorists and other general
      miscellaneous helpers that we may class together as the general
      public.

      Survivors were taken firstly to Nottingham, then Derby, then
      Leicester.  Telephone lines were set up so that relatives could
      be contacted or could contact the airline.   The practical needs
      and support needs of the British Midland and medical staff, the
      social workers and chaplains were paramount on that night as
      were the needs of the emergency staff.     British Midland care
      centres were set up in the 3 main hospitals and in identified
      hotels manned by British Midland staff 24 hours a day.

      Victims were then allocated to specific wards in each hospital
      so that they would get some support from each other and
      particularly the families could support each other.     Social
      workers offered support for 24 hours a day for one week to the
      relatives and to the survivors.      They then decreased that
      support to normal cover after the week.  A named social worker
      was allocated to each family.

U3>
            By day 2 an action group had been formed of the principal
            social worker, the clinical managers in A & E, the chaplain,
            and myself as the clinical psychologist.      The aim of this
            action group, SAG (Support Action Group), as that is how we all
            felt after a day or two, was to identify the needs of the
            survivors and the staff - the short term and long term needs.
            Such functions included setting up help-lines and a drop-in
            service, organising on-going support tailored to meet people's
            different needs, gathering and disseminating information from
            other disasters, liaising with other districts and planning the
            general services that were needed.
    I
             From this brief resume of what we did during the Ml aircrash,
            hopefully it becomes clear that what is demanded in this
i           situation is for a consistent, varied, and a well co-ordinated
             response.   Basically, a response which enables the survivors
             (speaking of survivors as those involved on the 'plane or the
             ferry, the relatives, the staff, and the general public and
             press) which enables people get back in control in some way and
             to enable them to achieve a more balanced view of what is going
             on and what they can do to effect some change in the situation.

[           A.   WHAT ARE THE NEEDS?

             I   think  it   is  appropriate   for us   to     deal   with the
             organisational issues first, and what we as an organisation, as
             a District    Health Authority,    or Social   Services,   or as
             emergency services, need to do in these situations and then to
|           turn to considering our role as individuals in disaster work.

             As part of regaining this balanced view of the situation, we
             need to look at, firstly, who      is in need, what levels of
             support they need, what types of support they need, and how we
             can prioritise our input. We need to look at what resources we
             have, both professional, lay, practical and management.     We
I           need to look at what back-up is available, and who supports
             these supporters. We need to establish what perspective we are
             working with, whether on the short term or the long term and
    I       how long is long term.        These issues are important in
    I'      determining the type of support which we give and also what
             practical help, such as relief of staff and support of those
             staff, is required.
        I
            Considering firstly, who is in need?   As I have said already,
            the people in need can be all termed survivors, but if I now
            use the term survivors in its more traditional sense of those
            who are actually involved on the disaster vessel, we need to
            address the demands of those actual people who were physically
            involved in the disaster, also the relatives, and the staff of
            various categories, both clinical, managerial, and whether they
            were involved directly or indirectly in the disaster.

            When turning to consider the resources that we may have
            available for responding to these peoples' needs, we need to

                                                                                 11 +
     look at what staff are available, which staff wish to be
     involved and which staff do not.    I will consider it in more
     detail later on, but it is very important to consider whether,
     and how, staff wish to be involved, also what are their skills
     and limitations, so that we gain an idea of what resources are
     available for use in disaster work.

     Staff back up and relief is an often neglected issue in
     disaster planning.   It is essential to incorporate into ones
     disaster plans, some sort of support for the supporters,
     because when one is met by the immediacy of the situation, it
     tends to be the supporters who are forgotten in terms of giving
     them support.

     In order to work out how to organise the support it is
     necessary to have an idea of the basic needs people have in
     response to post traumatic stress.    We need to differentiate
     between therapeutic needs and counselling needs.      For most
     people what they will need is what is called a debriefing
     session, which enables them to talk about what they have been
     through, and to gain some perspective about their experiences,
     to put it into place within the personal constructs that they
     have of their normal everyday life.  For other people they will
     need counselling, i.e. an opportunity to work on issues related
     to trauma in more detail.   For other people still, the trauma
     of coping with the disaster will highlight other psychological
     'unfinished business' which is around for them, and they may
     need more time to actually have some sort of formal therapy to
     deal with these issues.  It is very important as supporters and
     as planners of the services in response to trauma, that we
     differentiate between these types of needs, because we are
     there first and foremost, to deal with people's response to the
     trauma, and we need to be clear about how it is appropriate for
     us to continue supporting a person, and when to refer them on
     to another agency.

     So looking at people's needs in response to stress,   these can
     be seen as A main needs:

     1)   An opportunity to acknowledge the stress       itself,  to
     acknowledge that they have actually gone through something that
     is very stressful, very abnormal and it is actually perfectly
     okay if they are finding it difficult to deal with, i.e. a
     legitisimisation of their feelings and restoring of their sense
     of control,   It is actually alright to feel out of control,
     because this is a novel and an overwhelming situation.

     2)   A safe place, or safe space, within which to legitimise
     these feelings to restore their sense of control, and to feel
     that somebody is just there in it with you.         That is an
     important phrase because as supporters we very much tend to
     feel  that we should be getting on and doing something,
     particularly if we are not used to dealing with people in a
     severely traumatised state, which not all of us are on a day to




                               -   20   -




lu
day basis.   Just to be there with the person, to listen, and
stand with them in the horror of their situation, even if we
cannot begin to understand really how they feel.

     In this respect, when talking about restoring the persons1
sense of control, it is important that we are trying to restore
the actual person's sense of control, and not so much the
counsellors' sense of control, so that we enable them to stay
with the chaos of their situation, and don't too quickly try
and get it all sorted out and all nice and neat and tidy.

3)   To help them to explore and make sense of the variety of
the feelings which they may be experiencing and to identify
which ones are important to them.      This will depend on the
person's own personal perspective of the situation, and the way
in which they construe it within their own life experiences:
how traumatic they find the disaster.     For example, a little
old lady had her house burgled.  She didn't appear to be at all
traumatised by this experience.   What was important to her was
the fact that her budgie was okay.     If the burglars had hurt
her budgie, that to her, would have been a trauma.

A)   To help the people to explore both the short term and long
term options for support, by differentiating whether theix
needs are trauma-related, or whether they have an agenda of
other psychological needs which they may wish to seek help for.
This exercise can be very empowering to the person concerned
because it helps them to begin to see that they are not totally
out of control, they are not going mad, which is a very
important thing to say to people.    It may be the first time
that they have actually needed to talk to somebody formally
about their feelings.   It is important to give the person the
option of whether they decide to deal with the topics which may
suggest that they need further therapy or not.    That is their
decision.  We don't all have to get beautifully sorted out, as
we are all well aware of I hope.

So those are the basic needs.  Numbers (1) and (2) will tend to
be dealt with in debriefing sessions.  Debriefing sessions have
been acknowledged by other people working in the field of
disaster to be useful, as they bring together people wifh
shared experiences, (not necessarily the same professionals),
so they can talk about what they have been through and gain
some   group support and group permission to be feeling as
unsettled as they are.

I hope it becomes a little bit more evident from what I have
said so far, that the needs of people are very similar, but
also, are very different, because of how the individual person
perceive the trauma for themselves is a unique experience.  For
this   reason we need to arrange a variety of support services,
that    can hopefully tap  into the needs of the individual.
Certain individuals may feel very overwhelmed by the whole
situation.   Others may find themselves experiencing almost no
reaction at all, and that can be equally frightening.     Some
people may feel that they need to share in a group or to talk
on a telephone.   Other people may feel that they want to talk
to somebody on an individual basis in the flesh.

It is important also to be aware of the natural resources that
there are in certain communities.   We have been very fortunate
in a way so far that things like Locherbie and the Ml aircrash,
and Hillsborough, have happened to people who actually have a
very strong community spirit, and very supportive atmosphere
within their culture anyway.   The Irish and the Liverpudlians
are renowned for their community support, and the way that they
share together and pull together in difficult situations.    It
might have been very different if the 'plane had crashed on a
London suburb.

One may also need to differentiate between the needs of the
staff and the needs of the survivors, because the staff may not
feel comfortable using the support services which have been
arranged for the survivors, because they may feel that they
have to be strong, be supportive, with the survivors and
relatives.

I am not saying what we did in Derby was the perfect model.
What we did there was to differentiate between the survivors'
needs and the relatives' needs, and those of the staff.  In the
short term we supported the survivors by attaching a social
worker to each patient and each family, so that they could get
to know somebody and go through their experience with them.
From working with people in traumatised situations in the past,
we realised that a very important factor is information,
particularly for the relatives, because if you tell a patient
anything,   they are going to forget it if they are in a
traumatised state. They take in very little of what you say to
them.   Therefore, we quickly designed and disseminated to all
persons involved, both a leaflet and a letter helping them to
begin to understand and make sense of what they may be
experiencing.

Each of the survivors was assessed psychologically and given a
letter to enable them to seek long term follow-up in their own
home base, both from a social worker and, if it was felt
necessary, a psychologist.    It is important to remember that
when somebody goes back home, the marvellous social worker at
the hospital, the marvellous counsellor, suddenly it becomes
'oh no, I don't need a social worker': the old stigma comes up.
So it is important to be able to give the person a fairly open
letter which they can take to their GP and be able to seek the
sort of help that they feel comfortable with once they have
gone back home.    We cannot assume that the help which they
wanted in hospital will be the same that they will feel
socially comfortable with when they get back to their home
base.
5.   STAFF NEEDS.

Looking now at the staff needs, what we tended to do was to
identify groups of staff with similar experiences, as, unlike a
psychotherapy group, where it is useful to have people of
different experiences to work against each other, it became
very rapidly clear that people needed to share with staff who
had similar experiences, even if they were not of the same
profession, for example, the Flying Squad that went out to the
crash site, ward and A & E staff.    It is important to ensure
that we do not assume that anybody is okay, and that we make
sure that all the personnel involved at all levels are aware of
the support services that are being offered.   We also tried to
tailor the support offered to each individual         situation.
Therefore, in A & E I just hung around in a little back room
down by the loos, in fact for several lunchtimes, and people
could say to their colleague, 'I'm popping down to the l o o 1,
and in fact come down and see me!

For people in the theatre, something had to be slightly more
formalised because of the practicalities, and also because the
staff wanted to come together as a group, to talk about what
they had experienced.     As well as debriefing and drop-in
sessions,  a drop-in centre was     established off the main
hospital site, and a staff helpline was set up.

An example of the need to tailor your support to the individual
situation, is highlighted by the help-line in Kegworth, which
was virtually unused,     because  the community automatically
converted the usual community activities, such as evening
classes. WI meetings etc, into therapeutic support groups.    We
need to be aware of this when we are planning services.      The
aim of all these short term support groups and short terra
resources, such as help-lines and leaflets etc, is really to
normalise, label and clarify peoples' experiences for them, and
to reassure    them about    their  reactions  and   experiences
themselves, and to identify those who may need possible follow-
up.

What we have now done in Derby as a result of the Ml aircrash
is first of all to put psychology and         social work and
counselling into the district MAJAX plans.     They need to be
there so that the support agencies are alerted on Day One about
the disaster and can begin to activate the planned services.

We have also now a clear planned network of services and
responsibilities, splitting up the load of the original SAG
group, so that we differentiate between the short term needs of
survivors and relatives, and the needs of staff, and the wider
needs, such as those of the press etc.

So what we now have is two groups who automatically come into
action within 24-48 hours of the disaster happening.




                           -   23   -




                                                                   118
       The first one is called PRIG (Patient and Relative In-Patient
       Group), co-ordinated by the principal social worker, chaplain,
       the in-patient management, and a representative from the lay
       bodies.  Their task is to deal with the support required by the
       patients and relatives in hospital in the first few days and
       weeks following the disaster.

       The second group is the old SAG group (Support Action Group),
       and the remit of that group is to deal with staff support,
       support for the general public, (which we had to really put
       aside during the Ml aircrash), and the long term follow-up of
       the survivors.

       That group will be headed up by a psychologist like myself,
       again a social work representative, a representative from the
       chaplaincy, and clinical managers.  We have to tailor the sort
       of response that we have to a disaster to both the political
       and practical structure of the district in which we work.    I
       know from colleagues working in Sheffield, that Sheffield has
       two main social services centres, and therefore it was very
       different from Derby, where we could co-ordinate everything at
       one centralised body.

       Those sort of things need to be looked at before a disaster
       happens so that you can make provisions for getting round the
       practical and political obstacles in a district.

       6.   ORGANISING SUPPORT.

       So then drawing together this section, there are some main
       issues which we need to consider when designing our response to
       a disaster.   Firstly, how should be organise the support, for
       example,   we  have   a large  number   of  social  workers  in
       Derbyshire, but there is only one of me, and there aren't that
       many other psychologists either.    It would have been totally
       impractical for me to say I will do it all, I will do all the
       hands-on work.    We need to recognise each others roles and
       responsibilities and resources.      For example, how do you
       involve psychiatry, since you are wanting in the first few days
       to normalise the experience for people.    Maybe they should be
       brought in more long term.

       How do you prioritise?  We in Derbyshire, had to put the needs
       of the general public to one side because we were so short
       staffed.      In   some   situations   particularly, like   in
       Hillsborough, that wouldn't be possible.

       How do you work together because in a disaster you are suddenly
       pulled together very intimately in a way that you probably are
       not on a day to day basis in a job? How do we work within each
       others roles and within each others boundaries? How do we deal
       with the fact that we are being pushed into a very novel
       situation where we may feel very deskilled, and where the
       survivors and staff who have needs, may be pushing us to be a



                                  -   24   -




11*1
friend as well as a professional? How do we organise the co­
ordination and the communication of this massive operation? In
Derbyshire we organised everything through the hospital based
control centre and the support action group.        But it was
essential to keep everybody very closely informed so that
people felt wanted, needed, and useful.

Finally,  very importantly, when designing these      services,
should we be pro-active or reactive?         The research has
suggested that it is more appropriate to be pro-active, that
the response for people if you just offer a reactive service,
can often be very low because generally as health and social
service professionals and other professionals and lay bodies,
we do not give ourselves permission to have psychological
needs.   That suggests to me something about the training of
ourselves as professionals, and that is something which we can
look at as a long term need for people who may be involved in
the future in disasters.  We need to create a climate where it
is okay to have needs, psychological as well as practical and
professional needs, so that we actually create a more whole and
healthy member of staff, who is therefore more stable and able
to deal with the trauma of a disaster, more effectively and
competently.

Training needs to be in terms of staff self-awareness groups,
teaching staff basic counselling skills and also staff support
groups to help them deal with everyday stresses of their jobs.

7.   PERSONAL ISSUES.

Having spent some time on the organisational issues, I think it
is now important if we just quickly home down on looking at
ourselves, and to ask ourselves some basic questions. (Not
something we all often like to do is it?) All of us here today
have been involved in some sort of disaster work.    This paper
may be being read by people who are being pro-active in terms
of planning their districts1 response to a disaster.  Therefore
I think as a health or social service or emergency staff
professional or a lay person, we need to ask ourselves some
basic questions.

Firstly, am I the right person to be involved?    What do I see
my role as, what do others see my role as, how should we and
can we be involved, and where is my support coming from?
Factors that appear to help people cope with dealing with
disasters as supporters, are a clear role identity;     knowing
your limitations and when to be involved and when not to be;
having a clear therapeutic identity so that you know what you
feel competent and comfortable to do, and know where to refer
people on to; being strong and able to work independently.

A history of loss related work also helps and to be aware of
whether you are at a position in your life to effectively use
your own experience of loss.



                          -   25   -




                                                                  12D
One characteristic which I would feel is imperative is a good
sense of humour.   Some of the humour that goes round on these
occasions is distinctly disgusting, as we all know, but it is
actually very important to be able to have that slightly
bizarre perspective on what is after all a very bizarre
situation to find ourselves in.

Also, what is very helpful is an ability to be helpless, to
have   spent  some  time  getting  in   touch   with your own
helplessness, and to be able to just be    there.

We also need to look at our motivation. Why do we want to     get
involved?  To look at our other commitments.     Have we actually
got the time to be practically involved? To see whether we are
authorised, to be involved and to look at whether we have got
the knowledge about what is helpful to do or less helpful to do
in   these  situations:     knowledge  of   PTSD,   knowledge  of
counselling skills.   All those are important factors.

It is important not to feel powerless if you do not have the
knowledge or may be you are not a psychotherapist. In these
situations, as I hope has become clear from this paper, a lot
of people just need someone to be there to just listen.      We
need those sort of people who can use their humanity and use
their natural caring and empathy to give people that initial
support.  There will be a need for deeper therapeutic work, not
for everybody, so don't think that just because you have not
got the knowledge and the higher level therapeutic skills, that
you cannot be of use in these situations.

In working in a disaster environment we often find ourselves,
very much pushed into roles that maybe we do not always feel
comfortable with, faced by survivors and by professionals.   So
we need a clear role identity, so that we do not jump in on our
initial enthusiasm and then find ourselves very at sea, either
because we have overstepped our professional boundaries, or
have overstepped our own personal skills and limitations.  And,
as I said before, if you are going to be involved, make sure
that you are appropriately supported.

If you are going to be involved, it is useful to have an idea
of what to be looking for when trying to respond to the needs
of a survivor.

8.   ASSESSING SURVIVORS' NEEDS.

Therefore, I want to run down a few points for assessing        a
survivor, things to look out for, things to be aware of:

1)    Being aware of the period of the sense of trauma.   How
      long is it since the trauma?

2)    The story of the trauma: what sort of things a person has
      been through, looking for amnesias, areas where the person



                            -   26   -
      cannot remember things which may be things that are
      particularly painful to them.   Also it is useful to gauge
      what defence systems a person is using and what sort of
      symptoms are they experiencing.

3)    Listen to the way they relate their story, and LISTEN,
       don't prompt too much because you can alter the way
       someone tells the story. Do they speak of feelings very
       impotent? Look for signs of efficacy and mastery which
      will help the person to begin to understand and make sense
       of their experience more?

A)    How they describe themselves as a person, do they see
      themselves as someone who generally copes or not? Do
      they see themselves as somebody who is allowed and is
      given permission by themselves to have feelings and have
      needs?

5)    Perceived support networks.

6)    Perceived social networks.

      They may actually be in a very         loving family but may not
      be able to perceive themselves         as able to use that
      support as they do not want to         share the experiences they
      have gone to with somebody who         is close to them and upset
      them.

7)    Look for the symptomology of PTSD.  The severity of their
      reactions and the types of reactions should give you an
      idea of whether they are getting a very rapidly disordered
      reaction, or whether they are actually getting just a
      normal reaction to an abnormal situation.

8)    What victim classification group         do they fall   into?

9)    How the family is working together:   istheperson   being
       supported, is the family a family that over-reacts to each
       others feelings and needs, or are they a very distant
       family who never talk about how they feel?

10)   The attitude of their workplace.  This can be very
      important in determining whether the person feels that
      they can give themselves permission to have time off work,
      if necessary.

The   sort   of  stages   are    shock,    realisation,    defence,
acknowledgement, and adaptation.    In the      first stage shock,the
psychological reaction is usually       one     of numbness andlow
anxiety, but the person's protective defences help them to not
realise fully what has happened to them.      In that situation as
a supporter, you mainly have to be very practical and give them
information and support.   Quite often, because a person isn't
wanting to share their experience       at that  time, your main



                              -     27   -
support is going   to be   to       the relatives,   helping   to   relieve
their anxiety.

In the second stage of realisation, the person begins to come
in touch with what is happening to them, and feels very
overwhelmed by symptoms of anxiety. In that situation, one is
trying to help them to make sense of what is going on for them,
both for the family and for the survivors, and to help them to
check out their feelings and explore options for the future in
a very concrete way.

The third stage is defence.    The person often retreats into
themselves again with a strong element of denial and the
setting of unrealistic goals for themselves, because they do
not really want to face the reality of what is going on.  It is
important  at  this   stage  to help   them to explore    their
aggression, and to help the family to understand how the person
at this stage may often reject their family, even if the family
is very supportive.

Those are the three stages that one is likely to go through
with a survivor if one is dealing with them in the short term,
such as when they are in the hospital.

If one decides to be more involved with the long term support
of survivors, whether with people on board the disaster vessel
or with staff, the person may begin to move on to the stages of
acknowledgement and adaptation.   In the acknowledgement phase,
they often become very depressed and start asking questions,
like, 'why me'? and to comment 'I don't want to live anymore',
'I don't care'.    At this stage, one is really helping the
person to begin to grieve, to get in touch with their loss, to
get in touch with their sense of abandonment and their anger
and their frustration, about the fact that their life will
never be the same again, because your life never is the same
again after this sort of experience.      You are helping the
person to begin to make those new adjustments.

At the final stage of adaptation, you are strengthening the
persons' self-concept, and helping to develop a more positive
attitude to the change that they have had to go through.

 I would say that all the way through this process, one needs to
 be aware of termination issues, because you will find that it
 is very hard to let go and it is very hard to get them to let
.go.   It is important to be able to begin to move people on,
 particularly in the last couple of stages, so that they do not
 feel that getting better is a punishment (in that they lose
 you), but that getting better is a positive thing and that they
 actually want to get better.   It is important to be aware that
 you may actually find it very hard to let go, and to want to
 hang on to the person longer than is actually healthy for them.

9.   CONCLUSION.

To wind the strands of this presentation together, I hope it
has become clear from this paper that disaster work and
organising and planning a response to a disaster, is both an
exciting and a challenging exercise.  Something that challenges
us as the organisation, but something that also challenges us
very intimately and very personally, and makes us look at
ourselves in a way that maybe we have never done during the
course of our training.   It can enable us to develop a degree
of awareness, both in a professional sense and a personal
sense, and to develop a degree of awareness in other people,
(their capabilities and their needs), as well as an awareness
of ourselves as a district and as an organisation, (what things
we as a district found particularly hard to deal with, or feel
that we are particularly skilled in).

The point I would like each of you to take away from today is
that disasters don't need to be disastrous. They can be, as I
emphasised at the beginning of this talk, opportunities to be
used as a catalyst to enable both management and ourselves to
be clinicians, to recognise both our own and our clients'
psychological  needs  on    an everyday   basis, and to  make
appropriate provision for these needs.

Yes, disasters do plunge us into very abnormal and very massive
situations of need, but basically you are dealing with personal
traumas.

Yes, social traumas, yes, social and shared experiences, but
personal traumas;     and   we are   all dealing with personal
traumas, whether at management level or at clinical level, on a
day to day basis by the very virtue of the nature of our jobs,
whether we are paid for those jobs or not.

One of the good things that has come out of the Ml aircrash, is
that management and clinical staff are beginning, maybe for the
first time in a way, to actually look realistically at what
their psycho-social needs are;      to look at issues of staff
stress and staff counselling;      to look at how we deal with
trauma victims, such as road traffic accident victims, or
people who are dying, or people who are having to cope with
major life changes, such as contracting a serious illness, or
having an amputation, both in the short term and the long term
on a day to day basis.      In the last few years we have made
great strides in the clinical situation at least, in terms of
who we can save, and who we can help medically.   We need to be
aware  that as professionals,     and as people who are lay
professionals, we are dealing with whole people, and therefore
what I hope has come out of the horror and the series of
disasters which this country has had to experience in the past
few years, is much more of an awareness of that whole person on
a daily basis in a normal way.    That we as people have a wide


                            -   29   -




                                                                  124
variety of needs, and that we as districts, both health and
social services, need to be making provision and to plan to
meet those needs more effectively.
                      FEEDBACK FROM GROUP WORK


THE INITIAL GROUP: THE EXPERIENCE OF HILLSBOROUGH.

BRIEFING.

Participants were      invited to break up     into   five multi­
disciplinary groups    with the following brief:

To share their experiences and feelings of being involved       in
the disaster at the initial weekend and subsequently.


Discussion focused on the experiences of members of the group
which were perhaps inevitably very varied.   There were still
many raw emotions which were expressed throughout the group's
activities, and amongst these feelings were:

A sense of unreality
The need just to be there
Not knowing what to do became a great equaliser
Sharing feelings with someone else
There to do a job, though some became personally involved
Feeling rejected and underused
Acting on automatic 'pilot'
Too many people, no-one to organise them
The important role played later linking up with each other and
allowing tears
Anger at the disruption in one's life
Anger centred on the police
Anger centred at the media
The wider implications of crowd behaviour
The triggering off of other losses and grieving
The awfulness of the event
Frustrations of not being used and needed at the time
The need to talk - counselling needs came later
Overwhelming sadness for people who had lost their relative,
and young people who saw a dead body for the first time
Feelings of guilt and relief at not being able to be there

Following this session of 'unpacking' feelings and experiences,
some groups discussed the constructive points of offering a
service in a more acceptable way.        There was a lot of
reinforcement of views for example on:

The needs to:

- Introduce some order as soon as possible.
- Identify key personnel, buildings, specific rooms to whom
  volunteers can report.
- Reduce elements of 'competitive caring'.


                               -   31   -




                                                                     \Uo
- Structure support, necessary for people involved.
- Publicise list of the support systems available - very
  necessary.

Each  service's   emergency   plan         should   complement   a   major
disaster plan.

It is envisaged that all services will review their disaster
plans and this presents an ideal opportunity to incorporate new
points.  All managers 'on the day' were under great strain and
difficulty in the environment they were in.     The feeling of
being unnecessary and inadequate is perhaps part of the normal
process to this type of disaster.      In any emergency , the
public look to the police initially in expectation of knowing
what to do.     Problems inevitably arose when orders were not
promptly received and reluctance among police officers to act
on their own initiative were noticed by many. The need for a
predesignated co-ordinator was felt to be essential, though
inevitably communication is difficult within the midst of a
major disaster.


THE SECOND SESSION:   HOW TO COME TO TERMS WITH DISASTER.

BRIEFING.

Participants were invited to identify both what they were able
to achieve in supporting others, and what hindered them in
doing so.

Many useful issues were discussed during this session and
groups focused on helping each other and recognising the need
of volunteers and professionals involved in a disaster.  There
becomes an ideal opportunity for services to work together and
support each other.

a) Coming to terms with the disaster and helping others could
be aided by:

     Good family support enabling us to survive.

     Relationship of trust enabling detailed or upsetting
     material to be released.

b)   Difficulties were recognised in talking about the disaster
     because of the confidential nature and the press
     sensationalism.

     Those 'pushed* into debriefing sessions found them very
     helpful, most of all at the beginning.

     It was felt that you needed to be made to attend rather
     than just to be given a telephone number.




                              -   32   -
     Good to have some groups for the same levels within
     organisations.

-    Need to have many different ways of approach.

1.   TOGETHERNESS IN G R I E F .

This was felt to be important and problems were recognised for
those who do not have a team base or who live alone and are
unable to share the ritualisation of death.           This was an
important aspect.       The great advantage of the Hillsborough
Disaster was that the Football Clubs are a community of their
own, and therefore more supportive and more able to express
necessary     ritualisation,     for  example,  the   use  of  the
Hillsborough Stadium as a 'shrine' for people to express their
emotions and feelings for several weeks following the disaster.
Several families who were unable to communicate verbally were
able to express emotions and start their journey to recovery by
expressing their feelings in different ways.       For example the
placing of football shirts, photographs and flowers, had been
an important part of people's grief process.     The importance of
the need to symbolise during bereavement, when perhaps people
find it difficult to articulate was expressed as a major part
of the recovery process.      The media have an important part to
play, but have to avoid intrusion into personal grief.      It was
felt that there has to be space for anger to be expressed, and
m u c h anger was expressed towards the media in response to this
disaster.

Disaster planning must allow flexibility for Counsellors to be
available during the whole process, and to help the bereaved to
focus their grief and also to recognise where grief processes
are becoming abnormal.   Each bereavement is recognised as being
individual.     A  disaster   of  this   scale  presents  another
opportunity  to   improve   liaison,   support and    bereavement
services for all agencies.       Football fans come with both
experience of previous losses and also with their own strength.

Affirmation by superiors became increasingly important, helping
u s to 'forgive ourselves'.

2.   COUNSELLING SU P P OR T .

Among the initial needs of the bereaved, the groups identified
the following: just 'being there', physical support (holding),
w ar m t h and blankets,    provision of food and hot drinks -
counselling      becomes more important     later. Help needs to be
visible and flexible.         What helps one person doesn't help
another.       It is harder to approach a telephone number than a
person.       Importance of access in the mortuary.      The need of
families to touch the body and say goodbye.         Cues for support
m u s t be taken from the sufferers themselves who decide what
they need and the response must be flexible and match that
need.      Honesty is essential and mistakes must be admitted.   The



                                   - 33 -


                                                                       12?
       role of the Counsellor is to help          people to work through
       feelings.    Groups can help people        to share feelings when
       sensitively led.

       This disaster has presented many opportunities for widening
       people's understanding and for changing training of young
       recruits in uniformed services.   People in shock need guidance.
       Uniforms and labels can help this.   A special bonding of people
       occurred as a human response to the chaos and confusion around.
       Many found that the special memories of caring acts by people
       in extremely   stressful  situations help them to value      the
       experience.   Long term needs must be recognised.      Immediate
       help was very beneficial in preventing long term trauma.     The
       vulnerability of helpers was recognised.

       THE THIRD SESSION:   ISSU E S .

       BRIEFING

       Participants invited to identify how counselling and support
       services can be organised for an effective response to a
       disaster.


       1.   FORWARD PLANNING.


       Discussion ranged over extremes,     but views were not held
       evenly.   An extreme minority view was expressed that since all
       disasters are unique in some sense, and since none may recur in
       Sheffield on the Hillsborough scale, forward planning is time
       consuming and can be counter-productive.    The majority seemed
       to hold the view that there are identifiable contingencies,
       needs and roles for which contingency planning can be carried
       out.    It was also pointed out that such organisations as
       hospitals, airports and coal mines provide useful models, since
       all have such contingency plans from which useful lessons can
       be drawn.

       The stated needs included:

       a)  The need for all agencies, statutory or voluntary, to be
       involved in formulating plans,    co-ordinating resources and
       expectations.   There was a recurring theme that the police
       always seem to be isolated from any such activities, yet are a
       key to the whole issue.

       b)  The need for those representing the agencies involved to be
       of sufficiently accredited level of experience or rank to be
       able to speak for their agency at planning meetings, and to
       have local knowledge.

       c)    The need to appreciate that what might be taken for granted
       in   ordinary circumstances of accidental or natural death, in



                                         - 34 -

a °\
which only one or two people are involved, required special
planning where the numbers are greater, e.g. emergency road
signs  guiding   people  to hospitals   or mortuaries,   proper
facilities for large numbers waiting to view and identify
bodies, handling huge diversities of information, co-ordinating
use of and support for Counsellors and helpers in a non­
competitive way.

d)  The need for a structure by which all agencies know to whom
they should report - how they can be found, and what will be
expected of them,    with built   in flexibility for the co­
ordinator.

2.   INFORMATION.

There was a lot of comment on the need for, and the usefulness
and importance of a central information point,where information
could be fed in, collated, and given out.     Whilst some felt
this would work better in theory than practice, others felt it
must be better than a structure in which:

a)  Some agency representatives, b oth statutory and voluntary,
were told by people who did not k now what was happening that
they were not needed, and went away.

b)  Representatives, both voluntary and professional,    chased
from one site to another, trying to find a role.

c)  Important information or requests which could have been
useful to people in charge at certain points, could not be
passed to them, since those with this information could not
gain access.

d)  There was delay in setting up emergency telephone lines or
radio contact because of ambiguities over who was responsible,
placing of equipment.

e)  People who could and should take initiatives that would be
helpful fail to do so through fear of making mistakes or
ambiguity over authority.

SUPPORT.

It was felt that a number of useful conclusions could be drawn:

1.   COUNSELLING.

a)  The initial needs of relatives of victims are more physical
than psychological, e.g. creating     structures and order are
essential, and indicate that those in authority have relatives'
needs in mind and look after them.

b)   As much attention needs to be given to those waiting to
view   bodies  or  injured  relatives, and recognising  their



                            - 35 -


                                                                  130
      anxieties and fears, as is given after the identification has
      taken       place.     The  physical   conditions  such  as cold  or
      overcrowding       are   as  important   in   this  as  the personal
      s u p po r t . (1)

      c) A directive approach, i.e. leaving relatives high and dry
      in ambiguous   situations   is distinctly unhelpful    in these
      situations,  and  can   affect  long-term  bereavement   health.
      Helpers from different disciplines should be attached to every
      family group and stay with them as long as necessary.

      d)    It cannot be taken for granted that all involved, even
      members         of counselling   agencies,  are  fully aware   of  the
      dynamics          and processes of grief, the needs of the bereaved to
      ritualise their loss, or the long-term effects on some members
      of emergency services, caring agencies or even T.V. viewers.
      As one professional said 'counselling is not understood in our
      se r v i c e ' .

      2.   CARING FOR C A R E R S .

      It is evident that man y carers and professionals who needed to
      debrief felt they were not able to do so because either:

      a)  The 'availability' of help required making a phone call to
      an unknown person or through a third person.

      b)  The counselling facility was intra-departmental, leaving
      some professionals fearful that seeking help would go onto
      their records and affect their career prospects.   In the case
      of the police there is an additional factor, that to seek help
      outside breaks normal disciplinary procedures.

      c)  They believe that the best way to deal with the matter is
      to try to forget about it as soon as possible.     As one (sic)
      'Counsellor' put it.   'The door on this business closed after
      the  Cathedral  service,   and  I don't   want  it   re-opened'.
      Experiences at Bradford, Dover, Kings Cross etc have shown the
      fallacy of this, with some helpers reliving their experiences
      and need to talk three, four, five years later.

                     CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


    Because disasters are unique it is impossible to plan for them
    in detail; because we have experience of an increasing number
    of disasters, we are more aware of the nature of disasters, the
    problems they create, and to the reactions - however varied
    these might be - which are common,    and enable us to predict
    some of the needs reasonably accurately.

    These    recommendations have     been    distilled   from      the
    presentations and discussions    which   took place   during    the
    Conference.

    A.   PLANNING.

    1.   The deployment of debriefing counselling and support
         services should form an integral part of the MAJAX plan
         operated by the City Council, Health Authority
         and the Emergency Services.
I
    2.   Social work, psychological and counselling services run
         by both statutory and voluntary agencies should have a
         clear role within the MAJAX plan.

    3.   Joint planning, preparation and training for a possible
         disaster should take place under direction of a pre­
         designated Co-ordinator.

         Representatives should be experienced, able to commit
         resources, and have sound local knowledge, and should be
         a consistent representative, so that effective working
         relationships can be established in the planning teams.

    A.   The plan for support services should specify with clarity
         the role, responsibilities and tasks of every agency
         involved, and what resources should be deployed to meet
         specified needs.

    5    The plan should specify where volunteers can phone or
         report in person.

    6.   The plan should separate out two main areas of activity

    a)   Short term physical and emotional needs of survivors and
         the relatives of survivors, and of those who died.

    b)   Needs of staff for relief and support
         Needs of general public
         Liaison with press
         Planning
         Staff training
         Long term follow up




                                  - 37 -


                                                                          13 Z-
INFORMATION.

A number of information lines to be set up as new numbers
from a central information point.

Information/Help-Line to be set up to tell about support
services available.

Information about likely impact of disaster on individuals
to be widely distributed.

SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS.

A range of support counselling debriefing and therapeutic
services to be made available both in the short and long
term, depending on the nature of the disaster and needs
of survivors.  The allocation of the services to be based
on an assessment of the individual needs and the short and
long term monitoring of survivors responses to the impact.

Each survivor and family to be allocated a social worker/
counsellor who will assess and monitor and be available if
needed at visits to the scene of the disaster, inquests,
public inquiry, anniversaries, police interviews, etc.

Survivors' natural social networks to be encouraged or
developed to give support, particularly in terms of
acceptance of feelings and practical assistance in
dealing with stress.

Where appropriate support groups of survivors to be
established using group workers and Youth or Community
workers.

SERVICES FOR STAFF, HELPERS, CARERS.

Separate relief support, debriefing counselling and
therapeutic services to be planned in advance including
Staff Help-Line and Drop-In centre.

Debriefing sessions to be routinely offered to all staff
and wherever possible to groups sharing a similar
experience.


Counselling and therapeutic services to be totally
independent of employing or organising agency.

Trainers and Group Workers and others to be trained in
debriefing techniques and supportive counselling.

Relevant staff to be trained in disaster work.
These   recommendations    will   be    sent  to  the   Elected
Representatives  and   Senior   Managers   of the organisations
involved in the City's Major Accident Plan, with a view to
stimulating and supporting the planning necessary to implement
the recommendations.

This report has been compiled from the addresses and group
sessions which took place at the Conference       'Disaster and
Opportunity - a reflection on the Hillsborough D i s a s t e r 1 ,
organised by the Sheffield Area Bereavement Forum, on Tuesday
October 31st 1989, at Whirlow Grange Conference Centre.


The purpose of the Day Conference, was to allow people who were
directly or indirectly involved in a helping capacity in the
Hillsborough Disaster, and the aftermath, to reflect on that
experience   in  terms  of   their  own  and   their  agencies*
contribution to alleviating the distress of those affected by
the disaster.


Then  building  on  these   reflections  they  were  given  the
opportunity to identify how debriefing, counselling and support
services can be integrated into a Major Accident Plan.


This report has been prepared as a means of communicating the
recommendations of the Conference to Members and Officers of
the Area Health Authority,     City Council,  Police and Fire
Authorities,   and  Voluntary   Organisations responsible for
preparing and reviewing Major Accident Plans.


The Conference was attended by 54 people from a wide range of
statutory and voluntary agencies, and included:



Citizens Advice Bureau
Clergy
CRUSE Counsellors
Education Department
Fire Service
Freelance Counsellors
Hillsborough Task Team
Hospital Visitors
Medico Legal Centre
Nurses, Northern General Hospital
Nurse Managers
Police Welfare Officers

   A KEYNOTE ADDRESS TO THE CONFERENCE ON THE HILLSBOROUGH
    DISASTER ORGANISED BY SHEFFIELD AREA BEREAVEMENT FORUM


  - Given by Bryan Craig a trainer and group facilitator in
     Family and Community Services Department, Sheffield.
           He was a member of the original F & C S
                  Hillsborough Disaster Team.


This address will attempt two things:

Firstly to define in general   terms our    task   for to-day,   the
focus of our attention and our energy.

Secondly to suggest, propose, encourage our approach to the
task; to begin to establish something of the emotional climate
w ith i n which we might conduct to-day's proceedings. This might
seem a rather presumptuous thing to do,        but there is some
justification in wanting to do this, because the Hillsboroug'h
Disaster had such a great impact on the City, on the people who
w ere at the match, on the workers from the emergency services,
and all the voluntary agencies, including Clergy. This is even
though all the evidence suggests that much of the personal and
collective impact of the disaster was dealt with personally and
informally.

H o w do we come together to discuss publicly a major tragedy
which took place in our community, which focused the attention
and energies of a vast number of people on the weekend of the
15th and 16th April, but which diminished gradually? Apart from
some peaks    such as the service in Sheffield Cathedral a
fortnight later, the Taylor Enquiry in Sheffield Town Hall, and
later the publication of the Report.

There has been very little collective public discussion  of the
disaster. We have undoubtedly talked about it amongst friends,
our families, informally at work, and it might have been on the
agendas of formal meetings at our workplace, but there has been
very  little collective discussion in public of the disaster in
Sheffield by Sheffield people. So how are we going to publicly
discuss such a very public disaster when we do not have the
experience of sharing our thoughts and our feelings and ideas
of people, other than those that we know.

Returning to our task first.          The visible tangible product
w h i c h the Sheffield Area Bereavement Forum wants to come out of
this      Conference,   is  some  initial  thinking,   some  initial
recommendations       about  how  counselling   services  should  be
deployed within a major accident plan.       In order to do this, we
m u s t reflect on our experience of the disaster and focus it in




                             - 3 -
     a purposeful direction.We will have the guidance of Rod Orner
     and Jo Wright to help us to do this, but it is inevitable that
     in reflecting on our experience for this purpose, we may
     surface, get back in touch with, re-experience, some of the
     feelings   that  arose  within us when we    saw  those  ghastly
     pictures on television and in the press, when we sat for hours
     wit h a grieving family at the Medico-Legal Centre, accompanying
     a distressed person looking for their friend, or relative;as we
     comforted distressed and confused relatives waiting in hospital
     for news of one of their family undergoing examination;or as we
     wa ited for hours and hours at Forbes Road, Kelvin Community
     Centre and later at Division Street and other places, being
     there ready and willing and wanting to support, to help, but
     not being needed.

     If such feelings arise within us,     then I suggest we give
     ourselves  permission, and each other permission, to share, to
     show them, to express them, as a natural and inevitable part,
     for some, of the day's experience.  It is not    the purpose of
     the day that we should unburden our feelings, but given the
     purpose of the day how can we, who are interested in
     counselling, support, befriending,how can we do anything else
     but allow some time and space, if it is needed, for     the re-
     emergence of those feelings which belong to that day.     I feel
     sure that giving ourselves this permission will enhance our
     final product, since it will be more related to the emotional
     reality of such days which might arise in the future.

     One of our responses to the disaster, and of our part in it, is
     inevitably powerlessness.     The disaster struck unannounced,
     unprepared for, as all disasters do, filling one with horror
     and pity,    fear amd compassion,    and a great desire to do
     something no matter how small, to relieve the suffering.       The
     feeling   of powerlessness,    engendered by being part      of a
     community, which could be affected so suddenly by such a tragic
     disaster, engendered by an inability to take away the suffering
     of the people that we were with, to give them back their
     friends or their family member, to 'make them better'.    But the
     reality is we made a very powerful response in Sheffield to
     that disaster.    In the Emergency Task Team, which was set up
     immediately after the weekend of the disaster,       we estimated
     that about   3,000 people   in   Sheffield,   from voluntary   and
     statutory agencies, and ordinary members of the public, either
     gave   or  volunteered  their    services   during that  weekend.
     Despite the chaos, people went to the gym to help others
     identify bodies, and to hospitals to trace relatives, to sit
     with them while they waited, went to the Medico-Legal Centre to
     accompany   family members   through    the  awful identification
     process, went to Forbes Road to receive the distressed parents
     coming from Liverpool.    There was no lack of courage, no lack
     of caring, no lack of compassion, and no lack of response.

     The only thing that was lacking, and inevitably so at that
     stage,  was  organisation and   deployment of  Counsellors,



                                 -   4   -

Befrienders, Volunteers.    So people arrived, and putting their
own distress on one side, found people who needed them and
stuck with them, realising they couldn't do anything about the
whole  situation,   the whole     disaster,  but   they   could   do
something to help one individual or two individuals or a
family, and that's    what   they    did.     The    response    was
magnificent, it was powerful, and it was more than adequate.
We also had people, waiting to be used, and to be of service.
By so doing, we converted the disaster into an opportunity, an
opportunity to serve, to heal, to support, to care, to be
with,and   to listen.   This m a y sound a strange idea, but it's
interesting to note that the Chinese word for crisis -        and by
any definition the Hillsborough Tragedy was certainly a crisis
- this word is made up of two characters.     One character means
disaster, and the other means opportunity.        Literally in the
Greek, crisis means turning-point, put another way, crossroads,
decision point.   A crisis is such an impact-full event, that it
demands a response,and we have the choice, respond to the
crisis as victims of a disaster, or with the power to respond
to it as an opportunity.

Out of respect for the dead, the 95 people who died in the
crush at Hillsborough,    out of respect for those who were
injured there, and out of respect for their families, we call
what has happened at Hillsborough a disaster.   But in Sheffield
we did not become powerless, helpless victims of those tragic
events, we turned it into a magnificent oppportunity to serve,
to heal, to support, to comfort, and to succour. All those
things we   did,  not because we     belong  to any particular
organisation, but because we are human beings, because we
cared, confronted the suffering of other human beings, and had
the confidence to do so.     We made a powerful response during
that weekend.     One Social Worker told me that at one    stage
during the Saturday night, in the gym, she became    aware  that
despite the horror and the distress of the situation, that
there was a wonderful feeling of support, care, and compassion
from one human being to another.    No bureaucracy, no forms to
fill in, everyone was equal, but with different parts to play.
She very much regretted that this expression, this feeling of
common humanity and concern, inevitably dispersed, as life
returned to 'normal'.

Immediately   following     that  weekend,   an  Emergency   Social
Services   Disaster   Task Team was     set up.     The voluntary
organisations met together.      The Clergy met together, and all
the organisations involved began to take stock of the effects
on their staff of the disaster.     Offers of support came in from
Kent, from the workers on the Zeebrugge Disaster, Bradford,
from workers on     the Football Ground Disaster, from Kings Cross,
f rom workers on    the Underground Disaster.

Arrangements were made for grieving Liverpool families and fans
to visit the ground, and to work with some of the Stewards who
h a d been working on the fatal West Stand. Support was given to



                              - 5 -
the families of the few remaining unidentified dead victims of
the disaster.    Arrangements were made to support the families
from Liverpool who attended the preliminary Inquest Hearings.
Telephone help-lines were set up.       Counselling services were
made available both for people in Sheffield, and for staff of
the various organisations who had been working in the disaster.
A tremendous amount of purposeful and effective activity took
place. But to our surprise all of the services which were set
up   after   the   event,   were   greatly  under-used,    or  more
accurately,    substantially   over-provided.     The   independent
counselling and debriefing resources made available to Family &
Community Services staff, were used only by a small minority of
those who had participated over that particular weekend.        The
phone-in and drop-in service, organised by Relate, had hardly
any   callers.      The   Sheffield   Help-Line,   operating   from
Hillsborough Library, had callers mainly wanting to know where
to send money for the Hillsborough Disaster Fund. Only a very
few were seeking help.

W hen the Emergency Disaster Task Team was replaced by the full­
time Task Team, especially recruited for the purpose, they only
handed over 23 active cases with whom they were working, and
since July, when that Team was set up, only 9 new cases had
been referred.   So we have to take account of this phenomenon.
How is it that so little demand was made on the         services
specially provided?

Let's be honest straight away,     and say that those of us who
were   setting up these    counselling,  support and debriefing
services, were assuming that because people had a need to deal
with the impact of the disaster on them, they would necessarily
seek    counselling,  debriefing,   and    the support   services
available.    In this we were quite wrong.   We miscalculated and
overestimated the need of counselling, out of our zeal to be of
value.

There are a number of reasons why these services weren't taken
up.  Firstly, two points about the culture of Sheffield.  There
is a strong history and practice of informal community support.
Pubs, clubs, coffee bars, families, neighbours, are the main
resources for those needing to deal with the impact of the
Hillsborough Disaster.

Secondly,   the  strong  macho   culture  in Sheffield,   which
particularly discourages men from acknowledging weakness and
vulnerability in expressing their feelings.  In short that some
of  the   impact of the   disaster had    to be  suppressed  or
repressed.

Thirdly, Sheffield was the first to the tragedy, but not the
prime victim.    The prime victims were Liverpool, or rather
Merseyside.   No Sheffield people died.  Maybe in Sheffield we
felt it unfair to deal with our feelings, when people in
Merseyside were suffering so much more than we were.  The fact




                            - 6 -
that  nobody  in  Sheffield  died,   meant that  there was no
justification for grieving.   Dealing with our shock and horror
seemed out of place when others were dealing with grief.


We also     have to accept the possibility that people did not
need them because they were well able to cope - with informal
and counselling support.

So,  the resources,   the support   counselling and debriefing
resources made available, far outstripped the need.   If we got
it wrong, thank goodness we got it wrong that way round instead
of providing too little.   But maybe we have to ask if what was
offered, was offered in the right way, and was made easily
available without stigmatising people.

We have all had an experience of some sort as a result of the
tragedy of the 15th April.   Let us pool our resources and come
up with some positive proposals.

       W HAT HELPS PEOPLE COME TO TERMS W I T H A DISASTER?


         -Given b y Rod O m e r a Clinical Psychologist at
       St. John's Hospital, Lincoln, who has worked with
     disaster victims from troops in the Falklands Islands
            and the Red Arrows crash in Lincolnshire.


Reflecting on the title set for this presentation, I double
checked with the printed programme and was relieved to find its
final  element to be a question mark.        This is its most
important element because it captures a core parameter of any
disaster scenario and its aftermath, namely uncertainty and its
derivative 'the situation of not knowing'.

Even if the above question can be formulated with clarity, it
does not follow that one substantive answer can be given.
Although research publications are informative,     as are the
subjective reports of survivors, victims and emergency services
personnel, the approximate truth is 'we do not know'.

It   follows  that   a  Conference   Title  of   'Disaster  and
Opportunity' with its three commendable objectives is as timely
as it is courageous and constructive in intent in that it
anticipates that experiences gained since May will be relevant
to future critical incidents.   It probably will be, but it may
not. Only time will tell!

It has not been my intention to be nihilistic in raising these
points of uncertainty by w a y of introduction.    From the start
the point has to be made that in disaster scenarios and their
aftermaths there are very few certainties.    'Not knowing' rules
supreme and to pretend otherwise is to run the risk of not
being appropriately prepared.     Our starting point has to be
that the business of to-day is of 'risk reduction, damage
limitation and anticipation of a variety of scenarios'.      Like
the people referred to in the title of this presentation, we
all have to come to terms with having foundations set as
uncertainties,  rather  than   the  seductive   allure  of false
certainty.

At this moment many among you may be reacting with contained
outrage.   Being directly involved in the Hillsborough Disaster
you  kno w  and  can   speak  of  real,  intense,  overwhelming
experiences that are facts.   To speak of uncertainties and not
knowing may seem   to devalue what was and is very real indeed.
Coming from someone who was not involved in the unfolding
scenario, may lead you to take the position 'he was not there
so what can he possibly know about what it is like'.

To w h i c h I might say 'your outrage is understandable and indeed
because I was not at Hillsborough or did not help in its
aftermath, I cannot possibly know what is was really like'.




                             - 8 -
Such a statement is, I should think, familiar to you.         You
probably said so yourself to those you have had to help these
last five and a half months.    But as an outsider I should wish
to make the point that at this juncture, the needs of survivors
of Hillsborough and those of ourselves who have helped in its
aftermath fuse.   On all counts there is distress, more or less
intense   emotional    reactions    followed   by   psychological
readjustments,  the main purpose     of which    is to integrate
experience and minimise the probability of something like this
ever happening again.    So my initial    comment to the question
asked in the title is that what helps most in coming to terras
with a disaster is that which engenders a personal sense of
having minimised the probability of any event having such a
turbulent impact again.

We live our lives according to implied probability estimates
centred on the balance between our predictable impact on the
outside world and the outside world impacting on us.        Shorthand
terminology refers to this as our 'assumptive world': and is
demonstrated by Janoff Bulman et al           (1985); coming to terms
w it h major  critical    events   is   about   rebuilding  shattered
assumptions about personal safety, the world as an ordered and
meaningful place, and how we perceive ourselves in           it.   By
implication;   coming    to   terms   with    disasters  cannot  mean
resuming life as it was experienced pre-disaster.        Furthermore,
the    impact will,   for   a significant      number,  be  lifelong;
influencing future adjustment for the better in some instances,
but also for what is felt to be the worse by the victims, theix
families, their friends, and those who try to help in                a
professional capacity.

Since the publication of a paper in Br. J. Med. Psychology
earlier this year, authored by McFarlane, it is unwise to turn
to professional therapists alone for reliable guidance about
what helps survivors come to terms with disasters.    Reviewing
the  literature  reveals  almost  equal  claims  for effective
interventions whichever therapeutic approach or approaches are
employed.   But in no instances is it firmly established that
the documented changes would not have occurred anyway; nor is
follow-up data reported to tell us if the effects are lasting.

McFarlane's point should be noted and remembered because it is
a key premise for disaster planning and making sense of what
this Conference is about.     To understand his conclusion paves
the way for considered action!     It is a perversity of truth to
m ak e out that McFarlane's paper confirms the position of those
who    say  there  is no   point  in making    provision  for  the
psychological casualties of disasters.     The reason is this:  to
demonstrate a consistent therapeutic impact arising from a
specific intervention, research methodology requires that the
natural stepwise course of psychological reactions following
disasters is known.     Only then can valid comparisons be made.
At current state of knowledge the natural course of these
reactions is not formally described.      Assessing the impact is



                               - 9 -


                                                                         /43
      therefore fraught with difficulties if we stipulate that the
      type of criteria promulgated by this author always have to be
      met.

      Clinical impressions now borne out by published studies of
      survivors and victims indicate that rather than there being one
      natural course to these psychological reactions, there is great
      diversity in the stages and duration of the processes that lead
      to problem resolution; if at all.      Significantly, Percante
      (1989) publishes data indicating that relapses are a common
      feature of the long term course of people's reactions.     This
      m ay occur against a background of significant progress and
      treatment gains.

      The implications of what has been said so far is as follows:

      1)   In planning provision for those psychologically distressed
      and traumatised by disasters  it  is essential to anticipate a
      broad range of needs.  To assume a 'typical' response requiring
      a pre-determined response is a most likely recipe for failure.

      This first premise informs planners of the necessity to think
      in terms of flexible, mobile responsive provision which is not
      encumbered   by professional   lobbying,  self  interests  and
      convenience.

      2)   Those involved in responding to psychological and social
      needs should demonstrate a capacity to respond discriminatively
      depending  on what   stage  of a post    disaster  scenario  is
      unfolding and what the particular  experiences of each and
      every survivor have been.

      3)    Resource  allocation  must  be  long   term   and  flexibly
      arranged to respond to changing needs.         Apart from being
      prescribed for the relapse phenomenon referred to earlier, the
      first long term studies of psychological and physical after
      effects    of  major   critical  incidents    repeatedly   reveal
      chronicity of psychological reactions.     Van der Ploeg (1989)
      tried to follow up five hundred subjects involved in major
      incidents in Holland during the 1970s and early 1980s.     Of the
      two hundred and seventy who could be contacted, one in three
      were found to be still encumbered by negative effects resulting
      from their critical experiences, continue to evince the type of
      psychological reactions as make up the criteria for PTSD, are
      generally anxious and suffer a variety of medical symptoms.
      One in eight were found to be still in need of aftercare and
      help, even though nearly all of them had had several contacts
      wit h professional health care workers in the period following
      the major incidents.

      4)    A fourth premise in planning is that monitoring of all
      implicated should be possible in order to identify target
      populations   most at  risk   for  chronicity of   adjustment
      difficulties.




                                 - 10 -

1)   Those who do not have supportive families or who fail to
maintain open communication with family or friends resulting in
social isolation.


2)   Those who seem unable to establish new activities           and
interests that are useful in replacing intrusive thoughts        and
behaviour problems.


3)   Those who develop a lifestyle of frequent and regular
change seemingly without ever giving themselves time to adjust
and settle.


4)   Those  who    do  not  establish    career  or  life goals
appropriate to their skills and abilities; and fail to     plan
methodically for the achievement of these.


5)   Those who    develop   recurrent     medical   complaints    or
generalised deterioration in health.


6)   Those who resort  to long       term courses of prescribed
medication, socially sanctioned      substance misuse or illicit
drug taking.


7)   Those with histories of subsequent stressful life events.


8)   Those  who   fail  to  eliminate  stereotypic    or    phobic
behaviours related to the original trauma.


W i t h such chronicity of problems and high levels of need we may
well ask ourselves 'what helps people come to terms with a
disaster?'      As I have argued, helping professionals have not
demonstrated a particular acumen for coming up with any one
answer; and may indeed be misguided and will lose credibility
in trying to do so.     In our failures we are not alone.

Inconveniently, at least one in three of those who experience
disasters do not know what helps them come to terms with what
they have been through.        It follows that as far as this
substantial population of survivors is concerned, there is no
k n o w n answer  to the question   that is the title of this
presentation.      At best we know of some of the factors that
lessen the impact of a traumatic event, and those that magnify
its effect;      but the prerequisite to coming to terms with
disasters is not known.     Herein lies a major challenge which,
as it is systematically addressed, will in time fundamentally



                            - 11 -


                                                                       lSI
      re-orientate our approach    to   victims   of   disasters   and   health
      services in general.

      The closest we can come to getting an answer to the question is
      to ask survivors what they have done to come to terms with the
      emotional   and  psychological    sequelae   of  a  disaster.    A
      consistent pattern of sometimes antithetical (but co-existing)
      coping mechanism is now emerging from our attempts to learn
      from survivors.     Of particular importance are avoidance of
      reminders of the incident, involvement in relationships that
      are close and supportive, being involved in altruistic and self
      esteem   enhancing  activities,    plus  symbolic  repetitions  of
      disaster experiences followed by the development of a sense
      that   the  traumatic   situation    is  mastered  psychologically
      (Kleinman 1989).

      Social support and self efficacy have become the buzzwords in
      recent studies of how survivors cope.      Findings are as one
      would expect in that it tells us retrospectively about what the
      copers do to cope; with social support being most strongly
      associated with a favourable prognosis.      But the answer to
      helping is not simply the mobilisation of personal or social
      supports as such.

      Crucially important   is how a survivor      uses  that  support
      (Solance 1989) although Murphy (1988) has demonstrated that
      long term health outcome at three years post disaster is most
      strongly associated with social network size.   All the pointers
      indicate that social support is to be preferred to isolation,
      but the remedial processes of those networks depend strongly on
      the way a person makes use of it.       Whilst there is strong
      indication for showing feelings, expressing distress and grief
      with others for a time after a disaster, those who seem to come
      to terms with traumatizing incidents later mobilise help from
      their  support  network  to contain   disruptive   psychological
      reactions usually through practical assistance with what is
      required to deal with life (Solomon 1989).

      Insights gained from survivors of disasters provide some clues
      as to what is helpful and what is not.     Such distinctions guide
      those who are involved in care after critical incidents.         When
      it works it works and that is fine.      But it leaves the others
      in a   state   of unrelenting   chronicity    of problems.        New
      approaches   are  required  drawing   on    the  already     existing
      knowledge about the diffent elements of the PTS reaction;
      namely intrusive re-experiencing,    hyperarousal and numbing.
      Once the functions of these disparate elements are understood
      from both psychological and biological perspectives, we can
      start   to  contemplate  a  considered    response      to  the  very
      prevalent problem of 'not coming to terms with disasters'.         We
      are privileged in being presented with an opportunity to
      determine the direction of a new and emerging speciality.          If
      we can corae to terms with so much 'not k n o w i n g ' , contain our
      fears whilst trying to limit psychological damage, we shall,




                                   - 12 -

from our position of recognising how close we are to the
personal disaster of losing our precarious grip on life, be
inspired by n e w insights, greater honesty with ourselves, our
clients, and our colleagues.    This has to be the practice from
whence we develop our knowledge of what helps people come to
terms with disaster.

               DEVELOPING OUR RESPONSE TO DISASTERS


          -Given by Jo Wright a Clinical Psychologist in
       Derbyshire, who played a leading role in mobilising
            support and counselling services following
                  the Ml plane crash at Kegworth.

1.   INTRODUCTION.


The task of this paper, as I see it, is to move on from Rod and
Bryan's discussion of the general effects of disasters on
people, to look, in a very real and practical way, at what we,
both as individuals, and as service planners and im p l e menters,
do w he n the district in which we work, experiences what may be
defined as a MAJAX or major incident.    The theme of this paper
will explore the nature of the phenomena of a disaster, its
short and long term effects on survivors and will then move on
to focus primarily on how we can effectively structure our
responses to such disasters and what are our needs, and others,
as supporters.

Before we start, I would like to pause for a moment and
consider:  why me? Why JO WRIGHT?       We probably all asked
ourselves that question at some point in the course of our work
with survivors.  Quite simply, the 'plane from the Ml aircrash
landed in my patch and, since disasters are known to produce
severe psychological sequelae in some victims, and I had worked
previously with trauma victims on a small scale, it never
occurred to me not to be involved.       That latter phrase is
probably echoed in the minds of most of us at this Conference.

So what is it, what is it about disasters and disaster work
that makes it so unique?     Disasters by their very definition
are  vast,   unexpected,  overwhelming,   life changing      events,
whether they be man-made or natural.    We can plan our response
to them but we can never predict exactly when or h o w they will
happen.   The characteristics of a disaster mean that one very
easily and rapidly feels overawed by the course of, and the
size of the events, and can begin to feel 'out of c o n t r o l '.
The key characteristic of this feeling may Ee seen to* arise
because one is dealing with a novel experience

-    demanding immediate action
-    demanding unusual thought and action
-    demanding a reassessment of how one sees oneself    as a
      person and as a professional/lay professional
-    the psychological constructs which one uses   tomake   sense
      of the world suddenly don't fit anymore.

The aim of Conferences such as this is designed to help us
address the issues which tend to reduce these feelings of
helplessness and powerlessness, and to help us regain some sort



                             - 14 -
of control as helpers so that we can begin to offer an
effective service of support to other survivors.      Regaining
appropriate control is not the same as bottling up your
feelings and carrying on.   It requires that one gets in touch
with and begins to accept in oneself that in many situations we
are powerless, we are helpless, but that we can be of most help
by first being there and sharing with the feelings of survivors
rather than denying these same feelings in ourselves and trying
to appear super competent.

An illustration may be helpful at this point.   It is similar to
trying to define the difference between sympathy and empathy.
Sympathy is like standing on the shore watching a man drowning
in the sea and throwing him a life belt.     Empathy is walking
into the sea and taking him the life belt. However, if the sea
is very rough (as in a disaster) or he is in a very bad way, or
you are simply in need yourself or not a very good swimmer, you
need to make sure you are well anchored and supported yourself
or you may both be swept away.   This scene emphasises that we
need to be both aware of our strengths and limitations, to give
ourselves and others permission not to be involved in disaster
work, and to see that we are appropriately supported if we are
to be effective.

Who then needs the support and help following a disaster and
what helps us to identify that they, or we, are in need?
Taylor's categorisation (1987) emphasises the fact that not
only are the passengers of a 'plane, ferry or train, the
victims of a disaster, but also included must be the relatives
and the staff, i.e. ourselves.   We are also victims, or as I
like to phrase it more positively, survivors, in any disaster.
This categorisation emphasises to us that we have to include in
any disaster plans support for ourselves, as well as support
for those who have been more usually defined as survivors.

Taylor's categorisation is based on the victims' involvement,
function, culpability and the degree of self-control.     For
example, he would define as primary victims those who were
directly involved in the disaster, such as the passengers on
the 'plane, and the crew.   Secondary victims will be seen as
the relatives.   Tertiary victims are those going out to the
crash site, emergency services, those of us who are involved
and on duty on the night of the aircrash, or the night of the
Hillsborough tragedy.

2.   POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.


His categorisation ties up quite closely with the incidence of
PTSD or post traumatic stress disorder in these people, with
30% to 40% primary victims usually experiencing PTSD, and 10Z
to 20% of secondary and tertiary victims experiencing this
degree of disorder.    He also emphasises, as do most people
working in this field, that most peoples' reactions to trauma
and  to disaster are perfectly normal.        They are normal
reactions to an abnormal situation.     Their reactions may be
acute, chronic, or often their reactions are in fact delayed
and may not occur until some 6 months after the disaster.

I don't want to spend a lot of time in this talk discussing
post traumatic stress disorder in any depth.   However, I feel
that it will enhance our understanding of the types of support
that both we and the other survivors of the disaster need, and
to also help us to understand what is going on for ourselves
and these other people, if we briefly look at what is known as
post traumatic stress.

Most people's reactions to post traumatic stress are actually
perfectly normal.    They are reactions which seem to stem from
this primary sense of loss of control, which occurs when one is
met by such a vast and overwhelming and unexpected event.   Such
reactions we can probably remember feeling ourselves, such as
fear, helplessness, sadness, longing for everything just to be
okay,   then   feeling  guilty  and  shameful  for having   such
feelings.    Some memories will be very beautiful, some memories
will be very painful and are re-experienced in nightmares and
flashbacks.     These reactions may be pulled together into a
definition of post traumatic stress disorder, which is defined
as occurring, if these reactions persist, for a greater time
than 4 - 6 weeks.

That is the general agreed time of onset for the disorder, but
obviously we have to be aware that different people will have
encountered different experiences in the course of a disaster,
and so the onset of their reactions may differ.


Defining post traumatic stress disorder:

i)     Recognising an abnormal stressor in   the event.

ii)    Re-experiencing the trauma in terms of flashbacks,
        dreams or a re-enactment of the event triggered by an
        associated stimulus.

iii)   Numbing of responsiveness, people and feelings.

iv)    Two or more of the following, which were not present
        pre-trauma: sleep disturbances, guilt, memory problems,
        hyper-alertness, avoidance of event triggering
        stimuli, intensification of symptoms in the presence of
        such stimuli.

People who are experiencing post traumatic stress disorder
usually feel very vulnerable and very out of control, very
insecure and may be seen to 'overreact' to situations which
normally wouldn't trouble them at all. They may have problems
with processing new information, with concentrating on or



                           - 16 -
remembering things.    They often feel very ambivalent about
social relationships and familial relationships. On the one
hand wanting to be with the family, and desperately needing to
feel supported and held, and at another level, not feeling
emotionally   strong   enough   to   cope   with   the   normal
responsibilities and practical problems related to having a
family or having any close relationship.     These symptoms of
post traumatic stress disorder affect not only individuals, but
also organisations.

Disasters have an uncanny habit of highlighting for ourselves
as professionals, as a health service or a social service, how
vulnerable  we   really  are  and  whether  we   are   actually
functioning as an effective and healthy unit.     They tend to
highlight whether we really are taking care of our staff on a
day to day basis, whether we are letting staff be able to have
emotional problems and be able to deal with them in the normal
run of events of their job.

They highlight how good our communication is, how good we are
at helping each other out, how bound we are by red tape and
regulations.   We think back to the disasters that all of us
have been involved in.  Many people have said to me how amazed
they were at how things were able to happen so smoothly and so
quickly, very differently to how they functioned on a normal
day to day basis.

These are some of the positive opportunities that we can draw
out of disasters.

Both for organisations, and for individuals, there appeared
from the work that I did during the Ml air crash, and from the
work  that  other people    have  done  in response   to other
disasters, certain mediating factors that appeared to encourage
the development of post traumatic stress disorder in any
individual.  As yet the results of systematic research fail to
agree about which mediating factors, if any, may be significant
in helping people to avoid developing post-traumatic stress
disorder.

The mediating factors which my research and my clinical work
with disaster victims suggested were important were:

i)     what the person experienced
ii)    how satisfied they felt with what they did
iii)   the role that they took
iv)    their personality, especially their stability with their
       own identity.
v)     their personal history, and
vi)    the support which they received, particularly the
       professional support and whether they felt that they
       were appreciated.

                                                                  1-5 9-
      The second, fourth and sixth of this list of mediating factors
      were shown to be particularly significant in the research which
      I undertook following up the health, social and emergency
      services staff who were involved with the Ml aircrash.

      3.   DESIGNING AN EFFECTIVE RESPONSE.

      Turning now to look in detail at how we can design an effective
      service for responding to major disasters, we need to look at
      two levels.   Firstly, our role as an individual counsellor or
      supporter, what we can do and what we need in order to do that
      work   effectively,  and   then  secondly,   to  look   at  the
      organisational level, at the macro level, as it were, in terms
      of how such services can be developed.

      In order to do this I think it may help if I first of all give
      you a very quick scenario of what happened on the Ml aircrash,
      in order to give you something to 'flesh out' the issues I will
      bring up later.

      The Ml aircrash, as many of you are aware, happened on the
      night, 20.26 to be precise, of 8th January 1989.   On the night
      when the 'plane landed on the embankment of the Ml, the people
      who were involved immediately were the emergency services from
      Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Leicestershire, fire, ambulance
      and police, council workers from Leicestershire, volunteers,
      social workers and lay counsellors, local chaplains, hospital
      services, and administrative and management services.      Also
      involved because of the very nature of the crash, were airport
      flight   and  traffic   control  staff,   and  British  Midland
      engineers.

      The residents of Kegworth and Ml motorists and other general
      miscellaneous helpers that we may class together as the general
      public.

      Survivors were taken firstly to Nottingham, then Derby, then
      Leicester.  Telephone lines were set up so that relatives could
      be contacted or could contact the airline.   The practical needs
      and support needs of the British Midland and medical staff, the
      social workers and chaplains were paramount on that night as
      were the needs of the emergency staff.     British Midland care
      centres were set up in the 3 main hospitals and in identified
      hotels manned by British Midland staff 24 hours a day.

      Victims were then allocated to specific wards in each hospital
      so that they would get some support from each other and
      particularly the families could support each other.     Social
      workers offered support for 24 hours a day for one week to the
      relatives and to the survivors.      They then decreased that
      support to normal cover after the week.  A named social worker
      was allocated to each family.




                                 - 18 -



is?
By day 2 an action group had been formed of the principal
social worker, the clinical managers in A & E, the chaplain,
and myself as the clinical psychologist.      The aim of this
action group, SAG (Support Action Group), as that is how we all
felt after a day or two, was to identify the needs of the
survivors and the staff - the short term and long term needs.
Such functions included setting up help-lines and a drop-in
service, organising on-going support tailored to meet people's
different needs, gathering and disseminating information from
other disasters, liaising with other districts and planning the
general services that were needed.

From this brief resume of what we did during the Ml aircrash,
hopefully it becomes clear that what is demanded in this
situation is for a consistent, varied, and a well co-ordinated
response.   Basically, a response which enables the survivors
(speaking of survivors as those involved on the 'plane or the
ferry, the relatives, the staff, and the general public and
press) which enables people get back in control in some way and
to enable them to achieve a more balanced view of what is going
on and what they can do to effect some change in the situation.

A.   WHAT ARE THE NEEDS?

I    think    it   is  appropriate for us  to deal  with  the
organisational issues first, and what we as an organisation, as
a    District    Health Authority, or Social   Services, or   as
emergency services, need to do in these situations and then to
turn to considering our role as individuals in disaster work.

As part of regaining this balanced   view of the situation, we
need to look at, firstly, who is in need, what levels       of
support they need, what types of support they need, and how we
can prioritise our input. We need to look at what resources we
have, both professional, lay, practical and management.     We
need to look at what back-up is available, and who supports
these supporters. We need to establish what perspective we are
working with,   whether on the short term or the long term and
how long is     long term.     These issues are important in
determining the type of support which we give and also what
practical help, such as relief of staff and support of those
staff, is required.

Considering firstly, who is in need?   As I have said already,
the people in need can be all termed survivors, but if I now
use the term survivors in its more traditional sense of those
who are actually involved on the disaster vessel, we need to
address the demands of those actual people who were physically
involved in the disaster, also the relatives, and the staff of
various categories, both clinical, managerial, and whether they
were involved directly or indirectly in the disaster.

When turning    to consider     the resources that we may have
available for   responding to   these peoples'needs, we need to



                            - 19 -
      look at what staff are available, which staff wish to be
      involved and which staff do not.    I will consider it in more
      detail later on, but it is very important to consider whether,
      and how, staff wish to be involved, also what are their skills
      and limitations, so that we gain an idea of what resources are
      available for use in disaster work.

      Staff back up and relief is an often neglected issue in
      disaster planning.   It is essential to incorporate into ones
      disaster plans,   some sort of support for the supporters,
      because when one is met by the immediacy of the situation, it
      tends to be the supporters who are forgotten in terms of giving
      them support.

      In order to work out how to organise the support it is
      necessary to have an idea of the basic needs people have in
      response to post traumatic stress.    We need to differentiate
      between therapeutic needs and counselling needs.      For most
      people what they will need is what is called a debriefing
      session, which enables them to talk about what they have been
      through, and to gain some perspective about their experiences,
      to put it into place within the personal constructs that they
      have of their normal everyday life.  For other people they will
      need counselling, i.e. an opportunity to work on issues related
      to trauma in more detail.   For other people still, the trauma
      of coping with the disaster will highlight other psychological
      'unfinished business' which is around for them, and they may
      need more time to actually have some sort of formal therapy to
      deal with these issues.  It is very important as supporters and
      as planners of the services in response to trauma, that we
      differentiate between these types of needs, because we are
      there first and foremost, to deal with people's response to the
      trauma, and we need to be clear about how it is appropriate for
      us to continue supporting a person, and when to refer them on
      to another agency.

      So looking at people's needs in response to stress,   these can
      be seen as 4 main needs:

      1)   An opportunity to acknowledge     the stress itself,    to
      acknowledge that they have actually gone through something that
      is very stressful, very abnormal and it is actually perfectly
      okay if they are finding it difficult to deal with, i.e. a
      legitisimisation of their feelings and restoring of their sense
      of control,   It is actually alright to feel out of control,
      because this is a novel and an overwhelming situation.

      2)   A safe place, or safe space, within which to legitimise
      these feelings to restore their sense of control, and to feel
      that somebody is just there in it with you.         That is an
      important phrase because as supporters we very much tend to
      feel  that we should be getting on and doing something,
      particularly if we are not used to dealing with people in a
      severely traumatised state, which not all of us are on a day to




                                - 20 -


l&-
day basis.   Just to be there with the person, to listen, and
stand with them in the horror of their situation, even if we
cannot begin to understand really how they feel.

     In this respect, when talking about restoring the persons'
sense of control, it is important that we are trying to restore
the actual person's sense of control, and not so much the
counsellors' sense of control, so that we enable them to stay
with the chaos of their situation, and don't too quickly try
and get it all sorted out and all nice and neat and tidy.

3)   To help them to explore and make sense of the variety of
the feelings which they may be experiencing and to identify
which ones are important to them.      This will depend on the
person's own personal perspective of the situation, and the way
in which they construe it within their own life experiences:
how traumatic they find the disaster.     For example, a little
old lady had her house burgled.  She didn't appear to be at all
traumatised by this experience.   What was important to her was
the fact that her budgie was okay.     If the burglars had hurt
her budgie, that to her, would have been a trauma.

A)   To help the people to explore both the short term and long
term options for support, by differentiating whether their
needs are trauma-related, or whether they have an agenda of
other psychological needs which they may wish to seek help for.
This exercise can be very empowering to the person concerned
because it helps them to begin to see that they are not totally
out of control, they are not going mad, which is a very
important thing to say to people.     It may be the first time
that they have actually needed to talk to somebody f o r m a l l y
about their feelings.   It is important to give the person the
option of whether they decide to deal with the topics which may
suggest that they need further therapy or not.    That is their
decision.  We don't all have to get beautifully sorted out, as
we are all well aware of I hope.

So those are the basic needs.  Numbers (1) and (2) will tend to
be dealt with in debriefing sessions.  Debriefing sessions have
been acknowledged by other people working in the field of
disaster to be useful, as they bring together people with
shared experiences, (not necessarily the same professionals),
so they can talk about what they have been through and gain
some group support and group permission to be feeling as
unsettled as they are.

I hope it becomes a little bit more evident from what I have
said so far, that the needs of people are very similar, but
also, are very different, because of how the individual person
perceive the trauma for themselves is a unique experience. For
this reason we need to arrange a variety of support services,
that can hopefully tap into the needs of the individual.
Certain individuals may feel very overwhelmed by the whole
situation.   Others may find themselves experiencing almost no
      reaction at all, and that can be equally frightening.     Some
      people may feel that they need to share in a group or to talk
      on a telephone.   Other people may feel that they want to talk
      to somebody on an individual basis in the flesh.

      It is important also to be aware of the natural resources that
      there are in certain communities.   We have been very fortunate
      in a way so far that things like Locherbie and the Ml aircrash,
      and Hillsborough, have happened to people who actually have a
      very strong community spirit, and very supportive atmosphere
      within their culture anyway.   The Irish and the Liverpudlians
      are renowned for their community support, and the way that they
      share together and pull together in difficult situations.    It
      might have been very different if the 'plane had crashed on a
      London suburb.

      One may also need to differentiate between the needs of the
      staff and the needs of the survivors, because the staff may not
      feel comfortable using the support services which have been
      arranged for the survivors, because they may feel that they
      have to be strong, be supportive, with the survivors and
      relatives.

      I am not saying what we did in Derby was the perfect model.
      What we did there was to differentiate between the survivors'
      needs and the relatives' needs, and those of the staff.  In the
      short term we supported the survivors by attaching a social
      worker to each patient and each family, so that they could get
      to know somebody and go through their experience with them.
      From working with people in traumatised situations in the past,
      we realised that a very important factor is information,
      particularly for the relatives, because if you tell a patient
      anything,   they are going to forget it if they are in a
      traumatised state. They take in very little of what you say to
      them.   Therefore, we quickly designed and disseminated to all
      persons involved, both a leaflet and a letter helping them to
      begin to understand and make sense of what they may be
      experiencing.

      Each of the survivors was assessed psychologically and given a
      letter to enable them to seek long term follow-up in their own
      home base, both from a social worker and, if it was felt
      necessary, a psychologist.       It is important to remember that
      when somebody goes back home, the marvellous social worker at
      the hospital, the marvellous counsellor, suddenly it becomes
      ’oh no, I d o n ’t need a social worker’: the old stigma comes up.
      So it is important to be able to give the person a fairly open
      letter which they can take to their GP and be able to seek the
      sort of help that they feel comfortable with once they have
      gone back home.       We cannot assume that the help which they
      wanted in hospital will be the same that they will feel
      socially comfortable with when they get back to their home
      base.




                                   - 22 -

5.   STAFF NEEDS.

Looking now at the staff needs, what we tended to do was to
identify groups of staff with similar experiences, as, unlike a
psychotherapy group, where it is useful to have people of
different experiences to work against each other, it became
very rapidly clear that people needed to share with staff who
had similar experiences, even if they were not of the same
profession, for example, the Flying Squad that went out to the
crash site, ward and A & E staff.    It is important to ensure
that we do not assume that anybody is okay, and that we make
sure that all the personnel involved at all levels are aware of
the support services that are being offered.   We also tried to
tailor the support offered to each individual        situation.
Therefore, in A & E I just hung around in a little back room
down by the loos, in fact for several lunchtimes, and people
could say to their colleague, ’I ’m popping down to the loo’,
and in fact come down and see me!

For people in the theatre, something had to be slightly more
formalised because of the practicalities, and also because the
staff wanted to come together as a group, to talk about what
they had experienced.     As well as debriefing and drop-in
sessions,  a drop-in centre was     established off the main
hospital site, and a staff helpline was set up.

An example of the need to tailor your support to the individual
situation, is highlighted by the help-line in Kegworth, which
was virtually unused,     because  the community automatically
converted the usual community activities,      such as evening
classes. WI meetings etc, into therapeutic support groups.   We
need to be aware of this when we are planning services.     The
aim of all these short term support groups and short term
resources, such as help-lines and leaflets etc, is really to
normalise, label and clarify peoples’ experiences for them, and
to  reassure   them about    their  reactions  and  experiences
themselves, and to identify those who may need possible follow-
up.

What we have now done in Derby as a result of the Ml aircrash
is  first of all to put psychology and social work and
counselling into the district MAJAX plans.     They need to be
there so that the support agencies are alerted on Day One about
the disaster and can begin to activate the planned services.

We  have also now a clear planned network      of services and
responsibilities, splitting up the load of the original SAG
group, so that we differentiate between the short term needs of
survivors and relatives, and the needs of staff, and the wider
needs, such as those of the press etc.

So what we now have is two groups who automatically come into
action within 2A-A8 hours of the disaster happening.
The first one is called PRIG (Patient and Relative In-Patient
Group), co-ordinated by the principal social worker, chaplain,
the in-patient management, and a representative from the lay
bodies.  Their task is to deal with the support required by the
patients and relatives in hospital in the first few days and
weeks following the disaster.

The second group is the old SAG group (Support Action Group),
and the remit of that group is to deal with staff support,
support for the general public, (which we had to really put
aside during the Ml aircrash), and the long term follow-up of
the survivors.

That group will be headed up by a psychologist like myself,
again a social work representative, a representative from the
chaplaincy, and clinical managers.  We have to tailor the sort
of response that we have to a disaster to both the political
and practical structure of the district in which we work.    I
know from colleagues working in Sheffield, that Sheffield has
two main social services centres, and therefore it was very
different from Derby, where we could co-ordinate everything at
one centralised body.

Those sort of things need to be looked at before a disaster
happens so that you can make provisions for getting round the
practical and political obstacles in a district.

6.   ORGANISING SUPPORT.

So then drawing together this section, there are some main
issues which we need to consider when designing our response to
a disaster.   Firstly, how should be organise the support, for
example,   we  have   a large  number   of  social  workers  in
Derbyshire, but there is only one of me, and there aren’t that
many other psychologists either.    It would have been totally
impractical for me to say I will do it all, I will do all the
hands-on work.    We need to recognise each others roles and
responsibilities and resources.      For example, how do you
involve psychiatry, since you are wanting in the first few days
to normalise the experience for people.    Maybe they should be
brought in more long term.

How do you prioritise?  We in Derbyshire, had to put the needs
of the general public to one side because we were so short
staffed.      In   some  situations    particularly, like   in
Hillsborough, that wouldn’t be possible.

How do you work together because in a disaster you are suddenly
pulled together very intimately in a way that you probably are
not on a day to day basis in a job? How do we work within each
others roles and within each others boundaries? How do we deal
with the fact that we are being pushed into a very novel
situation where we may feel very deskilled, and where the
survivors and staff who have needs, may be pushing us to be a



                           -   24 -
friend as well as a professional? How do we organise the co­
ordination and the communication of this massive operation? In
Derbyshire we organised everything through the hospital based
control centre and the support action group.        But it was
essential to keep everybody very closely informed so that
people felt wanted, needed, and useful.

Finally,  very importantly,   when designing these    services,
should we be pro-active or reactive?         The research has
suggested that it is more appropriate to be pro-active, that
the response for people if you just offer a reactive service,
can often be very low because generally as health and social
service professionals and other professionals and lay bodies,
we do not give ourselves permission to have psychological
needs.   That suggests to me something about the training of
ourselves as professionals, and that is something which we can
look at as a long term need for people who may be involved in
the future in disasters.  We need to create a climate where it
is okay to have needs, psychological as well as practical and
professional needs, so that we actually create a more whole and
healthy member of staff, who is therefore more stable and able
to deal with the trauma of a disaster, more effectively and
competently.

Training needs to be in terms of staff self-awareness groups,
teaching staff basic counselling skills and also staff support
groups to help them deal with everyday stresses of their jobs.

7.   PERSONAL ISSUES.

Having spent some time on the organisational issues, I think it
is now important if we just quickly home down on looking at
ourselves, and to ask ourselves some basic questions. (Not
something we all often like to do is it?) All of us here today
have been involved in some sort of disaster work.    This paper
may be being read by people who are being pro-active in terms
of planning their districts’ response to a disaster.  Therefore
I think as a health or social service or emergency staff
professional or a lay person, we need to ask ourselves some
basic questions.

Firstly, am I the right person to be involved?    What do I see
my role as, what do others see my role as, how should we and
can we be involved, and where is my support coming from?
Factors that appear to help people cope with dealing with
disasters as supporters, are a clear role identity;     knowing
your limitations and when to be involved and when not to be;
having a clear therapeutic identity so that you know what you
feel competent and comfortable to do, and know where to refer
people on to; being strong and able to work independently.

A history of loss related work also helps and to be aware of
whether you are at a position in your life to effectively use
your own experience of loss.
One characteristic which I would feel is imperative is a good
sense of humour.   Some of the humour that goes round on these
occasions is distinctly disgusting, as we all know, but it is
actually very important to be able to have that slightly
bizarre perspective on what is after all a very bizarre
situation to find ourselves in.

Also, what is very helpful is an ability to be helpless, to
have   spent  some  time   getting  in  touch  with your own
helplessness, and to be able to just be there.

We also need to look at our motivation.    Why do we want to get
involved?  To look at our other commitments.     Have we actually
got the time to be practically involved? To see whether we are
authorised, to be involved and to look at whether we have got
the knowledge about what is helpful to do or less helpful to do
in   these  situations:     knowledge  of   PTSD,   knowledge  of
counselling skills.   All those are important factors.

It is important not to feel powerless if you do not have the
knowledge or may be you are not a psychotherapist.     In these
situations, as I hope has become clear from this paper, a lot
of people just need someone to be there to just listen.      We
need those sort of people who can use their humanity and use
their natural caring and empathy to give people that initial
support.  There will be a need for deeper therapeutic work, not
for everybody, so d o n ’t think that just because you have not
got the knowledge and the higher level therapeutic skills, that
you cannot be of use in these situations.

In working in a disaster environment we often find ourselves,
very much pushed into roles that maybe we do not always feel
comfortable with, faced by survivors and by professionals.   So
we need a clear role identity, so that we do not jump in on our
initial enthusiasm and then find ourselves very at sea, either
because we have overstepped our professional boundaries, or
have overstepped our own personal skills and limitations.  And,
as I said before, if you are going to be involved, make sure
that you are appropriately supported.

If you are going to be involved, it is useful to have an idea
of what to be looking for when trying to respond to the needs
of a survivor.

8.   ASSESSING SURVIVORS' NEEDS.

Therefore, I want to run down a few points for assessing        a
survivor, things to look out for, things to be aware of:

1)    Being aware of the period of the sense of trauma.   How
      long is it since the trauma?

2)    The story of the trauma: what sort of things a person has
      been through, looking for amnesias, areas where the person



                            - 26 -
      cannot remember things which may be things that are
      particularly painful to them.   Also it is useful to gauge
      what defence systems a person is using and what sort of
      symptoms are they experiencing.

3)    Listen to the way they relate their story, and LISTEN,
       d o n ’t prompt too much because you can alter the way
       someone tells the story.     Do they speak of feelings very
       impotent? Look for signs of efficacy and mastery which
      will help the person to begin to understand and make sense
       of their experience more?

A)    How they describe themselves as a person, do they see
      themselves as someone who generally copes or not? Do
      they see themselves as somebody who is allowed and is
      given permission by themselves to have feelings and have
      needs?

5)    Perceived support networks.

6)    Perceived social networks.

      They may actually be in a very    loving family but may not
      be able to perceive themselves    as able to use that
      support as they do not want to    share the experiences they
      have gone to with somebody who    is close to them and upset
      them.

7)    Look for the symptomology of PTSD.  The severity of their
      reactions and the types of reactions should give you an
      idea of whether they are getting a very rapidly disordered
      reaction, or whether they are actually getting just a
      normal reaction to an abnormal situation.

8)    What victim classification group    dothey fall into?

9)    How the family is working together:   is theperson being
       supported, is the family a family that over-reacts to each
       others feelings and needs, or are they a very distant
       family who never talk about how they feel?

10)   The attitude of their workplace.  This can be very
      important in determining whether the person feels that
      they can give themselves permission to have time off work,
      if necessary.

The   sort   of  stages   are    shock,    realisation,   defence,
acknowledgement, and adaptation.    In the first stage shock, the
psychological reaction is usually       one of numbness and    low
anxiety, but the person’s protective defences help them to not
realise fully what has happened to them.      In that situation as
a supporter, you mainly have to be very practical and give them
information and support.   Quite often, because a person isn’t
wanting to share their experience at that time, your main



                               - 27 -



                                                                     16#
        support is going   to be   to    the relatives,   helping   to   relieve
        their anxiety.

        In the second stage of realisation, the person begins to come
        in touch with what is happening to them, and feels very-
        overwhelmed by symptoms of anxiety. In that situation, one is
        trying to help them to make sense of what is going on for them,
        both for the family and for the survivors, and to help them to
        check out their feelings and explore options for the future in
        a very concrete way.

        The third stage is defence.     The person often retreats into
        themselves again with a strong element of denial and the
        setting of unrealistic goals for themselves, because they do
        not really want to face the reality of what is going on.  It is
        important  at   this  stage  to help   them to explore    their
        aggression, and to help the family to understand how the person
        at this stage may often reject their family, even if the family
        is very supportive.

        Those are the three stages that one is likely to go through
        with a survivor if one is dealing with them in the short term,
        such as when they are in the hospital.

        If one decides to be more involved with the long term support
        of survivors, whether with people on board the disaster vessel
        or with staff, the person may begin to move on to the stages of
        acknowledgement and adaptation.    In the acknowledgement phase,
        they often become very depressed and start asking questions,
        like, 'why m e ’? and to comment ’I don't want to live anymore’,
        ’I d o n ’t care’.   At this stage, one is really helping the
        person to begin to grieve, to get in touch with their loss, to
        get in touch with their sense of abandonment and their anger
        and their frustration, about the fact that their life will
        never be the same again, because your life never is the same
        again after this sort of experience.        You are helping the
        person to begin to make those new adjustments.

        At the final stage of adaptation, you are strengthening the
        persons’ self-concept, and helping to develop a more positive
        attitude to the change that they have had to go through.

         I would say that all the way through this process, one needs to
         be aware of termination issues, because you will find that it
         is very hard to let go and it is very hard to get them to let
        .go.   It is important to be able to begin to move people on,
         particularly in the last couple of stages, so that they do not
         feel that getting better is a punishment (in that they lose
         you), but that getting better is a positive thing and that they
         actually want to get better.   It is important to be aware that
         you may actually find it very hard to let go, and to want to
         hang on to the person longer than is actually healthy for them.

9.   CONCLUSION.

To wind the strands of this presentation together, I hope it
has become clear from this paper that disaster work and
organising and planning a response to a disaster, is both an
exciting and a challenging exercise.  Something that challenges
us as the organisation, but something that also challenges us
very intimately and very personally, and makes us look at
ourselves in a way that maybe we have never done during the
course of our training.   It can enable us to develop a degree
of awareness, both in a professional sense and a personal
sense, and to develop a degree of awareness in other people,
(their capabilities and their needs), as well as an awareness
of ourselves as a district and as an organisation, (what things
we as a district found particularly hard to deal with, or feel
that we are particularly skilled in).

The point I would like each of you to take away from today is
that disasters don't need to be disastrous. They can be, as I
emphasised at the beginning of this talk, opportunities to be
used as a catalyst to enable both management and ourselves to
be clinicians, to recognise both our own and our clients’
psychological  needs   on  an  everyday  basis, and  to make
appropriate provision for these needs.

Yes, disasters do plunge us into very abnormal and very massive
situations of need, but basically you are dealing with personal
traumas.

Yes, social traumas, yes, social and shared experiences, but
personal traumas;     and we are all dealing with personal
traumas, whether at management level or at clinical level, on a
day to day basis by the very virtue of the nature of our jobs,
whether we are paid for those jobs or not.

One of the good things that has come out of the Ml aircrash, is
that management and clinical staff are beginning, maybe for the
first time in a way, to actually look realistically at what
their psycho-social needs are;     to look at issues of staff
stress and staff counselling;     to look at how we deal with
trauma victims, such as road traffic accident victims, or
people who are dying, or people who are having to cope with
major life changes, such as contracting a serious illness, or
having an amputation, both in the short term and the long term
on a day to day basis.     In the last few years we have made
great strides in the clinical situation at least, in terms of
who we can save, and who we can help medically.   We need to be
aware  that as professionals,    and as people who are lay
professionals, we are dealing with whole people, and therefore
what I hope has come out of the horror and the series of
disasters which this country has had to experience in the past
few years, is much more of an awareness of that whole person on
a daily basis in a normal way.   That we as people have a wide


                            - 29 -
     variety of needs, and that we as districts, both health and
     social services, need to be making provision and to plan to
     meet those needs more effectively.

                      FEEDBACK FROM GROUP WORK


THE INITIAL GROUP: THE EXPERIENCE OF HILLSBOROUGH.

BRIEFING.

Participants were      invited to break up     into   five multi­
disciplinary groups    with the following brief:

To share their experiences and feelings of being involved       in
the disaster at the initial weekend and subsequently.


Discussion focused on the experiences of members of the group
which were perhaps inevitably very varied.   There were still
many raw emotions which were expressed throughout the group's
activities, and amongst these feelings were:

A sense of unreality
The need just to be there
Not knowing what to do became a great equaliser
Sharing feelings with someone else
There to do a job, though some became personally involved
Feeling rejected and underused
Acting on automatic ’pilot’
Too many people, no-one to organise them
The important role played later linking up with each other and
allowing tears
Anger at the disruption in one's life
Anger centred on the police
Anger centred at the media
The wider implications of crowd behaviour
The triggering off of other losses and grieving
The awfulness of the event
Frustrations of not being used and needed at the time
The need to talk - counselling needs came later
Overwhelming sadness for people who had lost their relative,
and young people who saw a dead body for the first time
Feelings of guilt and relief at not being able to be there

Following this session of ’unpacking' feelings and experiences,
some groups discussed the constructive points of offering a
service in a more acceptable way.        There was a lot of
reinforcement of views for example on:

The needs to:

- Introduce some order as soon as possible.
- Identify key personnel, buildings, specific rooms to whom
  volunteers can report.
- Reduce elements of ’competitive caring’.


                               - 31 -


                                                                     i^l
     - Structure support, necessary for people involved.
     - Publicise list of the support systems available - very
       necessary.

     Each  service's   emergency   plan   should   complement   a   major
     disaster plan.

     It is envisaged that all services will review their disaster
     plans and this presents an ideal opportunity to incorporate new
     points.  All managers 'on the day' were under great strain and
     difficulty in the environment they were in.     The feeling of
     being unnecessary and inadequate is perhaps part of the normal
     process to this type of disaster.      In any emergency , the
     public look to the police initially in expectation of knowing
     what to do.     Problems inevitably arose when orders were not
     promptly received and reluctance among police officers to act
     on their own initiative were noticed by many. The need for a
     predesignated co-ordinator was felt to be essential, though
     inevitably communication is difficult within the midst of a
     major disaster.


     THE SECOND SESSION;   HOW TO COME TO TERMS WITH DISASTER.

     BRIEFING.

     Participants were invited to identify both what they were able
     to achieve in supporting others, and what hindered them in
     doing so.

     Many useful issues were discussed during this session and
     groups focused on helping each other and recognising the need
     of volunteers and professionals involved in a disaster.  There
     becomes an ideal opportunity for services to work together and
     support each other.

     a) Coming to terms with the disaster and helping others could
     be aided by:

          Good family support enabling us to survive.

          Relationship of trust enabling detailed or upsetting
          material to be released.

     b)   Difficulties were recognised in talking about the disaster
          because of the confidential nature and the press
          sensationalism.

     -    Those 'pushed' into debriefing sessions found them very
          helpful, most of all at the beginning.

          It was felt that you needed to be made to attend rather
          than just to be given a telephone number.

in
     Good to have some groups for the same levels within
     organisations.

     Need to have many different ways of approach.

1.   TOGETHERNESS IN GRIEF.

This was felt to be important and problems were recognised for
those who do not have a team base or who live alone and are
unable to share the ritualisation of death.        This was an
important aspect.    The great advantage of the Hillsborough
Disaster was that the Football Clubs are a community of their
own, and therefore more supportive and more able to express
necessary  ritualisation,     for  example,  the   use  of  the
Hillsborough Stadium as a 'shrine1 for people to express their
emotions and feelings for several weeks following the disaster.
Several families who were unable to communicate verbally were
able to express emotions and start their journey to recovery by
expressing their feelings in different ways.    For example the
placing of football shirts, photographs and flowers, had been
an important part of people's grief process.  The importance of
the need to symbolise during bereavement, when perhaps people
find it difficult to articulate was expressed as a major part
of the recovery process.   The media have an important part to
play, but have to avoid intrusion into personal grief.   It was
felt that there has to be space for anger to be expressed, and
much anger was expressed towards the media in response to this
disaster.

Disaster planning must allow flexibility for Counsellors to be
available during the whole process, and to help the bereaved to
focus their grief and also to recognise where grief processes
are becoming abnormal.   Each bereavement is recognised as being
individual.     A disaster    of  this  scale presents   another
opportunity   to  improve   liaison, support     and bereavement
services for all agencies.       Football fans come with both
experience of previous losses and also with their own strength.

Affirmation by superiors became increasingly important, helping
us to 'forgive ourselves’.

2.   COUNSELLING SUPPORT.

Among the initial needs of the bereaved, the groups identified
the following: just 'being there', physical support (holding),
warmth and blankets, provision of food and hot drinks -
counselling becomes more important later.      Help needs to be
visible and flexible.      What helps one person doesn't help
another.    It is harder to approach a telephone number than a
person.    Importance of access in the mortuary.     The need of
families to touch the body and say goodbye. Cues for support
must be taken from the sufferers      themselves who decide what
they need and the response must be flexible and match that
need.   Honesty is essential and mistakes must be admitted.  The



                              - 33 -

                                                                   \^ 3 .
role of the Counsellor is to help     people to work through
feelings.    Groups can help people   to share feelings when
sensitively led.

This disaster has presented many opportunities for widening
people's understanding and for changing training of young
recruits in uniformed services.  People in shock need guidance.
Uniforms and labels can help this. A special bonding of people
occurred as a human response to the chaos and confusion around.
Many found that the special memories of caring acts by people
in extremely stressful situations help them to value the
experience.   Long term needs must be recognised.     Immediate
help was very beneficial in preventing long term trauma.    The
vulnerability of helpers was recognised.

THE THIRD SESSION: ISSUES.

BRIEFING

Participants invited to identify how counselling and support
services can be organised for an effective response to a
disaster.


1.   FORWARD PLANNING.


Discussion ranged over extremes, but views were not held
evenly.   An extreme minority view was expressed that since all
disasters are unique in some sense, and since none may recur in
Sheffield on the Hillsborough scale, forward planning is time
consuming and can be counter-productive.    The majority seemed
to hold the view that there are identifiable contingencies,
needs and roles for which contingency planning can be carried
out.    It was also pointed out that such organisations as
hospitals, airports and coal mines provide useful models, since
all have such contingency plans from which useful lessons can
be drawn.

The stated needs included:

a) The need for all agencies, statutory or voluntary, to be
involved in formulating plans, co-ordinating resources and
expectations.   There was a recurring theme that the police
always seem to be isolated from any such activities, yet are a
key to the whole issue.

b) The need for those representing the agencies involved to be
of sufficiently accredited level of experience or rank to be
able to speak for their agency at planning meetings, and to
have local knowledge.

c) The need to appreciate that what might be taken for granted
in ordinary circumstances of accidental or natural death, in



                             - 34 -
which only one or two people are involved, required special
planning where the numbers are greater, e.g. emergency road
signs  guiding   people  to hospitals   or mortuaries,   proper
facilities for large numbers waiting to view and identify
bodies, handling huge diversities of information, co-ordinating
use of and support for Counsellors and helpers in a non­
competitive way.

d) The need for a structure by which all agencies know to whom
they should report - how they can be found, and what will be
expected of them, with built in flexibility for the co­
ordinator.

2.   INFORMATION.

There was a lot of comment on the need for, and the usefulness
and importance of a central information point,where information
could be fed in, collated, and given out.     Whilst some felt
this would work better in theory than practice, others felt it
must be better than a structure in which:

a)  Some agency representatives, both statutory and voluntary,
were told by people who did not know what was happening that
they were not needed, and went away.

b) Representatives, both voluntary and professional,     chased
from one site to another, trying to find a role.

c)  Important information or requests which could have been
useful to people in charge at certain points, could not be
passed to them, since those with this information could not
gain access.

d)  There was delay in setting up emergency telephone lines or
radio contact because of ambiguities over who was responsible,
placing of equipment.

e)  People who could and should take initiatives that would be
helpful fail to do so through fear of making mistakes or
ambiguity over authority.

SUPPORT.

It was felt that a number of useful conclusions could be drawn:

1.   COUNSELLING.

a)  The initial needs of relatives of victims are more physical
than psychological, e.g. creating     structures and order are
essential, and indicate that those in authority have relatives’
needs in mind and look after them.

b)  As much attention needs to be given to those waiting to
view bodies   or  injured relatives, and recognising   their



                            - 35 -
     anxieties and fears, as is given after the identification has
     taken place.      The  physical   conditions  such  as cold  or
     overcrowding  are   as  important   in   this  as  the personal
     support.(1)

     c) A directive approach, i.e. leaving relatives high and dry
     in ambiguous situations     is distinctly unhelpful in these
     situations,  and  can   affect  long-term bereavement  health.
     Helpers from different disciplines should be attached to every
     family group and stay with them as long as necessary.

     d)  It cannot be taken for granted that all involved, even
     members of counselling agencies,     are fully aware of the
     dynamics   and processes of grief, the needs of the bereaved to
     ritualise their loss, or the long-term effects on some members
     of emergency services, caring agencies or even T.V. viewers.
     As one professional said 'counselling is not understood in our
     service'.

     2.   CARING FOR CARERS.

     It is evident that many carers and professionals who needed to
     debrief felt they were not able to do so because either:

     a) The 'availability' of help required making a phone call to
     an unknown person or through a third person.

     b) The counselling facility was intra-departmental, leaving
     some professionals fearful that seeking help would go onto
     their records and affect their career prospects.   In the case
     of the police there is an additional factor, that to seek help
     outside breaks normal disciplinary procedures.

     c) They believe that the best way to deal with the matter is
     to try to forget about it as soon as possible.     As one (sic)
     'Counsellor' put it.   'The door on this business closed after
     the  Cathedral  service,   and  I don't   want  it   re-opened'.
     Experiences at Bradford, Dover, Kings Cross etc have shown the
     fallacy of this, with some helpers reliving their experiences
     and need to talk three, four, five years later.

                 CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


Because disasters are unique it is impossible to plan for them
in detail; because we have experience of an increasing number
of disasters, we are more aware of the nature of disasters, the
problems they create, and to the reactions - however varied
these might be - which are common,    and enable us to predict
some of the needs reasonably accurately.

These   recommendations  have     been    distilled   from      the
presentations and discussions    which   took place   during    the
Conference.

A.   PLANNING.

1.   The deployment of debriefing counselling and support
     services should form an integral part of the MAJAX plan
     operated by the City Council, Health Authority
     and the Emergency Services.

2.   Social work, psychological and counselling services run
     by both statutory and voluntary agencies should have a
     clear role within the MAJAX plan.

3.   Joint planning, preparation and training for a possible
      disaster should take place under direction of a pre­
      designated Co-ordinator.

     Representatives should be experienced, able to commit
     resources, and have sound local knowledge, and should be
     a consistent representative, so that effective working
     relationships can be established in the planning teams.

A.   The plan for support services should specify with clarity
     the role, responsibilities and tasks of every agency
     involved, and what resources should be deployed to meet
     specified needs.

5    The plan should specify where volunteers can phone or
     report in person.

6.   The plan should separate out two main areas of activity

a)   Short term physical and emotional needs of survivors and
     the relatives of survivors, and of those who died.

b)   Needs of staff for relief and support
     Needs of general public
     Liaison with press
     Planning
     Staff training
     Long term follow up
INFORMATION.

A number of information lines to be set up as new numbers
from a central information point.

Information/Help-Line to be set up to tell about support
services available.

Information about likely impact of disaster on individuals
to be widely distributed.

SERVICES FOR SURVIVORS.

A range of support counselling debriefing and therapeutic
services to be made available both in the short and long
term, depending on the nature of the disaster and needs
of survivors.  The allocation of the services to be based
on an assessment of the individual needs and the short and
long term monitoring of survivors responses to the impact.

Each survivor and family to be allocated a social worker/
counsellor who will assess and monitor and be available if
needed at visits to the scene of the disaster, inquests,
public inquiry, anniversaries, police interviews, etc.

Survivors1 natural social networks to be encouraged or
developed to give support, particularly in terms of
acceptance of feelings and practical assistance in
dealing with stress.

Where appropriate support groups of survivors to be
established using group workers and Youth or Community
workers.

SERVICES FOR STAFF, HELPERS. CARERS.

Separate relief support, debriefing counselling and
therapeutic services to be planned in advance including
Staff Help-Line and Drop-In centre.

Debriefing sessions to be routinely offered to all staff
and wherever possible to groups sharing a similar
experience.


Counselling and therapeutic services to be totally
independent of employing or organising agency.

Trainers and Group Workers and others to be trained in
debriefing techniques and supportive counselling.

Relevant staff to be trained in disaster work.
These   recommendations    will    be   sent  to  the   Elected
Representatives  and   Senior   Managers   of the organisations
involved in the City's Major Accident Plan, with a view to
stimulating and supporting the planning necessary to implement
the recommendations.

Dear Mr. Jones,
                               Sheffield Wednesday Inquiry
              In a telephone discussion with Chief Inspector Ross late
this evening,                     I discovered that p e r m ission had not been given
for representatives of the Club to enter on the Leppings Lane
end of the ground to make measurements or carry out tests.
              I must apologise most sincerely for the fact that on 17 May,
we m a d e a level survey of part of the West terrace,and that on
15 May,we carried out an experiment in which one of the exit
gates from the terrace was subjected to the test load appropriate
to a crush barrier,in order to see whe t h e r under that load the
quick release device which we designed operated easily.
              There was unfortunately a complete misunderstanding.                                                                              You
will k now that we designed shoring for the boundary wall round
the South West corner of the ground but were not able to instruct
the contractors to carry out the w o r k until we had Lord Justice
Taylor's permission.                                       When that p er m ission was given,                                          I had understood
that we n o w had freedom of access to the whole of the Leppings Lane end,
I n o w realise that that was incorrect.
              I w i s h to express my sincere a pology and to assure you that no
di s r e s p e c t was meant to your authority.
                                                                                                                Yoilrs ci nrPKg 1 \7

18 .5.1989



4 .55pm       Call from DR Nicholson to DCI Ross saying that he had
              commissioned some photographs being taken of the Leppings Lane
              end on 17.5.1989 and when the photographs had been developed he
              had noticed that Eastwoods straining rig was in place on the
              terrace.  This he found to be unacceptable.

5.00pm        Call to DR Eastwood from DCI Ross.  DR Eastwood said he had
              carried out tests on gate 3 in particular the opening device
              which had been subject to a full test load of 6km per meter
              length and he had found the gate to then open easily.  The
              equipment had been left for DR Nicholson to use.

5.10pm        Return call to DR Nicholson by DCI Ross explaining above.  DR
              Nicholson, who had with him Prof Manden asked what permission DR
              Eastwood had to do this and considered DR Eastwood to be
              interferring with evidence.

5.15pm        Call to ACC (HI) - No one without written expressed permission
              from him was allowed on terracing and DR Eastwood had not been
              given that permission.

5.20pm        Return call to DR Eastwood from DCI Ross - DR Eastwood apologised
              profusely - he understood that the terracing had been going back
              to the club and was not aware of LJT restriction.

5 .30pm       Call from DCI Ross to MR Mackrell, Secretary of SWFC.  He was not
              aware that Eastwood had in fact gained access to the terracing to
              carry out check/tests.  He was however aware that Councillor
              Chase from Liverpool City Council had attended the ground with
              others and had been over the restricted terrace.  Councillor
              Chase was in possession of a letter with Liverpool headed note
              paper saying ACC(HI) had no obection to the visit by these
              people.

5.45pm        ACC (HI) telephoned.  Chase should have had written permission to
              attend the ground. ACC was expecting a ’fax’ letter from him,
              Chase, in reply to which ACC (HI) would have ’faxed’ written
              permission.  This had not been done.

              Instruction from ACC (HI) to write three letters attached
              enforcing L J T ’s restricted access to the ground.

                Dear Dr. Eastwood

                I have been made aware that you have recently carried out tests
                on gate ’3 ’ of the Leppings Lane West stand of Sheffield
                Wednesdays Football Club ground.   I write to confirm that an
                exclusion zone has been designated by Lord Justice Taylor viz
                the West stand and access may only be gained with written
                authority.   I must point out that anyone acting in contravention
                of Lord Justice Taylors directions may be considered in contempt
                of his directions.

                 In view of the fact that you have gained access and carried out
                 certain tests it is necesssary to make arrangements to interview
                 you and those who assisted with the tests on Monday 22 May to
                 record how those tests were conducted and what results were
                 attained.




                                                                                                I

                Dear Mr Mackrell

                Can I confirm that the area of your ground previously notified by
                Lord Justice Taylor as being excluded, viz the West Stand still
                exists, and it must be considered that any person ignoring that
                exclusion order without written apporoval under my signature as
                Assistant Chief Constable could be considered in comtempt of Lord
                Justice Taylors directions.

                 I would be most grateful in these circumstances if you could ensure
                 that no further contravention of Lord Justice Taylors directions
                 are allowed to take place.

                 I am 'faxing' to you copy letters I am sending to Eastwoods and
                 Partners and Councillor Harry Chase of Liverpool City Council
                 which are self explanatory.

          Councillor Harry Chase
          Secretary,
          Liverpool City Council




         Dear Councillor Chase

         Following our conversation of 18 May respecting permission sought
         by you to attend the West stand of Sheffield Wednesday Football
         Club,  I am yet to receive a 'faxed' letter from you in order that
         I can give written authority as I explained.

         I have learned today from Sheffield Wednesday Football Club that
         you have visited the ground and in particular the West stand
         without my written authority.

         Can I remind you that access has been restricted by order of Lord
         Justice Taylor and any contravention of those directions may be
         considered a contempt.

         In view of the fact that you have taken this action into your own
         hands without my written authority it is necessary to interview
         those who attended without that permission to discuss the purpose
         of the visit and the events that took place during the visit.

         I shall        be appointing a senior officer from my Liverpool        office to
         contact        you on Monday 22 May.

         I trust in futurg that you will comply with Lord Justice               Taylors
         directions on this matter.

               The majority of barriers on the ground are contained in tlds area mostly
               consisting of typ* (a)* Failure of these barriers when it occurred, was
               due tot-
               1. corrosion - usually of tho top bracket holding the horizontal rail*
               8. veak foundations, allowing the barrier to be pulled out of the terrace,
               3* too great a span - generally in excess of 8'O'* - allowing (he

                  in tlds case occurring from bending of the posts and rakers.
                  Particulars of each failure are given In the Appendix.
                    As previously mentioned, due to the close proximity of barriers behind,
               barriers 32 to 38 were loaded to the equivalent U.D.L. of 288 lbs per foot
               run, These are type (b) and have been strengthened previously. They
               withstood the tost loads satisfactorily with the exception of barriers 37
               and 38 which faileddue to each having one span of ll,6n. Of the type (c)
               barriers (No’s, 82, 83      and 8 4 ) only one was testedand faileddue toweak
               foundations. Further testing of tlds type was not continued to avoid
               possible damage,
                    Tlie following barriers were not completely tested due to Obstructions

               At ground lovel, the barriers consisted, with one exception, of typo (a).
               Please refer to the Appendix for details of those barriers which were not
               strong enough. Harrier 126 was type (j) and withstood the test load.
               On tho suspended terracing, a tubular barrier, typo (e) has been installed
               vldch, unfortunately, was found to be inade-uate to talte the tost load,
               Excessive bending started to take place In both the rail and Bid post.
               Testing was not continued as the barrier tested vat considered to be typical
               of those in this section and we wished to avoid any unnecessary danage*
                    Barriers 125 and 127 were not completely tested due to obstructions or
               lack of terracing behind.
               Perimeter Vail.
               A section of Insitu wall wMch generally measured 3*6" high x 4* thick was
               teatod and found to be satisfactory. However, at one comer of the Spion
               Kop there is a snail section of perimeter vail tude fron precast concrete
               planlcs V thick and 12" wide, supported by 6* x 5* concrete posts, slotted
               to take the concrete planks. Previous experience on other grounds has
               ehown that this vail can withstand an equivalent U.D.t, of approximately
               3001 bs per foot run if in good condition.

                Certain part# of the fcncing guarding tho drop At the back of the Spion

                Conclusion1

                tlto ground ia veil naintolncd and the failure rate for tlie barriers la veil
                below the average for Grounds tested so far.
                A* vith many other Club1a, tho barriera arc net spaced according to the
                rocoio&ond&tions in the Wheatley Report. Tlds la particularly noticeable at
                tlio top of the Spion Kop and the suspended terracing at Lcppinga Idne. In
                both areas the terracing has a steep slope ef l in 2 and due to the space
                between barriers an effective distance botween then of |8 feet Masurod at
                right angles to tlie terracing.

                     Finally, ve vould like to tbanlt llr Taylor for Ids co-operation in
                carrying out these tests together with llr Hayes vhose knovlodge of the
                ground and experience with the original testing vere of great Value.

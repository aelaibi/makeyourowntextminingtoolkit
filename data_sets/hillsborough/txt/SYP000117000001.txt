             At 8 .15 am on Saturday,                         15 April        1989,      I came on duty at Arm t h o r p e

             P ol i c e S t a t i o n for          duties at          the F .A. Cup Semi-Final                      m a t c h at

             Hills b o r o u g h .

             A f t er    the b r i e fi ng            at H i l l s b o r o u g h    Iwas       detai l e d to serial            31 under

              the -supervision of                     PS 2881       Pearson. At a p p r o x i m a t e l y           10.30       am I took

              up my      position at             the      roundabout               j u n c t i o n of L e p pings Lane,. Halifax

             Road,       Herr i e s Roa d and P e ni st on e                       R oad and was        in company           with PC            1934

             Smith       in front           of an area of waste                    ground.

             At this          location          the m a j o ri ty       of    people were L i verpool                  fans.        On

              several         o c casions        I was a pp ro a c h e d by Liverpool                     fans who wi s h e d to

             know either where                   to go       in the       ground,        whether        any     public      houses were

             open and on o cc as i o n s                  if I had any spare                   tickets        for   sale.

              1 a dv is ed          them    that      no public houses were                      open and       if they did           not

             have a ticket                 they should           leave       the v i c i n i t y of H i l l sborough.                The

             ma j o ri ty      of the          fans     that     1 saw had either                 been drinking           or were

              car rying         bee r cans            and we r e dr i nk i gout                of t h e m »    I wou 1 d not         say

             that       the    fans were              drunk     but were           in very high spirits.

             F r om a p p r o x i m a t e l y      1.30 pm I was                   aware       of a large number             ofLiverpool

             fans       looking        for tickets             dost       to where         I      was   stood.

             I spoke          to a Chief           Inspector and a sked                  him what         to do abcut-t— llua             .

At 2 .00     pm a large          number       of suppo r t e r s      past my      location       presumably

from    the train.            T hese were a c c o m p a n i e d      by only about 20             police.

F r o m this       time    onwa r d s     the volume       of s u pporters         grew to thousands                   and

I not i ced the fans who                  had been      looking      for    tickets walk          down with

the s w e lling        numbers         to Hills b o r o u g h .

At approx imately 2 . 3 0               pm the     traffic        t ravelling      dawn Leppi ngs Lane

was    halted        by m y s el f and PC S m i th on the order of PS Pearson.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 0 0    pin L a p p i n g s Lane was       full    of s u p p o r t e r s    over

a thousand           in my e st im a t i o n and se e m e d to come from the                    d i r e c t i o n of

H a l i f a x Road.        At about        the same      time      1 o v e r h e a r d an a radio           that

some    trouble        had s ta r t e d      inside     the gr o u n d on the L e p p i n g s Lane             side,

an    Inspector        came    past our         location and told us to go to Leppings

Lane    and on arri v a l         at L e p p i n g s Lane         1 saw a large number              of

L i v erpo ol      fans who were           upset and hurl i n g abuse at Police                     Officers.

As    1 went       t h r o u g h gate C I saw several               bodies wit h        people      trying to

render first           aid.      1 then helped to move                 injured      people      outside        the

gates.       A y oung       lady then         came to me and asked for help.                        X together

w i t h PC    1900 Kent        followed         the   lady    into the       snack      bar.      1 then

helped a young             female w ith         chest    injuries,         as we    carried her across

the holding a r ea the L i v erpool                     fans refused to get out of our way

a l t h o u g h we    s ho u t e d at them we           were for c e d to knock           them out          of the

way.

An    Inspector a t t e m p t e d         to take     charge       of the    s i tuation and ordered

myself and other              officers        to form a           barrier   to shield          the dead.           I

received a great              deal      of abuse        from the Liverpool             fans.

A short while             later after         the arrival          of fire and a m b u l a n c e         services

the    dead and        injured         began to be m o v e d        from the scene.

       FROM:        Detective Sergeant 952 Charlesworth           STATION /DEPT-   DIO
       TO:       Chief Superintendent Duckenfield                  DATE:   28 April 1989


                    SUBJECT:    ARRESTS ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989 FA CUP SEMI FINAL- NOTTINGHAM
                        FOREST v LIVERPOOL



                        With reference to the above I have to report as follows:

                        Arrests in and around the Hillsborough Ground in connection with the
                        above game totalled 44.   Of these, 10 were charged, bailed to court and
                        released. The delay in c h a rg ing prisoners 10, 11, and 12 at F Division
                        was due to the fact we were unable to verify them until these times.
                        Attached is a sheet showing full details of all prisoners, material
                        times and their disposal.

                        In addition there is a further list attached showing a further 14
                        arrests in D Division during the build-up to the kick off time and who
                        in fact never got further than the Midland Station and City Centre,
                        with the exception of two who were arrested later. These being a Notts
                        Forest fan at 17-28 in Pond Street, for s4 Public Order Act and a
                        Liverpool fan at 18.55 at the Midland Station for being drunk and
                        disorderly.

                        The total arrests therefore in connection with football supporters for
                        the above date is 58.I have checked with the other Divisions of    the
                        South Yorkshire Police, A, B, C and E and there were no arrests in
                        connection with the subject of this report.

                        Of the 58 prisoners, 24 were charged and bailed to court, 24 were
                        verbally cautioned and 10 were ejected from the ground.    One of the
                        prisoners from D Division,                     has already been dealt
                        with.  He was remanded in custody after his arrest and appeared before
                        Sheffield Magistrates Court on 17 April 1989 charged with s4 Public
                        Order Act and offensive weapon.   He was fined £200.00 on each charge
                        with £15-00 costs.

                        I would at this point like to point out that the adverse publicity in
                        the national press in respect of prisoners appearing at Sheffield
                        Magistrates Court on Tuesday 25 April 1989, were in no way connected
                        with prisoners dealt with at either FI or F2 on the 15 April 1989, but
                        were in fact prisoners from D Division who never got as far as the
                        ground or its proximity.

                         I submit this report, together with the attached lists of prisoners and
                         their details for your information.

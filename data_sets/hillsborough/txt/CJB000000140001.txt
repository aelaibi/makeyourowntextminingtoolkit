          Further to our recent telephone conversation I can confirm that the last
          inspection was undertaken on 17.5.88 when 43 separate items were recorded
          as requiring attention.  None of these items could be classified as major.

          We have a duty to inspect at least once every 12 months but should also do
          so on complaint or if we feel necessary.  In our current and projected
          resource situation we would be reluctant to inspect more regularly of our
          own volition and we get very few complaints.

Dear Sir,

Safety At Sports Grounds Act

I write to confirm the opinion already expressed at a meeting of the Advisory
Group that no officer of the Council, in whatever capacity he purports
to act, has any authority whatsoever to amend, vary, modify or revoke in
any way any safety certificate or any amendment, alteration or similar
matter, in any respect whatsoever.  Any such amendment, alteration or
revokation can only be made by the Council acting in its official capacity
as the certificating authority under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act,
and formal notification in the appropriate statutory form will be issued.

I have informed all the other appropriate statutory services, and the
operators of the three stadia who mare potentially or actually the subject
of the certicicating process.  Dr. Eastwood has also been informed, and
appropriate steps are being taken to ensure that all Council Departments
are aware of this rule.

Yours faithfully,

HOTB OF MEETING OF MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISE AND GENERAL SERVICES POLICY
WORKING GROPP ON THE 1ST SEPTEMBER. 1989



Members met to consider the content of a report which it was intended to
submit to the Municipal Enterprise and General Services Committee on the
11th September, 1989 raising a number of issues concerning safety of
sports grounds.  There was a considerable discussion concerning the
outstanding matters from the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.   The
general feeling of members was that the City Council should be doing as
much as possible to enforce the terms of the recommendations and that in
instances where no response or an unsatisfactory response has been
received from the various football clubs, then the Council should be
giving serious consideration to the issue of prohibition notice.   It was
concluded that the best way forward was for a verbal report to be made to
the General Purposes Panel, to be taken as an emergency item, on the 4th
September 1989 seeking the Panel's approval to write to the respective
clubs concerning the outstanding matters and to enable members to give
consideration to the imposition of a time limit in respect of them.   The
Head of Administration and Legal Department confirmed that this would be
done.

Turning to paragraph 4, "matters for consideration", it was felt that the
General Purposes Panel should be visiting the respective sports grounds
during September.  It was felt that it may be useful to have available
some expert help in the form of Building Surveyors, Environmental Health
experts, Fire and Police Officers to assist members and that members
should also be provided with a checklist of items which have been
completed and those which remained outstanding to enable them to consider
them on site.  There was also some debate about the length of time it
would take to visit each ground and it was felt on balance that at least
half a day would be required for each.

There was also some discussion about members function in the future and
the general concensus that members wished to be more involved in matters.

The emergency procedures were discussed and it was generally agreed that
it was appropriate for emergency procedures to be delegated to the Acting
Head of Administration and Legal Department in consultation with the Chair
of the General Purposes Panel and the Chair and/or Deputy Chair of MEGS.
It was felt that members should be informed immediately afterwards and a
General Purposes Panel meeting called immediately to discuss the matter.

The meeting then went on to discuss the question of resources.  Members
were anxious to ensure that there was some cross referencing with the
posts so that cover was provided for each of the Chief Licensing Officers
and also with the Licensing Officers.  The question of funding of this was
discussed.  The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department
indicated that it would not be possible to fund this entirely from the
annual fees recovered from the sports grounds or from the existing budget
of the Administration and Legal Department.  It would therefore be
necessary for additional funding to be made available.  If these proposals
are accepted in principle, this matter will be given further
consideration.

  Dear Sirs,

  Re: Safety of Sports Grounds

 I refer to previous correspondence in connection with this matter.  I refer
 particularly to the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which
 required implementation prior to commencement of the football season.  The
 General Purposes Panel of the City Council recently gave consideration to those
 matters which required implementation prior to commencement of the football
 season and remained outstanding.  These appear to be as follows

  (a)    With reference to recommendation 41, I have not received confirmation from
         you that the medical practitioner you propose to employ is qualified in
         advanced first aid.

  (b)    I refer to your letter of 16th August in which you indicated servicing was
         necessary to some turnstiles in the Bramall Lane stand and terrace areas
         and the Spion Kop area. I look forward to hearing from you with some
         indication as to whether or not this servicing has been completed and the
         effect upon capacity in those areas.

  (c)    The final point is a minor one, but please would you confirm that stewards
         have now been trained in the use of bntt croppers.  You indicated that
         there was a proposal for the Fire Service to undertake such training.

 The members of the General Purposes Panel indicated that unless a satisfactory
 response is received to these items by the close of business on 7th September
 1989, they felt they had no option but to consider the issue of a Prohibition
 Notice in respect of the Sports Ground.  1 therefore look forward to hearing
 from you.

 Ytours faithfully,                 _________

Dear Hr. Mackrell,

Re: Safety of Sports Grounds

I refer to previous correspondence la connection with this matter and your
letter of 24th August*  The General Purposes Panel of the City Council met on
the 4th September 19&9 to discuss the outstanding items of the interio
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.

As far as the matters vhich required implementation before the coraaeacetaent of
the football season are concerned, there are three outstanding matters:-

 (a) Although you have confirsea that the Police are satisfied that the
     information on tickets is unambiguous and correlates with information
     provided insicie and outside the ground, you have not yet supplied a copy of
     the revised tickets to enable the Local Authority to satisfy itself that
     this is in fact so.

 (b) You have not confirmed that the aedical practitioner you propose to employ
     is trained and competent in advanced first aid.

Please also supply, as requested, a copy ox the "stewarding plan" showing the
location of the stewards.

 I look forward to hearing from you with a response to these particular raatters
 and also a suost&nti&e response to my letter of 17th August.  The members of the
 General Purposes Panel indicated that unless a satisfactory response is received
 by the close of business on the 7th September, 1989, they feel they have no
 option but to consider the issue of a Prohibition Notice in respect of the
/Sports Ground.

      For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes

      Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                                            Sheffield United Football Club Ltd.
                                                             Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                                       Radial Fences .

                          Thank you for your letter dated 8 September and for your
      telephone call to John Strange on 11 September telling him that
      the condition for the date by which the barriers are to be tested
      has been relaxed.
                          However, we had already arranged to test the barriers on 15
      September, as stipulated in your letter.                                                                                                  Nevertheless thank you
      for considering the extension of time.                                                                                               The testing rig is at the
      ground now and we shall be able to report the results of the tests
      to you next week.
                          So                    that the Panel can judge dates by which they may wish to
      have work completed we have pleasure in enclosing seven copies of
      each of the fixture lists for both Sheffield United                                                                                                                         (the red one)
      and Sheffield Wednesday                                                                 (the blue o n e ) .                            We trust you will find
      them useful.

                                                                                                                                    Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr.                                                   D. Bownes


Dear Mr. Bownes,
                                         Sheffield United Football Club L t d .

              I write to confirm that the lengths of barriers,                                                                                          numbers 38,

were load tested, in accordance with the procedure                                                                                                 set         out in
the        'Green Guide', on Friday 15 September, as requested.
              A copy of each of our two record sheets showing the results
of the tests together with extracts from our drawings 6518/100C
and 6518/102C showing the location of the barriers tested are
enclosed.                 You will see from the results that in all cases the
barriers withstood the test load.
              Our report about the results                                                              ofthe annual barrier                                    testing

               I write to confirm that the lengths of barriers,                                                                                                           numbers 38,

1.   MINUTES OF LAST MEETING

     There were no comments arising out of the meeting held on 24th August.

2.   APPLICATION OF GREEN GUIDE

     Generally speaking, the meeting assented to the proposal that the Guide
     be strictly applied except when there are very substantial reasons for
     not doing so.  The only reservations were expressed by Arthur Butler, The
     Building Surveyor.   His view was that the Guide was merely guidance for
     professionals and that the professional view ought to prevail rather than
     the Green Guide.   Mr.   Ward responded that this was not disputed and
     accepted that in certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to relax
     the provisions but that the Council should have that option and that the
     starting point must always be the Green Guide.    The principle must be
     that departures are made from the Green Guide only in very exceptional
     circumstances.   If there was a conflict, then the higher standard would
     be applicable.   Mr.   Butler indicated he still felt that the Green Guide
     could be restrictive and that there could be difficulties if the guide
     was adhered to strictly.

     Mr. Blount said that there was a difference between saying something was
     more or less correct and saying something needed relaxing.  Mr. Ward
     replied that if the Council were unaware of potential problems the
     Council wil be in difficulties if questions were asked of its officers.
     The duty upon officers were to put the Council on notice of problems.
     There was really no alternative but to stick strictly to the letter of
     the law.

     Mr. Blount said that this would prevent difficulties in view of the fact
     that the Guide was not as precise as perhaps it could be.  Mr. Ward again
     emphasised that what the Council insist upon is not a matter for this
     group.  It is up to officers to report to the Council to make decisions.

,3.   CAPACITY A T SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB                                ACTION

      Mr. Ward referred to the letter from the Fire Service dated 30th August.
      He confirmed that this matter was to be referred to the General Purposes
      Panel on Friday, 15th September and comments were needed from the Fire
      Service and Building Surveyor.  The Fire Service were asked whether or
      not they had anything to add to their letter.

      Mr. Grimshaw indicated that the comments only covered the Kop and the
      North-West area.  Their views upon the North-West terrace were not in
      writing yet.  Due to lack of plans, they have not commenced calculations
      for the South Stand.  He indicated that the evacuation time was the main
      issue and whether or not pitch perimeter gates were used as emergency
      exits.  Without using the pitch perimeter gates, it was possible to
      evacuate 16,800 people in the 8 minutes specified in the Green Guide.

      The police indicated that there contingency plans utilised the perimeter
      gates, depending upon the position of the fire.  If the fire was on the
      pitch, there would not use them.

      Mr. Grimshaw referred to Home Office advice which accepted that 10
      minutes was a reasonable time to evacuate the pitch.   Their proposal was
      to use only normal exits to evacuate.   If the pitch perimeter gates were
      used, on the basis of one unit, they could evacuate in just over 7
      minutes.   The Green Guide says that evacuation should be possible within
      8 minutes.

      Mr. Ford, from Health and Consumer Services, indicated that in his view,
      the Green Guide should be followed.

      The general view was that the Guide should be adhered to and therefore       AHALD
      the capacity should be reduced to 16,800.

4.    PITCH PERIMETER GATES AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

      Again, reference was made to the Fire Service letter of 30th August.   The
      Fire Service indicated that originally, the difficulty was that the pitch
      perimeter gates were not signed for evacuation purposes.  Now, all are
      signed as means of escape.  There was no dissent from the views expressed
      by the Fire Service in their letter.

      With reference to paragraph 7A the police said that the views expressed
      in that paragraph were untrue.  The arrangements with the police were
      that the Club would only sell 4000 tickets leaving the balance as a
      contingency.  The point was noted by the Fire Service who said that it
      should not make any difference to exit numbers.

5.    CAPACITY AT SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB PURSUANT TO REMOVAL OF RADIAL
      FENCES

      The Fire Service commented that their calculation of capacity was
      approximately 11,000 on the basis of the evacuation time needed.   That
      was below the current figure in the certificate.   With reference to the
      Kop, the exits from the immediate vicinity were adequate.   Mr. Butler,
      Building Surveyor, commented that his calculations had been done purely
      on the holding capacity and on that basis the removal of the radial fence
      did not alter the position vis-a-vis the capacity.
                                          -3-


     A second emergency item was raised at this point, that of the testing of       ACTION
     barriers pursuant to the removal of the radial fences.   In accordance
     with the notice of consent for the carrying out of works issued on the
     25th August, 1989, one requirement of that notice was that the barriers
     were tested by the 15th September, 1989.   This is presenting difficulties
     since both Arthur Butler, the Buidling Surveyor and Eastwoods on behalf
     of the Club say that the cement will take 28 days to set.   It is
     therefore recommended by the Building Surveyor that the period in the
     notice is extended for 28 days running from the date the posts were
     inserted.   Frances Woodhead asked whether, in view of that, the area was
     safe for the admission of spectators.   Mr. Butler took the view that it
     was since when the load was tested, it was put on "overload".   He talked
     about the curve of maturity of concrete.   He was of the view that the
     concrete would already have the adequate strength to achieve the load
     required but was not yet at full strength.   Therefore, to err on the side
     of caution, the testing should not be undertaken as yet.   The police
     pointed out that two matches have already taken place at Bramall Lane
     since the concrete was laid.   No large matches are anticipated in the 28
     day period.   Mr. Butler indicated that he did not perceive any likely
     problems if spectators were admitted to the area in the meantime.            AHALD

6.   OWLERTON SPORTS GROUND

     Mr. Ward referred to documents C and F. attached to the agenda.   He
     confirmed that the Council would be considering what to do with Owlerton
     Stadium in the very near future and explained that the Director of Health
     and Consumer Services was minded to issue a Prohibition Notice.   He asked
     for the group's views upon this ground.  Mr.  Butler indicated that he
     had nothing further to add pursuant to his written report.   The Fire
     Service referred to their letter and referred to page 3, item C(2).   He
     confirmed that the Panorama referred to the whole of the first floor not
     to the Panorama Room as defined in the Entertainments Licence.   The
     police and SYMAS had no comment to make.  The question therfore was
     whether or not a Prohibition Notice should be issued or whether we should
     consider issuing a Safety Certificate in respect of the ground.   Mr.
     Ford asked whether we had any alternative to issuing a Safety
     Certificate.  Frances Woodhead advised on the requirements for issuing a
     Safety Certificate and explained that members of the Council were now
     moving away from their original view that a ground had to be up to a
     certain standard before a Certificate was issued.   The view seemed to be
     that if a ground was safe, a Certificate was issued, if not, we
     prohibited the use of it.  There was also some discussion about the
     possible application for the re-designation of the Stadium by the Stadium
     itself.  Julian Ward said that he expected that the Council would oppose
     such an application and that the views of the Council would besought by
     the Home Office if such an application was made.

     The Fire Service confirmed that the means of escape would be acceptable
     for day time use.  There were concerned that there was no emergency
     lighting and therefore the ground was unsafe for night time use.   They
     indicated that the need for emergency lighting had been brought to the
     Club's attention two years ago.   Mr. Ward explained that there were two
     options.  We could do nothing, but if we did nothing we had to have
     reasons for doing nothing.  Alternatively, we could issue a Safety
     Certificate or prohibit the use.   Mr. Ford confirmed that the present
     Health and Safety legislation did not assist them in taking enforcement
     action action against the ground.   There were reliant upon Safety of
     Sports Ground legislation for this purpose.
                                         - 4 -


     Mr. Ward referred to the Building Surveyor's report which ran to 29 pages     ACTION
     of immediate safety requirements.  There was also the list of works
     required by the Fire Service.  He said was there any reason not to issue
     a Prohibition Notice.  The report clearly revealed immediate safety
     hazards.  The concensus of the meeting was therefore that a Probition
     Notice should be issued and a recommendation made to the General Purposes
     Panel at its meeting of 15th September to that effect.  Some dicsussion
     then took place as to whether use could be made of the bars.  It was
     confirmed that they could because all we were doing was prohibiting the
     use of the premises for sporting activities.

     The Fire Service raised the question of the use of the Panorama Room.
     Mr. Ward asked that the Director of Health and Consumer Services looked
     at the problem of capacity.  Some discussion then took place as to
     whether the Prohibition Order should be restricted to a particular sport
     or a particular part of the Stadium.   As far as the Fire Service were
     concerned, most events are believed to have taken place in the afternoon
     and therefore there was not a problem.   They confirmed that they have
     submitted a similar report listing items of work two years ago and the
     work had not been carried out.

     It was therefore concluded that the appropriate recommendation was that a
     Prohibition Notice was issued in respect of Owlerton Sports Stadium with
     immediate effect for all kinds of sports.

7.   SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY CAR PARK

     Reference was made to the memorandum from the Building Surveyor dated 6th
     September, 1989.  Mr. Butler confirmed that he still awaiting advice from
     the Club and commented upon the lack of detail on the drawings.  The Fire
     Service confirmed that the delineated parking area at the back of the        Building
     training facilities were satisfactory.  The police indicated that their      Surveyor
     observations revealed that the work had now been done and was simply         Fire
     awaiting the top coat of tarmac.  Further enquiries need to be made about
     this.

8.   SHEFFIELD UNITED - DISABLED FACILITIES

     The letter from the Fire Service dated 4th August and the letter from
     Health and Consumer Services dated 27th July were referred to.  Mr.
     Butler handed in a memorandum setting out his comments.  There was some
     discussion about ways in which the facilities were inadequate.  The Fire
     Service said that the stepping arrangements could be improved and there
     was a need for handrails at access points.  The item was deferred to         Further
     enable members of the Advisory Group to give further consideration in        meeting
     their individual capacities.

9.   SHEFFIELD UNITED SOUTH STAND - FAMILY ENCLOSURE

     Julian Ward referred to the letter from the Fire Service dated 22nd
     August.  The Fire Service made reference to the means of escape which had
     been calculated on a 50/50 basis.  They said they would need the views of
     the police as to how it works in practice. The police considered that
     there were no problems, that the stand emptied very quickly but they were
     unable to say how many people went one way or the other. There was
     therefore a possible imbalance upon the exits.   The police questioned how
     the stewards were to be made aware of the means of access across the
     concourse and the emergency procedures as referred in paragraph IE of
     their letter of 22nd August.  The police felt that the stewards were
     being asked to complete an impossible task and that it was not
     appropriate to put that onus on stewards. The Fire Service felt there
                                           - 5 -


      was a need for another gate across the middle of the area and the police       ACTION
      felt there was a need to monitor the area.   Mr. Butler said that he was
      concerned about the gate specification.   The Fire Service referred to
      item IB of their letter.   Mr.  Butler felt the gate should be a maximum
      of 1.1 metres high and should look as if it could be easily opened.    The
      Fire Service accepted   this point and said they were happy toreduce the
      height of the gate to 1.1 metre.

      Mr. Butler mentioned the turnstiles at the Shoreham Street entrance and
      the drop from the ramping to the yard area.   He said that it was possible
      from the edge of that ramp to put cigarette ends and rubbish on the roof
      of the timbered refreshment cabin and suggested that the cabin was
      removed.  With reference to the family enclosure area, he raised the
      question of removal of seats.   There was no suggestion on the drawings to
      do this and he. required confirmation that this was still unintended since
      it would create a gangway in an area where steps were twice the riser
      level they should be.    It was therefore agreed that the matter will be     SUFC
      left in abeyance until further information was available.

10.   STEWARDING

      It was recommended that there was a need for an analysis of the schedule
      provided by Sheffield United to be undertaken.  The Building Surveyor
      will undertake this.  The Fire Service raised the question of the
      stewarding on the pitch perimeter at Sheffield United Football Club.
      They said it did not tally with the figures in the Schedule.

      Two stewards were needed for checking fire specifications at the John
      Street stand and they did not seem to be identified on the Schedule with
      the certificate.  It was agreed further consideration would be given to
      the matter.

11.   WORKS REQUIRED

      It was noted that it had taken Sheffield Stadium 14 months to complete
      the required works.

12.   URGENT BUSINESS

      Some discussion took place about the playing of rugby at Sheffield United
      Football Club.  Clear that more details are needed about this.  It was
      also commented that the Safety Certificate did not permit the playing of
      rugby at the ground.  The provision of liquor is also permitted since the
      Control of Alcohol Act does not affect rugby.

      The Fire Service raised the point of Sheffield Wednesday and the capacity
      of the North Stand, Gate A, Leppings Lane is narrower than it should be
      for a full capacity.  Need to monitor emergency procedures with
      particular reference to Upper Concourse Area.

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
               Complaint - Mr. R. Bates, 6 Prospect Precinct, Worksop

               I refer to your memorandum of 25th September, 1990 concerning a complaint you
               received from Mr. R. Bates of the above address.

               As requested, I have undertaken an investigation of this matter.  I attach for
               your information a copy of a letter I forwarded to the Club on 1st October,
               1990 enquiring into the incident together with a copy of a reply my Chief
               Licensing Officer received on 10th October, 1990.

               I am confident that this was an isolated incident and was unavoidable in the
               circumstances.  The error in ticketing has now been rectified and the only
               concern I have is with the action of the Steward on the day.  Steward training
               you will appreciate is a difficult area, but is being addressed at the moment.
               My Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Derricott will be speaking to the Clubs during
               the season about Steward training.

               I hope this information clarifies the position, but should you require any
               further information, please do not hesitate to contact my Chief Licensing
               Officer Mr. Derricott on the number given above.

        Dear Sir,

       Thank you for your letter dated 1st October 1990. I would
       confirm that there was a slight problem at the Lawrie Madden
       Testimonial match which took place here on the 17th August 1990.
       This was caused owing to the fact t h a t ’an agreement between the
       Building Surveyors Department and our Consultant Engineers to
       remove a small number of seats was not conveyed to our ticket
       office. I would point out however, that the licence capacity
       for this area is 3,847 and we do in fact have some 4,000 seats
       within this area. On the night in question the capacity was
       approximately 1,200.

       Following the Lawrie Madden match and prior to our first, match
       of the season, the correct profile was put on the computer.

        I have in fact communicated this information to the gentleman in
        question and can only assume that he is a frustrated United
        su pporter.

     Dear Sir,

     Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (As Amended)
     Lawrie Madden Testimonial - 17th August, 1989 - Leppings Lane Stand

     Please find attached for your information a copy of a letter that was
     forwarded to Councillor Betts relating to the Lawrie Madden Testimonial
     match which took place at your stadium on 17th August, 1990.

     It seems that the writer bought a ticket for one of the seats that had
     been, removed^fromr-fche Leppings-Lane stand during the close season.

     Please my I have your full written comments on the contents of the letter.
     Also, will you confirm that you have now rectified this apparent error and
     that, you did not at any time breach the capacity limits provided in your
     General Safety Certificates for the Leppings Lane Stand on the date in
     question.

     I look forward to receiving your early reply.

     Yours faithfully,

 1. INTRODUCTION

S c o p e a n d s t a t u s o f th e G uide
1.      This booklet provides guidance to ground management, local
authorities and technical specialists such as engineers on
measures for improving spectator safety at existing sports
grounds. It is a voluntary code and has no legal force.

B a c k g ro u n d to th e G uide
2  .    Guidelines on measures for improving the safety of
 spectators at sports grounds first became available on a more or
 less comprehensive scale when the Wheatley Report on Crowd
 Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1972. The recommen­
dations in the appendix to that Report were extended to include
fire precautions and means of escape from an emergency situation
such as a fire, and then formed the basis of the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds (which became known as the "Green Guide"). The
application of those guidelines to football grounds over the few
years which followed revealed a need for the advice to be
amended in certain respects. Furthermore, since the safety of
spectators can be affected when crowds are disturbed by hooligan
elements, the recommendations of the Working Party on Crowd
Behaviour were incorporated in a new version, published in 1976,
which was aimed specifically at football grounds. Following the
fire at Bradford City FC ground in 1985 in which 56 people died, a
working party, established under the aegis of Mr Justice
Popplewell's Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
Grounds, reviewed the Guide and produced a series of recommen­
dations which have been taken into account together with
comments from others in producing this revised and expanded
version.

3.    Serious accidents at sports grounds involving injuries on a
large scale to spectators are fortunately few. But as demonstrated
by those at Ibrox and Valley Parade, and before that at Burnden
Park, the potential scale of death and injury at a crowded sporting
event is such that it is essential for ground management to take


                                    5



    i I
    such steps as are necessary to ensure reasonable safety at their
    grounds. This applies to all sports grounds irrespective of whether
    or not they are the subject of a safety certificate.


    G en eral p rin c ip le s o f th e G uide
    4.    The problem of crowd safety at sports grounds is complex
    and cannot be solved simply by ensuring that each component of a
    ground, such as stairways, passages or sections of terracing, is
    satisfactory in itself. The inter-relation of these and the other
    components is essential: none of them can be considered in
    isolation without consideration of its effect on the others, and they
    should all be compatible and combine to form a balanced unit.


       The Guide is intended to cover grounds where sporting
events of all kinds are held and where the gathering of large
crowds is likely to present a safety problem. However, much of the
guidance has particular application to football stadia and this
should be borne in mind when applying the Guide to grounds used
for other sports and modifications may prove necessary, because
the measures to meet problems of stadia used for association
football may not always be necessary at other grounds used for
other types of sports. For example, if a ground has no terraced or
sloped viewing areas, crush barrier requirements are unlikely to
be of concern. Indications are given throughout to those sections
of the Guide which are particularly relevant to football grounds or
stadia and to those where close compliance with the guidelines is
desirable irrespective of the sport concerned.


6 .    Deviations from individual guidelines are possible without
necessarily detracting from the overall safety of the ground. The
variety of type, function and layout of sports grounds and the inter­
relationship of the different parts of them means that a flexible
approach should be maintained to take account of the particular
circumstances at individual grounds. For these reasons the Guide
does not attempt to set a minimum standard which would be
acceptable for a large well-attended stadium but excessive for a
smaller, sparsely-attended ground; or which would be an
appropriate standard for the latter but insufficient for the former.


                                 6
 7.   The Guide is aimed primarily at advising on safety for
spectators in existing sports grounds and as such it attempts to
take account of the constraints and difficulties which are present
within these grounds. Although it is not a design brief for new
construction work or reconstruction at sports grounds the
principles may well still be applicable. Such work should not be to
a standard lower than that set out here and the scope offered by
new design work should lead to better standards than can be
achieved at grounds already built.

8 .   It should be borne in mind that, when using the Guide to
assess whether existing circumstances provide adequately for the
safety of spectators, the criterion to be aimed for is that of a
reasonable degree of safety. It would be unreasonable, even if it
were practical, to seek the absolute safety of everyone attending
a ground.

9.    The Guide is not specifically aimed at risks to spectators
from the sport itself, but clearly management have a duty to take
all necessary precautions to safeguard spectators against the
effects of accidents in, or originating from, the activity on the
playing area. Particular care is needed when the sport entails use
and storage of flammable fuels.

1 0 . The advice given in this Guide is without prejudice to the
operation of the Building Regulations, the Health and Safety at
Work etc Act 1974 and any other relevant legislation.


U sing th e G uide
11 . The principles referred to in paragraphs 4 -1 0 above should
be kept in mind by both ground management and, where
applicable, by the local authority when applying the Guide to an
individual ground. The Guide is an aid to, not a substitute for,
professional judgement and common sense.

1 2 . Although some of the safety standards are likely to apply to
all sports grounds, however many spectators are present, it is
nonetheless important to relate the Guide to the needs of the
individual ground. It should be borne in mind that in most circum­


                                   7



    •i
                                                                  II



stances, the required safety standard to be attained will often
relate to the maximum number of spectators who are liable to be
admitted to the ground (or parts of it). For example, a large football
stadium with a maximum spectator capacity of tens of thousands
is liable to pose significant crowd pressure risks. To accommodate
safely a maximum crowd at such a ground might entail substantial
remedial work; alternatively, consideration might be given to
accepting a much smaller number of spectators who, properly
dispersed, could be accommodated safely without having to incur
costly repairs or alterations. The first step, therefore, is to assess,
using the Guide's criteria, how many people can be safely
accommodated in the different sections of the ground given the
existing condition of the ground (ie determine a safe spectator
capacity). This should be done with a proper, detailed plan,
preferably drawn to scale (1:200) of the ground (see Chapter 16).

13. It follows that in general in a ground where it is proposed to
retain a high spectator capacity, the measures needed to be taken
to accommodate safely such large crowds are potentially more
extensive.

The p ro b le m s
1 4 . There are essentially four types of safety problem to be
considered within a ground and in its immediate surroundings, all
of which are linked in some way.

15. The first concerns hazards affecting individuals which cause
tripping, slipping and falling, which in themselves can have
serious consequences for the individuals concerned, but can also
lead to a serious incident involving others. This type of problem
can be remedied by proper care and maintenance, and attention to
the general constructional features of the ground.


1 6 . The second type is far more important and involves crowd
pressures. When large crowds are present and densities are high,
pressures build up within the crowd either through motion or
swaying which make it difficult, or even impossible, for individuals
to control their own movements. Under these conditions crowd
pressures can escalate to a dangerous level and if a person


                                8
stumbles or falls the crowd cannot adapt to avoid him or to stop to
help. Since this type of danger arises from crowd pressures its
remedy lies in their removal or restraint within safe limits. These
dangers arise in particular on terraces and in exit routes, and so
careful attention must be paid to restraining surges and similar
pressures on the terraces and to ensuring free movement
throughout the exit systems. Such free movement is dependent
upon the capacity of all the various sections of the exit systems
and interactions between them.

17 . The third type of safety problem cannot be divorced from the
second and in some ways is an extreme version of it. The danger
arises from emergency situations which can develop following, for
example, an outbreak of fire or hooliganism. The orderly
evacuation of large crowds may under emergency conditions
become a very serious problem.

18 . The fourth problem is the risk from fire itself, particularly
where there is a large crowd in a confined area of an elevated
covered stand where spectators are in the upper tiers of a
building, the materials and construction of which might in
themselves constitute a fire risk. Measures should be taken which
as far as possible will prevent the outbreak and contain the spread
of fire; systems should be introduced to detect such an outbreak
early on; and provision must be made for means of escape and for
staff to be trained in emergency procedures.


O v e rc o m in g t h e p ro b le m s
1 9 . The importance of good ground management cannot be
emphasised too strongly (see Chapter 2). Much of the safety
advice contained in this Guide can and should form part of the
general upkeep and maintenance of a sports ground. If these
guidelines are applied they should reduce or eliminate risks to
spectators and in the long term prove cost effective by preventing
serious defects. A well-maintained and well-run venue may also
attract more events and a greater number of spectators.

2 0 . As mentioned in paragraph 7 above, the scope in new
design work can give an opportunity to enhance spectator safety,


                                     9



    .i
                                                               11



which should be given a high priority when deciding upon the
design, layout, materials and loading of new buildings, or
alterations in a ground. Close attention should be paid to new and
existing exits and exit routes, slip-resistant surfaces, lighting and
ease of maintenance. All parts of viewing areas should always
have a clear unobstructed view of the playing area and designs
should take account of the need for effective stewarding, which
can play an important role in controlling crowd movement (see
Chapter 13).

21. Although controlling crowd numbers may serve to reduce
some risks to an acceptable level, remedial work is likely to be
necessary to overcome others. Obvious defects such as trip
hazards (especially at the head of stairs or steps), loose or weak
handrails on stairs, and obstructed exits or exit routes, should be
rectified as part of the general care and maintenance of a ground.
Structures should be sound (see Chapter 3) and inspected by
suitably qualified persons (see Chapter 4). Design, layout and
signposting of exits and exit routes require particular attention to
ensure that they can safely cope with the number of spectators
who will use them at the end of an event or in an emergency (see
Chapter 6 ). Similarly, the condition of terraces or viewing slopes
(see Chapter 8 ) and presence or otherwise of crush barriers,
correctly sited and meeting the strength tests of this Guide (see
Chapter 9), are important factors. Broken, uneven terracing causes
stumbling. Barriers not only serve to break up crowd pressures but
also assist in controlling movement off the terraces by regulating
the rate of arrival at exits to suit their capacity, and encouraging
the formation of queues so that spectators arrive at exits in an
orderly fashion.


22. Proper precautions against the risk of fire are vital (see
Chapter 11). Good ground management is crucial in reducing or
eliminating the risk. Accumulation of litter is a prime potential
source of fire but can be eliminated by regular and frequent
inspections, good housekeeping, ground maintenance and by
taking particular care over the storage of flammable materials. The
nature and type of materials used in the construction of covered
areas and stands will strongly influence the safety measures


                              10
required in them; for example, in some circumstances consideration
may have to be given to restricting the number of spectators
and/or to the provision of additional exits from the building if it is
to continue in use.

                                                               I'




2. M A N A G E M E N T RESPONSIBILITY

Effective ground m an agem en t is an im portant factor in
achieving proper safety and m anagem ent should constantly
look to improve safety standards wherever possible.


23. The safety of the public inside the ground is the
responsibility of those who stage the event and administer the
ground in which it is held, ie the "management". This responsibility
applies in both normal and emergency situations. Local authority
safety officers, fire and police officers will help management to
discharge this responsibility and in certain circumstances may
require measures to be taken in order to achieve reasonable safety
standards, but the management is not thereby absolved of its
responsibility for the safety of its customers.

24. Management should draw up a programme of checks,
inspections, tests, personnel training and remedial work pro­
grammes so as to eliminate or reduce risks to spectators.
Management is responsible for ensuring that such inspections are
carried out on structures and installations so that they are safe for
the purpose for which they were intended. The results of any
remedial action, as and when taken, should be recorded. Where
restrictions on crowd numbers to parts of the ground are required
for safety reasons they must be imposed and enforced. Similarly, if
a part of the ground is required to be closed because it is
potentially unsafe for spectators this must be done, and it must
not be opened up as a result of an "attractive” fixture or event,
unless measures have been taken beforehand to remove the
dangers which led to its closure in the first place.

25. The ground management should ensure that structural fire
protection of buildings is adequate, and that fire warning systems
are correctly installed and properly maintained in accordance with
manufacturers' instructions or British Standards. Similarly,
suitable fire-fighting equipment must be provided and maintained
to the standards specified in this Guide (see Chapter 11).


                              12
26. Staff training, particularly for stewards, in carrying out both
their normal duties and ensuring that they are aware of their role
in an emergency situation, should be given high priority.
Management should not only inform all staff in writing what their
duties are, how to effect them “and from whom to seek advice if in
doubt, but also carry out active supervision and organise
emergency drills to maintain standards (see Chapter 13).

27. General repair and maintenance should be undertaken with
spectator safety in mind; litter should not be allowed to
accumulate and management should see that minor repairs are
quickly and properly carried out.

28. There should be an appointed safety officer who should be
of sufficient status and authority effectively to take responsibility
for safety at the ground and to be able to authorise and supervise
safety measures. He or an appointed deputy should be in
attendance at a central control point when an event takes place.
All staff should know the location of this control point and who is
in charge of safety on the day in question.

29. A summary of management responsibilities is contained
below.

        i.     To appoint a safety officer.
        ii.    To ensure compliance with the terms and conditions
               of a safety certificate or other notice covering the
               safety of spectators.
        iii.   To draw up and keep up to date records and plans of
               the ground; to maintain the general fabric of the
               ground, and arrange an annual detailed inspection of
               the ground and regular testing of a representative
               sample of any barriers or rails, keeping a record of
               their location and results of the tests.
        iv.    To maintain and test all electrical installations and, in
               accordance with the relevant British Standards, the
               systems for emergency lighting, communications and
               fire warning/detection, and fire-fighting equipment.

v.     To draw up in consultation with the emergency services
       contingency plans, including arrangements with police
       for stopping an event, for:
       a.   various emergency situations including fire;
       b.   possible crowd trouble;
       c.   coping with exceptionally large numbers                of
            spectators arriving at the ground; and
       d.   the failure of any detection, warning, lighting or
            communications system.
vi.    To devise a clear system of communications within
        the ground.

vii.   To take necessary fire prevention and precautions
        measures.

viii. To consult the fire authority about emergency
       evacuation time; fire risk in stands; fire-fighting
       equipment; and access for emergency vehicles.

ix.    To store safely and away from public areas any
        hazardous and flammable materials, combustible
        items, and any accumulations of combustible waste
        which cannot be cleared from the ground before the
        next event.

x.     To provide first aid facilities and first aid staff.

xi.    To consult with the police to arrange adequate policing
        and police facilities.

xii.   To recruit, train and deploy stewards and to organise
        and carry out emergency evacuation drills using those
        staff.

xiii. To man any locked exit gates at all times when the
       public are in the ground, to ensure they can be opened
       immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.

xiv. To ensure that all gangways and exit routes are
      unobstructed and capable of being used to their full
      capacity at all times when the public are in the ground.

     xv.     To provide directional flow, exit and emergency exit
             signs.
     xvi.    Before each event:
             a.   to test exit doors and gates, and their locks if they
                  are to be locked;
             b.   to test lighting, communications and fire warning/
                  detection systems; and
             c.   to check the ground for any accumulations of
                  combustible litter, especially below stands and in
                  exit routes; and for any source of potential missiles.
     xvii.   After each event:
             a.   to carry out a general visual inspection for signs of
                  damage; and
             b.   to liaise with police so as to gain full benefit from
                  any debriefing about crowd control.
     xviii. To keep records of:
             a.   attendance figures; and
             b.   all inspections and tests, any defects noted and
                  the remedial/other action taken.

3. GENERAL FABRIC AIMD
STRUCTURAL MATTERS

To m eet safety requirements, all com ponents, installations and
structures, eg terraces, stands, stairs, barriers and pylons,
should have th e strength and durability, and be m aintained in
such condition and arranged in such a m anner as to perform
safely their required functions.

30. The design and construction of buildings and installations
should be in accordance with good engineering and building
practice, especially as set out in all relevant British Standard
specifications and codes of practice. They should be properly
maintained and repaired by appropriately qualified persons.
Specialist advice from an appropriately qualified engineer
belonging to a recognised Institution should be sought to assess
the safety and strength of load-bearing elements in buildings and
installations such as crush barriers (see Chapter 9) and brick/block
walls (see Chapter 8 , paragraph 103).

31. When wells, including perimeter walls, and fences are to
withstand crowd pressures, they should be designed to withstand
such pressures safely and allowance should be made for forces
simultaneously and independently induced by other factors eg
wind forces or attached installations.

32. All parts of the ground used by the general public, and
especially the exit routes, should have minimum headroom of not
less than 2 metres. Exit routes should wherever possible have a
headroom of 2.4 metres.

33. Precautions should be taken to prevent people from climbing
on to roofs, pylons, hoardings and other structures. Where
possible such structures should be fitted with unclimbable
devices eg stout barriers or close-boarded enclosures. Spikes,
barbed wire etc should only be installed above the minimum
headroom specified in paragraph 32 above and preferably at a
minimum height of 2.4 metres from the base.

                              16
34. All electrical installations should comply with the current
edition of the Regulations of the Institution of Electrical Engineers,
or have been awarded a certificate of satisfaction from a chartered
electrical engineer. Emergency lighting equipment should conform
to BS 5266: Part 1.

35. Where the natural lighting in any section of the ground
accessible to the public is deficient, adequate artificial lighting
should be provided. If the ground is to be used after dark, all parts
accessible to the public should be provided with means for lighting
adequate to enable them to see their way into, within and out of
the ground. These provisions are particularly important in relation
to exit routes and stairways used by the public. Advice on
emergency lighting is offered in Chapter 11, paragraphs 166-169.




                                     17
                                                              I'




4. INSPECTIO NS AIMD TESTS

Inspections and tests should be carried out by suitably qualified
persons on behalf of m anagem ent to ensure th a t the safety
standards of th e Guide are maintained.

36. A detailed inspection of the ground, including all components
and installations, should be arranged annually by the management.
It should be carried out by a person with a relevant and recognised
professional qualification, and experience of inspecting existing
structures.

37. Engineers commissioned to assess structural safety of
buildings may find the appraisal techniques recommended by the
Institution of Structural Engineers (ISE) in the "Appraisal of
Existing Structures", published in 1980, of assistance. Hard and
fast rules on the extent to which a structural appraisal is
necessary for individual buildings are difficult to lay down: much
will depend upon the type of installation, its size, condition,
materials used in construction and standard of maintenance. A full
appraisal is however unlikely to be necessary unless defects are
identified or in evidence from the analysis of information on the
structure and visual inspection.

38. Testing of crush barriers (see also Chapter 9) should be
carried out in accordance with Annex C of this Guide. When the
guidelines are first applied to a particular ground, a representative
sample of barriers of all types from all areas of the ground should
be selected for testing. Thereafter testing of barriers should take
place every 4 years unless from visual inspection doubts are
raised as to their strength/integrity, in which case they should be
retested. Testing should be carried out by or under the supervision
of a suitably qualified engineer, ie a structural or civil engineer.

39. Following each event, a general visual inspection of the
ground should be made for signs of damage which might create a
potential danger to the public. Particular attention should be paid
to the condition of terraces, viewing slopes and stairways. Crush


                              18
barriers and balustrades should be examined for deformation or
any other overt signs of weakness. The fire precautions measures
should also be inspected for damage, and alarm and other
electrical installations should be checked to ensure compliance
with the relevant British Standards.

40.    Warning, detection, lighting and public address systems are
vulnerable to vandalism, and this should be borne in mind when
installing them. All automatic fire detection and fire warning,
emergency lighting and public address systems should be tested
24 hours before an event, in accordance with the methods laid
down in BS 5839: Part 1 and BS 5266: Part 1 respectively. There
is currently no British Standard for public address systems. In case
any of these systems is not operating properly and cannot be fixed
before the event, contingency plans should be formulated, in
consultation with the emergency services, for the use of acceptable
substitute measures or (if necessary) the closure of any areas of
spectator accommodation until the fault is remedied.

41.   Before an event, and at major soccer grounds in particular,
steps should be taken to ensure that the ground does not contain
any accessible items which could be used as missiles (eg piles of
bricks, stones etc).

4 2 . The ground should be inspected before and after each event
to ensure there are no accumulations of combustible waste and
that any hazardous materials (if essential to be stored) are safely
stored well away from public areas.

4 3 . Records should be kept and maintained of all inspections
and tests together with a record of remedial actions taken.

5. INGRESS

S p ectators should be adm itted a t a rate which is compatible
with the dispersal arrangem ents for them inside the ground.

44. Where admission to a ground or parts of it is controlled by
turnstiles, these, by their number and location, control not only the
rate of admission but, to a large extent, the dispersal of spectators
within a ground to their particular sections. Turnstiles should be of
such numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly
large crowds are kept waiting for admission and yet at no faster
rate than the arrangements for distributing spectators within the
ground permit.

45. Dangerous overcrowding can be caused if spectators are
able to force their way into a ground already full to capacity by
scaling or breaking through boundary walls or fences or the gates
in them. To avoid this danger such walls, fences and gates should
be of appropriate height and strength, and hand- or foot-holds
which might assist climbing should be avoided. They should be
regularly inspected.

46. Contingency plans should be made to deal with situations
where the available entrances at a ground have proved insufficient
to stop unduly large crowds from gathering outside. This may, for
example, include opening additional entrances, but local knowledge
of the ground, crowd patterns and advice from the police should be
taken into account in drawing up contingency plans. Larger
grounds should have intercommunication systems and metering
systems at turnstiles (see Chapter 12), and installation of a
centralised computer monitoring system may be of assistance to
management in quickly identifying particular areas of difficulty.

47. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass
through turnstiles will depend upon a variety of factors; for
example, the design and age of the equipment, the ability of the
operator and the ticketing arrangements. The admission rate will
therefore depend greatly upon local circumstances but in general.


                              20
based on observation and experience, it is unlikely that the
maximum notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 persons
per hour.

                                                                  11




6. EGRESS

There should be a sm ooth and unim peded passage through an
exit route and a free flow of people from one element to the
next until they reach the boundary of the ground.

48. It is generally recognised that a period of great risk to crowd
safety is at the time of leaving. Pressures can be set up within a
departing crowd by impatient people; such incipient pressures can
and must be contained and controlled by careful attention to the
detailed design of barriers, stairways, gangways and exits.

49. Recommendations relating particularly to egress from stands
are given in Chapter 10. Advice on the calculation of the capacity
of exit systems is contained in Chapter 16.

50. A smooth free flow through an exit route to the outside is
best achieved by controlling the crowd flow at the entrance to the
exit route, so that departing spectators are held back in a relatively
safe place eg on the terrace and gain access to the exit route at a
calculated rate. That is to say, the first part of the exit route
leading from the terrace (or other enclosure) should have a lower
capacity than any subsequent element. The exit route will then be
able to discharge people at a rate compatible with that at which
they enter into the route.

51     Where the system is not free flowing, the width of any
restricting element should be increased and/or the width of the
exit from the stand or terrace reduced to regulate the How.

52. Where deviations in design or construction from the
recommended guidelines are such as to create a manifest danger,
that section of the exit system should be closed until remedial
action has been taken, and a reduction made accordingly in the
spectator capacity of the section of the ground it serves, ie the exit
route should be excluded from the capacity calculations.

53. Care should be taken in the planning of exit systems to
ensure that in the event of an emergency which blocks the usual
exit route spectators will be able to use an alternative exit route

                              22
(including, where appropriate, forward evacuation on to the pitch:
see Chapter 11, paragraph 186).

54. There should be no "funnelling" effect causing people to
converge on a narrower means of access or egress. This will slow
down the rate at which people can pass through the entire exit
system and pack them more closely together. However, a
narrowing in the exit route is acceptable when it is preceded by an
open space or "reservoir area" where the holding capacity is
sufficient to contain safely the spectators held up because of the
difference in the flow rate into and out of the reservoir area. The
capacity of reservoir areas should be calculated using the
appropriate flow rate given in Chapter 17 and the recommended
exit time given in paragraph 56 below; a packing density of 54
persons per 10 square metres of the area available for standing
within the reservoir area is the maximum for safety. Arrangements
should be such as to prevent this being exceeded.

55. Reservoir areas should be avoided wherever possible and
should not be permitted within 45 metres of any combustible
building within the ground eg a timber stand, or within 15 metres
of any non-combustible building within the ground.

E g re s s tim e
56. Some research has indicated that when it takes more than
about 7 minutes to vacate an area of terraced spectator
accommodation, the crowd flow tends to become turbulent. In
these conditions the rate of flow may be reduced and individuals
can losp control over their own movements; there is thus higher
potential for accidents. Exits from each area of spectator
accommodation should be so designed that all spectators can
leave that area and if desired pass into a free flowing exit route
system in 8 minutes or less. The capacity of an exit route is the
number of people who could pass through restricting parts of it as
calculated in Chapter 16, paragraphs 229-232.


Note: This time is not necessarily the same as emergency
evacuation time, which is dealt with in Chapter 11, paragraphs
183-188, and which involves other considerations.

S ig n p o s tin g
57. A comprehensive system of signposting which clearly
indicates routes to the various parts of the ground, and to the exits
from the ground, should be provided. Signs relating to fire safety
should be in accordance with BS 5499: Part 1: 1984, and other
safety signs (eg first aid facilities) should be in accordance with BS
5378: Part 1: 1980. Exit gates themselves should be clearly
signposted, preferably using illuminated signs in accordance
with BS 2560 or BS 4218. Directional signs should be provided to
encourage crowds in any particular section to flow in one direction
when leaving the ground.

Exit r o u te s
58. Exit routes should be kept clear of obstructions. In particular,
no catering, sales or toilet facility should be situated in such a way
that it, or any queue it attracts, obstructs an exit route.

59. The minimum width for any section of an exit route should
be 1.1 metres. However, the required width for any particular
section is dependent on the crowd flow it will be required to carry.
(For capacities of exit routes, see Chapter 16, paragraphs 229-232).

60. Where there is a simple exit route, ie a direct passage from
the accommodation area to the exit gate from the ground, every
part of that route should be able to accommodate the flow from
the terrace or stand exit.

61. For a more complex exit system which combines a number
of exit routes and/or offers a choice of alternative routes to exits,
the system should be analysed in the form of a network in order to
check that the capacity of the exit from the terrace or the stand is
sufficient to ensure a free flow of spectators to the various exits
from the ground. Where branching of routes gives spectators a
choice of paths, the proportion of the crowd likely to use each path
should be derived from local knowledge, eg the exit closest to a
railway or bus station may be likely to attract a higher proportion
of spectators.




                               24
Exit d o o rs
62. All doors on an exit route should always be capable of
opening outwards so that crowds can escape in an emergency.
This is particularly important for doors within covered stands and
at the foot of stairways.

63. All doors on an exit route should be secured in the fully open
position before the end of play. When open, no door should
obstruct any gangway passage, stairway or landing.

64. All exit gates from the ground should also open outwards.
Where this is impracticable for existing doors, eg because it would
cause an obstruction on a public highway, the gates should be
resited (ie put further back) within the exit route they serve, or
provision made for two-way opening. Where practicable exit gates
should be sited adjacent to entrances. There should be no
obstructions eg no changes in level etc at exit doors.

65. Sliding or roller-shutter gates should not be used because
they are incapable of being opened when pressure is exerted in
the direction of crowd flow and have mechanisms or runways
which are vulnerable to jamming.

66. Where exit gates have to be secured against outside intruders
they should be fitted with panic-type bolts, but all exit gates,
unless secured in an open position, should be manned at all times
while the ground is used by the public and be capable of being
opened immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.

67. Facilities should be provided to enable people to leave the
ground at any time. For this purpose a number of reversible turn­
stiles or, preferably, pass doors, so operated as to limit the opening
to the passage to one person at a time, should be considered.
However, reversible turnstiles are not acceptable as a means of
escape from a ground and should not form any part of, or be
installed into, the normal or emergency exit system of the ground.

7. STAIRWAYS A N D RAMPS

The disposition and construction of stairways and ramps should be
such as to help provide smooth and unimpeded ingress and egress
for spectators under all conditions set out in Chapters 5 and 6.

68. The aim should be to provide stairways which minimise
hazards by such features as uniform going and rise, secure
footing, not too steep a gradient, and a width sufficient to allow
free movement but narrow enough to provide everyone with
access to a handrail. The head of the stairway should be so
designed that flow is uniform across its width and crowd
pressures cannot easily be generated. In addition flights should
not provide long, unrestricted paths down which crowd pressures
and surges can be created. Adequate separation should be
provided between channels and multi-channel stairway arrange­
ments so that there is no overspill from one channel to another.


D isp o sitio n o f sta ir w a y s
69. Stairways should be carefully positioned to take advantage
of natural light and ventilation. Where the natural lighting is
deficient the stairway should be adequately lit by artificial light
(see Chapter 3, paragraph 35).


C o n s tr u c tio n o f s ta ir w a y s
70. The width, rise and going of the steps should be uniform
within each stairway, and should ideally be uniform throughout
the entire exit system.

71. Stair treads should be provided with slip-resistant surfaces
and durable edgings. Adequate drainage should be provided.

72.     Open risers should not be used.

73. On any stairway the preferred going of treads should be
305 mm but not less than 280 mm; and preferred height of risers
should be 150 mm but not more than 190 mm.


                                       26
74.    Stairways should:

       i.     be without winders;
       ii.     be in flights of not more than 16 or fewer than 3
              steps; and
       iii.   not have more than 2 successive flights in a turn, and,
              if there are more than 12 steps in a flight, should have
              not more than one flight without a turn.

7 5 . The going of the landing between flights should not be less
than the width of the section or channel of the flight.

7 6 . Every person on a stairway should have access to a handrail.
Accordingly the minimum width of a stairway should be 1.1 metres,
stairways wider than 1.8 metres being divided as far as possible
into channels having a width of between 1.1 metres and 1.8
metres. The strength of the handrails (including supports) used to
divide a stairway into channels should be as described in Chapter 9.

7 7 . Handrails projecting not more than 100 mm should be
provided on both sides of all stairways, steps and landings at a
height of not less than 840 mm (measured vertically from the
centre of the step, or the surface of the landing).

78.   Protection should be provided on both sides of all stairs and
landings. Where next to open wells, or spaces, such protection
should be enclosed and should be not less than 1.1 metres in
height (measured vertically from the centre of the step, or the
surface of the landing). The protection should have a strength
equivalent to that of the crush barriers of the weaker type,
described in Chapter 9.


A c c e s s to s ta ir w a y s
7 9 . Access to the head of the stairways should be controlled
along the following lines to ensure a free flow c>f spectators.

8 0 . Where a stairway is divided into channels the access should
be designed to secure a uniform flow down each channel.


                                      27

81. The approach to the head of the stairs should be level and
should be so arranged that the spectators converge on the
stairway from the front and/or the sides only. There should be no
approach from behind, involving movement around the ends of the
balustrades or side walls of the stairway, except where this
approach is already controlled by physical means such as by the
gangways in the seated areas of the stand.

82. The extent of the approach in the direction of the stairway
should not be less than 1.1 metres and preferably not more than
3 metres.

83. Where restrictive elements such as barriers or gateways are
installed in the approach to a stairway in order to meet the
foregoing provisions, the total width of the passage formed by
these elements should not be more than two-thirds the minimum
width of the stairway. This is to accommodate the slower flow rate
down a staircase as compared with the flow rate on flat areas and
through portals (see Chapter 17).

84. For an application of these principles to a multiple stairway
leading direct from a terrace, see Figures 1 and 2 .

Figure 2       Exits attracting spectators from higher up the

               spectators are forced to pass around them and
               approach from the side.

85.    All exit stairways should discharge either:
       i.     at ground level and lead directly to a place of safety* in
              the open air; or
       ii.     on to walkways or concourses of adequate dimensions
               at any level provided these also lead directly to a place
               of safety in the open air.

Fire p ro te c tio n
86. This is dealt with in Chapter 11, paragraphs 180-182.

Ramps
87. The gradient should preferably be constant and not broken
by steps.

88. The maximum gradient acceptable will depend on the
particular ramp's length, purpose and usage but a ramp subject to
heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient of
1 in 10.




                            30
8. TERRACES A N D VIEW ING
   SLOPES

A rrangem ents should be m ade to encourage the even
distribution of the crowd on the terraces to provide ease of
access and egress; to control and facilitate movement,
particularly if a local emergency should arise during the event;
and to contain pressures before they reach dangerous
proportions. The provisions set out here will assist in achieving
these conditions.

89. In addition to the incidental dangers of standing for long
periods on steep terraced slopes, crowds are subject to excessive
pressures generated by spectators straining to see the event, by
excitement, or by surging deliberately induced by a certain type
of spectator.

90. Failure to provide spectators with an unobstructed view
invites them to stretch and strain, and so generates dangerous
pressures within the crowd.

91. Terraces are recognised as presenting a special safety
problem especially at football grounds. The following guidance is
therefore aimed mainly at football stadia but can be applied to any
ground where standing terraces or viewing slopes are used for
accommodating spectators.



T e rra c e s t e p s
92.  A terrace step should not be less than 280 mm or more than
380 mm wide. The preferred dimension is between 355 mm and
380 mm.

93.  The height of risers should be between 75 mm and 180 mm.
75 mm is related to the minimum width of 280 mm. If the riser
height is greater than 180 mm, a crush barrier should be provided
at the top of the riser.


                                    31




       •i
                                                            I'



94. Excessive variations in the gradient of a terrace should be
avoided. Gradients steeper than 1 in 2 could be dangerous.

95. The surface of terrace steps should be even and of a slip-
resistant material. Adequate drainage should be provided to
prevent rainwater causing deterioration.



G a n g w a y s (see Annex A)
96. The aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the
terraces is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit, so that
spectators can move quickly on to exit routes at the end of an
event or in the event of emergency. This may be achieved by a
pattern of gangways (not less than 1.1 metres wide) linked to the
exit system.


97. Spectators should be discouraged from standing in lateral
gangways because this disrupts free movement about the ground
(or within sections of it). Also, spectators on the terrace steps
behind the gangway may have their view obstructed, which will
cause them to stretch and strain, and so generate dangerous
pressures within the crowd. Spectators would be discouraged
from standing in these gangways if they were sunk from 100 mm
to 200 mm and if crush barriers were provided behind but not
immediately in front of them.


98. Similarly, spectators should be discouraged from standing in
radial gangways. These are relatively long and uncontrolled
downward paths through terraces, and are difficult to keep clear,
especially when sited in popular viewing areas, eg behind the goal
area at a football ground. It is helpful to sink them 150 mm to
200 mm and to interrupt an otherwise continuously descending
gangway by turns along, say, lateral gangways.


99. Where sinking gangways, lateral or radial, is not thought to
be practical, their boundaries should be highlighted with paint and
spectators advised by signs not to stand there. Stewards may be
needed to enforce this instruction.


                                32
100. As with other forms of stairways, the going in radial
gangways should be uniform, the step dimension as defined in
paragraph 92 and the surfaces slip-resistant.

D ivision o f s p e c t a to r a c c o m m o d a tio n
101. A ground should be divided into sections to prevent
potentially hazardous migrations by spectators. Each section of a
ground has its own limit of safe capacity (see Chapter 16), and a
major migration can cause dangerous overcrowding. Each section
of the ground, for example, each end or side, should be self
contained with its own entrances, exits and toilet/refreshment
facilities. For soccer grounds in particular there should be no
access from one such major section to another except in an
emergency. At other sporting events such as greyhound racing
spectators may need to move freely between different parts of the
ground and this should be borne in mind when considering access
to and from the sections of the ground and when considering the
need for subdivisions of sections in paragraph 103 below.

1 02. Each of the major sections should be subdivided by such
means as gangways and crush barriers, arranged so as to
minimise the sway and surge of spectators.

103. Railings, fences etc dividing sections of the ground should
be of the strength of the crush barriers, as should handrails
dividing stairways into channels as appropriate, described in
Chapter 9. Brick/block and similar solid structures lacking
sufficient mass or tensile strength are poorly suited to withstand
horizontal pressures, and where used to divide spectator accommo­
dation, should be subject to regular structural appraisal by
appropriately qualified persons (see Chapter 3).

C ru sh b a rrie rs
1 04. Detailed advice on crush barriers is given in Chapter 9.

V iew ing s lo p e s (ie n o n - s te p p e d sip p in g a r e a s p ro v id in g
s ta n d in g a c c o m m o d a tio n f o r s p e c ta to r s )
1 05. The surface of this form of terrace should be covered with a
slip-resistant material, eg packed ash, and should be even and
properly drained.

106. The desirable maximum gradient for a viewing slope is 1 in
6 (ie 9.5°). (Note: this is different to the stepped terrace gradient
quoted in paragraph 94). Viewing slopes with any steeper gradient
should have continuous crush barriers between gangways.

107. The spacing of crush barriers should be the same as for
those on normal terracing (see Chapter 9).

T e rra c e to to u c h lin e d is ta n c e
108. To prevent undue crowd pressures generated by spectators
stretching and straining for an unobstructed view, it is desirable to
provide a minimum distance between the front of the terrace and
the playing area of the pitch.

109. The minimum recommended distance between the two is 3
metres where the terrace gradient is 30° or steeper. Where the
gradient is shallower than this, it may be advisable to increase this
distance so as to enable spectators to obtain a clear view.




                                     34
9. CRUSH BARRIERS A N D
   HANDRAILS

Many of the hazards arising from crowd pressure on terraces
can be eliminated by provision of well constructed, correctly
positioned and properly m ounted crush barriers.



D im e n sio n s a n d d e s ig n f e a tu r e s
110. In order to locate the top rail against that part of the body
most able to tolerate pressure the height of crush barriers should
be between 1.02 metres and 1.12 metres above the nosing of the
step immediately behind the barrier, with a preferred height of
1.1 metres.

111. Crush barriers should be designed so that there are no sharp
projections or edges. Although a barrier with a top rail of 50 mm
internal diameter tube has been favoured at many sports grounds,
research has shown that there would be advantage in the use of a
flat rail of 100 mm vertical depth.



S p a c in g o f c r u s h b a rrie rs
112. The maximum spacing of crush barriers will be dependent
on the gradient of the terrace or viewing slope. Paragraphs
113-119 below give recommendations for the spacing and
strength of crush barriers.

113. Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the full
width of a terrace, with gaps only at the radial gangways.

114. Where barriers are not continuous between radial gangways,
the alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace
should form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. There should
be no more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line of gaps. (See
Figure 3 overleaf).

115. Where there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these
should be at least 1.1 metres and not more than 1.4 metres
in width.

116. Column A in Table 1 opposite provides the maximum
distances between barriers conforming to the greater strength
requirements of crush barriers as described above; column B
provides the maximum distances between barriers conforming to
the lesser strength requirements. Interpolation may be made
between these figures.

117. A distinction is made between barrier intervals required in
"peak" viewing areas. The term "peak” viewing areas describes
the most popular parts of the terraces where there is a tendency
for spectators to crowd together and become so emotionally
involved in the occasion that their reactions can cause additional
pressures to be set up in those sections of the ground. The peak
viewing areas are particularly associated with football grounds and
are typically behind the goal areas, although other parts of the
terraces known locally may come within this category.

118. Existing crush barriers and handrails should be capable of
resisting the forces indicated in the existing test load columns of
Table 2 overleaf when applied in a test as described in Annex C.
Where existing crush barriers and handrails fail to meet these test
conditions, they should be replaced or strengthened in such a way
as to do so. Barriers and handrails so strengthened should be
retested in accordance with Annex C.

119. New crush barriers or handrails should be designed to resist
safely a horizontal force as indicated in the "new design force"
column in Table 2 applied as a static load acting on the top rail of
the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal axis. The
foundations of new barriers or handrails should be designed to
resist the overturning movements and sliding forces, induced by
the forces described in the "new design force" column overleaf,
with a factor of safety of 2.

10. ROOFED STANDS WITH
    SEATED ACCOM M O DATIO N

The general safety considerations for stands are similar to those
for other parts of the ground but with the additional need to
safeguard spectators against the risk of fire (see Chapter 11).

1 2 0 . Stands may consist of seated accommodation only or may
contain a mixture of both seated and standing areas. The following
advice can be applied to all sports grounds where spectators are
so accommodated.

1 2 1 . There is generally a less hurried departure from the seated
accommodation in stands at the end of an event. Moreover,
spectators are induced by the layout of the seats to form orderly
queues. Even so, attention should be paid to the points below as well
as the other structural considerations in respect of stairways, exits,
egress and, where appropriate, density levels and crush barriers.

1 2 2 . Fire safety is particularly important and is dealt with in
Chapter 11. Every stand should be provided with sufficient exits to
allow for the orderly evacuation of all the spectators to be
accommodated. Evacuation time will depend to a large extent on
the fire hazard present in the stand (see Chapter 11, paragraphs
183-188). Egress time (see Chapter 6, paragraph 56) should be no
longer than 8 minutes using the calculations in Chapter 16, but
the emergency evacuation time is an overriding criterion when
calculating the allowable capacity of a stand (see Chapter 11,
paragraph 183).

1 2 3 . Seats and gangways should be so positioned as to provide
ready access to exits. No person in any part of a stand should have
to travel more than 30 metres to the nearest exit from a stand.

1 2 4 . All seats should be securely fixed in position. The use of
tip-up seats allows more circulation space, the automatic type
being preferable.


                                     39
125. The minimum area allotted to each seated person should be
4 60 mm wide and 610 mm deep; but for comfort these
measurements should be 550 mm and 760 mm respectively. To
enable people to move freely between rows of seats, there should
be at least 305 mm between perpendiculars from the foremost
projection of one seat and the back of the seat in front of it. (The
minimum of 305 mm is included in the 610 mm or 760 mm depth
measurement of the seating area.)

126. The number of seats in a row should not normally exceed:
        a.      14 seats where there is a gangway at one end only; and

        b.      28 seats where there is a gangway at both ends.

1 27. Gangways should be of sufficient width for the seats served,
but in no case less than 1.1 metres wide (ie 2 unit widths) without
projections.

B alu stra d in g
1 28. Those sections of balustrading at the foot of stairways or
gangways within stands should be as strong as crush barriers of
the stronger type (see Chapter 9).

T e m p o ra ry s ta n d s a n d o th e r te m p o r a r y s tr u c t u r e s
129. The nature of temporary stands and other temporary
structures, whether or not covered, used to accommodate
spectators at a sports ground is likely to vary considerably as will
the materials used in their construction. Some may be erected for
a single event only. Even so there is no justification for accepting a
lower standard of safety in such structures than elsewhere within
the sports ground, and the design and construction of temporary                 <
structures should be in accordance with good engineering and
building practice, should pay particular regard to public safety and
should satisfy all relevant British Standards.

130. The principles of this Guide are applicable to temporary
stands and structures and particular attention is drawn to:
        Chapter 3       - General Fabric and Structural Matters
        Chapter 6       - Egress


                                       40
      Chapter 4 - Stairways and Ramps
      Chapter 11 - Fire Safety
      Chapter 1 7 - Recommended Flow Rates

1 3 1 . All temporary stands should be capable of withstanding any
load or force to which they may be subjected and account should
be taken of. any external factors such as wind forces. Failure of any
one support member or connection should not render the
structure unstable. As far as practicable the area around supporting
frames should be secured to prevent unauthorised access, and
frames should be so designed that they are firmly locked into
position and cannot be tampered with by unauthorised persons.

1 3 2 . Consultation with the local authority and building authority
(if different) should take place at an early stage prior to the erection
of any temporary stand.

1 3 3 . Siting. Choice of location may be limited but factors which
need to be considered include: load-bearing capability of the
ground, its slope or unevenness, drainage, availability of mains
services, access/egress for spectators and for emergency vehicles,
overhead power lines, and the proximity of surrounding buildings
in relation to the risk of fire. The condition of the site should be
regularly checked to ensure its load-bearing capabilities have not
deteriorated; settlement of ground may cause instability and so
require repacking and re-levelling. The site should be prepared and
maintained so as to provide an even surface for those parts to
which the public have access.

1 3 4 . Assembly/dismantling. The assembly and dismantling of
stands should be carried out by or under the supervision of
persons experienced and trained in the proper performance of
such work and in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions
whenever available, or in accordance with drawings and plans
made by a competent engineer.

1 35. Work should be carried out only where lighting is sufficient
to allow it to be safely and properly performed and checked. No
assembly or dismantling work should be carried out to the danger
of members of the public in the vicinity.

                                      41
136. The work should be carried out in a proper manner, using
correct parts, and tools of a proper size and design. Care should be
taken with the handling of components to avoid damage or distortion.

137. All components should be closely examined during assembly
and dismantling for signs of wear, deformation or other damage,
and where necessary replaced by sound components of matching
material properties and dimensions. Temporary repairs using
makeshift components should be avoided.

138. Care should also be given to ensure all components are
correctly aligned; they should not be bent, distorted or otherwise
altered to force a fit.

139. On completion, assembly work should be checked with
particular attention given to fastenings and connections.

140. Tents/marquees and other such structures. These types of
structures can present special fire safety problems and guidance
will be contained in the Home Office/Scottish Office publication
"Guide to Fire Precautions in Existing Places of Entertainment"*.

141. All tents should be capable of withstanding any forces,
particularly wind (including uplift so caused) and those caused by
the build up of snow or heavy rain, to which they may be subjected.
Emergency arrangements should be made for the dismantling,
either partial or total, of a tent should conditions arise that could
lead to any collapse or distortion. Where such work in any way
affects the stability of the tent or the safety of members of the
public, the work should not commence until the immediate area
has been cleared of all but essential staff.

142. Supporting poles, guy ropes and stays should be used as
necessary and correctly formed, and secure anchorages made to
the ground to ensure that the tent is stable and maintains its
correct shape.


‘ Expected to be available in 1987.


                             42
143. The stability of the main tent poles and supporting structure
should be independent of the sheeting fabric, ie any tearing or
defect occurring in the fabric should not result in the collapse of all
or any part of the main structure.

144. Particular attention should be paid to the main supporting
poles and top braces of large tents where they have to be raised to a
considerable height. Damage or distortion to these members could
considerably weaken the structure. Where such damage does
occur, the members should be replaced or repairs or modifications
carried out so as to bring them up to full working strength.

1 45. Where solid frames or units, eg doors, are linked to a tent
structure they should be rigidly formed and adequately braced, and
care should be taken that they do not overstress local areas of
the tent.

146. Foundations to poles or frames should be properly prepared
and subjected to regular checks as should wire bracing or guys,
the tension of which should be re-adjusted as necessary.

11. FIRE SAFETY

S afety from fire is achieved by m easures which will restrict
initiation, rate of early grow th and later spread of fire; provide
and protect escape routes; segregate higher fire risk areas;
provide warning (and w here necessary detection) of fire; and
assist fire-fighting operations.

147. The type of accommodation which represents the greatest
hazard in the event of fire is the covered stand where spectators
sit or stand. New structures will conform to Building Regulations
requiring them to have a reasonable degree of structural fire
protection. Existing structures will vary considerably in age and
materials used in construction. The qualities of combustibility and
ability to propagate and spread fire of the materials used in
construction have an important effect on the standard of fire
precautions required to ensure reasonable safety. It may be
difficult in some cases to improve the fire resistance of an existing
structure to any significant extent but it should be done wherever
practicable even though in some cases substantial alterations may
be needed to provide reasonable protection from fire.


148. With new stands there is much more opportunity to
incorporate from the start comprehensive measures for fire safety,
considering properly the impact of each measure on the others.
Design features for new stands should include the following:

      a.    internal finishes which have low flammability;
      b.    seating, partitioning and any other fixed or removable
            contents including seat cushions which possess low
            flammability characteristics and fire risk potential and
            are limited in amount;

      c.    contents which are not capable of being easily
            dismantled;
      d.    no inaccessible places where litter can collect;
      e.    adequate structural resistance to fire;


                              44
      f.    fire resisting separation from any spaces below or
             communicating with the stand;

      g.    as far as possible, no storerooms or other spaces
             communicating with the stand. Where this is unavoid­
             able, storerooms or other spaces communicating with
             the stand should be provided with fixed fire extinguish-
           ■ ing systems appropriate to the fire risk posed by the
             materials to be stored or contained;

      h.    escape routes which are planned to keep people well
            clear of the smoky gases produced by a fire (which in
            general means that initial movement of people should
            be downwards);
      i.    later stages of escape routes which are incapable of
             being significantly threatened by continuing fire;
      j.    the provision of alternative, widely separated escape
             routes; and
      k.    a roof geometry which should restrict smoke and
            flame travel along the underside of the roof.




M inim ising fire risk
149. One potential cause of fire arises from the accumulation of
waste paper, programmes, food and drink cartons etc dropped by
spectators. Such waste can be easily set alight by smokers'
materials and the resulting fire may then spread to the structure,
especially the ones that are constructed of more combustible
materials. Every effort should be made to reduce this hazard.
Accumulations of litter, for example near catering facilities, should
be cleared from the ground as quickly as possible or kept in a safe,
fire resistant container or room pending clearance.

150. All parts of buildings should be inspected before and after an
event (see also Chapter 4, paragraph 42) and any accumulation of
litter cleared away as described above. It is particularly important
to ensure that litter does not accumulate in escape routes or
under stands.


                                    45
    161. Smoking should be discouraged in stands containing
    combustible or flammable products, either loose (eg cushions) or
    fixed (eg seating), or in the fabric of the building.

    152. A common feature in construction of stands which is a fire
    risk is the existence of voids under the seating and under the
    flooring itself. These voids can become a resting place for paper,
    cartons and other combustible materials which can be ignited,
    unnoticed, by carelessly discarded cigarette ends etc. Seating
    arrangements should, wherever possible, be such that floor
    surfaces are accessible for the removal of litter. Where voids
    below flooring exist they should if practicable be excluded; for
    example, where a stand is built into a natural slope the
    underneath area can be filled in with concrete. Where thip is not
    practicable they should be completely sealed off to stop litter
    accumulating in them, or be entirely open to allow easy access for
    inspection and removal of combustible waste.

    153. Other items, such as cushions filled with cellular foams or
    other synthetic materials are a fire risk because they are
    combustible, and when set alight can give off large quantities of
    smoke and fumes. Also, the use of large quantities of plastics in
    seating should be reviewed carefully, particularly where cellular
    polymers may be proposed. The fire authority should be consulted
    about the fire risk in stands.


    154. Cushions and other flammable materials represent in bulk a
    risk of a swiftly developing fire. They should be stored in a fire-
    resistant container or room well away from spectator accommodation
    as should paper items such as programmes. Similarly, hazardous
    materials, for example fuels (whether in containers or within fuel
    tanks and machinery) fertilizers, weed killers and paints should be
    kept (if at all) well away from public areas and stored in a room
    which has fire resistance of at least 1 hour. Other high fire risk
    areas, eg enclosed or underground car parks situated under stands,
    should also have fire resistance of at least 1 hour.

    155. Where catering facilities are provided, special care should be
    taken to ensure that any fuel or power supply used for cooking, for


                                 46




L
example LPG cylinders, is safely stored and used, in accordance
with the advice of the authority responsible for enforcement of the
Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. Useful guidance is given in
Health and Safety Executive Guidance Notes CS4, 'The Keeping of
LPG in Cylinders and Similar Containers" and CS8, "Small Scale
Storage and Display of LPG at Retail Premises''.

P re v e n tio n o r r e ta r d a tio n o f fire g r o w t h / s p r e a d
156. Where, despite all precautions, a fire has started, it is vital to
ensure that the rate of growth in its early stages is restricted to
proportions which will not overwhelm the arrangements provided
for safe escape. This is best achieved by controlling the amount and
nature of the materials (especially the combustibles) in a stand,
both in terms of the contents (loose and fixed) and in those parts of
the fabric of the stand to which a fire would have access (especially
internal linings). An important additional line of defence is prompt
action by ground staff using the fire-fighting equipment available at
the ground to tackle the fire and keep it in check ("first-aid" fire­
fighting) until the fire brigade arrives. These measures are crucial
because the quicker a fire develops, the less time there is available
to escape from it. A fire should not be able to develop unnoticed
anywhere underneath or adjacent to the spectator area of the
stand, so that its spread would be likely to break through into the
spectator accommodation.

1 57. The spectator area in the stand should be separated from any
other adjacent circulation space or void by a construction having
fire resistance of not less than half an hour.
              »


158. Walls and ceiling Mnings within stands and ceiling linings
beneath the stand seats should have a flame spread classification
of not less than Class 1 when tested in accordance with BS 476:
Part 7.


1 59. Restricting the extent and speed of the spread of fire in its
later stages is also important in order to reduce the possibility of
escape time being further threatened. Most measures which
reduce the rate of fire growth in the early stages will also serve to
restrict the fire spread in the later stages. The following measures


                                                47
would mainly affect the later spread. For some roof configurations
venting systems may offer a means of reducing the spread of fire
(including movement of flames along the roof) and hot smoky
gases. The science of fire and smoke venting is however complex
and advice from the fire authority should be sought on whether
this would be advantageous in a particular case.

1 60. Where the roofs of buildings are so connected that smoke
and flame could travel essentially two or more sides of the playing
area, a wide break in the roof should be made of sufficient width to
prevent spread from one side to the other, unless the flame travel
could be eliminated by the prevention measures mentioned above.

161. Use of flammable roof materials should be avoided*. Where
they do exist they should be replaced where practicable by non­
combustible materials or should be underdrawn with non­
combustible board.



Fire w a rn in g s y s te m s
1 62. All buildings in the ground (including stands) to which public
or staff have access should be provided with an electrical fire
warning system to alert staff. An indication of the warning and its
location should be given to a central control point (see Chapter 12,
paragraph 193). The system should conform with BS 5839: Part 1
in terms of its components, installation and maintenance. The
central control point and, where necessary, other selected
positions in the ground should have facilities to call the fire
brigade and other emergency services. Stewards and other
officials should be trained in what they should do if they discover a
fire (see paragraphs 176-177).

163. The area underneath the spectator accommodation should
have a system for detecting a developing fire. In order to give an
early warning in an unoccupied area an automatic fire detection
(AFD) system should be considered, conforming to BS 5839: Part 1
in terms of its components, installation and maintenance. It should
be connected so that any alarm will be communicated to the
central control point.


                                48
164. Any fire detection equipment should be tested regularly in
accordance with the advice given in the British Standard
specification.

165. Where areas of high fire risk such as large storerooms and
enclosed or underground car parks are situated under stands,
consideration should be given to the installation of an automatic
fire extinguishing system, eg sprinklers, instead of an AFD system.
Here again any such system should be connected so that warning
of fire is communicated to the central control point.

E m e rg e n c y lig h tin g
166. Emergency lighting, for use in the event of failure of the
general lighting, should be provided in all parts of the premises
accessible to the public and along all exit routes, with exit signs
clearly illuminated. Installation should be in accordance with
BS 5266: Part 1. The system should be completely separate from
the general lighting system, although a one-circuit system
incorporating staggered sub-circuits would be an acceptable
alternative. Unless exceptionally two entirely independent supplies
can be obtained from outside sources, the emergency circuit
should be connected to a source of power located on the premises,
for example storage batteries or a diesel generator, with a delay of
not more than 5 seconds.

167. The system should be capable of maintaining the necessary
level of illumination for a period of 3 hours from the time of failure
of the normal supply.
              »

168. The emergency lighting should operate automatically on the
failure of the main lighting.


169. Emergency lighting systems should be tested regularly in
accordance with BS 5266: Part 1.

F ire-fig h tin g e q u ip m e n t
1 70. Advice should be sought from the local fire authority on the
type, the amount and siting of fire-fighting equipment. The
succeeding paragraphs give general guidelines.


                                     49
171. In major grounds it may be necessary to provide a suitable
water supply for fire fighting in the form of hydrants.

172. For "first aid" fire fighting by members of the staff, hydraulic
hose-reels should be provided to BS 5306: Part 1. These should be
sufficient to provide adequate protection to the whole floor area,
and should be installed in a suitable position by entrances, exits
and stairways.

173. Where hose-reels are not provided, portable fire extinguishers
should be installed in sufficient numbers to give adequate cover.
The number and type will depend upon the size, layout, fire
separation and risk in each structure. Fire extinguishers should
conform to BS 5423 and be sited and maintained according to
BS 5306: Part 3.

174. Fire blankets and fire extinguishers of a type appropriate to
the cooking facilities used should be kept in all catering facilities.

175. It should be borne in mind when considering location of fire­
fighting equipment that it may need to be sited so that it cannot be
vandalised but yet is readily accessible to staff in the event of fire.



E m e rg e n c y p r o c e d u r e s a n d s ta f f tra in in g
176. It is essential that plans should be made for dealing with
emergencies, including fire. The onus to do this lies with ground
management. Joint consultation between management, police,
fire, ambulance and other emergency services should take place in
order to produce agreed plans of action for all foreseeable types of
emergency. While the public are in the ground the number of staff
on duty should be sufficient to cover entrances, exits and other
strategic points and to fulfil other essential duties (see Chapter 13).

177. All such staff should be trained in the use of the fire-fighting
equipment provided, and in the action they should take in the
event of fire. This is management's responsibility but the local fire
authority's advice should be sought on whether the content of the
proposed training programme is adequate.


                                      50
M ean s of e s c a p e
1 7 8 . "Means of escape" is the structural means whereby a safe
route is provided for people to travel from any point in a structure
to a place of safety without outside assistance. In a sports ground,
the means of escape in the event of an emergency will usually be
the same as the normal egress routes plus any additional "route"
of forward escape on to the playing area. The kind of emergency
most likely to occur at a sports ground is fire but other types of
emergency, such as bomb threat, may arise which might
necessitate the evacuation of spectators from all or part of the
spectator accommodation. It is the management's responsibility to
ensure that all exit routes for use in an emergency are capable of
being safely and effectively used at all times when the ground
is occupied.


1 7 9 . It is vital that the emergency exit routes are sited so that
people using them will be least affected by the fire or its products,
for example smoke, toxic gases, heat etc. Initial travel should if
possible be downwards. This is because in the event of fire, its
dangerous products will travel upwards and accumulate densely at
the highest points. Further stages of the exit routes should be so
arranged as to take people progressively further away from the
fire, along a route where they cannot be significantly affected by
the fire or its products. There should be more than one emergency
exit route from a stand or a terrace in case one becomes blocked.
The emergency exits within any one structure should be as widely
separated as practical planning considerations will allow, to
minimise .the risk of them all being blocked by the same cause.

Fire p r o te c tio n fo r s ta ir w a y s a n d p a s s a g e s
1 8 0 . Where a stairway, passage or any other part of an
emergency exit route passes up, down or through a stand or other
building used by spectators, it should be in a fire resistant
enclosure separated from the remainder of the stand by a
structure having fire resistance of not less than one hour. Such
exit routes should discharge to a place of safety in the open air
(which may be inside or outside the ground).

1 8 1 . The surface finish of walls and ceilings of all emergency exit

                                     51
stairways should be of a standard corresponding to Class 0 (as
defined in the guidance issued in connection with the Building
Regulations 1985 for England and Wales and the Building
Standards (Scotland) Regulations 1981-84).

1 8 2 . Any door forming part of the enclosure to a stairway should
be self closing and have a fire resistance of not less than half an hour.


E m e rg e n c y e v a c u a tio n tim e
1 8 3 . The emergency evacuation time is the notional time it would
take spectators to leave their viewing positions and reach a place of
safety in the open air or a protected stairway or emergency exit
route with fire resistance in accordance with paragraph 180. It is
calculated from the spectator capacity of the accommodation (see
Chapter 16) and the flow rate (see Chapter 17) through restricting
parts of the exit system used for evacuation purposes.

1 8 4 . The emergency evacuation time should not be confused with
the egress time of 8 minutes (referred to in Chapter 6, paragraph 56)
which is the maximum time it should take spectators to enter into
the normal exit system from their viewing positions at the end
of play.

1 85 . The emergency evacuation time will depend largely on the
fire hazard present in the accommodation in question. Any stand
which has a potential for rapid fire spread because of its interior
use and contents and/or the nature of its internal surfaces which
would be exposed to fire should have an emergency evacuation
time of no more than 2'/2 minutes. An increase in this time may
however be acceptable where the interior use and contents, and
the nature of the internal linings, are such as to eliminate the
possibility of rapid fire spread, and the emergency exit routes are
not vulnerable to a fire occurring within the accommodation. In
setting an emergency evacuation time longer than 2'/2 minutes the
advice of the fire authority should be sought.

1 8 6 . Where the playing area or perimeter track is accessible to
spectators and is considered suitable as a place of safety,
evacuation onto it can be taken into account in calculating the


                               52
emergency evacuation time. Where there is a pitch perimeter
fence or wall it should have access points in accordance with
Chapter 15, paragraph 215 which can serve as exits and which
can be taken into account in the calculation of the emergency
evacuation time.

1 8 7 . Where the playing surface of a pitch is made of synthetic
materials, advice from the fire authority should be sought to
establish if it can be properly considered a place of safety in a fire.
This is because it is possible that some forms of artificial turf
might in themselves constitute a hazard in the event of fire
because of flamespread and fumes etc caused by decomposition of
the material as a result of heat radiation.

1 8 8 . The playing area may not be a place of safety, eg if it is
wholly surrounded by covered accommodation with no breaks in
the roofing (see paragraph 160) and the advice of the fire authority
should be sought in such circumstances.

A c c e s s fo r e m e rg e n c y v eh ic le s
1 8 9 . Adequate roads for emergency vehicles such as fire
appliances and ambulances should be provided so that speedy and
direct access can be obtained to all buildings within the ground;
wherever possible these access routes should be separate from
those used by spectators entering and leaving the ground.

1 9 0 . The local fire authority should be consulted about the width,
clearance, height and supporting strength required of these access
roads. Wherever possible access roads should provide for the
parking of Emergency vehicles so that exit routes used by crowds
are not seriously obstructed.

19 1 . Wherever practicable and where necessary roads within %
of a mile of the ground should be kept entirely free of parked
vehicles so as not to delay or obstruct the access of emergency
vehicles.




                                     53
12. C O M M U N IC A TIO N S

There should be a com m unications system capable of clearly
relaying essential m essages to all parts of the ground in both
normal circumstances and in an emergency.

1 92 . Precise requirements for communications will depend on the
sort of ground and the numbers of people that attend there. In
general the communications system should be determined after
consultation with the police and emergency services. It should be
available for use and capable of coping with all emergencies.

19 3 . A central control point, preferably a room, should be set
aside for the use of the supervising police officer and the ground
safety officer.


194 . At larger grounds the following arrangements are likely to
be needed:

     i.     There should be inter-communication between the
            central control and all turnstiles or banks of turnstiles
            and all entry and exit gates used by the public.
     ii.    Metering systems to record all admissions should be
            installed at turnstiles and, to ensure that ground
            capacities are not exceeded in any section, arrange­
            ments should be made for central control to be
            informed immediately a predetermined number of
            spectators has been admitted through each turnstile.

     iii.   Public address equipment should be installed so that
            broadcast messages can be heard under reasonable
            conditions (including emergencies) by all persons of
            normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the
            public has access. The system should be capable of
            being controlled from the central control point and
            should ideally be capable of addressing messages to
            each major section of the ground. The power supply to
            the system should be such as to enable it to continue


                              54
      to operate in an emergency such as fire or a failure of
      the mains supply.

iv.   Loud hailers should be available for the use of
      stewards and police in directing or instructing
      spectators.

v.    Any police radio facilities available for the maintenance
      of law and order should augment and not supersede
      the ground communications system.
vi.   Installation of closed circuit television is considered
      likely to be of significant value in assisting emergency
      evacuation.




                              55
13. STEWARDING

Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding in sections
of the ground, reduce the likelihood and incidence of disorder,
help disperse spectators in such a way as to reduce crowd
pressure and provide the m eans to investigate, report and take
early action in an emergency.

195. Manning levels and stewarding requirements will vary
depending upon the size and configuration of the ground, the
nature of the event and crowd levels, but there are five basic
duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:
      a.    controlling or directing members of the public who are
            entering or leaving the ground, to help achieve an even
            flow of people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal
            of spectators on the terraces or viewing slopes.
      b.    patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies eg
            raising alarms or extinguishing fires;
      c.    manning entrances, exits and other strategic points,
            especially exit doors and gates which are not
            continuously open whilst the ground is in use;
      d.    assisting police as appropriate or as requested with
            crowd control; and
      e.    undertaking specific duties in an emergency.

1 9 6 A more detailed check list of the kind of duties which
stewards are liable to undertake is at Annex B. It should be borne
in mind that this is only an example and not necessarily an
exhaustive list of duties.

197. Stewards should be fully capable of carrying out the duties
allocated to them. Every steward should be fully appraised in
writing of his duties and responsibilities and should carry on him a
general check list of them. Where a ground such as one used by
an association football league club has a high police presence,


                              56
duties and responsibilities of stewards should be agreed with the
police. Stewards should attend pre-match briefing and should be
made aware as necessary of the arrangements and any
contingency plans to deal with the arrival of away supporters.

1 9 8 . Effective training and supervision should be provided by man­
agement so that all stewards, whether regular or casual, know not
only what their duties are but how to carry them out and why. This
is especially important in emergencies when it is essential that
stewards and their supervisors are fully aware of and practised in
the part they are to play in the plans drawn up with the emergency
services (see Chapter 11, paragraph 176).

1 9 9 . Exercises should be carried out so as to ensure that
emergency procedures operate smoothly, and a record kept of the
duration of the exercise, details of the instruction given and by whom.

2 0 0 . Management should appoint a chief steward responsible for
coordinating responsibilities of all stewards. Control of stewards
should be from a central point with an efficient means to
communicate with the stewards (see also Chapter 12).

2 0 1 . All stewards should be readily identifiable eg by the wearing
of distinctive clothing (including armbands).




                                      57
14. CROWD CONTROL

Where there is a disorderly element am ong th e crowd intent on
violence, additional safety measures are needed to contain and
minimise the potential disruption, to isolate quickly, identify
and remove the offenders and to prevent their re-entry on
future occasions.

2 02 . Although the problem of crowd disorder at sporting events is
one which affects primarily professional association football, other
sports are not immune from it. Therefore, whilst the following
advice is directed mainly at those grounds where professional
association football is played, the general principles shouldalso be
borne in mind by management at other grounds where major
spectator sports are played.

203. The 'European Convention on Spectator Violence and Mis­
behaviour at Sporting Events and in particular at Football Matches'
(HMSO, Cmnd 9649), which came into force on 1 November 1985,
sets out in general terms the measures to be taken to prevent and
control violence by spectators. Additionally, some sports' governing
bodies have issued their own guidance on crowd control. For
example, the Football Association has issued a 'Memorandum to
Football League Clubs On Crowd Management' which sets out the
measures that must be taken at all League grounds, and UEFA has
issued binding instructions in their document 'Order and Security
in the Stadia' (Third Edition, 1985) which apply to matches in their
competitions. The following paragraphs cover some of the main
areas that require the attention of ground management. The
advice they contain is not comprehensive and is intended to
supplement rather than replace existing instructions, codes of
practice etc.

Policing
2 04 . As in other areas of safety, management is responsible for
the crowd control arrangements and ground conditions. They
should ensure that spectators are safe bearing in mind that a game



                             58
can lead to a build-up of tension or excitement. The safety
measures described elsewhere in this Guide will help to achieve
reasonable spectator safety, but for management to discharge its
responsibility properly a special police presence inside the ground
may be necessary to deal with any problem of disorder which may
arise, as well as to provide support and leadership in an emergency.
The number and disposition of the police must be determined by
Chief Constables who have the sole responsibility for the direction
of police operations. To aid the police in their duties, a police control
room should be provided within the ground.

2 0 5 . Proper advance planning with the police is essential to
counter potential crowd disorder. There must be an effective
liaison between club and police for this purpose to including not
just the arrangements inside the ground but also the escort of
visiting supporters, their likely numbers, their separate entry to the
ground and their departure at the end of the match. There should
be debriefing meetings as necessary to evaluate existing
arrangements and provide the flexibility necessary to deal with
different circumstances.

C ro w d m o v e m e n t
2 0 6 . Crowd movement on terraces should be strictly controlled in
order to give the police the fullest opportunity for crowd control.
Less problems occur when terraces are subdivided as far as
possible into sections by use of both radial and lateral barriers or
railings which should comply with the strength requirements set
out in Chapter 9. Each section should ideally be self contained and
should be serviced by its own entrance/exits, refreshment facilities
and toilets (in keeping with the principles of general ground
division described in Chapter 8, paragraph 101). Special care is
needed to ensure that sections and subdivisions are provided with
sufficient exits for use in an emergency.

2 0 7 . Home and visiting supporters at professional soccer matches
should normally be segregated but segregation is not advocated
for other sports where crowd disorder is not a problem. This
should be borne in mind when considering barriers at grounds
used for other sports as well as association football.



                                       59
208. Where possible a neutral or sterile zone should be provided
within a ground so that home and visiting supporters are not
physically close to each other. The arrangements for admitting
spectators into the ground, whether by tickets purchased in
advance or through payment at the turnstiles, should be drawn up
in consultation with the police, and must be carefully controlled to
ensure as far as possible that segregation is effective and known
troublemakers are excluded.



209 . Access to the pitch must be made as difficult as possible in
normal circumstances while at the same time ensuring that the
police have effective access to the terraces for the purpose of crowd
control and enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the
event of serious emergency (see also Chapter 11, paragraph 186).
Where a pitch perimeter barrier fence is installed to keep spectators
off the pitch, care is needed to ensure that it does not impair the
visibility of the playing area from the terraces. If spikes or barbed
wire are installed they should if possible be at a height of no less
than 2.4 metres (see Chapter 3, paragraph 33). One alternative to
fencing is the construction around the pitch of a wall with a smooth
surface which should not be less than 1.22 metres in height on the
terrace side. This boundary wall should have gates or access points
to the pitch which could be manned by the police or stewards. A
walkway between the boundary wall and the terraces, which would
be solely occupied by the police, first aid and official club personnel,
has been found to be effective as regards safety and security. In
order to achieve this it might be necessary to remove one or two
rows of terracing and to protect the walkway from the terrace by a
continuous line of barriers, so designed as to discourage access to
the walkway except at authorised points. The access points from
terrace to walkway should be directly linked with the access points
from the walkway to the pitch. Where a walkway system is in use,
sliding gates may be installed at the access points from the
walkway to the pitch, ie where there can be no crowd pressure
against them (see Chapter 6, paragraph 65 regarding the use of
sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the pitch is usually
unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing area.
D e te n tio n a n d rem o v al o f tr o u b le m a k e r s
2 1 0 . At larger soccer grounds, particularly where there has been
a record of frequent crowd trouble, secure detention rooms may be
necessary for use by the police.

2 1 1 . There should be adequate vehicular access for the
unobtrusive, removal of detainees (see also Chapter 11, paragraphs
189-191 on access for emergency vehicles).

R e f r e s h m e n ts
2 1 2 . Hard containers such as glasses, bottles or cans can make
dangerous missiles and should not be used for the sale of refresh­
ments. All refreshments should be served in soft containers.

2 1 3 . Alcohol should not be on sale for consumption on the
terraces or in the stands.
Note: The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985
applies to any ground in England and Wales used for an inter­
national association football match or a match involving a football
league club. In Scotland the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980
applies to grounds used by clubs in the Scottish Football League,
Highland League and to the international stadia used for
association football and Rugby Union.




                                            61
 15. PITCH PERIMETER
     FENCE/W ALL

A pitch perimeter fence/w all may not only delineate the playing
area from the spectator accomm odation but may have to serve
as a crush barrier, or in som e situations as a barrier to discourage
or prevent access to the playing area except in an emergency.

214. The type, strength and height of a pitch perimeter fence or
wall will vary according to its location and required function. At one
extreme, at a certain type of ground or small stadium used by very
few spectators, there may be no need for a perimeter fence or wall
at all; or if such a wall or fence exists it may need to consist of little
more than a rail to mark the playing area. At the other extreme, at
some major soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement
forms a necessary part of the safety measures, it may be necessary
to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
circumstances (see also Chapter 14, paragraph 209) but allows for
access in emergency. Even at these grounds however specification
of the pitch fence may vary for different parts of the ground.

215 . For most major stadia, whether used for association football
or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to
prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to
discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates
or other access points (minimum width 1.1 metres) should
nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency and, at those
grounds where a perimeter track is used as part of the exit system,
for the departure of spectators at the end of an event. Provision of
such gates or access points is particularly important to allow full
access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should
be properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access
to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured. .


216. If spectators can lean on the perimeter fence it should be
deemed a crush barrier and fulfil the conditions of height and


                               62
strength specified in Chapter 9 although if the fence is of solid
construction its height may be more than 1.12 metres. This is
because the pressures acting on a person forced against such a
fence are distributed over a large area of the body, unlike the
situation with a normal crush barrier, where the pressures
are localized.




                                  63
16. ESTIM ATION OF SAFE
    GROUND CAPACITY

To assess the num ber of spectators which can be safely
accom m odated acco u nt should be taken of the features of the
individual ground, its configuration, general condition, use and
any deviations from the Guide's provisions.

2 1 7 . The previous sections of the Guide give guidelines and
safety considerations for individual features of a ground. This
section suggests a method of calculating the number of people
that can be safely accommodated when taking into account
interactions between these individual features and where there
are deviations from the guidelines. The following paragraphs
contain as of necessity generalised guidelines in view of the wide
variety of types, sizes, configurations of sports grounds, their use
and general condition.


218 . To facilitate the calculations a plan of the ground should be
available with such details as exits, stands, terraces, stairways,
passages, kiosks, seats and barriers. A scale of 1:200 is
appropriate for this purpose.


2 1 9 . The method assesses:
      a.   the holding capacity of a terrace or viewing slope (that
           of a seated area generally being determined by the
           number of seats when it conforms to guidelines); and
      b.   the capacity of a given exit route from a terrace or stand.


2 2 0 . The number of people that can be safely accommodated on a
terrace or in a stand (or other covered accommodation) is either its
holding capacity, or the capacity of the exit system to be used in
normal circumstances at the end of an event (assessed in
accordance with paragraphs 229-232 below) or the emergency
exit system whichever is the smallest.


                               64
T e rra c e s a n d v ie w in g s lo p e s
2 21 . Where crush barriers meet the strength and spacing guide­
lines of Chapter 9 the capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should
be assessed from the area available for standing by allowing a
packing density of between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square
metres depending upon the condition of the terrace or slope. Only
those parts, of the terrace or viewing slope from which the whole
of the playing area can be seen, excluding gangways, should be
included in this calculation.


2 22 . The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:
       a.    54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or
             viewing slope is in good condition (as set out in Chapter 8);
             and

       b.    27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially
             deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to
             constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely packed.


223 . It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures
where conditions fall between the two extremes. When the
positioning and length of gangways do not meet with the
recommendations of Chapter 8, paragraphs 96-100, an appropri­
ate reduction should be made in the area available for standing.


2 2 4 . Even distribution of spectators on the terrace may be difficult
to overcdme notwithstanding the measures in this guide because
spectators may prefer to gather in a certain part or parts of a
terrace. Ground management should therefore take such factors
into account when assessing safe capacity levels.

225 . The capacity of the terrace is calculated by multiplying the
area available for standing by the appropriate packing density. The
following formula may be used:

       Capacity (Number of persons) A_ x (27 to 54)
                                             10
where 'A' is the area available for standing in square metres.


                                             65
Example A
Peak Viewing Terrace
Barriers and pitch perimeter wall conform to Guide's recommen­
dations on both strength and spacing.
Area for standing 700m 2 (100m x 7m ) (excluding designated
gangways)
Condition and drainage of terraces good.

Dimensions: steps 375 mm (Guide recommends 280m m -375 mm,
            see Chapter 8, paragraph 92)
            risers 70 mm* (Guide recommends 75 m m -180 mm,
            see Chapter 8, paragraph 93)

“Correction not possible without major reconstruction so accepted
in view of only minor deviation of 5 mm and good condition of
the terrace.

Capacity: 700 x 54 = 3780
               10

2 2 6 . When the strength of crush barriers conforms with the
guidelines but the spacing of such barriers does not, the capacity
is calculated from the provision of crush barriers in the area
available for standing (as defined in paragraph 221) as follows:
     a.   Where a terrace contains either "peak viewing areas"
          only or "other viewing areas" by multiplying the total
          length of the crush barriers by the appropriate distance
          between barriers (as given in Chapter 9, paragraphs
          116-117) or the existing distance, whichever is less,
          and multiplying by the appropriate packing density.

Example B

Peak Viewing Terrace.

Barriers and pitch perimeter wall comply with greater strength
requirements (see Chapter 9, paragraph 119, Table 2) but not the
spacing requirements of the Guide.

                            66
Area available for standing 700m 2 (100m x 7m ) (excluding

Terrace condition and drainage good: dimensions conform to
Guide's recommendations in Chapter 8.

Gradient 10%: therefore maximum appropriate distance 4.3 m (see
Chapter 9, paragraph 117, Table 1).
Number of barriers: 6 at 5 m = 30 metres
Perimeter wall (see Chapter 15, paragraph 216): 100 metres

                    Total = 130 metres

Capacity: 130 x 4.3 x 54         = 3019
                         10
      b.       Where a terrace contains both "peak viewing areas"
               and "other viewing areas", by multiplying the total
               length of barriers by the appropriate distance between
               barriers in a "peak viewing area" or the existing
               distance, whichever is less, and multiplying them by the
               appropriate packing density.

Example C

with other areas only. Barriers and pitch perimeter wall comply
with strength requirements but not spacing requirements of the
Guide.

Terrace details as in Example B.
Calculations as in Example B.




227 . Crush barriers which do not meet the guidelines on the
strength set out in Chapter 9 should in general be discounted for
calculation purposes, although where crush barriers are well
constructed consideration may be given to allowing a lower
packing density figure for the purpose of the calculation.

                                         67
2 2 8 . Note: In small grounds attracting few spectators and low
density crowds, and where a terrace contains no crush barriers or
where most or alt of those installed have to be discounted for
calculation purposes the restrictions on the crowd capacity may be
unrealistic. A more flexible approach may be appropriate taking
account of the recommendations of the Guide to assess the
terrace holding capacity. In such cases the permissible packing
density is however likely to be much lower than the 27 persons
per 10 square metres referred to in paragraph 222 and the overall
terrace capacity will be severely limited.

2 2 9 . General considerations to be taken into account when
assessing the adequacy of exit systems are set out in Chapter 6.

2 3 0 . The capacity of an exit system can be calculated by
assessing for each element in the system (ie each gangway,
doorway, stairway, exit etc) the number of persons who can pass
in 8 minutes (ie egress time, see Chapter 6, paragraph 56) or, the
emergency evacuation time appropriate to the accommodation
(see Chapter 11. paragraphs 183-185), whichever is the shorter
time. This calculation is made by multiplying the width of the
element by the appropriate flow rate in Chapter 17.

2 31 . Where an element in the exit system is less than 1 metre
wide that element should be omitted from the calculation.

2 3 2 . Flow restricting elements of the kind described in Chapter 6
should be ignored for the purpose of these calculations.




                                    69
17. RECOMMENDED FLOW RATES

233. From stands and stairways a flow rate of 40 persons per
minute per unit of exit width (ie 550 mm) should be used.

234. From terraces (including covered terraces) and the ground
generally a flow rate of 60 persons per minute per unit of exit
width should be used.

STEWARDING

1.   All stewards should be capable of carrying out their duties
and should be properly trained to do so (see Chapter 13).

2.    Stewards must be informed in writing of all that they are
expected to know and do. The following list gives examples of
typical tasks and duties which stewards should be expected to
carry out and for which they should be prepared. Stewards should:
     i.      Prevent overcrowding by ensuring the crowd limits in
             various parts of the ground are complied with.
     ii.     Prevent spectators, as far as possible, from climbing
             fences and other structures eg floodlight pylons, and
             from standing on seats. Where by virtue of the scale of
             the incident stewards are unable to prevent this, they
             should immediately report the matter to the nearest
             police officer or, if no police officer is present, to the
             chief steward or the safety officer.
     iii.    Ensure that gangways and exits are kept clear.
     iv.     Identify and investigate any incident or occurrence
             among spectators, reporting their findings to the police
             or to management.
     v.      Know the location of and be able to operate effectively
             the fire-firefighting equipment at the ground.
     vi.     Know the location of the first aid room and any first
             aid equipment kept elsewhere.
     vii.    Be fully conversant with any methods or signals used
             to alert staff that an emergency has arisen.
     viii.   Be capable of recognising potential fire hazards and
             suspect packages, reporting such findings immediately
             to the nearest police officer or, if no police officer is in
             the immediate vicinity, the chief steward or the safety


                                72
o ffic e r .

Comply promptly with any instruction given in an
emergency by a police officer, the chief steward or the
safety officer.

Remain at their allocated posts as instructed unless
authorised or ordered to do otherwise by a police
officer, the chief steward or the safety officer.
Report to the safety officer any damage or defect
which is likely to pose a threat to spectator safety eg a
damaged crush barrier.
Annex C

TESTING OF CRUSH BARRIERS AND HANDRAILS

1.    For crush barriers the test is to consist of the application of
an evenly distributed force of either 6.0 KN/metre width
(400 lbs f/foot width) or 4.3 KN/metre width (290 lbs f/foot width)
of barrier as mentioned in Chapter 9.

2.    For handrails the test is to consist of the application of an
evenly distributed force of either 4.3 KN/metre width (290 lbs f /
foot width) or 2.74 KN/metre width (188 lbs f/foot width) of
handrail as mentioned in Chapter 9.

3.    The force is to be in the form of a static load acting on the
top rail of the barrier or handrail at right angles to the longitudinal
axis and applied in about ten equal increments.

4.    The force to be applied for three consecutive periods, the full
force being maintained for 5 minutes each period. The interval
between applications to be as short as possible, ie to enable
complete unloading and reloading only. A record should be kept of
any deformation during the loading periods, during the periods of
maintained loading, or during the recovery period.

5.    If on the removal of the force for the third time the recovery
of deformation is at least 75% the barrier or handrail may be
deemed to have satisfied the loading requirements.
If this requirement is not met but the recovery is more than 50%
then the test should be repeated and if on retest the recovery is at
least 75% the barrier or handrail may be deemed to have satisfied
the loading requirements.

If the recovery is less than 50% on the first test or less than 75%
on the retest, the barrier or handrail shall be deemed to have
failed to meet the loading requirements.




                              74
6.     If during any test, even though the barrier or handrail
satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should arise for
any reason (including such matters as cracking of the terracing or
distortion of connections) as to the safety of the barrier or handrail,
a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results of
this investigation remove the doubt as to the safety of the barrier
or handrail, the barrier or handrail, as the case may be, should be
deemed to have failed the test.

7.    A record should be kept of all the barriers and handrails
tested and of their performances during the tests.

              Shortly after publication of the Interim~~Rexipmmenclations and Report of Lord
                                                                                            :
              Justice Taylor, a Senior Police Officer attended before the General Purposes
              Panel to discuss the use of the Leppings Lane turnstiles. At that time, the
              Police said they did not wish to make use of those turnstiles for the ingress
              of spectators into the sports ground.

              At a meeting of the Advisory Group on the 19th October, 1989, the Police
              mentioned the fact that they were presently considering revising that
              operational plan in respect of games taking place at Sheffield Wednesday
              Football Club and they would write to us concerning the matter.

              Despite several telephone calls by my Assistant Solicitor, Mrs. Woodhead, and
              Mr. Bownes, the Chief Licensing Officer, the letter was not supplied.  During
              the course of conversations officers had with the Police, it became clear that
              the Police wished to make use of the Leppings Lane turnstiles to enable home
              supporters gain access to the North Stand.  This was proposed as a measure to
              be used only for "non-contentious^matches". When "big" matches were taking
              place, the original arrangement would be used (i.e., all home supporters to
              gain access via turnstiles at the Kop end).

              Officers were extremely concerned about the matter, particularly in view of
              the fact that there was an article in "The Star" indicating that the Police
              and the Club had agreed that this revised operational plan would be effective,
              despite the fact that the matter had not been referred to the City Council.

              Eventually, a copy of the letter which had been written to the Club concerning
              the matter was obtained direct from the Club on the 27th October, 1989.  This
              was 24 hours before the operational plan was to be effected.

              Mrs. Woodhead consulted with the Chair of the General Purposes Panel.  In view
              of the fact that there could be greater danger to spectators in insisting upon
              the original arrangement being reverted to, it was decided that in the
              interests of safety, it was proper for the revised arrangements to stand.

              I enclose copies of the relevant correspondence for your information.

              You will note that a meeting has been arranged with the Police and the General
              Purposes Panel to discuss the matter furtherw  If you require any further
              information, please contact me.

              The meeting is scheduled to take place at 2.00 p.m. should you wish to attend.

 Dear Mr. Mackrell,

 Re: use of Leppings Lane Turnstiles
 Changes in Policing Operational Procedures

 I refer to your telephone conversation with Mrs. Woodhead concerning this matter
 this matter on Friday, 22nd October.  Thank you for supplying a fax copy of the
 letter you have received from the police dated the 11th October, so promptly.

 I enclose a copy letter which has been sent to the police concerning this
 matter, the contents of which are self-explanatory.  You will note that
 members of the City Council are extremely concerned about the fact that they
 were not consulted about the proposals.

 I have been asked to write to you to indicate that members of the Council feel
 that it is the joint responsibility of the Police and the Club to advise them of
 such matters.  I would therefore, be grateful if you would confirm that in
 future, the Council will be advised of such matters.

 Yours sincerely,




 Head of Department

     South Yorkshire Police,
     Operations Division,
     Snig Hill,
     SHEFFIELD.



     Dear Mr. Broomhead,

     Re: Sheffield Wednesday Football Club -
     Revised Operational Plans_______________

     I refer to your various conversations with Mrs. Woodhead concerning this matter,
     when you explained the arrangements you had entered into with Sheffield
     Wednesday Football Club to make use of the Leppings Lane turnstiles for access
     by home supporters using the North Stand.  You confirmed that the proposal was
     to be implemented only in respect of "non contentious matches" where you
     expected small numbers of visiting fans.  Other than that, the usual arrangement
     whereby no use was made of Leppings Lane turnstiles and home fans all gained
     access to the ground by turnstiles servicing the Kop would prevail.

     As you are aware, members of the City Council are extremely concerned that the
     matter was not referred to them at an early stage, despite the fact that the
     letter to the Club setting out the proposals is dated the 11th October.
     Furthermore, that letter clearly envisages that the matter will require
     discussion with the Local Authority.

     Members of the Council are anxious to ensure that this does not occur in the
     future, and accordingly have asked me to write to you seeking your assurance
     that in the future, issues such as this will be referred to them for
     consideration.

     I confirm, that in accordance with your conversation with Mrs. Woodhead, I am
     making arrangements for you and your senior officers to meet with members of the
     General Purpose Panel to discuss the matter generally, and the distinction
     between operational issues and issues of general safety.

     I will contact you further to make the necessary arrangements.

     Yours sincerely,




     Head of Department

            Re: Safety of Sports Grounds - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
            and Sheffield United Football Club

            I enclose extracts from two copy documents which have been prepared by the
            Police summarising the action taken by them in respect of the football clubs as
            a means of implementing the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.  I also
            enclose copies of the covering letter sent with the report which summarise the
            contents of the documents.

            The extract contains the summary of the activities undertaken by the Police.          If
            you wish to see the remainder of the document, please let me know.

            With reference to both documents you will note that the local authority is asked
            to follow through a number of items.

            I refer to recommendation 6. You will note in the final paragraph that the
            local authority is asked to ensure that the club undertakes its responsibilities
            for staff training in accordance with the Green Guide.  This matter will be
            referred to the Advisory Group as soon as possible.

            With respect to recommendations 13 to 17, as you are aware, it is the intention
            to set up a separate ^Advisory Forum" to ensure that these recommendations are
            implemented.

            With reference to recommendation 31 to 33, the proposals will need to be
            submitted to the local authority in the usual way and considered by the Advisory
            Group and in due course by members of the General Purposes Panel.  The proposals
            for construction of the new Police Control Room have already been submitted.

            With reference to the extract concerning Sheffield United Football Club, and
            with particular reference to recommendation 1, the Safety Certificate has
            already been amended to reduce the capacity to 11,040.  Works have been proposed
            by the club which will probably have the effect of increasing the potential
            capacity at the ground.  The matter is to be considered by Members of the
            General Purposes Panel at their meeting on 27th November.

            The document is to be circulated at the Police Authority meeting on Monday 27th
            November.  If you have any general comments or wish me to take any action in
            respect of that meeting, please let me know.

Dear Mr Webster

RECCM^DATIONS ARISING FRCM THE INTERIM REPORT o f LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

The interim report on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, prepared by Lord
Justice Taylor, was published on 4 August 1989.      The report contained 43
recanrtendations which were thought necessary to ensure safety at existing
football grounds.    The South Yorkshire Police have addressed each of the
recermendations in relation to the five ■football league grounds in the
county.    This correspondence refers specifically to the assessment and
implementation of the recommendations in respect of SHEFFIEXD UNITED FOOTBALL
CLUB.

On 18 September 1989, a meeting took place between representatives of the
South Yorkshire Police and the four local authorities concerned.      It was
agreed, as a result of that meeting, that the police would conclude their
review of the recoirmendations and inform the relevant local authority of
their proprosals in respect of each club. The local authority advisory group
will wish to consider the achievements of the police 'Implementation Team'
and superintend the future implementation of the Taylor recarmendations. It
is suggested that the enclosed documents provide a framework for such
consideration.

You might agree that it would be appropriate to convene, in the near future,
a meeting of the Sheffield City Council Safety of Sports Ground Advisory
Group, in order to progress these matters.

Please find enclosed the following documents

1. Copy of Chapter 24 of the Taylor Report - The Recarmendations.

2. Summary of the activities undertaken by the South Yorkshire Police at
   Sheffield Wednesday FC in respect of each of these reccnmendations.

      THE PRESENT POSITION AT

         SHEFFIELD UNITED PC

IN RELATION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
RECCMMENDATION 1




It is noted by the police that the current Safety Certificate for

Sheffield United Football Club has been amended to reflect the new

capacities of all standing areas as follows:-



Spion Kop                             14,550

Bramall Lane end                       5,660

John Street Terraces West             '1,340

John Street Terraces East              2.050



However, following an Inspection Meeting, at the ground, involving

the     South   Yorkshire    Fire   Brigade, it      is    recommended that the

capacity for the Spion Kop terrace be revised downwards fran 14,550

to 11,040.        If this recaimendation is agreed by               the   licensing

authority then the Safety Certificate requires further amendments



RBCCM4ENDATION 2



The     calculation    for     maximum   capacities,         proposed     by   this

recommendation, has been followed in determining the figure for each

terraced area recorded above.



RECOMMENDATION 3



a) An    electronic    counting     mechanism   is    in    place   at    Sheffield

   United's ground whereby the number of spectators entering each self-

   contained area is contemporaneously recorded.
   The club has undertaken (see written agreement) to monitor this

   counter and to limit the number of spectators entering any self-

   contained       area    to    the   maximum   capacity    figure    assessed   in

   accordance with Reccmnendation 2 above.



b) The club will achieve this by closing off the relevant turnstiles

   to prevent       further access       to such an area when          its maximum

   capacity is about to be reached.                The police have agreed to

   assist the club in this regard, if requested so to do.



RECOMMENDATION 4



   A written agreement, setting out their respective responsibilities

   for crowd safety and control, has been approved and signed by

   representatives of South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield United

   Football Club.         A copy of that agreement is attached'as document (63



RECOMMENDATION 5



At each match at Sheffield United's ground there are six stewards

(two    to   the    Spion       Kop,   John   Street   and   Bramall    Lane   ends

respectively) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in those

areas for possible overcrowding or distress.             The stewards regularly

perform the same duties, as do the police officers authorised under

Recommendation 9 below.           The parties are therefore familiar to each

other, and the stewards have . ready access to these police officers

who each have a radio giving them contact with the police control

room.
RBCXM1ENDATI0N 6




All police officers and stewards (not just those authorised under

Reccnmendations    5 and      9)   are   fully briefed with regard to the

recognition of crowd densities and to the recognition of signs of

distress.     All officers and stewards have been issued, as an aids

memoire, with     a   laminated     card    which   identifies   the   signs    of

distress.



Stewards are each issued with a copy of written instructions, by the

club, which detail their duties.             The stewards are briefed by a

police inspector, before each natch, on their responsibilities for

crowd safety and control and their duties in case of emergency

evacuation.



Similarly, police officers are briefed by a Senior police officer

before    each   match   on   their      complementary   responsibilities      and

duties.



The   South Yorkshire Police are presently preparing visual aids,

designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different

crowd densities, to recognise signs of distress, and to understand a

little more about crowd dynamics.              The aids will consist of a)

albums of photographs depicting the various sections of Sheffield

United's ground with different numbers of spectators therein, and b)

a video tape film which highlights crowd densities, distress and

dynamics.    When completed these photographs and film will be shown

to the Safety of Sports Ground Advisory Group.
The     certifying   authority   are   asked   to   ensure    that     the   club

undertakes and continues to undertake its own responsibilities for

staff training as set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds -

'The Green Guide’ - paras 26, 177, 195 - 199 and Annex B to the

Guide.



R EcaM EroK H ag 7



All gateways in radial or perimeter fences at Sheffield United are

painted in the international safety colour -white              - which is a

different colour      frcm the rest of the fence.            Each is clearly

identified by a sign which proclaims 'Emergency Exit'.               Furthermore,

a notice is displayed on the electronic scoreboard, beforeeach game

commences, asking all spectators to identify their nearest emergency

exit.



RBOOMEMPftTION 8



All the gates in perimeter fences have been removed at Sheffield

United*s ground.



KECCMMEKDflTICN 9



TSiere i$ in respect of each gateway in the perimeter fences, at

least one police officer whose sole duty whenever spectators are on

the   terraces, is to decide whether or not           to allow spectators

through that gateway to relieve overcrowding.         Such police officers

are to be identified by means of a lime green tabard. The offjeer
is familiar to all stewards in that area (see Recarmendaticn 5

above),     is   known    by    then     to   be   authorised      to    relieve    over­

crowding,    and    is able      to make        radio contact with          the police

control roam.



RECO'MBCraTOH 10



Four sets    of    metal       cutting       equipment     have   been    provided      by

Sheffield United Football Club.                It has been agreed that, in case

of need, employees of the club trained in its use will be readily

available to operate the equipment.                 T wd   operatives are deployed

to either end of the ground and are in radio contact, via the

club's radio system, with both the club safety officer and the

police control room.



A test of the ability of the operatives to muster and make the

equipment    ready       for   use     was    performed     by    the    police    ground

commander at       the    Sheffield       United vs        Hull   City match       on   23

September 1989.      He was satisfied with the response.



RECQMEaganoNs li and 12



It is understood that City Council representatives of the Safety

of Sports Ground Advisory Group have carried out an inspection of

all crush barriers.



RBCCMMENDATIONS 13 - 17



Safety Certification is obviously a matter for Sheffield City Council.

In respect of Recommendation 17, the South Yorkshire Police await
police view, however, that this Grcuo should supplement,                     and not

replace, the existing Officer '.vcrking Group.



RBCCW^ENDATIQNS 18 AND 19



It    is    -understood        that   each   turnstile   has   been   inspected,   its

potential rate of flow measured and that the maximum capacities of

each viewing area can be admitted via the respective turnstiles in

less than one hour.



RBCCMMElgaTICW 20



(See Recenmendation 3b.) When the capacity of any viewing area is                  ^0%

below ifhe maximum permitted,                an alarm sounds at the electronic

monitor in the Club Secretary’s office.                    The secretary,     or his

agent, will immediately pass a message via the club radio system to

a steward at the relevant bank of turnstiles.                   The turnstiles will

be closed off and the police informed by club radio or telephone to

police control.



R E m - M E N D ^ T I O N 21




Sheffield United Football Club currently have four CC TV cameras

installed around the ground.                  A survey of the installation was

carried out by a trained police CC TV operator (no expert                  knowledge

is professed! and his report is attached at document (3).
Since       that    survey       was      completed,         the    club       have       applied        tc

the    Football Ground               Improvements           Trust       for    funds        tc expand

the CC TV system,                to ensure compliance with this particular

recommendation.              However,           the    Trust       have       declined           to    fund

such     expansion          until         the     final       Report          of     Lord        Justice

Taylor      is published.



For your further            information              the General Purposes Committee

of    the A ssociation            of Chief        Police Officers                  has    convened a

work i ng    group       to consider,            nationally,            the use of CC TV to

promote       public        safety         at    football           grounds.               The        group

anticipates         that     it m a y be po ss i b l e            to provide a ’package'

of equipment to use as a test for a common m i n i m u m standard

of performance.             They will report tiack in due course.



RECOM ME N DA TI ON 22



S ignposting         for     spectators              both     inside          and     outside           the

Sports       Grounds        Ad v isory          Group.            The    police           have        made

certain      suggestions             to   the    club       which       they       have    agreed        to

implement           and          thus '     ensure           compliance                  wit h         this

Recommendation.



R EC OMMENDATIONS 23 a n d 24



The    South       Yorkshire         Police      have       had    liaison          with    the       club

on    the     question          of     ticketed         matches.               The       police        are

satisfied      with        the       arrangements           and    will        ensure       that        the

information         on    any    ticket corresponds                 with       their       plans        for

admitting spectators to the ground.
RECOMMENDATION 25



Following      discussions       with     Sheffield     UniredFootball             Club    it    is

REOGmEKDATION 26



The South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable nominated his Deputy, Mr

Peter Hayes, QPM, LLB, MA, to liaise with the management of each

football club and local authority concerned in respect of the safety

and    control    of    crowds.         Mr Hayeshas met       with       Directors              and

Secretaries      of     all    five     football    league   clubs 5 in            the    county,

Both    the    Operational       Order     andthe    pre-match           briefing         of all

officers on duty at each match at Sheffield United EC alert officers

to the dangers of overcrowding and, if any should be defected, of

taking immediate and appropriate steps to remedy ir.



The    proposed       training    by     way       of photographs and              video        (see

Recommendation 6 above) will further emchasise these mess aces.
RBCCmENDATICN 28



The operational planning for each march at Sheffield United PC is

intended to enable the police to cope with forseeable patterns in

the arrival at and departure frcr? any rratch by spectators.



The    following scenarios   are   each   catered for by way of police

contingency plans at Sheffield United FC:-



a) All ticket, or otherwise restricted, matches.

b) Early arrival of spectators.                                          -i*.

c) Unexpected and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators.

d) Individual section of a ground approaching capacity.

e) Whole ground approaching capacity.                    '                ••.

f ) Late arrival of spectators.

g) Emergency opening of      external     gates   (or forcing of external

      gates), thereby allowing an influx of spectators.

h) Early departure of spectators fran ground.

i) Emergency evacuation.



The police retain a reserve of officers at the ground to enaEfee

rapid deployment to any difficulty which may arise inside or outside

the ground.                                                  :



The certifying authority may, however, wish to satisfy themselves

that the club have made contingency plans to deal with a situation

where the available entrances might prove insufficient to stop unduly

large crowds gathering outside the ground.          Such contingency’ plans

are    required by paragraph   46 of the Guide to Safety at Sports

Grounds - The 'Green Guide1.
     RECa-f-fPJDATION 29



     The police officer in conmand at Sheffield United FC is aware cf the

     option to delay kick-off      and discusses this matter, before each

     game,   with the match officials.     The option was   utilised on 12

     August 1989, when the police superintendent asked for the kick—iff

     at the match between Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday to be

     delayed for fifteen minutes to ensure the safety of the crowd still

     trying to get into the ground at 2.45 pm.    The crowd was notified of

     the delay by the public address system.



     To enable instant contact with the match referee when considering

     kick-off delay, the police request that the club install a telephone

     link between the police control roan and the referee’s roan. .(See

     also Reccrrmendation 32 below).                                   ^



     RECOMMENDATION 30



     There is available in the police control roan at Sheffield United

     the results of all closed circuit television, monitoring outside and

     inside the ground.    There is also a ccmputer terminal which displays

     the record of the electronic counting of spectators into the ground.



     Police officers who perform duty in the control roan have attended a

     CC TV Operator's Course run by the Greater Manchester Police.     They
J    are therefore skilled in the use and interpretation cf the results

     of CC TV filming.

RBCOWENDATICN 31



There are sufficient operators employed in the police control rocr.

to deal with radio ccrmrunications.         New police conmini cat ions

equipment has been cormissioned, ana is about to be installed at

She ffieId Uni ted1s ground.



The equipment consists of a two-bay radio set with a spare station

in case of radio failure on the primary station.             It also has

battery back-up in case of power failure.       This system also gives

operators in the control roan priority over, and the capacity to

override, others using the same channel.



The police ground coirmander has the option of utilising, when he

feels it necessary, an additional radio channel which provides

exclusive     camrunication    between   himself    and    other     sector

cormanders.     This    executive   channel would   be    utilised   in an

emergency when the primary channel may become overcrowded.



The police control roan is to be replaced by Sheffield United EC

in the near future     The club is aware of the requirements cf sound­

proofing etc.    The certifying authority are asked to oversee the

construction of this new control roan.



RBCCM4ENDATI0N 32



A survey of Sheffield United's ground has identified twenty eight

key points where the police would wish to see dedicated telephone

points to enable direct cormunication with the police control room.



Attached, at document (4),- is a plan showing the location of those

points, together with an equipment specification prepared by the

South Yorkshire Police Communications Department.
Sheffield United    FC have   subsequently agreed tc fund,   using a

Football Trust grant,   a network of telephones.      The certifying

authority are asked tc oversee its installation.



RECOMMENDATION 33



There is in existence at Sheffield United PC a public address

system.   However, at a meeting between the police and the club on

5 August 1989, it was agreed that there was a need for a more

efficient system to enable effective ccmnunication with individual

areas both inside and outside the ground.



Sheffield United FC have commissioned a new public address system

and work is progressing.       The plan at document   (5) shows the

existing system and site of new loudspeakers.         The certifying

authority are asked to oversee the installation of this public

address system to ensure that it complies with this recommendation

and that it is effective.     In so doing, the certifying authority

will wish to pay regard, also, to paragraph 194 (iii) of the Guide

to Safety at Sports Grounds - The 'Green Guide' - which lists the

requirements of an effective public address system.



The police have asked the club to ensure that the use of a loud

signal to precede important messages be advertised in the club's

progranmes.



RECOMMENDATICN 34



The illuminated advertising/score board at Sheffield United's grcind
is utilised by the police tc broadcast safety messages tc the crcwc.

An example   is    ’identify   year   nearest   emergency   exit1 which   is

displayed before the     start cf each game.        The advertising/score

board cannot be seen by every spectator in the ground and so it is

treated very much as a secondary medium for canrranicaticn.



A series of hand signals for use by police officers in an emergency

is presently being formulated, nationally, by a working group of the

Association of Chief Police Officers.      The results are awaited.




RBCCMMEMDATIQN 35



The South Yorkshire Police maintain regular liaison with the South

Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance       Service and the South Yorkshire

Fire Service concerning crowd safety at Sheffield United's stadium.



At a force level    the Chief Superintendent (Operations) has regular

meeting with senior officers frcm the other services.           At a local

level the police match commander meets with the ambulance liaison

officer at most if not every match.       The fire service have also had

a liaison officer at at least one match this season v.r.ere he met

with the police match commander.



RECQMBTOATION 36



In advance cf each match at Sheffield United's ground,           the South

Yorkshire Police forward to the South Yorkshire Fire and Ambulance

Services full details about the forthcoming event.
RECOMMENDATION 37



Contingency plans           fcr the      arrival cf emergency police,                fire and

ambulance vehicles at Sheffield United's ground, have been reviewed

and    prepared.          The     rent in gen try plan     forms    part     of    the   cclice

operational order.               On 20 August       1989 the three services held a

practise exercise.              The contingency plans worked well.



The certifying authority will wish to consider whether the club have

taken adequate account of paragraph 29 (v) of the Guide to Safety at

Sports Grounds - The 'Green Guide' - which tasks management with the

responsibility            for    preparing     emergency         contingency        plans    in

consultation with the three emergency services.

Dear Mr Webster

KBCCMOCflTIONS ARISING FROM TOE INTERIM REPORT OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

The interim report on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, prepared by Lord
Justice Taylor, was published on 4 August 1989.      The report contained 43
recaimendations which were thought necessary to ensure safety at existing
football grounds.    The South Yorkshire Police have addressed each of the
recarmendations in relation to the five football league grounds in the
county.    This correspondence refers specifically to the assessment and
implementation of the recoimendations in respect of SHEFFIEED      WEDNESDAY
FOOTBALL CLUB.



On 18 September 1989, a meeting took place between representatives of the
South Yorkshire Police and the four local authorities concerned.       It was
agreed, as a result of that meeting, that the police would conclude their
review of the recommendations and inform the relevant local authority of
their proprosals in respect of each club. The local authority advisory group
will wish to consider the achievements of the police 1Implementation Team1
and superintend the future implementation of the Taylor reccrrmendations. It
is suggested that the enclosed documents provide a framework for such
consideration.


You might agree that it would be appropriate to convene, in the near future,
a meeting of the Sheffield City Council Safety of Sports Ground Advisory
Group, in order to progress these matters.

Please find enclosed the following documents

1. Copy of Chapter 24 of the Taylor Report - The Recommendations.




                                                           Continued

      Sheffield City Council




2. Summary of the activities undertaken by the South Yorkshire Police at
   Sheffield Wednesday FC. in respect of each of these recaimendations.

3. Survey of CC TV equipment at Sheffield Wednesday PC.

4. Proposals for land line telephone system at Sheffield Wednesday PC.

5. Survey of public address system at Sheffield Wednesday PC.

6. Written agreement between Sheffield Wednesday PC and the South Yorkshire
   Police.

7. Minutes of Meeting held on 18 September 1989 between representatives of
   South Yorkshire Police and the local authorities of Sheffield, Rotherham,

      THE PRESENT POSITION AT

       SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY PC

IN RELATION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS QF

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
RBCCWEKDATION 1


It is noted by the police that the current Safety Certificate for

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has been amended to reflect the new

capacities of all standing areas as follows

Spion Kop                                      16,800

North West Terrace - Upper Level                2,300

North West Terrace - Lcwer Level                  680

(It is further noted that the Safety Certificate prohibits spectators

from standing on the West Stand, Leppings Lane, terraces.)



RBCXEMENDRTION 2

The     calculation      for   maximum        capacities,   proposed      by      i-hi«

recommendation, has been followed in determining the figure for eacb

terraced area recorded above.



RECOMMENDATION 3


(a) An electronic counting system is in place at Sheffield Wednesday's

      ground   whereby   the   number    of    spectators   entering    each   self-

      contained area is contemporaneously recorded.



      The club has undertaken (see written agreement) to monitor this

      counter and to limit the number of spectators entering any self-

      contained   area    to   the    maximum    capacity   figure     assessed     in

      accordance with Reccmmendation 2 above.



(k) The club will achieve this by closing off the relevant turnstiles

      to prevent further access to such an area when its maximum capacity

      is about to be reached.        The police have agreed to assist the club

      in this regard, if requested so to do.
RECOMMENDATION 4

A written agreement, setting out their respective responsibilities for crowd
safety and control, has been approved and signed by representatives of South
Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Wednesday FC.

A copy of that agreement is attached at document (6).


RECOMMENDATION 5



At each match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground there are stewards

situated on the perimeter track at the Spion Kop end of the ground

whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area, for possible

overcrowding or distress.             The stewards regularly perform the same

duties, as do the police officers authorised under Reccmnendation 9

below.      The parties are therefore familiar to each other, and th e

stewards have ready access to these police officers who each 'have a

radio giving them contact with the police control roan.



RECOMMENDATION 6



All police officers and stewards              (not    just those authorised under

Recommendations      5   and    9)   are    fully    briefed     with   regard   to   the

recognition of crowd densities and to the recognition of signs of

distress.       All officers and stewards have been issued,                 as an aide

memoire, with a laminated card which identifies the signs of distress.



 Stewards are each issued with a copy of written instructions, by the

 club, which detail their duties. The senior stewards are                  briefed toy a

 police     inspector,   before      each   match,    on   the    responsibilities    of

 stewards    for crowd safety and control and their duties in case of

 emergency evacuation.         The senior stewards are expected to brief the

 more junior stewards.



 Police officers are briefed by a Senior police officer before each
match on their complementary responsibilities and duties. The camander

of each sector of the ground is responsible for further briefing his or

her officers on their specific duties within that sector.



The    South   Yorkshire    Police   are   presently   preparing   visual   aids,

designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different crowd

densities, to recognise signs of distress, and to understand a little

more about crowd dynamics.           The aids will consist of a) Albums of

photographs depicting the various sections of Sheffield Wednesday’s

ground with different numbers of spectators therein, and b) A video

tape   film which highlights crowd densities, distress and dynamics.

When completed these photographs and film will be shown to the Safety

of Sports Ground Advisory Group.



The Certifying Authority are asked to ensure that the club undertakes

and continues to undertake its own reponsibilities for staff training

as set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide'

- paras, 26, 177, 195 and Annex B to the Guide.



RECOMMENDATION 7



All gateways in radial or perimeter fences at Sheffield Wednesday PC

are painted     white      which is a different colour frcm the rest of the

fence.    Each is clearly identified by a sign which proclaims 1Bnergency

Exit'.



RECOMMENDATION 8



All the gates in the perimeter fence at Sheffield Wednesday's ground
remain cpen While ever spectators are on the terrace.



RBOCWENDftTIQN 9



There is, in respect of each gateway in the perimeter fences, at least one

officer whose sole duty, whenever spectators are on the terraces, is to

decide whether or not to allow spectators through that gateway to relieve

overcrowding.    Such police officers are to be identified by means of a lime

green tabard.    The officer is familiar to all stewards in that area (see

Reccnmendation 5 above), is known by them to be authorised to relieve

overcrowding, and is able to make radio contact with the police control

roam.



RBCCfrMENDftTION 10



Two sets of metal cutting equipment have been provided by Sheffield

Wednesday PC and are stored in boxes, adjacent to the fence, at either end

of the ground.     It has been agreed that, in case of need, enployees of the

club trained in its use will be readily available to operate the equipment.



All stewards have been trained in its use and will respond to instruction

from police control (many of the stewards are in radio contact via the

club*s radio system).



RBCSMMENDftTIONS 11 a n d 12



It is understood that City Council representatives on the Safety of Sports

Ground Advisory Group have carried out an inspection of all crush barriers.
RECOWEHDATICKS 13 - 17



Safety Certification is obviously a natter for Sheffield City

Council-      In respect of Reccrrmendation 17, the South Yorkshire

Police await notification of the constitution of the Advisory

Group.      It is the Police view, however, that this group should

supplement, and not replace, the existing Officer Working Group.



RBTCM-ENDATICIPE 18 AM) 19



It is understood that each turnstile has been inspected and its

potential rate of flew measured and that the maximum capacities

of   each    viewing   area    can    be   admitted   via   the      respective

turnstiles in less than one hour.



RECOMMENDATION 2B



(See ■Recarmendation 3b).          When the capacity of any viewing area

is 15% below the maximum permitted, the figures displayed on the

electronic monitor in the Club ^secretary's office begin to flash-The

secretary, or his agent, will immediately pass a message via the

club     radio   system   to   a     steward   at   the   relevant     bank   of

turnstiles-      The turnstiles will be closed off and the police

informed by club radio or telephone to police control.



 RECOMMENDATION 21



Sheffield Wednesday PC currently have five CC TV cameras
 installed around the ground.          A survey of the installation was

 carried out    by     a trained     police   CC TV operator   (no expert

 knowledge    is professed) and his report is attached at document

. (3).



 For your further information the General Purposes Carmittee of

 the Association c£ Chief Fblice Officers has convened a working group

 to consider,       nationally,   the use of CC TV to promote public

 safety at football grounds.         The group anticipate that it may be

 possible to provide a 'package' of equipment for use as a test

 for a ccmnon minimum standard of performance.          They will report

 back in due course.



 RECOMMENDATION 22



 Signposting for spectators both inside and outside the ground has

 been    reviewed    by the   City   Council   Safety of Sports Grounds

 Advisory Group.        The police are generally satisfied with the

 signposting.       Signposting at the West, Leppings Lane, end of the

 ground will require revision in the light of any new turnstiling

 arrangements which are proposed by Sheffield Wednesday EC, at

 this end of the ground.



 RECCMENDATIONS 23 AND 24



 The South Yorkshire Police have had liaison with the club on the

 question of ticketed matches.         The police are satisfied with the

 arrangements and will ensure that the information on any ticket

 corresponds with their plans          for admitting spectators to the

 ground.
RBCOWENDATION 25



There is no regular pre match entertainment at football natches

at Sheffield Wednesday.      Police have no knowledge of whether the

club has held discussions with the recognised supporters club on

this matter.



 RBCOMBPftTION 26



The South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable ncminated his Deputy,

Mr Peter Hayes, QPM, LLB, MA, to liaise with the management of

each football club and local authority concerned in respect of

the   safety   and control   of   crowds.   Mr   Hayes   has   met with

Directors or    Secretaries of all five football league clubs in

the county, including Mr Mackrell of Sheffield Wednesday BC, c n

24 August 1989.    He met with representatives of the four relevant

local authorities, including Messrs Ward and Bcwnes of Sheffield

City Council on 18 September 1989.     A copy of the minutes of that

meeting are attached at document (7).



RECCW1ENDATI0N 27



Both the Operational Order and the pre match briefing of all

officers on duty at each match at Sheffield Wednesday FC alert

officers to the dangers of overcrowding, and if any should be

detected, of taking immediate and appropriate steps to remedy it.
The    proposed   training   by way   of   photographs   and video   (see

Reccmnsndation 6 above) will further emphasise these messages.



.KBOCM4ENDATION 28



The operational planning for each match at Sheffield Wednesday PC

is intended to enable the police to cope with forseeable patterns

in the arrival at, and departure fran, any match by spectators.



The following scenarios are each catered for by way of police

contingency plans at Sheffield Wednesday PC:-



a) All ticket, or otherwise restricted, matches.

b) Early arrival of spectators.

c) Unexpected and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators.

d) Individual section of ground approaching capacity.

e) Whole ground approaching capacity.

f) Late arrival of spectators.

g) Emergency opening of external gates (or forcing of external

      gates), thereby allowing an influx of spectators.

h) Early departure of spectators frcm ground.

i) Emergency evacuation.



The police retain a reserve of officers at the ground to enable

rapid deployment     to any difficulty which may arise inside or

outside the ground.
The certifying authority may, however, wish to satisfy themselves

that    the    club    have       made    contingency      plans        to deal    with   a

situation where the available entrances might prove insufficient

to stop unduly large crowds gathering outside the ground.                             Such

contingency plans are required by paragraph 46 of the TSuide to

Safety at Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide*.



RECOMMENDATION 29



The police officer in command at Sheffield Wednesday TC is aware

of the     option to delay kick-off,                  and discusses this matter,

before each game, with the match officials.                             The cfftzion wes

utilised      on     the     30     August      1989,     when     the    police     chief

superintendent         asked      for    the    kick-off, at       the match "between

Sheffield Wednesday and Evertoi> to be delayed for 15 minutes to

ensure the safety of the crcwd still trying to get into the

ground at 7.15 pm.             The crowd was notified of the delay by the

public address system.



To enable instant contact with the match referee vfaen considering

kick-off      delay,    the police         request       that     the    club   install a

telephone link between the police control room and the player's

tunnel. (See also Recommendation 32 behswj.,



REOQfWENDATION 30



There    is   available        in   the    police       control    room at       Sheffield

Wednesday      FC,     the   results       of   the     closed     circuit      television
monitoring conducted by the police both outside and inside the

ground.    There are, however, fifteen other CC TV cameras belonging

to the club which monitor turnstiles and areas behind turnstiles

throughout the ground.     These are currently monitored in tie club

control roan and the results of this filming are not available in

the police control roan. The certifying authority are asked to

ensure that this recarmendation      is ccnplied with.    There is a

computer    terminal in the club control roan which displays the

record of the electronic counting of spectators into the ground.

Tte police have requested that the club make this same information

available in the police Control Rocm.    The certifying authority are

asked to ensure that this reconmendation is corplied with.



Police officers who perform duty in the control roan are skilled in

the use and interpretation of the results of CC TV filming.      ’Eacia

of these officers is to attend a CC TV operator’s course Which is

run by the Greater Manchester Police.



REPCMMEMDftTICW 31



There are sufficient operators employed in the police control roctn

to deal with radio communications.         New jpolice comnunications

equipment    has recently been   installed at Sheffield Wednesdays

ground.     The equipment consists of a two-bay radio set with a spare

station in case of radio failure on the primary station.      It also

has battery back-up in case of power failure.        This system also

gives operators in the control rocm priority over, and the capacity

to override, others using the same channel.



The police ground cormander has the option of utilising, when

he feels its necessary, an additional radio channel which provides
exclusive     camiunication     between   himself      and     other     sector

cormanders.     This   executive channel       would   be    utilised    in an

emergency when the primary channel may become overcrowded.



The police control roctn at Sheffield Wednesday EC                is inadequate

in terms of size and facilities.      The club have been made aware of

the police dissatisfaction with the present acccnmodation.                  The

certifying    authority   are    asked    to   oversee      the    design   and

construction of a new control rocm at the ground.



RBCCWEMDRTION 32



A survey of Sheffield Wednesday's ground has identified twenty key

points where the police would wish to see dedicated telephone

points    to enable direct ccmmunication with the police control

room.



Attached, at document (4), is a plan showing the location of those

points, together with an equipment specification prepared by t±ie

South Yorkshire Police Cormunications Department.             The Certifying

Authority are asked to oversee its installation.



RECCM^ENDATICN 33



There is in existence at Sheffield Wednesday PC              a public address

system.       The police survey of the system has identified the

requirements for at least five further loud speakers as follows:-
a) A speaker outside turnstiles 77 to 88.

b) A speaker at the rear of the North Stand near to the police

   roan.

c) A speaker adjacent to Gate B.

d) A speaker adjacent to Gate C.

e ) A speaker on the North West elevated section to service the

   Leppings Lane terraces.



The plans at (5) show the existing system and the proposed siting

The Certifying Authority are asked to oversee the installation of

an adequate public address system to ensure that it ocnplies with

effective.    In so doing, the Certifying Authority will wish to pay

regard, also, to paragraph 194 (iii) of the Guide to Safety at

Sports Grounds - ’The Green Guide* —      which lists the requirements

of ah effective public address systeia.



The police have asked the club to ensure that the use of a loud

signal to precede important messages be advertised in the club's

programmes.




RBCgyMENDATION 34



The illuminated advertising board at Sheffield Wednesday's ground

is presently out of coimission and there are no plans to repair

it.
A    series   of   hand     signals    for     use   by police    officers     in an

emergency is presently being formulated, nationally, by a working

group of the Association of Chief Police Officers.                     The results

are awaited.



RECCM4ENDATI0N 35



The South Yorkshire Police maintain regular liaison with the South

Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and the South Yorkshire

Fire      Service concerning crcwd           safety at Sheffield Wednesday’s

stadium.

At    a   force    level,    the    Chief    Superintendent      (Operations) laas

regular meetings with senior officers from the other services,                    at

a local level the police match ccmrander meets with the ambulance

liaison officer at most if not every match.               The fire service "ha^e

also had a liaison officer at at least one match this season vhere

he met with the police match ccnrnanaer.



RBCOMMENDATICM 36



In advance of each match at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground, the

South Yorkshire Police forward to the South Yorkshire Fire and

Ambulance Services full details about the forthcoming event.



RECgyMENDATICW 37



Contingency plans for the arrival of emergency police, fire and

ambulance     vehicles      at     Sheffield    Wednesday's   ground    have    been

reviewed and prepared.             The contingency plan forms part of the
police operational order.



The Certifying Authority will wish to consider whether the club

have taken adequate account of paragraph 29(v) of the Guide to

Safety   at   Sports   Grounds   -   'The   Green    Guide'    - which    tasks

management    with     the   responsibility    for     preparing      emergency

GENERAL PURPOSES PANEL - SAFETY OF SPORTSGROUNDS - URGENT CONSIDERATIONS

At  the Monday,   27 November meeting of the      General     Purposes Panel,
consideration   was   given to several safety     aspects     with regard to
sportsgrounds in Sheffield.

You will, I am sure, appreciate the extreme sensitivity of these  issues,
particularly  as  they were   dealt with only a matter of days before the
Sheffield Wednesday v. Liverpool game at Hillsborough.

I was, therefore, most concerned to receive from the Chair of the Panel,
Councillor   Butler,  and also Councillor Nelson and Councillor Mrs. Elsie
Smith, complaints about the way officers  had come   to the meeting with
different   information to that which was available to them in the reports
and at the pre-meeting.   On the  invitation of the committee chair,       I
attended the pre-meeting, both as Leader of the Council and as a member of
the  South Yorkshire Police Authority.      The Panel members     had   much
information   to consider there and generally accepted the officers advice,
with the exception of one dr two matters where we were   actually   slightly
stronger.

One of the matters most concerning members was the fact that Eastwoods, the
consultants to Sheffield Wednesday, had to admit the capacity of one part
of the ground had been over-estimated and was given at 2,300, when only
1,500 people could be properly accommodated.

This seems to be a matter of extreme concern and the fact that Eastwoods
claim somebody else did it on their behalf did not seem to me to be a
proper excuse.

Unfortunately, during the course of the meeting, the majority of the impact
of criticisms which should have been made against Eastwoods was lost when
one of our own officers got up and said the 1,500 figure which we,     as a
Council,   had provided to the committee was wrong and it should only be
1,400.   Either the Building Surveyor concerned works for the City Council
or he    does not.  If he works for the Council then that advice should have
been put properly to the advisory group or, if subsequently recognised,   at
least  there should have been information given to the licensing officer in
time for the Committee Chair to be aware of it before      the meeting.    I
really do find such conduct unacceptable.
                                     - 2 -


I also understand    that, when Members tried to bring forward the date for
completion of certain works in a long schedule they were given, before  the
Boxing Day match when Sheffield United play Leeds United, which in my view
was a perfectly sensible move, the same Building Surveyor   started siding
with  the consultants   for the club,    stating  that some of the work was
actually of a different category.  Again, I do not    find  such behaviour
acceptable  and really do    feel that we have to get our act together as a
Council on this matter.

The Head of Admin. & Legal has previously expressed concerns      to me   about
the way the Building Surveyors seem far too ready to accept advice from the
C l u b ’s consultants, rather than giving independent advice   to members   on
these matters.      I feel now is the opportune time to make it very clear from
your position that we simply expect better service to be given to members
on this very crucial and sensitive issue.

       Proposed Pop Concert at Sheffield United Football Ground

       I enclose for your attention copies of correspondence in relation to the above
       proposal.  As you can see the proposal has not been explored in any depth but it
       is anticipated that a meeting will take place within the first two weeks of
       January perhaps at Sheffield United to discuss the matter further with both the
       Club and the promoters.

       If you have any observations to make on this proposal please do not hesitate to
       let me know.

                 Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 (as amended)
                 The Sheffield International Stadium (Don Valley)

                 I refer to your memorandum of 2nd October, 1990 concerning the Sheffield
                 International Stadium (Don Valley) in which you refer to my memorandum dated
                 13th September, 1990, directed to the Director of Design & Building Services
                 and the Director of Recreation & Amenities (a copy of which is attached for
                 ease of reference).

                 As is usual prior to the opening of any premises that require a Safety
                 Licence from the Council, a full inspection of the site takes place.   All
                 Safety Advisers to the Council are invited to this inspection.

                 The Sheffield International Stadium was inspected on 13th September, 1990.   As
                 a result of that inspection 15 items were highlighted to my Chief Licensing
                 Officer, Mr. Derricott, that required immediate attention.  Works needed  to be
                 undertaken prior to the premises opening to the public on Sunday, 16th
                 September, 1990 for the McVities* Challenge.

                 If I may take the items in the order they appear in my memorandum:-

                 Item 1        At the time of inspection, the site still resembled that of a
                               building site and items needed to be cleared away.

                 Item 2        Seating was still being installed and numbered. As tickets had
                               been sold in respect of individual seats crowd control problems
                               would have arisen if the seats had not been properly installed
                               and numbered.

                 Item 3        Signs were still being erected.  You will appreciate that signs
                               play an important role in directing spectators quickly and
                               clearly to their seats, toilets, exits, etc.

                 Item 4        Works were still in progress and my Chief Licensing Officer was
                               informed that they would not be completed by the Sunday event.
                               Temporary remedial action was, therefore, necessary.

                 Item 5        My Chief Licensing Officer was informed that toilets were still
                               being installed in the Main Stand and particularly to the new
                               First Aid Room.

                 Item 6        The Advisory Group was only informed of the introduction of this
                               new press area on 13th September, 1990.  The tables attached to
                               certain seats were of a temporary nature and in the opinion of
                               the Group, caused danger to both spectators and press officials.

                 Item 7        Works were in progress - and were highlighted as a risk to
                               public safety.  The Fire Service in particular stipulated that
                               works needed to be completed prior to the first event.

                 Item 8        As Item 7.
                                         2.



Item 9         As Items 7 and 8 above.

Item 10        The new First Aid Room was not complete, therefore, in effect
               there was no first aid facility for spectators at the Stadium.
               The Ambulance Service stipulated that work was required prior to
               the Sunday event.  In the event a temporary solution was found.

Item 11        This item was required by the representatives from the Building
               Surveyors and the Health & Consumer Services Department.   It is
               of a technical nature and, therefore, comments should be sought
               from the appropriate Departments, including the Designers,
               Design & Building Services.

Item 12        The Police required the Control Room to be operational.

Item 13        Work to be completed as previously arranged.

Item 14        The fireshutters did not work properly and, therefore, with the
               helpful assistance of Station Officer Woodhouse (Fire Service) a
               temporary solution was agreed for the day.

Item 15        The Police confirmed on 14th September, 1990 that the
               information they had received was incorrect.  This item was,
               therefore, removed as a requirement.

I must point out that a number of other temporary arrangements were agreed
between the Safety Advisers and the Stadium owners and management prior to the
McVities* Challenge and subsequent rugby league matches.    Without the
assistance   and willingess of these advisers to help I feelcertain that the
McVities* Challenge would not have taken place.

May I also point out that there are still outstanding safety related items in
respect of this Stadium, in particular the provision of turnstiles to the Main
Stand and an Emergency Landline Telephone System.  Both these items need to be
addressed quickly as the Police may consider withdrawing their services from
the Stadium and leaving the Council with little or no option but to prohibit
the use of this Stadium.

My Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Derricott, has for your information pointed
out to me the implications for crowd safety and control if turnstiles are not
provided to the Main Stand.  Any Council decision to permit the premises to
continue to be open to the public without firm proposals for full and complete
turnstile provision within the next few months would, I anticipate, be in
direct conflict with the recommendations of the Advisory Group who could
advice the Council to issue a Prohibition N o t i c e . It is also contrary to the
current understanding of the Advisory Group which is that the Stadium will
have full turnstile provision.

I hope this memorandum clarifies the position, but should you require anything
further please do not hesitate to contact my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr.
Derricott, on the number given above.

Safety of Sports Grounds Aot 1975 (As Amended)
The Sheffield International Stadlua (Don Valley)

I refer to the site meeting on Thursday, 13th September, 1990, undertaken by
the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group.

As a result of this site meeting, the following items were highlighted to my
Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Derrioott, as requiring your immediate attention.
These items MUST be oompleted to the satisfaction of the Safety of Sports
Grounds Advisory Group before the precises are open to the public on
Sunday, 16th September, 1990.

Items

1.     All rubbish, building materials etc. around the »ite «ust be removed
     ' before the premises are open to the public.

        erected or temporary   signs erected in their place.

4.    Kain Stand top level behind last row of aaats and boxes. Vorka to this
      area, I understand, will not be completed before Sunday. Therefore,
      exits 1-5 (looking from the track right to left) and the final exit 6
      need to be barriered off. Two openings are to be left       (6 and 7)where
      the press boxes are.    The areas to the side of exits 5    and7 areto be
      barriered off to prevent aooess along the baok walkway. This area must
      also be provided with stewards.

      boen designated a press area. Temporary tables have been provided and
      electrioal and telephone cabling is being installed. The eleotrical
      cabling is to be fused to between 3 and 5 amps. Appropriate contact
      breaker power points are to be used. The temporary tables fitted to the
      backs of chairs are to be provided with a front board to prevent the
      hinge leg underneath the tables travelling in front of the tables.

7. , The plant rooms adjaoent to the Main Stand vomitory. Boles above the
     doors are to be filled to the satisfaction of the Fire Servioe.

8.    Film store/external maintenance door - adjaoent to Marathon Road. There
      is no fire separation above the sliding door. Provide fire separation.
      This door is also fitted with an eleotrical fail safe devioe to olose the
      door in the event of an emergency. This electrioal devioe has not been
      Installed and therefore the door nust remain olosed during the event.
      At the rear of the store between the store and the puaprooa, a fire door
      needs to be Installed.

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended)
The Sheffield International Stadiuir (Don Valley)
fcain Stand - Provision of Turnstiles

1 refer to the attached rsemorandun; and note of a telephone conversation betveen
1-s. Uilliaus Design and Building Services and nyself relating to the provision
of turnstiles to the lrein stand of the above etadiim.

Apparently the Don Valley scheire has run out of money and no turnstiles are to
t.t prcviced tc this area. 1 at\ cost concerned about the lack of turnstile
provision to the main stand and vish to place on record:-

(«=)    that in my opinion crovd control problems could arise as a direct result of
       no turnstiling bein£; provided to tbe Hein Stand; and

(.L)   1 cc- not visb tc be asfcccieted with any decision to allow the premises to
       contirue to operate without firm proposals for the installation of
       turnstiles tc- this area.   Turnstiles should be installed as soon as
       possible and in any case prior to the V'or3d Student Games.

The tetter in try opinion needs urgent consideration by the Council.     The Council
ihoulc bear in trine that the South Yorl shire Police are under   the impression
that tvrnstilec are tc l-t provided    tc the stand within the next 3 months.  It
shoule be notec that the Police may consider vithdraving their services if crowd
control pro biers arise at irportent fcu^by League fixtures as a direct result of
underprcvis icr. in t'rns irportant area.

Hetsfc vili j ou cor.finr vhat acticn, if any, yov wish me to taVe.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (As Amended)
Sheffield International Stadium (Don Valley)
Change to Stewarding Arrangements______________

I refer to the telephone conversations between your Inspector Lowe
(Attercliffe Police Station) and my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Derricott
on Tuesday, 30th October, 1990 at 1.30 p.m. and 2.00 p.m. respectively,
concerning the change to normal stewarding arrangements at the above
Stadium for the Rugby fixture on 30th October, 1990.

I note that after receiving confirmation from my Chief Licensing Officer
that the following stewarding arrangements have been made:-

   20 normal stewards (including 5 senior stewards)
   30 stewards from Constant Security
   Total 50 stewards

inspector Lowe was content to allow the match to proceed provided thr
ground Safety Officer was also content to allow the match to proceed.  Mv
Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Derricott pointed out that as Mr. Bauer hid
no objections and felt that adequate stewarding had been provided, I weald
assume that the Ground Safety Officer was happy with the situation.

* have requested Mr. Bauer to keep my Chief Licensing Officer fully
briefed about future stewarding arrangements until the current dispurr                    is
resolved.   If you encounter any difficulties, please contact my Chief
-.izensing Officer, Mr. Derricott who will take appropriate action.

Tr.ank you as always for your assistance in this matter.

Yaurs faithfully,________

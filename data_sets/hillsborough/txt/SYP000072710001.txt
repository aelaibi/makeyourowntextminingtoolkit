                 I went on Saturday            15 April    1989 (150489)      to the FA Cup semi final at

                 I went to the match with my son                         (13 y r s ) , we/travel led by

                 coach,    we booked our seats thro ugjlf Barn es Travel Agency,              County R d ,

                Walton,        Liverpool.        We    caught the coach in Priqfry Rd, at about

                 11.10am       (1110).



                 I bought my ticket for the match from Anfield and paid £6 for it for

                  We travelled straight    to Sheffield,   we were subjected to sm^T.1 R e l a y s

                  crossed the Ml we were stopped by the police to check f or/al co+fol.

                  This was only for about 5 minutes.       On our coach thereywas no drinking

                  of alcohol and I didn't see anyone else drinking on yne way to the

                  ground.



                  We arrived   in Sheffield at about 2 . 0 0 pm (1400) and we parked near a

                  bakery on a side   road where there were about 30 or 40 coaches there.

                  I then walked straight from there to the ground.           We were about 3/4

                  miles from the ground.



                  We had no police direction or escort from the coach to the ground,             I

                  did not witness any disorder,    fighting or drunkeriess between the coach

                  and the ground.



                  I arrived at the ground at about 2.45pm        (1445), having split up from

                  my son          as he had gone straight to the ground, whereas         I had

                  gone to see if I could get a drink but c o u l d n ’t find an open pub.

I think it was about 3pm          (13005 when the wrought          iron gates w ere

opened and we went through in a slight surge,                  but I was able to walk

quite easily.     I didn't go to a turnstile the ne:<t thing I s a jk was the

tunnel    in front of me and I could see the pitch beyond.



I honestly can't remember going through any other gatej other than the

wrought    iron ones and I d i d n ’t see any other gates baang opened.



The only police    I saw were the ones on horse back and I saw no

stewards at all at any time before getting to the terraces.



I did not hand my ticket          in as    I was /never asked for      it       1 was

went straight down the tunnel wiy» no problems at all, there was no

crushing or surging at that stasfe.



As far as  I am concerned the tunnel is the on ly way to the terracing

and I saw no signs directing me in any other Ali recti on.



There were no police officers or stewards at or near the tunnel.                           The

crowd was quite orderly and I did not see any drinking                      in the ground.



At the end of the tunnel          the crowd w a y right up to exit,          just as I got

to the end of the tunnel          there,   the/e was a tremendous surge from

behind and I was carried forward A n d slightly left of the goals

was   pushed steadily forward unt/1           I was only about 5 people back from

the railings at the front.              1/ have   indicated on the attached grid the

route I took through the croyGd.

                I am not sure what time           I reached the end of the tunnel but there was

                some form of goalmouth incident going on directly in front of our

                terrace.



                It is not possible to describe what the crushing was like in the

                terracing,    it was terrible.            People were shouting and screaming.         I

                saw a big fair haired lad just to my left pass os/t and collapse on the ,

                wall   in front.      The crushing was so bad you couldn't move your hands.



                At sometime during this crush I received s J fractured r ib/on my left

i
*'sJtT         side and bruising and grazing to my left/leg

                Having been pushed down the terracing             I could see a gate in the

                fencing at the front and slightly to my right at that time it was

                still shut.        I could see a police officer at the gate and we were

                screaming at him to open the gate.               I could see two officers    in the

                seating above us,       they w e n / talking    into their   radios.

                People were by now climbing over the fencing onto the pitch.

                Eventually the gaft^? was opened and together with others              I got out onto

n               the pitch.      l ( j a id n ’t see   anybody actually die although I obviously
Y{=£_\ Nj
                saw dead bodies on the pitch



                Having got onto the pitch I was treated by a St Johns Ambulance man.

                He sat me down.        After a brief rest I went        looking for my son.



                Whilst sitting down I saw a photographer             come over and take

.photographs of the crush and then took a coat off a dead body and take

a picture of him,    that   really incited the crowd and in fact someone

came over and punched hirn.



After this the   photographer was taken away by the police,    but he was

brought back again and he was attacked again,      he was taken away by

the Police Again and as he walked away a fan followed him and kicked

at his camera case.



I did not assist anyone who was dead or injured as I was concent rat i rig

on finding Thomas.



I left the ground at about 4.30pm      (1630) after the loud speaker

announcement telling us the match was abandoned.



I do not want to pass any judgement on how the incident was handled,

other than the organisation could have been betjCer.



  would like to say that the police made a Jot is take last year by

bringing Nottingham fans to the Leppings/.n end last year so it does

show that its possible to let the Nottyfigham fans use that end,

despite what they have said.             /

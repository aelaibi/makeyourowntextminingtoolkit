            I work as a turnstile operator at Hillsborough ground,                      at Sheffield

            Wednesday Football Club and I have done so for the past three years.

            On the day of the disaster             15th A pri 1 1989 (150489),        I was working at

            Nc      or No         ;urnstile at                    Hop, Penistone Road End from

            about twenty five to twelve.

            During that time and three oclock I had about tjrfree people                      come to my

            turnstile and offered me money to let them *S{ty ( . / T p m r e           was two persons

            about quarter        past t w o , who offered me £10 eacn X f Q          let them in.     They

            were both Notts Forest fan I recognise their accents                      I d i d n ’t allow

            them in I told them noway.

            At about       ten to three another lad came to the turnstile and offered                      me

            £5 and I told him the same.

            At about       ten past three      I saw one of the gates         near       stone Road
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S2S9S

           opposite Herries Road appear to op,eft and a group of about 50 people

           appeared to rush in from this           I c o u l d n ’t say if they were
          ^ ---------------------------- \ 7
           allowed in by the police or the s t e i a r ^ but it looked like if the

           gates opened and they rushed in and got     in free.   They could have bee

           let in by other farts

                                                                                3IGNED

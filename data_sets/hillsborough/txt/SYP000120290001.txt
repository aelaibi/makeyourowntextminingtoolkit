     I!
                 On    Saturday,             15 A p r i l ,     1989       <150489)             I    came       on    duty       in    uniform       at

                 Main       Street       Police          Station,          in       order       to    work        the      FA    Semi       Final    match

                 at    Hillsborough,                Sheffield.             I was          briefed          before          leaving          Main    Street,

                 by    having       sight          of    the    f o o t b a l 1 o r d e r , that                I was        on P o l i c e       Sergeant

                 Kennedy's          serial,             along       with       officers             from    my       own    E    Group       and, D H Q

                 Community          Liaison.              I was          aware       before          leaving          C1    what       the    outline          of

                 my    duties       for       the       day    would       be       for       serial       no.              That       is    public

                 order       duties          Wadsley          Bridge       Station             prior       to     commencement               of    the

                 match,          meal    during          match       at    C l a y w h e e 1s a n d         similar             duties       after       the

                 match.

                 On    arrival          at    Hillsborough                my    serial          attended             the    match          briefing       in

                 the       North    stand,          and       then       went       as    a    whole       serial          to W a d s l e y ' B r i d g e      .

                 Station,          arriving             there       at    approximately                   1 1am      (1100).          •X    cannot       be

                 specific          about        the      time       as    at    that          time    I had          no    significant             reason

                 to    remember          it.        I    can    remember             thinking             that       given       there       was    only

                 one       special       train          arriving          shortly             after       2pm     (14-00),        that       our

                 deployment             there       so    early          was    perhaps             not    the       best       use   of     the

                 serial.           However          and       perhaps          as    was       in    fact       intended          the       serial       was

                 able       to    pay    attention             to    fans       on       Halifax          Road.

                 I    can    recall          the    public          house       adjacent             to    the       station,         (towards           the
town       centre          on       the    same       side       of       the     road)       was        sh u tt e red               up          with

boarding          across             the    windows.                 I do       not     recall           seeing             anyone,                   apart

from       possibly             the       licensees,             formally             entering               or       leaving                the          pub    at

the    rear.           This          was    not       the       case       at     the      public            house          on       the          opposite

side       of    the       Halifax          Road       from          the    Station           entrance.                     At       the          side          of

that       pub a       road          was    used       for       the       parking           of        hire          vans,       some             being

used       by P o l i c e           serials.           1 do          not    know        if    any        were          fans'                'buses’.

That       pub    was       also          boarded          up    but       the       licensee            was          admitting                   fan.s.             At

some       time       around          midday          he    asked          our       serial,            I do          not    know                who

though,          if    a    couple          of       bobbies             could       stand        with           him    at       the             rear       of

his    pub       to    help          him    'select*             who       he     was      going         to          admit.                 The       pub       at

this       time       seemed          quite          full       of       football          supporters,                  noisy                but          quite

controllable                by       the    licensee             and       his       staff.             I stayed             with                him       for

about        10 m i n u t e s         but       given       that          there       was     another                 serial                at    that          side

of    the       road,       immediately                outside             the       pub,     our        serial             arid a n o t h e r                  by

W a d s ley      Bridge             Station          I did       not       see       the     point           in a c t i n g                 as    a       bouncer

for    him       and       returned             to    my    serial-               I was       not        aware          until                leaving

that       area       immediately                before          3pm       (1500)          that         he       had    any          problems                   with

drunken          customers                and    also       cannot          say       if     the        licensee             ever                requested

P o l i ce      assistance                other       than       that       described              above.

From       the    time          of    getting          to       Wadsley           Bridge          Station              which            was           well

before          midday,             there       was    a    steady          stream           of    Liverpool                 fans                heading

towards          the       ground.              However,             a   small        number           then           came       back             in      the

opposite          direction                heading          away         from        the     ground.,                 I cannot                   give

the    occasion,                was       quite       acceptable                and     only       the           odd    few         were              advised

I    can     recall         during          the       time       spent          at    Wadsley           Bridge              some             fans

Above          Wadlsey             Bridge          Station               is    a    small             industrial                       estate          of    shops,

grassed             areas.              As    time          moved         on       toward             the          start              of    the m a t c h ,           and

cans       were          rolling             about          and      onto          the          road       vehicles                    were       kicking             them

So,    as       an    opinion,             fans          have       readily          exploited             the       weakness         and

to    drink          considerable                   amounts,             if    they       so    wish,        before        going       onto       the

ground,              leaving             the       turnstile             officers          the       subjective            opinion          as    to

whether          they          ae    drunk          or    not       and       the    practical             difficulties               of

arrests          in       that       situation.

Having          outlined             my    thoughts                on    events          prior       to    2pm       (1400),.. I w i l l          now

deal       with       events             after       2pm       (1400).

By    this       time          the       grassed          areas          near       to    Kilner          Way    were      completely

full       of    youths             sat    drinking.                    My    lowest       estimate             of    number       would         be.

500    in       that       area.           Again          generally             good       humoured             and     really        only-

required             monitoring                by    Police.                 Shortly       after          2 p m ( 1 4 0 0 > , the        single

special          train          arrived.                 My    feeling,             shared       to       a man,        fay m y    serial.

was    that          these          supporters                frankly          did       not    need       a Police            es^rdrt.          Ther

was    a    broad          range          of       ages       and       their       conduct          would       not      have     gdne       out

of    place          on    a    church             outing.              However,          my    serial          and     one     other       were

detailed             to    escort          them          to    the       ground.           They       were       held      back       by

Mounted          the       first          outside             the       station          on the       pavement, but               the       front

moved       off       last          as    the       last       of       these        fan s came           down       the s t a t i o n

entrance.

Therefore             the       ones       at       the       front          probably          waited        about        five     minutes.

The    train,             I believe,                had       run       to    time       and    2 . 1 0 p m (1410)         to     2,15pm

(1415)          they       left.

remained.               From            S . 1 5 p m (1415)          until           S . 5 0 p m (1450).                  The       numbers           of       fans

heading          towards                Hillsborough                did        not          seem       to     diminish.

At    all       times          there        seemed            to    be        a     s t e a d y stream.

Coaches          were          off       loading          by       the        station,                anywhere            they        c o u l d stop.                  I

advised          betwen             4-6     drivers            that           this          was       not        the     off       l o a d i n g point

and    to       move       further             up    Halifax              Road.              Theattitude                 of    the       fans        on       the

coach       was       that          the     kick-off               was        nearly             upon       them        and    they        wanted             to

rush       to    the       ground            not     to       miss        that.              One           b us,    the       fans left             by    a

rear       exit       door          w h i 1e     I was         talking              to       the driver.

Brickley          and          PS       Kennedy       started                 to    move          on       the     youth       sat       near        Kilner

Way    and       felt          that        whilst         they           did       riot      argue           about        g o i n g on,         as       you

would       expect             a    group        outside            a     nightclub,                       there        was    not A       rush          in

them       and    all          moved         slowly           off        towards             the       ground,           leaving           a    sea       of

discarded             empty             drink       containers.

Before' t h i s            I       can     recall         a    number              of       men       obviously           desperate                 for       a

toilet          asking             us    where       there          was        a    public             toilet.            I would              be

surprised             if       that        was      due       to    drinking                 a    thermos            flask.           There          was          no

obvious          place,             out     of      sight          of     a    police             offier           at    least,          to     go       to

ur inate.

As    my    serial             had       been       detailed              to       meal          at    3 pm        (1500)      at     C l a y w h e e 1s

(1455).           Even             at    this       point          there           were          still        fans       heading           for       the

ground.           Not          just        ones      or       twos        but       still             small        groups.            We       had

anticipated                meeting             up    with          the        rest          of    our       serial,           whom       we     felt

would       leave          the          outside       of       the        ground             for       meal        shortly          after           kick-off.

I did       not    know at          that       point       what       was       happening             inside       the       ground          and

On    arrival       at    the       ground       it    was          frankly          impossible             to    find       out       what

was    happening.              Initially          I formed                part       of    a    cordon       outside          the       gates
                                                             \                                            . ■'''
On    the    corner       of       Leppings       Lane        itself            with       other       officer®             there.           The

intention          was    to       allow       exit    but          not    entry.              That    only       lasted          a    few

minutes       as    ambulances             began       arriving                and    then       the    fire       service,

Myself       and    PC    Br i c k l e y       took    it       upon       oursleves             to    direct          ambulances              in

towards       the    road          running       around             the    rear       of       the    ground.           By    this         time

I had       gathered        that         there    were          a    number          of    injuries          from       within          th e

West    stand       and     I believed            at       that       time        casualties            were       coming             from     out

of    the    back    of     the      stand.

I did       not    know     the      scale       of    what          was       happening             inside       the       ground.            As

the    fire       service          arrived       we    tried          to       ’p a r k ’ them         so    as    to       leave       t he

entrance          clear.

As    fans    were       leaving          I can       remember             a     number         being       abusive          towards           me /       ■

and    other       officers.              However          this       conduct             was    that       born       out    of       fear

and    not    through          loutish          behaviour.                 It     was      impossible             to    answer          the

many    c omments, including                     " Y o u ’ ve        killed          my    mates       in    there"           "This          is,

all    the    bloody       P o l i c e ’s       fault"              nor    was       it    the       time    to    do       so.

It    was    really       only       when       I saw       the       group          of    8-10       bodies       1a i d     on       the

ground,       behind       makeshift             screens,             that        I knew         the    scale          of    the

disaster          (although          the       first       time       I knew          the       final       numbers          was       some      3

hours       later    via       a    local       radio       broadcast).

One    incident          outside          the    ground             was    that       a    group       of    Liverpool                fans

approached          me,     and      indicating             a       man    wearing             a yellow          press       jacket          told

me    "If    you    d o n ’t g e t        him    away       from          us    w e ’ ll       fucking       kill       him".           (Hail

he    been    taking        photographs               of    the       10       b o d i e s ? ? ? ).     I escorted                him      off

down    Vere       Road    a-nd .                                    whatever             his    actions          had       been'     my

advice          was     that       it    had        obviously             incensed             some       fans     and        he      should

consider           his       own    safety.               I left          him    at       the       other       end      of     Vere          Road.

1 did       notice           people        on       that       road       opening             their       doors       to      L i v e r pool            fans.

       recollection                 of     being          outside          the       ground          was       that       I felt

comVletely              useless.               I    realised             that    there          was       a   disaster              happening,

the    scale           of    which        I learned             later,          but       I received             no      d i r e c t i o n as            to

anythingNl              could       usefully              do.        On    talking             with       other       members                of    my

serial          that\went           inside           the       ground,          I will          always          feel         that        I    did       n ot

do    enough           on    phat       day        and    the       comments             made       in    the    press           about

Policemen              stood\iiout                 not    knowing          what          to    do    were       not       entirely                untrue.

It    seemed           that       the\adio               system          had    completely                gone     and         no     coherent

instructions                 were       comwig           out    over       the       radio.

I can-recall                 a    fellow           officer          2910       Cammock          asking          for      a     response             on

the    radio           from       Control           abo\        3pm       (1300)          and       receiving             rto r e p l y           from

Control.                Iappreciate                 the    obvious             diffi c u l t i e s the            Control                Room       had

and        Iw o u l d       not    wish       these        comme\ts             to       be    taken as..criticism                         of

been       to          violent           pub       fight       with       rny o w         duty       shift,        stood            on       the    side

and    let       the        others        get       on    with       it.                  \.

A    few    final           points.                                                             \

2.                      I have      no    comment              to   make        regarding             t h \ stewards,                    the

incident           had       already           happened             when       I arrived             at       the\around.

rarely          work        inside        the       ground          at    all,       and       usually          only         know        the             \

passing             through               the      trusntiles,                      At      this          time,       most          appeared              tobe

coming             to    my       turnstile                 and       offering              orange             tickets,             which           applied        to

the        Nottingham                  Forest           end        of       the     ground.                One       of    the        people          who

produced                tickets            for         the       Nottingham                 Forest             area       of    the-ground                 informt

 I was           able        at     this          time,          to     bring            t h i s to t h e            attention                 of    a police

 officer            who        was        close             to   the        turnstile.                    He       directed           the       supporter              tc

 another            police             officer               outside             the     ground.                   I do    not        know          where       th e s t

 people            went,          as      they         did       not        come       back          I assume             that        they          got    into        tv

 ground            through             another               entrance.                   I was         not         aware       of     any        stewards           in

 the        immediate                area         of        my   turnstile.                     I    could          see    in        the       enclosure            th-:

  there          were         three          or        four      stewards              at       the       bottom          of        the    stairs           l e a din'

  to       the     seating              area           of    the       West        Stand.              There         were,           however,             ten     or

  twelve            police            officers               inside              the     enclosure                 immediately                 behind        my

  From         1.30pm             onwards,              there           was        ag e n e r a l         increase             in     people          coming

      of    people           at     this        staqe            was        no    greater             than         that        at    a    normal           league

in      order           to     gain       entrance.                At    this          stage,         most           of     these           supporters

were        with         their' f r i e n d s .              One        person           would         enter             the     gangway              with         a

t. j c k e t ,      the        second          person        would           follow           him      closely,                 and       attempt            to

 pass       through               the     turnstile            together                with        his         friend           in       front,         at    the

 same        time         as      offering           me      money       for          his     entrance.                   There            was    however

 enough           room         at      this     stage         to      stop        the       attempt,                and     to       send        the       persor

 without            a     ticket          back       out      of      the      gangway             and         outside           the           turnstile.

 These         people             were        able      to    get       out,          but      only           by    pushing               their       way

 through            the        crowds          waiting           to     enter.

 Generally,                  the       supporters             who       attempted                to    gain          entrance                  without         a

 ticket           would           put     the       money        through              the      gap        in       the    wire            mesh.            The

 money           tended           to     be    rolled         up      into        a      cigarette                 shape.            Mostly            the

  bundles               offered          were        brown       which            indicated               a    ten       pound            note.          =>ome         oJ

  the      bundles             seemed          to       contain         more          than       one          note;       others               were

  different                  colours          indicating                other         values.

  I alway               returned             the     money       to      the       person           who        offered               it.         In    those

  cases          where            they       had     gained         entrance               with       a       friend            on       one     turnstile,,

  asked          the         next       person          in   the        queue         to      call        him        back.               1 then        gave

   the      money            back       to    that        person,            who      then        would             remain           m     the        ground.

   At     one       point,             I am     certain            that       a     police          officer               who        I    cannot

   identify,                 witnessed             my     action         in       returning               money           to     a       supporter            who

   had       tried           to     gain       entrance.                This        supporter                  passed           through           the

   turnstile                 and       was     approached               by    this          same       police             officer.                I assume

   that        he       was       then        ejected         from       the          ground.             I        have     no       idea        what        time


    that       was.

The          people                         coming             through                    the             turnstiles                      were       becoming              very     abusive

towards                      me             at      this           time.                  Most                    of    it     was        just       foul        language,              but    one

supporter                               threatened                       me         with             physical                    violence.                    The     person           following

this             supporter                           told               him         it        was                 not     my      fault,            and       they     both        went       into


the          ground.

There                were                   now          fewer            Nottingham                                  Forest        tickets               being       handed           to    me.

oreat                     it           was        impossible                         for          anyone                    to    go       back.           There       were        a    lot    rr.or-

 supporters                                 now          with            no       tickets                         at     all,       who        would           offer       me     money        in

 return                    for              entrance.                         Again,                  I would                    return             their       money        to    them,        but

 would                    have              to       let         them             into             the                ground,             as   there           was    no     way       for     them

 to         get             back                 outside                 the          ground.

 Some               supporters                            would                try           to           get           two      people             in    on    one       ticket.             The

 ticket                      consisted                         of        three               portions,                         I had           to    detach           and    retain           the

 middle                      portion                     of       the           ticket.                           Some         supporters                 would        tender          the     two

 outside                           portions                    of        their               ticket,                      saying              that       they       had     lost       the     rr.idd

  no r t i o n                         in    the         crowd.                     I believed                            that         their         friend           would       have        this

 middle                        oortion                    to       try          and           g a m                   entrance.

  At          this                     time         it        was         irrelevant                                  whether          or      not       people        had        tickets,          as

  once                   they               were          in            .the        turnstile                           gangway,               the       only        way    they        could       gc

 Eventually,                          this          fan     left           the       rear          of    my      turnstile,                   and      I could              see

 nw       view            some           were            quite        serious,                 but      I am         unable              to   describe                or

 There                  was    a      vast              number        of       Liverpool                supporters                   milling           around              m        th<

   to        leave             the            security           of       the        turnstile,                  through              an      open       gate,         and

   returned                    to       the         office        to           hand          in   my     tickets,

I, _____________________               of
will say as follows:-


I     was born on                  I am a student at
           and am presently studying for my A level  examinations.
I     am       studying       economics, maths and geography          and     my        exams
commenc^— di^ring the week beginning 21st May.  My final exam is
    2c            I am aiming to go to Sheffield University if I
on          ne.
am successful in my exams.


My        family are all supporters of Sheffield Wednesday                       F.C.      My
                has been a programme seller for the past 20                  years        and
for the past 4-5 years I have also been involved with the                                club
as        a    programme seller.            At the beginning of this         season,       in
September 1988, I became a turnstile operator.                       My ___               has
now           taken   the job of programme selling over from                me     and     my
      ---- is         also     involved in programme selling.            I       have     not
missed many home matches during the past 5 years


On        15th April,        1989 I was instructed to man turnstile                        at
the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                     The turnstile        allocation
varies           from match to match so that the turnstile operators                       do
not           get used to a regular stream of customers coming                    through.
I have not worked on                        turnstile before.    However I may           have
worked           once    on a turnstile towards the middle            of      turnstiles
numbered 1-16 at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.                             However,
 I    usually           work at the Kop end.         I arrived at    the      ground       at
 10.15          to    10.20      am.   Turnstile operators had       been        asked     to
 report          to the Central Office where we all meet on match                       days.
 'Phis         j_g situated under the South stand.              I have a pass to          get
 into          the    g'round.     Someone at the office, I do         not       know     the
 name,          allocates the turnstiles and hands out               turnstile          keys.
 The          turnstiles are all very much the same and sometimes it                        is
 easier to work at the visitors end of the ground because                               there
    are       less people to deal with.            However on 15th April it             would
                                         - 2 -




have     been very much the same at both ends of the                ground.              At
the    Central Office I was reminded that this was to be                      an        all
ticket     game.      I was not specifically told to turn people                       away
       were without tickets and wanted to buy their entrance                             as
wh
                  loicw
       was common pj^ertice.                *o cU so.
                                                                   □

At     11.00    to 11.10 am I was allocated a turnstile                 and       walked
down  to the Leppings Lane end of the ground.  I opened up the
                           1^?          T          * _    ......
turnstile  and went and      inside it. I was one of the first
turnstile operators to arrive.               I was allocated a turnstile                 to
open     early to allow the first spectators in.             I was        ready          to
open     at    around     11.30    am.   I    received   extra     money          as     an
incentive       for     opening early and I understand           that     for          this
semi-final       turnstiles were allocated to operators on                    a    first
come first served basis.


Turnstile             was also opened at about 11.30         am.         Turnstiles
                                                                          I do          not
know what time the rest of the turnstiles opened.                   Once          inside
the     turnstile I stood behind the counter and I                was     protected
from     the    supporters by a wire mesh.          Once I   was        inside          the
turnstile I was able to close the door so that it could not                              be
opened from the outside.            I had entered the turnstile from                    the
inside        of the ground and there is also a door to enable me                        to
leave through the outside,            if necessary.


I had a limited view outside the ground and could only see                              for
the first few metres.             I noticed however that there were people
in     Leppings       Lane.   Hardly anybody entered the          ground          before
noon and thereafter people started to come in in ones and twos,
or in small family groups, approximately every 10 minutes.


Towards        12.30 pm I began to think that we would be quite                        busy
but     I considered that the crowd was normal for a match day                           at

that    particular            time.    I started to number              the        counterfoils
from    the        tickets        which I had collected at that                    stage     as     I
thought that this would save time later.                         I had only             collected
about 27 tickets.              The number:jjia^of tickets is not something                          I
normally       do until 4rhc end o f -Hiho match- but I thought it                          would
be a good idea as there was likely to be a big crowd later                                        on.
I thought that I would take maybe as many as 1,000 tickets-                                       and
I wished to save time later.                    At this stage I still had                  plenty
of     time        to number tickets as people were coming                         through        the
turnstiles.           After        12.30   pm      and     towards          1.00     the     first
Nottingham          Forest          tickets     began to appear.              The       Liverpool
tickets were blue and the Nottingham Forest tickets were orange
and they were therefore easily identifiable.                            I questioned              the
first person who presented an orange ticket.                            He told me he had
bought        it     from     a    tout and said         that    he     had        requested        a
Liverpool           ticket.        He had a Merseyside accent and                    two     young
children           with     him.      I considered him to be                genuine.         As     I
talked        to     him     a policeman        overheard       our     conversation              and
directed him to a high ranking policeman outside the ground.                                        I
do     not     know        what    happened      but he    did        not     return       to     my
turnstile.           The police were being helpful generally                         throughout
to     those        who had been given the wrong                 tickets.           After       this
instance,           each . time       someone presented           a    Nottingham           Forest
ticket I directed him to the high ranking policeman whom I                                        had
been told was outside.


At that stage nobody was trying to buy entrance.                                If anyone had
tried I would have turned them away.


 Inside       the ground           there was a police presence and                  I    estimate
 that     there were 12 to 20 police officers inside the                                compound.
 The    fans        were     being     searched       as    they        came        through        the
 turnstile.
                                              - 4 -




The      entrance into the ground progressed like any normal                               match,
day      crowd        and,    despite      the slow    start,     the     crowd        slowly
increased         and I became busier.             By 2.00 to 2.3 0 pm          the        crowd
1/jo.s   passing through the turnstile at the same sort of rate as a
crowd       approaching kick off time at a normal match.                        However          I
was       still able to number tickets as I collected them.                            People
were       passing through reasonably quickly.                  I was     adopting             the
usual procedure which is to check the ticket, tear off and keep
half of the ticket and return the other half to the                             supporter.
I would then press the turnstile pedal and allow the                             supporter
through.


By about 2.3 0 the crowd was beginning to build up.                         The        crowds
outside the ground were adding extra pressure to the                             turnstile
and       it became difficult to allow only one person through at                                 a
 time.      At about this time people started trying tc■«et                            through
 the      turnstile two at a time and a crush was building                        up.            It
was       becoming        difficult to operate the turnstile               because              the
 crowd      was       pressing forward and the people in the                    front          were
 getting        in the way.            At that stage I was taking         the         comments
 which      I     could       hear from the outside with a          pinch         of        salt.
 However,         I specifically recall hearing a shout to                      let        people
 through        more      quickly as people were dying            outside.             I       also
 heard derogatory comments generally about the ground.                                At about
 2.3 0     pm     I    began to think that it was not              safe     to        continue
 numbering            tickets     as I collected them.          At this stage              I    had
 collscted            about     "700    tickets.   I put these to         one     side          and
 started a new pile and planned to count these later.                             I had          no
 time      to look to see what the police were up to.                      By now, if              I
 was      offered the wrong ticket it was impossible for me to                                 turn
  that     supporter back.              I therefore let him through and                trusted
  the     police to deal with him once he was inside                      the     compound.
 After 2.30 pm a large number of people began offering me money.
  I      accepted no money at all.             If money was pushed at me it                     was
«




                                               - 5 -




    given back to the same person who offered it.                        That person         was
    then allowed to pass through the turnstile and I hoped that the
    police     would deal with him.              Towards this time I            specifically
    recall        that    people     were pushing through          the     turnstiles          in
    pairs.        It was often the case that the first person would                          have
    the ticket and the second did not.                   At this stage I had to               let
    everyone        through     as     quickly      as     possible.        I    was     still
    inspecting tickets closely until 2.35 to 2.40.                        At that point I
    recall        that three supporters came through the turnstile.                       . The
    first offered his ticket,               I checked it and it was correct.                  The
    third     also offered his ticket and it was correct.                         The     third
    was     helping the second man through the turnstile.                         I     noticed
    that     he     had been crushed from the outside               and     could        hardly
    walk.         The third man passed me the second man's                  ticket        which
    was also in order.             From that moment on the crush became so bad
    that     I had to accept any ticket offered to me or no ticket                             at
    all.     However, at no stage did I accept any money.


    At     one point I heard footsteps on the roof and                     gathered          that
    people        were climbing over the turnstile buildings.                     I     believe
    that there was more than one person climbing over.                           It was       not
    possible for people to jump the turnstiles themselves.                               People
    were     getting so badly pushed forward that they could not                             step
    back in order to jump over.                The crush continued until 3.00 pm.
    From     2.4 0       onwards I began to smell alcohol on the                  breath       of
    the supporters.            The amount of verbal abuse was increasing                      and
    I     noticed that sweat was pouring off the faces of some of                             the
    fans.         One     or   two of the fans looked         as    though        they       were
    becoming         violent,    but    I    was not     frightened       because        I    was
    standing behind the wire mesh.                 Other people were looking tired
    and crushed and anxious to get in.


    Shortly        after 3.00 pm the crowd disappeared and finally                           there
    was      nobody outside any more.             I do not know exactly               when     the
                                           - 6 -




gate     was opened but presume it must have been                      shortly         before
this time.


I   estimate that during the last half hour I allowed about                                   300
people       through       the turnstile with tickets and              a     further          150
people without.


Once     the       crowd outside had disappeared I waited                    unti^l      pbout
3.15     and       then    shut   up    the outside        door.   I        jaa»fee-rT=r(3    the
remaining          tickets.       I     looked     through, the            Leppings          Lane
enclosure          and saw the Liverpool fans coming back through                            from
the terraces.             I closed the door which lead to the enclosure to
ensure       my own safety.           There was now a build up              of     Liverpool
fans within the enclosure and I heard an announcement over                                    the
tannoy       telling       fans   to     leave the     terraces and          leave            the
ground.         I did not, at that time, know tiws extent of what                             was
happening.           I was able to look into the enclosure through                            the
window       set     in the turnstile and I saw             people         being      carried
injured from the tunnel.                Liverpool fans were returning to                      the
enclosure.           They were distraught.           Someone came up and                 banged
on my window.             He was very angry and looked extremely                    violent.
I     believe that he was looking for someone to blame.                             By       this
time     I     had     finished counting up.           I    therefore            tentatively
opened       the outside door to see what was happening outside                               the
ground.         I     had intended to leave but as I opened the                       door      I
saw the emergency services and decided to wait where I was.                                     I
was     talking to                                    :urnstile.           We decided          to
sit     where        we were and we left at approximately 4.00                      to       4.15
pm.


By the time we left all the terraces had emptied and the police
were     filtering remaining fans out of the ground.   The ^nalicer
                                                         left I
had     formed a line from below the steel gate by the x.i#rt herd
sfeep?       to far wall by "C" gate in order to filter fans                          through

        to        the next area and out into Leppings Lane itself.         We        could
        therefore         exit safely through "C" gate.   We went down          to     the
        Central Office by the south stand to hand in the tickets and to

        get paid.

        I     then went towards the sports hall to find my family who                  had
        been        programme selling.    I was told that they were       not        there
        and therefore returned to the Central Office.             Upon returning I
        was        sent    back   to the sports hall where I    finally    found        my
        family.           We stayed there until we thought that the       crowd        had
        gone        and that it would be safe to leave.        I finally left         with
        my        family, none of whom had been injured, shortly          after       5.30

        pm.

        I     have read this statement and it is true and correct               to     the

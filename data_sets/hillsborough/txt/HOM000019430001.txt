HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

We spoke on the telephone about Lord Justice Taylor's plans to
visit football matches during Part II of his Inquiry, and his
thought that he might visit Chelsea on 30 September to see your
match against Arsenal.

I am very grateful to you for agreeing to this visit.  I will
accompany Lord Justice Taylor, and you suggested that we arrive
at about 12.30 when the briefings start. You kindly agreed to
let us have two car parking passes.

It might be helpful if I gave you an indication of what Lord
Justice Taylor is looking for. The briefings you suggest will be
very helpful. He would then like to see fans arriving, watching
them go through the turnstiles and onto the viewing areas. He
would like to watch some of the match (perhaps the first half)
from the terraces. He would, of course, like to have the
opportunity to meet your Directors and would be happy to receive
hospitality from them if they felt they would like to offer it to
him.

I will be in touch nearer the time to confirm the arrangements,
but please do not hesitate to get in touch in the meantime if any
questions arise.

We look forward to meeting you and your colleagues on 30
September

                                                           /

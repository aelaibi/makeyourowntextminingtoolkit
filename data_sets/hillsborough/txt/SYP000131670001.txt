    Dear Sir,


    Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Investigation



    Thank you for your letter of 2nd March sent to us on behalf of
    Dr. Eastwood.

    We imagine that your letter reflected a standard form sent to
    all  interested parties.          It has nevertheless  caused
    Dr. Eastwood considerable concern and disquiet.

    We have advised Dr. Eastwood that we cannot contemplate any
    criminal charges which could possibly be brought against him,
    not least in view of Lord Justice Taylor's comments at
    paragraph 289 of his Interim Report where he said:


                              "For his part, Dr. Eastwood is skilled and
                              experienced in this     field,  as already
                              indicated, and he sought I have no doubt to
                              act efficiently and professionally in his
                              advice and practical work. "


   Our view, and Lord Justice Taylor's comments, have brought some
   comfort to Dr. Eastwood but he remains distressed at the
   prospect,  however remote,   of his being interviewed under
   caution.

   You will know that Dr. Eastwood voluntarily supplied a full
   written statement with supporting documents from his files for




       Lloyd’s Office: Room 692, Floor 6, Lloyd’s, 1 Lime Street, London EC3M 7DQ. Telephone: 01623 7100 (Ext 4188) Fax: 01929 I960

                                                  Authorised by the Law Society to conduct investment business.
J. Mervyn Jones, Esq. ,
Assistant Chief Constable
West Midlands Police                        - 2 -                9 April 1990



the purpose of the Inquiry.    He did so even though he was made
a party extremely late in the day, indeed many weeks after the
actual Inquiry hearing had commenced.      He gave oral evidence
to the Inquiry for more than 2% days, far longer than any other
witness.    During that period he was questioned by Leading and
Junior Counsel, as the case may be,    forall parties as well as
by Lord Justice Taylor himself.

 We cannot conceive that in his Statement and oral evidence, of
 which you will have a transcript, Dr. Eastwood did not deal
 exhaustively with all matters of relevance.      We cannot see
 that a distressing interview under caution could or would add
 anything to what Dr. Eastwood has already said in evidence.

 Nevertheless, Dr. Eastwood wishes as ever to be co-operative.
 In the unlikely event that there is any particular aspect which
 you feel may not have been covered adequately in his written
 Statement or oral evidence then       the most convenient and
 appropriate course might be for you to write to us with
 relevant questions.   Dr. Eastwood will then be happy to answer
 them in writing via ourselves.


 Yours faithfully,

      Dear Sir

      Hillsborough Disaster - Criminal Investigation

      We thank you for your letter of 7th June with enclosures.

      We believe that there should be on the file a copy letter from
      our clients to Mr Mackrell, Club Secretary, dated 13th March
      1987, which was not included in the papers which you sent to

      We look forward to hearing from you.

Dear Dr Popper

HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

I enclose a copy of a letter of 9 April which the Home
Secretary has received from Eddie O'Hara MP on behalf of his
constituents, Mr and Mrs Aspinall, who lost a son at the
Hillsborough disaster.  I should be grateful for any comments
you may be able to offer on the points raised by Mr and
Mrs Aspinall.

In our reply to Mr O'Hara we will, of course, state that a
coroner is an independent judicial officer and that even
though the Home Secretary is responsible for coroners law, he
has no authority to intervene in or comment on the way in
which a coroner conducts his inquiries in any particular case.

                                                                      Yours sincerely




                                                                      G HARRISON (MISS)
                                                                      E Division

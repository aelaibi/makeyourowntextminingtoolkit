    6.   As a result of that hearing some further evidence was requested

         the central issue.

    8.   (In passing it may be noted that both the domestic English Court
         the commision and indeed again the European Court, all concluded
         that Liverpool city Council had acted properly and in accordance
         with the relevant UJc. legislation).                                           WATCH-THIS SPACE
    9.   The central isue appeared to be whether the U.K. law and
         procedure as it was at the material time, and indeed as it is in
         its most recently amended form, should provide a system of inde­
         pendent arbitration to operate in respect of all individual applica­
         tions for disclosure, the competing rights for the indiviual on the
         one hand and on the need to protect third parties and public interest
         on the other.
         Except in relation to criminal proceedings, U.K. provision does
         not extend to such arbitration in respect of individual applications
         and notwithstanding that there is in place a machinery to review
         the working of the access to personal information legislation in
         general, it could be argued that the absence of arbitration in respect
         of individual applications automatically prejudices decision in
         favour of public agencies, third parties, and non-disclosure.
         There are of course valid arguments to support the contrary view.

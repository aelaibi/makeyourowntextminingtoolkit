H o y l a n d Road,' N e e p s e n d Lane,           Parkwo-od Road,         Clubmill      R o a d and

Penistone Road.                On o c c a s i o n during       our    patrolling we had to               pass the

V i c t o r i a Pu b l i c H ou s e    on N e e p s e n d Lane and the Owl Public House                        at

Hi 1.1foot Bridge.              O ut s i d e   of both these          public     houses were           large

groups      of N o t t i n g h a m Forest          supporters        who were drinking            heavily.

A p p r o x i ma te   numbers       outside        these    premises w ould have             been one

h u n d r e d outside       the Owl,           and sixty outside            the Victoria,         the    latter

conta ining L i v e r p o o l         supporters.

A r o u n d 2pm that a f t e r n o o n traffic              had    built     up in the area,            the    side

streets       that we were            patrolling         had fil l e d with        parked vehicles             and

a long     the m a i n     roads      there was a st e a d y          stream of traffic: travelling

t owards H i l l s b o r o u g h      football        ground.        This    traffic      soon became

heavily       con g e s t e d at      the      j u n c t i o n of N e e p s e n d Lane and P e n i s t o n e    Road

where a u ni f o r m officer was                   on traffic        duty.     Shor t l y after        this     time

he was      joined at this                 point   by a Police        motorcyclist         and a Police

Roa d    towards H i l l s b o r o u g h        in order      to ease the         congestion.

At a r o u n d 2 . 3 0 p m that a f t e r n o o n N o t t i n g h a m Forest          supp o r t e r s were

still      outside       the    two    previ o u s l y m e n t i o n e d    public    houses a l t h o u g h        not

in such s t r e n gt h as           they had been earlier.                   There were        still     large

numbers       of s u p p o rt er s making            their way       towards     the ground,           a distance

of some       one     to one an d a            half miles.

public house at this time a p p e a r e d                    to be quite            empty but       there were

M c R o bbie w h o left        s ho r t l y after        our arrival.             Whilst we       had been on

patrol      in the N e e p s e n d area we had been                     in p o ssession of a personal

radio and had been m o n it or in g Channel                        19 w h i c h had been d e d i c a t e d as

the CID       channel       for    the FA C u p Semi Final.                   It was whilst          we were at

this    l o c ation that we           ove r h e a r d t r a n s m i s s i o n s    on Channel       25 and

became a ware          that    there were          problems        at    the ground.

We were       then jo i n e d by PS B u x t o n and DC Hirst who were                            both engaged

on mobile        patrol       duties       involving       crime.         Toget h e r w i t h them we               then

listened to further                transmissions           on Channel             23.     It became all             too

obvious       from what        we were        hearing      that a serious                incident     had

o c c u r r e d at the L e p p in g s Lane          end of the           ground and that            numerous

people      had been        injured,        some    quite      seriously,           some a p p a r e n t l y    dead.

After     liaising        w i t h PI T o w e l l by radio,              DS Bu x t o n and DC Hirst              left

to a t t e n d the ground.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 5 p m   that a f t e r n o o n after a c o n v e r s a t i o n          by radio

w it h DS Buxton,           PC S t e v e n s o n and my s e l f         then made         our way     back      to his

vehicle and drove              back to H a m m e r t o n R o a d Police S t a t i o n where                    we

                    rushed forwards an d began kicking                         the   chairs around.                He was also

                    shouting       o b s c e n i t i e s and    I took    hold of him          in order           to try and          cairn

                    him and to        prevent        him causing         injuries       to himself         or others.                He

                    an d   pulled this man a way from me,                      speaking      to him as            if he alre a d y

                    k new him.        Although        this man was            no doubt     em o t i o n a l l y    upset     the      fact

           that     he was         drunk was adding               to his     problems.

           At a r o un d 5 . 4 0 p m       that a f t e r n o o n     I became       involved      in speaking       to

END OF   REPORT
Steven John Vialton
Police Constable 1826
South Yorkshire Police, Hamnerton Road Police Station. (Attached to CID)

On Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at 9 am at Hammerton Hoad. I was
aware that my duties for that day would involve patrolling in Plain Clothes
around the Neepsend area of the city. This was in connection with possible
thefts of and from motor vehicles parked in that area by persons attending
the FA Cup semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough.
At 10.00 am that day I attended a briefing at the Hillsborough Football Ground,
addressed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield. After that initial briefing I
and the other CID officers present had an additional briefing from Det. Supt.
McKay, detailing our individual duties for that day. .
After that I returned to Hamraerton Road Police Station together with DC 366
Stevenson who was to work with me throughout that tour of duty. At Hammerton
Road we collected DC Stevensons own vehicle which we then drove to Iloyland
Road at Neepsend where we parked.
As already mentioned our duties for the day were to patrol the area with regard
to theft of and from motor vehicles. I was dressed that day in the following
clothing: blue leather jacket, blue checked shirt, blue cord trousers and grey
shoes.
Together with DC Stevenson I patrolled the Neepsend area around Hoyland Road,
Neepsend Lane, Parkwood Road, Clubmill Road and Penistone Road. On occasion
during our patrolling we had to pass the Victoria public house on Neepsend Lane
and the Owl public house at Hillfoot Bridge. Outside of both these public houses
were large groups of Nottingham Forest supporters who were drinking heavily.
Approximate numbers outside these premises would have been one hundred otitside
the Owl and sixty outside the Victoria, the latter being the most rowdy,
shouting , singing and giving abuse to passing motorists. '.'specially receiving
abuse were passing vehicles containing Liverpool supporters.
Around 2 pm that afternoon traffic had built up in the area, the side streets
that we were patrolling had filled with parked vehicles and along the main roads
there was a steady stream of traffic travelling towards Hillsborough football
ground. This traffic soon became heavily congested at the junction of Neepsend
Lane and Penistone Road where a uniform officer was on traffic duty. Shortly
after this time he was joined at his point by a Police motorcyclist and a Police
Range Rover which contained a further traffic officer and Chief Superintendent
Nesbitt. These officers assisted with traffic control and attempted to make two
lanes of traffic travelling along Penistone Road towards Hillsborough in order
to ease the congestion.
At around 2.30 pm that afternoon Nottingham Forest supporters were still outside
the two previously mentioned public houses although not in such strength as they
had been earlier. There were still large numbers of supporters making their way
towards the ground a distance of some one to one and a half miles.
By 2.30 pm that afternoon most of the football supporters had left the area and
traffic congestion had eased considerably around Neepsend Lane. It was around
this time that DC Stevenson and myself made our way to the Police Communications
caravan which was situated outside the Owl public house at Hillfoot Bridge,
arriving around 2.55 pm. The public house at this time appeared to be quite
empty but there were numerous glasses and bottles from these premises scattered
around on the street outside.
At the Communications caravan at this time was Chief Insp. McRobbie who left
shortly after out arrival. Whilst we had been on patrol in the Neepsend area we
had been in possession of a personal radio and had been monitoring Channel 19
which had been dedicated as the CID channel for the FA Cup semi final. It was
whilst we were at this location that we overheard transmissions on Channel 25
and became aware that there were problems at the ground.
We were then joined by DS Buxton and DC Hirst who were both engaged on mobile
patrol duties invoMng crime. Together with them we then listened tofurther
4




                                            2

    transmissions on channel 25. It became all too obvious from what we were hearing
    that a serious incident had occurred at the Leppings Lane end of the ground and
    that numerous people had been injured, some quite seriously, some apparently
    dead. After liaising with DI Towell by radio DS Buxton and DC Hirst left to attend
    the ground.
    At approximately 3»15 pm that afternoon after a conversation by radio with DS
    Buxton, DC Stevenson and myself then made our way back to his vehicle and drove
    back to Hammerton Road Police Station where we gathered together Gen 18 Sudden
    Death forms, Gen 19 body labels, numerous exhibit bags and one of the major
    incident boxes.
    I then made my way to the Sheffield Wednesday football ground at Hillsborough
    together with DS Ellis, Dc Stevenson and DC Walker arriving at the Penistone Road
    end of the ground at about 3*^5 P®* Together with these other officers I went to
    the gymnasium with the equipment and stationary we had taken with us. On arrival
    inside the gym I saw well over fifty bodies laid out on the floor, most having
    a uniform Police officer standing by them.
    In the centre section of the gym I saw ambulance crews and medical teams attending
    to numerous injured persons. I also noticed at least two doctors who were in
    the gym and they seemed to be examining the obvious dead and pronouncing life
    extinct.
    Many of the Police officers I saw inside the gym at this time were known to me
    and some were personal friends. The majority of these officers appeared to be in
    a severe state of shock and a small number were reduced to tears. Together with
    DC Stevenson I then began to distribute body labels, string and rubber gloves
    to the officers who were dealing with the deceased persons. Whilst doing this
    I made time to speak to officers I knew personally who appeared to be shocked
    and in a daze.
    I then assisted in moving the deceased persons within the gymnasium, affter they
    had been placed into 'body bags' and pronounced dead by the doctors who were on
    hand.
    I was then asked together with other officers from my department, to arrange a
    number of chairs in the centre section of the gym for relatives and friends to
    sit on. After I had put the last chair in place a short man who had been standing
    nearby with a vicar suddenly rushed forwards and began kicking the chairs around.
    He was also shouting obscenities and I took hold of him in order to try and calm
    him and to prevent him causing injuries to himself or others. He then turned his
    anger towards me by swearing and threatening me, this man smelled strongly of
    intoxicants and from his demeanor it was apparent that he was quite drunk.
    Another officer who I believe was DS Hopewell from D1, then came over and pulled
    this man away from me, speaking to him as if he already knew him. Although this
    man was no doubt emotionally upset the fact that he was drunk was adding to his
    problems.
    At around 5-^t-O pm that afternoon I became involved in speaking to relatives and
    friends of persons who were missing at the ground. I then accompanied a number
    of these people to Hammerton Road Police Station, together with other officers
    travelling on the Force coach. On arrival at Hammerton Road the friends and
    relatives went to the Hillsborough Boys Club where Social Workers were present
    to speak with them.
    I then went to the CID office which had been turned into a large interview room.
    Here I spoke to friends and relatives who were reporting people missing that had
    been with them at Hillsborough.
    Around 7.30 pa that evening together with other officers I attended a briefing
    at the station, by Det. Superintendent McKay. After that briefing I was stood
    by in the CID office at Hammerton Road pending another matter not connected with
    the H i l l s b o r o u g h *
On Saturday 1 5 April 1989 I was working the football duty as a CID officer,
however I have worked many football games at the Hillsborough Football ground
in uniform and in particular at the Leppings Lane end. When it first became
apparent to me what had happened that afternoon I found it hard to believe
that such a thing could have happened and on such a large scale.

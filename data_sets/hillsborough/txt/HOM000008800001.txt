                    Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 1989

The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster of April 1989 claimed the lives of 96

people. Lord Justice Taylorâ€™s public inquiry attributed blame and held

individuals to account for the mistakes they made.       The Director of Public

Prosecutions considered the evidence and in 1990 ruled that no prosecutions

should take place.      Lord Justice Stuart -Smith who was appointed in

June1997 to conduct a scrutiny into whether there was any fresh evidence

which might have a bearing on the various legal procedures and decisions

that had been taken, reported in February 1998 that he did not consider there

was any material which should be put before the              Director of Public

Prosecutions.




A Police Authority can fund the cost of the legal defence of police officers and

former officers who face criminal charges arising out of the performance of

their duty. Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray were serving police officers at the

time of the disaster and now face prosecutions brought by private individuals

for alleged offences arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.




Home Office guidelines were followed and it has been decided to meet the

cost of these now retired officers defending themselves against these private

prosecutions.    In making this decision it is accepted that, whilst mistakes

were made, these officers acted in good faith and that the morale of the Force

is served by paying the defence costs of these long retired officers.

Dear Mr^Dear        'Tua'tica.      ,

In the aftermath of the tragic events at Hillsborough, and with the public and
police inquiries about to begin, I thought the time wasappropriate  to write
to you on a personal basis both as the General Manager    of a
in the West Midlands and as someone who almost died a few yards from the
security fence behind the goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Firstly, as a General Manager of a                  I fully appreciate from
personal experience the complexities associated with conducting such a large
scale independent inquiry and the importance of securing accurate information
and balanced and objective evidence from a wide range of people.

Secondly, and much more importantly leading from this first point, I owe it to
the people of Merseyside, those who died and their bereaved, to draw on that
experience in giving evidence to the two inquiries which I would hope will
have a bearing on their outcome.

I have carefully recorded my experiences on the day itself and my assessment
of all the key issues which collectively contributed to the tragedy which
occurred.

As an illustration I witnessed and experienced

a)   The difficulties in getting to the ground.

b)   The harrowing experiences outside the ground and the many dilemmas
      faced.

c)   The opening of the gate bypassing the turnstiles, which I was standing
     next to when it was opened.

d)   The crush in the tunnel leading into the section behind the   goal.

e)   The tragedy as it unfolded in the terracing behind the goal   and the
     response to it.

    g)           The security and stewarding arrangements both outside and inside the
                  ground.

    h)           The aftermath when the full extent of the tragedy had been realised and
                  the actions which followed.

    There are many more points I could highlight at this stage, but essentially
    the most important contribution I can make is by giving a full and balanced
    perspective and an objective assessment of what actually occurred to both of
    the inquiries, and I would ask you to provide me with that opportunity.

    I have supported Liverpool Football Club for many, many years, have managed
    many of the                  and lived in the area where many relatives and
    friends still reside, and giving evidence to the inquiries will I believe be
    my small way of helping the people of Merseyside and a token of my respect for
    those who died and their bereaved.

    Thank you for taking time to give consideration to my letter and I should be
    grateful if the letter enclosed could be forwarded to Lord Justice Taylor.

    I look forward to hearing from you.

            On Saturday 15th April,               1989 (150489)        I attended the semi-final

            football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield

            Wednesday.          I had a £6.00 ticket for the Leppings Ln standing area B.

            I had travelled to Sheffield on the evening before                      (friday 140489)       in

            my own car and stopped overnight at my brother's m a t e ’s lodgings.

                Sheffield and his friend \     /(surname unknown).                     These   lodgings

           were about           10 - 15 minutes drive away from the ground and we left

           about       1.30 pm (1330 hrs).               On route we stopped off at a pub as my

            brother had arranged to meet some one to give them a ticket but 1 did

            not go in, and by the time we left                   it was about 2 pm (1400 hrs).

                    We parked the car in a side street to the rear of Leppings Ln about 5

                    minutes walk from the ground at about 2.15 pm (1415 hrs).                  (here was a

                           [packed with Liverpool    supporters,   everyone was shouting and

                      ngmg     but there was no disorder or fighting,



                    We left the pub at about 2.25 pm (1425 hrs) and walked to the ground.

                    As we walked/to the ground I saw quite a few policemen standing at the

                    junctions/of the st               I had no difficulty finding my way round as

                    and as we walked along Leppings Ln we were asked about four times                     if

                     e had any spare tickets.         As we came up to the outer       iron gates to

By about 2.50 pm (1450 hrs)       the two Policemen on horseback were

shouting at everyone to get back and it almost appeared that they were

beginning to panic themselves.        They gradually managed to back the

horses out of the crowd by the outer           iron gates.           The crowd were

getting very frustrated by this time as nothing seemed to be moving at

all.   It did not appear as if anyone was getting through

the turnstiles    I saw   one or two people       climb up o v ^ y ^ h e

of the turnstiles    in   all the time   I    was w a i t i n g y K e V e .   I did not

notice anyone else gain entry by climbing ovl^T                    At about 2.55 pm

(1455 hrs)   it seemed as    if the crowd were all            pushing towards

the two turnstiles to the right as if they were the only two

that were open and people were beginning to faint and people

were being   lifted over the top of the crowd because                   it was so

packed and crowded and people were disturbed and shouting to watch

out because somebody      had collapsed. I was getting           closer to          the

end turnstile by the      railings about 6 feet away when all of a

sudden a side exit     concertina gate opened to the right of the

't-ujrrfsti les and a Policeman   came out and shouted come on,                come on

you can get in here.      There were also about 6 other Policemen at

this gate.     My brother and I were     in about first twenty five

people to walk through this gate.            We did not have to surrender

our tickets.     As we walked through into the             inner courtyard I

saw a middle aged man collapse        in this area         and we went and

helped him take his jacket and scarf off and sit him down.                        By this

time my brother's friend had got in through                the turnstile and         I

could see that the exit gate was still            open
                                                  and peo/le were walking

over to the tunnel    entrance which leads to the /antre terracing area

in the West Stand area.       I had not n o t i c e ^ any s: gr|s directing us

anywhere else and all     I had seen was this entraiiM/ tV-tnis tunnel.

I did not realise that we could walk around to the sides and there was

no Police or stewards directing us.             I saw the staircase to the stand

and there were a couple of Policemen and stewards at the base of these

       s but there was no one at the entrance to the tunnel.                We started

      walk through the tunnel and there were           plenty of people walking

through but there was        plenty of room.       As we approached the far end of

the tunnel    I could see the players on the pitch and all of a sudden it

was just as if I was swallowed up in the crowd.                  I was immediately

separated from my brother and his friend and I was swypt to the right

into Pen 3.    I had no control      to where    I was going arid my feet hardly

touched the floor.         I would say this was about one m i ^ t e ^ ^ u 3 o'clock

(1459 hrs).     Within about one minute         I was swept f o o m ^ h e   tunnel       to

almost the front of Pen 3, area marked G7 on the gfid shown to me.

The    crush was tremendous.       I c o u l d / see people   climbing over the front

perimeter f e n c e .    My elbow was smshed into someone's f a c e , but I could

not move my arms at all.         I was stuck      in this position ftor kbp4t            10 -

15 minutes,    I was watching     people being carried over and\ c tfiS fib ijfq          over

the fences but I was unable to move myself              I got my leg \ y u ck on a

crush barrier at one time but managed to free myself and the crush

began to ease at about 3.15 pm (1515 hrs).                I managed to turn around

and I decided to push my way back towards the tunnel                 to get out.



I had not seen a crush [ c a r r i e r   break at all and I do not believe that

anyone standing     immediately around me had died.             At no time had I seen

anyone behaving disorderly or drinking             in the ground.      It only took rne

about one minute to push my way back to the tunnel and I just saw

everyone standing there,        I couldn't understand why everyone was just

standing there.         I got into the tunnel,\a/d there were still            people in

there but I was able to walk through fai                      sily and I noticed

                 they were dead or not.        I believe     I came out a Y the JbVck of the tunnel

                 by about 3.15 pm ( 1515 hrs).         As I came out If
                                                                     of the ga^tf of the tunne 1

                 I was trying to get my breath but there were only about 20 people at

                 the back when I came out but many more            people started to come out and

                 be carried out, and they were          laid out on the floor around me.          I

                 noticed that the exit gate that had been opened was still open.



                 All   the people that were being        carried out had lost shoes and clothing

                 some of them being half naked.           I started to help but no one seemed to

                 know what to do.      About ten Police arrived after a couple more minutes

                 and some of them seemed to know what to do first aid wise but some of

                 them had less    idea than me.        I stayed around this area for about 30

                 minutes to see if my brother          came out.    The fire service arrived in

                 this area about 3.40 pm (1540 hrs) and gradually the Police took over

                 and I moved into the background.            By about 4 pm (1600 hrs)      I walked

                 out   into Leppings Ln and sat on the wall          by the river.      I just   could

                 any kind of order at about 3.25 pm (1525 hrs) and we lay her down and

                 she appeared to me to be dead.          We pulled her jumper down to make her

                 decent and then a Policeman carne over and said okay,              thanks very much

                 and took over.



                 I waited outside the ground until about 5 pm (1700 hrs)                looking for my

                 brother and his mate until        I eventually found them and we made our way

                 home.

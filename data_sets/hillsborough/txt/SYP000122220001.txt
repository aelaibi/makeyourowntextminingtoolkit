             obtained,         Mr         p ro duced a small         tape    recorder        (pocket       size)      and

              began to      record the       interview.           I p ol itely        r eq u es t ed him not        to      do so

             and he g r a c e f u l l y   s t op pe d   the recording.



             However,       on c o m p l et i on of     the   in te rv ie w w h i c h had been       i n te r r u p t e d     a

              couple     of times      regarding        the   use   of the      tape     recorder.           Mr     did

              record me,        reading     back    to him the       contents         of the s t at em en t w h i c h         he

             signed.



             Superintendent          Thursfield         is aware     of this         incident.



             However,       since    reading       back    the sta te me nt      I am a ware       of two

              Secondly      on   line    14 of    page 3 he     refers    to    passing      t h ro u gh some    gates.
tr^
              T hese are     the gates w h i c h      separate     the two yards        inside     the   ground.

              On   line    17 same      page    he stated he did not           see a ny gates      open.         This

              refers      to the gates         p ermi tting access     into     the   ground     but   is not     clear

              in the      statement.

   twelve      pounds and was             for the seats          in the We^rt Stand,        and specified

   the seat and            row wi th in the stand.

   My son had o bt ained a ticket                   for    the adjacent       seat     in t h a t same      stand.

   At about       9.30 am on the S at u r d a y morning,                 15th,    April    1989 we were

   collected by the               coach,    owned by Lloyds           of Nuneaton,        from

                                  Coventry.        The    coaches     first stop or        pick-up
                                                                                                     _L
   Coventry,           where about        twenty    people       boarded   including                        , the

   s u pp or te rs      club general       manager and organiser,                who   lives

                                                   Coventry.

   The    coach made a further               two    stops at N u n e a t o n and H i n kl ey where about

   eight     people were           collected at each stop,               before    continuing       on to the

   last     pick up point at Leicester.

   As we     left the M&9 M o t o r w a y just before L eicester we were                          stopped by

   P olice Officers at              the    roadside,       who had a s s u m e d we were C h e l s e a

   O f ficers      realised we were Liverpool                   S u p po rt er s and were      then a l l ow ed

   to continue           our journey.

                                                     p           including   the two HE WI TT brothers

   I did not k n c^ /xhem            personally,          but    I did know them by sight as

   o c ca si o n a l l y att en di ng matches with the supporters                      club.      I am unable

   to say what           either     lad was wearing             or   if they were      carrying anything.

   I think       it w ould have been ar ou nd               12 noon by the time,            the    coaches

   left L eicester and headed towards S h e f f i e l d on the M1 motorway.                                  1

   cannot      recall       the    coach encountering any traffic                  hold-ups       before

   S h e f f i e l d and    it did not stop any where                  en route between L ei ceter and

   S he ff i e l d s    outskirts     until    we had left the motorway.

   There,      in a lay by just             off the m ot or wa y the         coach was      flagged down
                                                                                                PAGE        :
                                                                                                S2 S 1 7

and stopped by Poli/e O ff icers and searched.                       We were delayed for some

time    there and tnen a l l o w e d to          continue.     The    coach took a back          route

a ro u n d She^PTi'eld to get to the ground and along                   this    route we were

s top pe d again,        3-4 m iles     from the first       stop.     The Police who       stopped

us on this         occasion    carried out a more          detailed search w hi ch delayed

us    longer,      perhaps about        ten minutes.       I remember     the Police Officers

tried to move us on after                they had    completed their       search,     but we had

let one supporter           get off the        coach to go to the toilet and had to

wait    his      return.    The Police Officers at this              second stop put a

sticker       in the door window,            presumably to     indicate we had been

sear c h e d .

However,       a sho^t     distance      from this      second search we were stopped

a g a i n and/a P o l i ce ma n b o a r d e d the   coach.     He delayed us for some

IriTnutes, t ravelled with the               coach a short     distance    then stop pe d the

coach again,          to get off,       and we   continued to the ground.

As the     coach a p p r o a c h e d   the   stadium,    a short     distance    from the

L e ppings Lane entrance,              the   coach was    stop pe d and boarded by a Police

Officer.         He    informed us that we were           not a l l ow ed to disembark          in

L e pp in gs Lane,       but were      to stay with the       coach until       it parked.           This

was    in order that we w ould know where the                  coach had been parked.

Desp it e the         presence of a slightly d is ab le d man on the              coach who asked

to be a l l ow ed to get         off the      coach, a man     I know as          , (who has

d if fi c u l t y walking     even short       distances)     the Police Officers w ou ld not

a l l o w us to stop this          close to the ground.

The    coach      continued then to Its parking              p o i n t , the driver   having         been

d ir ec te d by the Police,            about a mile      from the ground,        to the west          of

it,    in an      industrial     area.

This    would have         been at about 2pm a nd was at a place where                 there were

m an y other Liverpool           Supp or te rs    coaches.     1 cannot    be more specific

than this.            We di sernbarked and wa lk ed to the stadium with other




                                                                                            &

' suppo rt er s      from our      coach and other           coaches w hich had         parked there.

  We did not         receive any Police escort                or di re ct io n from our           parking

  point    to the ground,            but    the    route was      r easonably direct.

  I took us about           twenty minutes            to walk     to the ground and on our

  arrival       we   entered the ground directly.                   We had no d i ff ic ul ty at all

  g etting      to the turnstiles,               there were      hardly any queues,         and     I cannot

  recall     noticing any Police                 or S te wards    directing     people outside            them.

  I do not       remember       seeing any         supporters      drinking alcohol         en route        to

  the stadium.          C er t a i n l y   no one on our         coach en route to the stadium.

  C e r t a i n l y no one on our          coach had       carried alcohol         with them to the

  match,     this     is always       a point made by                         - that     it will         not be

  tolerated.          I also     did not witness any disorder,                  fighting      or

  drunkene ss        between our arrival              point an d the ground,          nor any

  u n au th o r i s e d entry    to the ground.

          and    I had no d if fi c u l t y        in reaching      our    seats    in the West Stand,

  o bv io us l y having      handed our ticket              counterfoils       in upon entry via the

  turnstiles.         Our    seats were           located on the front          row directly

  o verlooking        the

  terraces and slightly to the                     right    of the goals.          There was a p it ch —

  gate    in the      perimeter       fence       just to the      left    of my seating          position.

  We were       sat with a number            of other Heart         of E n g la nd supporters            whose

  names    I do not know.             The time would have             been about S.25pm.

  It w ould have been            pen three         that our seating         position     particularly

  overlooked,        and    I g r a d ua ll y saw this        filling      up as time went on.              By

  g . 5 0 p m this    pen was      up to capacity           if n o y ' o v e r f u l 1, and yet    the    pen

  adj ac en t    to this and to            its    right    (peTj/two) was      compar it iv el y empty.

  I began to be concerned for the safety of the supporters                                  in the        pen

  below us.          I remember       seeing one man,            a white male,       5 6 —57 yrs     of age,

  of a ve ra g e height and            probably thin ~ slim            build,      he had straight          grey

  hair    to collar and          combed back,          and wear in g      spectacles and a pp e a r e d

cleanshaven.          I cannot          describe         him any further            that    this,     and am

unable       to say what      clothing          he was wearing.               He was       being jost le d         in

the    pen    (three)    and was obv io us ly not able                    to move        indep en da nt ly of

the    crowd.      The    crowd,         w hich was       packed,       was moving in forward and

sideways       directions         in     what a pp ea re d to me to be an                  u nc omfortable

w ay.It a pp e a r e d to me that the                crowd was         o v er pa ck ed     in this      pen,      and    I

a s s u m e d that a policeman who was                   stationed        in the gangway of the                   stand

close    to our      seats must          have      been able to see this                 fact.      He would

have    been    in a good         position to see exactly what was happening                                 in

those    pens      in my opinion.             I cannot         describe       the    police      officer

unfortunately,           but was        struck      by h^isy l a c k    of    concern for the            people

below    in the      pens.

The m atch kicked-off,                 a short while after              this       I remember       seeing        the

man that       I previously de sc ri be d about                  six yards          closer    to the fence              in

the    crush than he had been.                     His    initial      position on the terraces                    in

pen three had been about mid- wa y up the terrace                                   itself,      and because of

the    crush of      people       in the      pen there         is no conceivable way he                   could

have moved himself            to the second               point.       In my opinion the              barrier

breaking       in pen three was              the    cause of this man movement                    down the         pen.

I was    not able to see that                 barrier         because     of the sheer           volume      of

people a ro u n d     it,    nor       did   I see a sudden            surge forward,            my a t t e n t i o n

had been diverted to the kick-off.

A r o u n d this   time also,           I d is ti n c t l y    remember       hearing a voice say,

W e ’ve got to get them out                  of t h e r e ” meaning          the    pen below.         T hen I

remember       getting      to my        feet and        leaning over the balcony and helping

to    pull   supporters       out                                      three).

I helped to pull            up,    u                                   ilty because they a p p e a r e d            to

e x h a us te d and bathed or s at urated with sweat,                          and some had           lost     shoes

or clothing         in the    crush below.               The    last    one    I a ss is te d up into the

stand a pp e a r e d to be on his               last    legs,    he was     having d i ff ic ul ty

b reathing and          could not stand up on his own.                      I had to man-h an dl e             him

up away fron the front,                 he just        could not     help himself.             This     last    one

was a white male,              about 20 y r s - 22 yrs,             about 6 ’ tall,           of slim - thin

build,     with dark -- mid brown straight                      s ho rt is h hair,      cleanshaven,           and

was wearing a shirt              (possibly grey-brown)               and    trousers.          I cannot

further     describe        him or his          clothing.

It was whilst           1 was    helping        these    peajpi. e up into the stand that                 I

recall     see i ng the        pitch-gate        o penya by a policeman               (out of    pen t h r e e ).

I w ould    not    be able       to say whit           time   that w ould have          b e e n , but    I am

quite    sure the match was              stin.1 in progress.               Having      opened the gate

the    policeman and a fewj^dI le ag ue s                 began trying          to    pull    people out of

pen three onto the              pitch.         I watched and        saw that         they were totally

unable     to    pull    people out       of that gate,           the bodies were just

too tigh tl y      packed.        The one        policeman threw his arms                up in

f r u s t r a t i o n and then    continued trying              to get     people out of the gate,

and    I moved a way from the front,                    in order     to help those            lifted up into

the    stand to get awa y from the front,                       to a l lo w more       people    to be

pulled up.         I was       unable    to see what          else was      happening         in the     pens

below after        this,       be cause there we re more             people      being       pulled up or

pulling     people up at the front of the stand and blocking my vision.

S h o r t l y after     this    I said t o ______ that           there was       little else we           could

do and we should            leave     it to the others who               had a r ri ve d to help

afterwards.           I m e n t i o n e d to           , that most       of the       people at the           front

were    dead,     I had become aware that                 there was a "wall"             of    people at the

front of        pen three all a p p a r e n t l y dead or            certainly         lifeless.        Their

faces were        blue and their          heads were          tilted     to one side.           I cannot

really describe any of these                     people,      though.       I thought         there were

p robably a hundred of them,                   and they       remained      in this      block    even as

crowd conditions            eased     in the      centre of the          pen.

We made        our       way to the back of the stand and shortly after                          left the

ground.           In     t he area    behind the West S tand              we e nc ou nt er ed about ten or

twelve       people       lying    on their stomachs a p p a r e n t l y         lifeless.       No one was

a t t e nd i ng    to them that          I could see,      and    I remember       one    in particular

who    I thought was dead.                  This man,     a white male,          was aged about         -19-20

yrs,    of a ver ag e       height       ( 5 ’8 " ) , medium-    stocky build,       with m ed i u m     brown

straight          shortish hair,          c leanshaven,       I cannot     say,    though,      what he was

wearing,          but he was       blue     in the face and        bleeding       from the      nose.     I

thought        he was dead.           I am unable to describe any of the other                      persons

who were          laid out there,           other than to say there were a few females

am on g st     them.

We    left the ground of our own accord and made                           our way back         to the

coach via a telephone.                    I cannot     say at what        time this would have

been.The          coach gra du al ly filled up with the                  returning       supporters      until

by     6 .30      pm - 7 pm,       there were only two missing,                  Carl and Nicholas

HEWITT.           We     did not     learn until       much     later     that    they had died. The

last    I remember           seeing of the two           brothers         was as they boarded the

coach that             day at Leicester.          I did not see them again,                or   c onsciously

notice       them,       after    that    occasion,     a lt ho u g h we had noticed some Heart

of E n g l an d supporters            in the     pen    (three)    shor tl y after we had taken up

our    seats,          these were not amongst           them.

In my o pinion the tragedy was                    caused by a number             of factors.       Firstly,

the    pen s ystem did not a llow                people to move sideways,                thus   relieving

any bu il d- up of pressure.                  There     should have       been gates at         the sides

large     e nough to a llow easy access                  from the       pen,   as there     should have

been onto          the    pitch.      The    gate from     pen three onto          the    pitch was

d e fi n it e ly       inadequate     secondly,        I thought    there were not enough Police

O ff ic er s      in the ground to organise a rescue op er at io n for the dead or

injured.           The    supporters a pp ea re d to be the ones who were a s s i st in g                     or

helping        in the main.

            Thirdly,         it seemed a very long time        before   the first a mb ulance      came

             onto    the     pitch.     There was a distinct      lack of medical    a s si st an ce

             for    the     people    laid out    behind the west S t an d that   I described.

            Added     problems are        that    the turnstiles are    not an efficient means          of

             enabling        people   to enter a ground.       They are   usually   cramped and

             d i fficult      to enter    if you are more     than aver ag e   height and   build,      and

            this applies         to all    grounds.

                                                                                                 S I GN E D

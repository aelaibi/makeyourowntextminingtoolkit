                    moved       around           the       re/ar of      the     stand,          out     of       view       of    the       pitch       and

                    towards           pen 2.           I entered           pen 2 a n d           saw     the       game          had    stopped.

                 I saw a mass             of     people       packed          into      pen 3.         There    was    no    forward

                 movement         at     t his    time,       but       it wa s      obviously           many   people       had     been

                 forced      forward and               there       was    no    backwards             movement.

                 It b e c a m e      obvious          that    the       c r o w d was      having        problems      and       eventually

                        THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                                    15 APRIL 1989

                                       INTERIM REPORT OF INQUIRY


                                                INT R O D U C T IO N

   1. On 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round o f the FA Cup competition was to be
played between the Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium, Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. Only six minutes.into the game, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result,
95 died and over 400 received hospital treatment.

  2. On 17 April 1 9 8 9 1 was appointed by you to carry out an Inquiry with the following terms o f reference:

     To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
     recommendations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.

   3. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: Mr Brian Johnson QPM, Chief Constable o f Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard Maunder OBE, BSc, PhD, ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor o f Mechanical
Engineering at the University o f Newcastle upon Tyne. Their help has been invaluable and I am very grateful
for their expert advice and wise counsels. While the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am comforted
in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

  4. Mr Robert Whalley was appointed Secretary to the Inquiry. H e and his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give me all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, Mr Ernest Pott.

   5. The policing arrangements for 15 April were in the hands o f the South Yorkshire Constabulary. The
efficacy o f those arrangements and their implementation was from an early stage called into question. It was
therefore decided that the investigation o f the disaster and the gathering o f evidence for this Inquiry should be
conducted by an independent police force. Mr Geoffrey Dear QPM , Chief Constable o f West Midlands
Constabulary, undertook this task. He was made responsible directly to me; he appointed Assistant Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones to take full-time charge o f the investigation. I am deeply indebted to both o f them.

  6. On 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium. I inspected the scene o f the disaster on the terraces and all
relevant parts o f the stadium and its approaches. My Assessors and I have made further visits during the
Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 and 29 April.

    7. The Lord Mayor and the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to make the accommodation and facilities
o f Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. This offer was gratefully accepted and I would
like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
in Sheffield.

   8. On 28 April 1 9 8 9 ,1 held a preliminary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence would begin,
to give some directions as to the procedure I intended to follow and to hear applications from those wishing to
be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
      (i)    Those bereaved or injured as a result o f the disaster.
      (ii)   The Football Supporters’ Association.
      (iii) The Football Association.
      (iv)   Sheffield City Council.
      (v)    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the Club’s casual staff and
             their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
      (vi)   South Yorkshire Constabulary.
      (vii) South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.
Subsequently, during the hearing. I further accorded representation to:
     (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
            (SYMAS).
and (ix)   Dr W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

  9. Since the circumstances o f the disaster raised urgent questions o f safety, especially at football grounds,
you indicated at the outset that you would welcome any recommendations, even o f an interim nature, which I
might be able to give in advance o f the new football season due to commence in mid-August 19 8 9 .1 therefore
announced at the preliminary hearing on 28 April that I would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as the first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facts and causes o f the disaster and enable me to
make any immediate interim recommendations necessary in the short term.

   10. The West Midlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “Freephone” number was advertised to
enable members o f the public, especially those who had attended the match, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this number was available for three days on 28 different lines. The response from the public
was such that the lines were continued for a further three days by the end o f which 2,666 calls had been
received. There were also many written offers o f help. Some 440 West Midlands officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in Birmingham, Liverpool and
Sheffield and computer technology was used to the full. In all some 3776 statements were taken. There were
also some 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry and to me personally all o f which I read. The police,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the BBC had video cameras filming at the ground on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours o f film covering the period before, during and after the disaster. Thus
the material gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enormous. From this
mass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts and
causes o f the disaster.

   11. Where it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism might be made o f the conduct o f any person or
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
setting out the likely grounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Commission
on Tribunals o f Inquiry (the Salmon Commission).

  12. The hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel’s submissions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
on 14 July I heard their brief oral submissions supplementing the written argument.

  13. Witnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departmental inquiry, there was no power to administer the
oath but there was no instance o f any witness giving evidence w'hich I considered might have been different
had he or she been sworn.

  14. The witnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from whom statements were or could have been
taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in number and reliability to enable me to reach the
necessary conclusions. To have called more would have prevented me from presenting an interim report in the
required time and would not have added significantly to the relevant evidence. I have, however, been able to
take into account many written statements in addition to oral testimony.

   15. Apart from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn from statements taken by
the West Midlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
opportunity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final submission was made by
Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police that since the investigation by West Midlands Police is still continuing,
all the evidence has not been assembled and it would be unsafe for me to make findings o f fact. I should
therefore make clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to HM
Coroner for the City o f Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at death and the care and
movement o f each o f the 95 victims individually. I am assured by Chief Constable Dear and Assistant C hief
Constable Mervyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to
the history o f events which emerged at the hearing.

  16. I should like to thank all those who made it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account o f what
happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. I pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands
Police for their speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those responsible for processing it.


                                                        ~>
The most eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness o f the police investigation came from the Secretary
o f the Football Supporters’ Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whether that
investigation would be fair and objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness statem ent
themselves. Having heard the opening statement by Counsel to the Inquiry' based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before and during the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a wide range o f technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services Division) where tests were conducted and reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. This was done
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am most grateful to the Director, Dr A Jones, and to the
Deputy Director, Dr C E Nicholson, for their invaluable help.

  18. I wish to commend Counsel to the inquiry, Mr Andrew Collins QC, Mr Alan Goldsack and Mr
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence; also,
Counsel for all those represented who tested that evidence fully but expeditiously. This Interim Report could
not possibly have been prepared in so short a time had I not had the whole-hearted co-operation o f all those
mentioned and many others.

   19. The second phase o f the Inquiry will be directed to making final and long term recommendations about
crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth information, opinions and arguments
from a wide range o f sources and contributors both here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
second phase could not be carried to completion before the next football season. However, at an early stage o f
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it and specifically from many sporting,
local authority, emergency service and police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that submissions
should be in writing and should be made promptly so that the second phase o f the Inquiry could
follow immediately after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body o f written evidence which has
been submitted. I shall want in some instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction with
my Assessors. We will also need to make a number o f visits and inspections.

  20. I now present my Interim Report and Recommendations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
Recommendations as soon as reasonably possible.




 1 August 1989                                                                                 PETER TAYLOR

                                                   CHAPTER 1

                          TH E G R O UN D A N D PRE-MATCH ARRANGEM ENTS

Fixing The Venue
   21. On 20 March 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between the same two teams had been held there in April 1988. The arrangements had been
successful in the view both o f the police and o f the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to accommodate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arrangements were the same as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangements did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirement was
accepted and the match was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground
  22. The Hillsborough Stadium is some 2'h miles to the north-west o f central Sheffield in the district o f
Owlerton. The ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch lies
roughly east to west. A plan o f the ground and its immediate environs is at Appendix 1.

  23. The west end, with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the south is the river Don and to the north a residential street,
Vere Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
entrances, and to the administrative block under the stand. The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Penistone Road and Leppings Lane, but there are gates which can shut it o ff at each end. There
is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and employees o f the Club. The south
stand dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8,800. 5,500 o f those are
roofed over and 3,300 are uncovered.

  25. The north stand is also all seating and accommodates about 9,700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
hall. There are also a first aid room and police room close by.

  26. The east end is all terracing and is known as the Spion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
now accommodates som e 21,000 standing spectators. There are crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

   27. At the west or Leppings Lane end o f the ground there is terracing close to the pitch. Behind it is the west
stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 for World Cup matches, some o f which were held
at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accommodates 4,456 seated spectators. The terracing in front o f it
extends higher in the corners between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10,100. At both the Kop
end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perimeter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
mounted upon the low wall at the foot o f the terracing. At the top o f the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to climb over towards the pitch. There are gates at
intervals along the perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than a
metre wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
They are marked and numbered on the plan Appendix 1.

  28. Unlike the Kop end, the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
fences at right angles to it, dividing the area into pens. This division was begun after an FA Cup semi-final in
1981 when crushing occurred due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
arrangement being shown on the plan Appendix 1. The first section o f the west terracing moving south to north
contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only one pen. Next is pen 3
with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
divide pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate home and away fans on occasions when both might be
accommodated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west corner. Pens 5, 6
and 7 each have a perimeter gate. At the back o f the pens, under the front o f the west stand, there is a gate in


                                                         4
each radial fence. When those gates are open, the back row o f the terracing is in tended to permit access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible. The present layout o fth e p e n s . fences, crush barriers a n d gates has resulted from a
series o f piecemeal changes. The nature a n d effect o f those changes must be considered later.

The Turnstiles
   29. Because o f the housing in Vere Road there is no access from the north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road North there are some 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end o f the north stand. They are marked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. The 12 numbered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters o f the
two teams as appears later. Two o f them, 77 and 78, were however used for access to the Kop.

  30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (numbered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summary, the south and east sides o f the ground accommodated some 29,8 00 w hose access on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. The other two sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 24,256 were fed solely from the
Leppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
  33. Most supporters were expected to com e by road although rail transport was available. Nottingham
supporters travelling by train would arrive at the main line Sheffield Midland Station whence they would be
directed and escorted northwards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
Nottingham supporters travelling by coach, mini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would predominantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

   34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive at Sheffield Midland Station just
like their Nottingham counterpans. The police aimed to segregate the rival fans and put them into separate
coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadsley Bridge, a British Rail station
catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north o f the ground. A police escort was available to
conduct them on foot to the Leppings Lane entrance. Those coming from Liverpool by road would approach
Sheffield either via the M62 and down the MI from the north or across the Pennines from the north west. All
such routes would bring them to the ground via one or other limb o f Leppings Lane as shown on Appendix 1.
Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west; arrivals from Nottingham
would be from the south and east.

Allocation of Places and Tickets
   35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
o f rival teams. The need for this policy to be maintained was endorsed and em phasised by the Popplewell
Report following the Bradford City disaster in 198 5. Accordingly, before the 198 8 semi-final the police decided
that sections o f the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determined by the direction
whence each predominantly approached. Thus, Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides o f the ground
for which access was from Leppings Lane. Nottingham Forest were allotted the south and east sides with access
from Penistone Road.

   36. The effect o f the decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie, Liverpool were allotted only 24,256 places
as against 29,800 for Nottingham Forest. This, although average attendance o f supporters at home matches
was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and seats at
£12, Nottingham Forest had 21,000 standing places compared with Liverpool's 10,100. So, Liverpool's
allocation was more expensive as well as smaller. Understandably, Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
o f places and tickets. They sought with som e support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
1988, but the police were adamant. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
crossing each other's paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attempts at segregation and
creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989, when the same plan was proposed, Liverpool again challenged it. The
police, however, maintained their view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 would be familiar with the
arrangements and that any change would lead to confusion.
Access from Leppings Lane
   37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forecourt at
a bend in Leppings Lane where, coming from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west o f the ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs o f Leppings Lane and would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f double gates. Inside
those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs Appendix 2. the
latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers 1 to
 10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with north stand seats. Their
tickets were marked “Entrance A” and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. Thus 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.
They were the next block to the right o f those marked A. However, instead of these turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being marked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were marked C. Their colour-code on
tickets and boards was red.

   39. On the other side o f the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
 10.100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards
on the south side o f the ground. When the number at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
arrangements o f 1 to 1-6, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. “Entrance B“ also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. Thus, the three blocks o f turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
left to right A, C, B. The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A to G was mauve.
To the right o f turnstile G is a tubulai steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
south stand.

Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
  40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
on Appendix 1) between turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

  41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G. It had been built to segregate home and away fans at a
time when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
remained. There was. however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the two areas. An exit
gate (marked B on Appendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

  42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
mentioned and on the right by the wall o f the private roadway coming from the south stand to Leppings Lane.
There was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on Appendix 1) just inside turnstile G.

  43. All three exit gates, A, B and C, were o f concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
and were not intended for entry o f spectators into the ground.

   44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
moving to the right go round the south end o f the west stand and gain entry into pens 1 and 2. They could go
through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the north
end o f the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either o f
those courses. The obvious way in was straight ahead o f the turnstiles where a tunnel under the middle o f the
west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word “Standing” and a large
letter “B”. Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

   45. The length o f the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels ofi'but finally descends
tow ards the terraces at a gradient of 1 in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
fence between pen 3 on the right and' pen 4 on the left. A short spur o f brick wall projects forward from each side
o f the tunnel at its mouth. Those emerging are thus guided straight forward rather than to either side. The
photograph at Appendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

  46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration o f the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
them w as effected by a series o f piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary to analyse their resultant effect.
Policing Arrangements
   47. At the 1988 semi-final, policing had been under the control o f Chief Superintendent Mole, then
Commander of F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. He was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over command o f F Division on 27 March to
Superintendent Duckenfield on the latter’s promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March Mr Mole bowed out and Mr Duckenfield took over. Under him were
Sector Commanders, all Superintendents with much experience o f policing football matches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular, Superintendent Marshall was in charge o f the area outside the Leppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in command inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. Under Mr Duckenfield's overall command were some 801 officers and men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx o f supporters into the city centre.
In all, therefore, some 1,122 police were deployed for this match amounting to about 38 per cent o f the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the mounted section o f 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
assist respectively in marshalling their h om e supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually o f eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All o f this
was provided for in an Operational Order which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force’s “Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football Grounds”. The Order
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day o f
the match.

Sheffield Wednesday's Arrangements
  48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the morning o f the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
communicate by VHF radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total o f
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). When the total for any section was within 15 percent o f its permitted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10,100. W'hat the system could not do was monitor the distribution o f fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
   49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west corner o f the
ground between the south stand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
o f steps. It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line o f the west perimeter
fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control o f it
and was advisor to Mr Duckenfield as he had been to Mr M ole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
Goddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
and public address systems. At the back o f the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control o f the
police closed circuit television system operated by a row o f consoles on a bench in front o f him and behind the
three seated officers.

   50. There were five television screens showing views o f five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
rotation from one camera view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
facility to close in on any point o f interest. Specifically, there were good camera views o f the west terracing, o f
the Leppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

  51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box, to relay
music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
speakers or if appropriate to one area only.
   53. Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a W1 FU portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator's bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
Community Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
Communication was on “talk through” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
and if more than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
an attempt to overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt o f signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: VHF to police Headquarters at Snig Hill, channel 35 to FI
Sub-divisional Headquarters at Hammerton Road and channel 19 used by CID. There was also a set tuned to
Sheffield Wednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                                  15th APRIL: THE BUILD-UP TO 2.30pm

Early Arrivals
  5 4 / 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match w'as a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
w'ere expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain access otherwise.
The follow'ing account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small numbers. Some brought cans o f beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked; others took
advantage o f the weather and sat about on walls and open spaces. When the public houses opened, many
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs comprise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. Many were asking for tickets or “spares”. There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, some o f the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
wore on, numbers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was one o f carnival, good humour and expectation.

Public Houses
  55. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great amount o f alcoholic drink was
bought there.

  56. Opening time at public houses was in general 11 am. Some remained closed all day. O f the others, some
72, mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over a
hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters drank enough to affect their mood. At first excitement: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd
   57. Towards the end o f the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
as early as 11.30 am. Som e 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, many returned more than once. Those who had tickets were guided in the right direction. The
police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
each turnstile w'ith the duty o f searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one o f a serial o f officers positioned just inside.

   58. At about 12 noon C hief Inspector Creaser asked Superintendent Murray whether the pens on the west
terrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

  59. By 2 pm it w-as apparent to those inside the ground and those monitoring events in the police and Club
control rooms that the number o f Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnumbered those from Liverpool.
The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and w’est stands w'ere half empty. It was
noted about that time that the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1 ,2 ,6 and 7 were
nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward and make room for
others.

   60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This time, there was only one. It arrived
 early, just before 2 pm, at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by both mounted and foot
 police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Leppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
 the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

   61. By this time the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority o f
 Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
 increasing rapidly. Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
 longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. The foot officers
 outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.
Mounted officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
The police were beset by fans bemused by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had
been drinking but up to and just after 2.30 pm the mood remained good.

  62.      Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He became anxious about the numbers
coming down Leppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At . 1
pm he radioed to control to have motor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
2.30 pm. U p to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
was still no panic in the crowd; no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control room Mr Murray, who c°ujd
see Leppings Lane on the video, advised Mr Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. Mr
Duckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there was some
major external factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
late even in large numbers.




                                                        10
                                                 CHAPTER 3

                                    THE CRISIS AT T H E TU R N STILES

    63. In the 20 minutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developments both inside and outside
the ground. In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to the
favoured area behind the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The numbers at that time were clearly in excess
o f the maximum density stated by the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edn) (the Green
Guide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the Green Guide has no statutory or legal force, it is the
only official 3dvice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1, 2, 6 and 7, there w’as still
ample room and bare patches o f concrete were visible.

   64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles became more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and their rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
again through gate C where they did what they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The mounted
officers were surrounded by the dense mass o f people and became ineffective. Superintendent Marshall was in
the midst o f the turmoil. He extricated himself and stood on a parapet o f the bridge to get a clear view. A
drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer. But these were isolated acts by
individuals; the menace came from the massive numbers single-mindedly determined to be in for the kick-off
with time running out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack o f progress as 3 o ’clock
approached. Some, mostly young men who had been drinking, tried to push and force their way forward. At
the front, people w-ere jammed together and against the turnstile walls. Some panicked as the pressure
intensified. Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress. They were helped out through the
tubular barrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans climbed up and over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
most o f them had tickets.

    65. At 2.44 pm Mr Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing and for a veh icle with loudspeaker equipment to com e and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
pm, radio communication on channel 25 became defective. For a period o f two or three minutes the control
room lost contact. A communications officer came promptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
o f a handset at control, contact was restored. Despite this hiatus, two o f Mr Marshall’s requests were received.
The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including mounted officers from Penistone Road,
w'ere sent. The third request, for a Landrover, w'as received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
mounted officers besieged near the turnstiles came outside the perimeter gates. An attempt w'as made to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. Mounted officers, now reinforced to
greater numbers, formed a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for some minutes despite
desperate individuals forcing their way under or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
more dramatic relief o f the pressure.

“Open the Gates”
   66. Between 2.40 pm and 2.45 pm the crow'd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
over 5,000. At the head o f the phalanx conditions had become intolerable. Those who got through were short
o f breath and sweating profusely. Many complained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
and asked them in forceful terms to do something. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
could not passthrough the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
asking that kick-off be postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

  67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so, since it
was contrary to basic police strategy, he decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm, whilst Mr Duckenfield was considering the
request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
advantage and about 150 managed to get in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. Mr
Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. He repeated it a third time, adding that if the
gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room, Mr Duckenfield had not made a
decision. Mr Murray asked him “Are you going to open the gates?". Mr Duckenfield gave the order and Sgt
Goddard radioed to Mr Marshall “Open the gates”. Neither the Club control room nor any police officers
inside the turnstiles were told o f this order before or after it was given or o f any action it would require.

  68. At 2.52 pm, gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concourse beyond
came round to flow through it in large numbers.

   69. About two minutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gateman’s
objection, for it to be opened. If it was not, he said, “It’ll go and someone will get killed”. Permission was given,
but this time reserve serials were alerted to monitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
opened against the gateman’s wishes and about 200 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
left.

  70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five minutes it was open about 2,000 fans passed
through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. N o doubt some had no tickets at all.
The majority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, some found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnei in front o f them.

                                               THE DISASTER

   71. The initial influx through gate C, augmented by entrants via the turnstiles, came through the tunnel
with great momentum. Fans spoke o f being swept through, feet off the ground. The 1 in 6 gradient accelerated
their progress. Upon reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to do so. The new
arrivals found themselves pushed forward and the pressure became intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the teams came onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
acutely uncomfortable and some were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were shouts for help and for the gates to be
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perimeter track did not immediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation came at different moments
to different officers in different places.

   72. Gate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from w'ithin. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. Gate
4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
to the w'ing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it.

  73. Just before 3 pm, the match kicked off. At the same time, gate C, which had been closed at 2.57 pm,
was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out o f pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
tried to get over the front perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point o f collapse and in some instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, most were so preoccupied with the pain o f being
pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing o f the game. But at the rear there
w^ere many who, although cramped, were watching the football unaware o f the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm, Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There w'as a roar from the
Liverpool fans and at the same time a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force became such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front o f pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But I am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen” When the barrier broke those whom it had
supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Many fell and the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed them dow'n. The crushing force was transmitted and dispersed so that all along the front o f pen 3 fans
were pressed hard up against the low w>all and the wire mesh o f the fence above it.

  76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.

   77. Surges on terraces are common. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight o f
numbers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or prone,
life was ebbing away. If no relief came in four minutes there would be irreversible brain damage; i f longer,
death.

   78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
fans spilt out onto the perimeter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that there
was an attempted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gymnasium and all available
officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was made to HQ for dog handlers.

   79. Superintendent Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As he approached, he did not think the pens
overcrowded until he was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
situation “retrievable” if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was impossible.
Those fans who would have wished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many
unaware o f the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
o f the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

  80.     When Mr Greenwood's signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control
box. Mr Duckenfield sent Mr Murray down from the box to have the match stopped via the linesman, the
agreed emergency drill. Before he could do so, Mr Greenwood ran over the pitch to the referee who stopped the
game. It was 5/2 minutes past 3.

                                               TH E AFTERMATH

Rescue Attempts
   81. From 3 o’clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first, fans had walked or staggered out
winded and faint. But the final surge at 3.04 pm, and the struggle to reach the open gates, caused a horrendous
blockage o f bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate became interwoven in the sump at the front o f the
pens, especially by the gates. Those with strength left clambered over others submerged in the human heap and
tried to climb out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them up and over.
Numbers o f fans were climbing over the radial fences into adjaccnt pens. At the back, many were hauled up
into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

   82. The steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A number o f individual
officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only two or three
could get at the entwined bodies Willing hands got in one anolher’s wav. More officers arrived from ihe
gymnasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid out on the pitch, to
assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. But some stood in groups near the
perimeter fence not knowing what to do. They had been summoned in response to what was thought to be a
threat to public order. What they found was a horrific scene o f carnage and some young officers were shocked
into impotence by what they saw.

   83. It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent; their mouths open, vomiting; their
eyes staring. A pile o f dead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further and further on to the pitch, the
injured were laid down and attempts made to revive them. More and more walking survivors flooded out on to
the pitch as the players left. The scene w’as emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enormity o f the
disaster was realised, many o f the fans milling about were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for
what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small number o f
hysterical fans had to be subdued.

  84. Adding to the chaos, a number o f press photographers dodged about among rescue workers apparently
avid to secure photographs at point blank range o f those dying through the wire mesh and those laid on the
pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police had to intervene.

   85. At about 3.12 pm, Chief Superintendent Nesbit, Commander o f the Traffic Division, arrived on the
pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain o f officers to simplify and expedite the extraction o f
casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any mcchanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach ihe fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

   86. By now, some officers o f their own initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they met
other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
to go back through the tunnel. Some complied, but many resisted, wishing to stand their ground. Casualties
were brought out through the tunnel, and as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
the tunnel and attempts were made to revive ihem.

First Aid
  87. The St John Ambulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted round the ground for the match - 25
adults and 5 junior cadets, They were quickly on the scene when the first casualties emerged and sought to
revive them. Their Divisional Superintendent, Mr Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

  88. Dr Purcell, Sheffield Wednesday's doctor, came from his seat in the south stand and attempted
resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, he moved from patient to patient doing what he could,
but in most cases it was too late.

  89. At 3.13 pm a St John’s ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east corner and drove to the
perimeter fence close to gate 3. There was no call for doctors and nurses on ihe public address system until
nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the minutes ticked past, some o f them came onio ihe pitch to help o f their
own accord when they saw the casualties and the ambulance and realised the gravity o f the situation. Many
fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in some cases their own relatives
and friends. Artificial respi ration, mouth to mouth respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skilled
and the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable o f survival mostly came round o f their own accord. The
rest were mostly doomed before they could be brought out and treated.

    90. There was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in the
first aid room and three in the St John’s ambulance. They were quickly brought into use. Then the fans
improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge o f the pitch and against the stands so that lengths o f
board could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way, parties o f fans and police ran repeatedly the length
o f the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A number were dead on arrival there.

In the Control Room
  91. Mr Duckenfield stayed in the control room. Chief Inspector McRobbie was there in civilian clothes as
an observer. Mr Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to admit those
displaced from the centre pens. Mr Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw someone laid
on the pitch. Even then, he did not realise the nature o f the problem or its scale.

   92. Mr Murray returned from his attempt to stop the match and Mr Duckenfield sent him down again to
clear the pitch and assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to clear the pitch. This was
tacause Mr Duckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the milling and
iQPeasing numbers.

   93. The Assistant C hief Constable (Operations), Mr Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as
a guest o f the Club. He came from his seat in the south stand to ask what had happened. Mr Duckenfield was
unable to say; he did not tell Mr Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. Mr Jackson went
down to the pitch to discover the situation.

   94. At 3.06 pm Mr Duckenfield, still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to Headquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for all available additional police resources to
com e to the ground to strengthen the police presence.

   95. Mr Jackson was told by Mr Greenwood that there were casualties and returned immediately to control
to make sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile, Mr Murray had seen the plight o f those behind the
fence. He radioed to control that a fleet o f ambulances was required. He also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to
those in the pens to move back but there is no clear evidence that it was made.

  96. Only when Mr Duckenfield received the request for a fleet o f ambulances did he realise the nature and
gravity o f the situation. Then, supported by Mr Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting Operation
Support into calls for the Major Disaster Plan.

N o Information
        Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm, no
information or advice was broadcast on the public address system. Mr Duckenfield feared that the crowd
might turn hostile or might all attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
given information about what had happened. The result was that apart from those close enough at the west end
to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
Nottingham supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by
Liverpool fans. They continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated some Liverpool fans who
were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence might result on
top o f the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number o f officers to form a line across the
width o f the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
moved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. Other officers were posted to
the perimeter track facing the north stand for the same purpose. To those distressed and distraught who
wanted urgent action, this large contingent o f passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
intensified.

Misinformation
 98.    At about 3.15 pm, Mr Graham Kelly, Chief Executive o f the FA, Mr Kirton also o f the FA and Mr
Graham Mackrell, Secretary' o f Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for information. Mr
Duckenfield told them he thought there were fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a


                                                        16
gate had been forced and there had been an inrush o f Liverpool supporters. H e poinled lo one o f ihe television
screens focussed on gate C by the Leppings Lane turnstiles and said “That's the gate that's been forccd: there’s
been an inrush”. Inevitably Mr Kelly was interviewed a little later live on television. He spoke o f the two stories
concerning the gate - the fans' account that the police had opened it, the police assertion that the fans had
forced their way in.

  99. About 3.30 pm there was a further meeting in the Club’s boardroom. Mr Duckenfield went there and
met Mr Kelly, the referee and representatives o f the three clubs. ACC Jackson was also there. Mr
Duckenfield indicated the match was likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling was given. He added that
he did not want people to know it was to be abandoned lest the dispersing crowd hamper the emergency
operations.

Public Announcements
   100. Later the managers o f the two teams were asked to go to the control room. They were invited there to
make a public announcement to calm the crowd. Mr Kenny Dalglish agreed to do so. He told the crowd that
there were problems and asked them to assist the police and those rendering first aid. He asked for calm and his
message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4.10 pm it was announced that the match was abandoned
for that day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most o f whom behaved responsibly as they
dispersed.

Fire Brigade
   10 1. Meanwhile the emergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request came from the
perimeter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant Goddard contacted the police garage
close by without success. At 3.13 pm, PC Bichard requested Headquarters to call the fire service to bring
hydraulic cutting equipment to the Leppings Lane entrance.

   102. There was no arrangement for a fire officer to be present during the match. However, the Major
Disaster Plan required all emergency services to be alerted. After 'phone messages which must be described
later, fire appliances arrived at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at 3.22 pm. At both entrances their
arrival surprised police who were uninformed as to why they had been called or where they should go.

  103. At Leppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain “I don't really think we need you”.
Another police officer then asked for more resuscitators as people were dying so Mr Swain radioed for ten fire
appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation equipment.

   104. At the Kop end, Leading Fireman Housley arrived with an emergency tender and Station Officer
Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. The emergency tender came along the roadway by the south
stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out and went to the Leppings
Lane entrance losing some eight minutes. From there, Mr Housley and his crew went onto the pitch with
resuscitation equipment. They rendered help there and later at the gymnasium. Mr Fletcher and his men ran
along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipment and oxygen cylinders. When they arrived at the
fence, the cutting equipment was not required as by then the last o f the dead and injured were being removed
from the pens. Mr Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firemen assisted in carrying
victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (SYMAS)
   105. Before 1986 there had been no SYMAS representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. The
Club was content, as indeed are many other clubs, to rely upon the St John’s Ambulance Brigade and&999 call
if necessary. From 1986 onwards, after representations, the Club provided two seats in the south stand for
SYMAS staff at League matches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placed in the north stand
close to the gymnasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event o f a major incident. The
south stand seats were allotted as they placed the SYMAS staff closer to the players’ tunnel should a player be
injured. These seats were, however, not available at Cup semi-finals. SYMAS representatives nevertheless
attended at the semi-finals by arrangement with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. The SYMAS officers
stood on the ramp leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They had one ambulance outside the ground
and one on standby.

   106. On 15 April 1989, Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an ambulance and crew. They
noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. They began
to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm, there had been a call from Police Constable Waugh at police
Headquarters to the Hillsborough police control asking if ambulances were required. This was on the
instruction o f Chief Inspector Edmundson who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise and snatches of speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports of injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground that there might be injuries, police Headquarters notified SYMAS that ambulances might be required.
Then, seconds later, Mr Murray's request for a fleet o f ambulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. Ambulances began to arrive at the Leppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistone Road
entrance at 3.17 pm. In all, some 42 ambulances attended, 31 o f them from SYMAS and 11 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed some 172 casualties to the Northern General
Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Gymnasium
   107. The gymnasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. When the Major Disaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. One end became a temporary mortuary; the other was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in more and more
casualties, the scene was initially and inevitably chaotic and harrowing. There was intense distress amongst
the injured and bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to revive them. There
were people looking for missing friends and relations; there were recriminations, there were scuffles. Some o f
those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors and nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. Those in most urgent need o f
hospital treatment were taken to ambulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determine priorities.
Doctors were requested by the police to examine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify
death. A police Constable was detailed to attend and guard each o f the dead and a photograph o f each was
taken by a police photographer so that relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal o f
searching amongst all who had died.

The Dead and the Injured
  108. O f the 95 who died, the evidence suggests that at least 16 and probably 21 came through gate C after it
opened at 2.52 pm. That is established by the statements o f relatives and friends who came through with them
but survived.

   109. By commendable hard work, a team o f pathologists headed by Professor Usher completed
post-mortem examinations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found that 88 o f the victims were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years o f age, 39 were between 20 and 29 years and only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause o f death was crush asphyxia due to compression o f the chest wall
against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta; in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chest; in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. Thirteen o f those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured femur, one a fractured
radius and the remaining three involved fractures o f bones or cartilages round the voice box. These injuries
suggest the victims may have been trodden while on the ground.

  110. Blood samples were taken from the dead. N o alcohol was found in any o f the females. O f the males, 51
had no more than 10 milligrams percent in their blood which is negligible; 15 had over 80 milligrams per cent
and six over 120 milligrams percent.

  111. Although the great majority o f those who died were in pen 3, at least five were in pen 4. Most deaths
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

  112. In all, some 730 people complained o f being injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. O f the 730,
about 30% are thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. The largest category o f injury was
bruising, especially to the ribs and chest.

                                           SPECIFIC INCIDENTS

   113. 1 have given my findings as to the basic factual background and the main sequence o f events in
narrative form. There was very little conflict as to the principal events save as to som e timings and numbers.
Indeed, the consistency o f the evidence has been a remarkable feature o f this Inquiry. The experiences o f most
witnesses were unforgettable and no doubt the early hearing helped to preserve accurate memory. Also, the
existence o f timed videos and photographs and o f logged and taped messages provided reliable checks by
which to prompt and test witness recollection. Accordingly, I have not forthe most part burdened the narrative
with citations from the evidence o f individual witnesses.

   114. However, there were several instances o f detailed evidence and assertions being highlighted by the
media in dramatic and emotive terms during the hearing. Since some o f those much-publicised incidents gave
rise to unfair criticism, they ought to be the subject o f specific findings. I have therefore dealt with them
individually at Appendix 6.

   115. This disaster was the worst in the history o f British football. It happened because pens 3 and 4 became
grossly overcrowded. They were uncomfortably overcrowded by 2.50 pm at least to a degree which required
that they should be closed to further arrivals.JEvenJhgjTumbers^oming through the turnstiles in the last 10

                              THE LAYOUT AT THE L EPPIN G S LANE E N D

  1 1 8 . 1 have already observed that the layout o f the turnstile area, o f the terraces and o f the concourse
between them was the result o f piecemeal changes. A brief history o f these changes is now necessary.

The History
   119. Before 1965, the Leppings Lane end consisted entirely o f terracing like the Kop. In that year, the west
stand was built and the terraces remaining in front o f it were truncated to their present depth, front to back. As
to width, they consisted o f a single standing area with no dividing fences. During the early 1970’s, hooliganism
and pitch invasions made it necessary to prevent access to the playing area and the perimeter fences were
therefore erected in 1977.


   120. Section 1 o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 empowered the Secretary o f State to designate a
sports stadium having, in his opinion, accommodation for more than 10,000 as a stadium requiring a
certificate from the local authority. Hillsborough was so designated with effect from 1 January 1979 by SI
1978/1091. In anticipation o f that date, Sheffield Wednesday instructed Eastwood and Partners, a firm o f
consulting engineers, to act on their behalf especially in their dealings with the local authority. Dr Eastwood,
the principal o f the firm, is a highly experienced civil and structural engineer and has advised several major
football clubs. He recommended that a number o f additional crush barriers should be added since those
already in place were insufficient to comply with the Green Guide (1976 edition). That work was approved
and carried out during 1979.


  121. The relevant local authority at the time was the South Yorkshire County Council. It set up an Officer
Working Party consisting o f representatives o f the police, the fire service, its own building surveyor’s division
and its own legal and administration department. The Working Party made inspections and consulted with the
Club and Dr Eastwood. A Safety Certificate was issued on 21 December 1979 for an indefinite period. It has
remained in force ever since and has not been amended.


   122. Schedule 3 o f the certificate sets out the maximum crowd capacity for various areas in the ground. The
figure for the west terrace is 7,200 and for the north-west terrace 2,900. These figures were intended to be in
accordance with the Green Guide (1976). Paragraph 15.4 provided for a maximum “packing density” o f
between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres depending on the condition o f the terrace. Dr Eastwood had
calculated 8,000 for the west terrace on the basis o f 54 per 10 square metres. He thought this a justified starting
figure in view o f his improved system o f barriers. However, he reduced it to 7,200 because there were no
gangways on the terrace and he did not think it feasible to provide any. So, the total figure for the Leppings Lane
terraces was and is 10,100.


The 1981 Semi-Final
  123. As already mentioned, there was crushing at the Cup semi-final in 1981. The match was between
Tottenham Hotspur and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The police debriefing minutes after the incident
prophetically refer,


  “to the late arrival o f a large number o f spectators who were still waiting to enter the Leppings Lane
  enclosure when the match started. The flash point occurred when Tottenham scored” (at the Kop end) “after
  only three minutes. The spectators just entering pushed forward to see what was happening and caused a
  crush, which resulted in the injuries”.


   124. Those being crushed called for the perimeter gates to be opened onto the track. There was no
immediate reaction, according to Mr Vaux who was there, but fortunately a police Inspector gave instructions
and the gates were then opened. About 250 came out onto the track. There were broken arms, legs and ribs and
38 were treated either in hospital or by the St John Ambulance Brigade. It is clear from the documents (a) that
the turnstile readings showed the capacity figure o f 10.100 had been exceeded by over 400 (b) that the police
shut o ff further access to the terraces because o f crushing, and (c) the police view after the event was that the
capacity figure o f 10.100 in the Safety Certificate was too high. This latter view was communicated to the Club
by the Chief Superintendent then in command o f F Division but it was not pursued.
T hree Pens
   125. After this incident in April 1981 the police requested that the terrace should be divided into sections.
The object was to improve crowd control by reducing sideways movement. Division would enable more even
distribution to be effected when there was a capacity crowd. It would also enable the west end to be used for
both home and away supporters who could be segregated in separate pens, if necessary with an empty pen
between them.

   126. This proposal was agreed by the Club and the Officer Working Party and was approved by the local
authority. Two radial fences were accordingly fitted in November 1981. They are the fence now separating pens
2 and 3 and that now separating 5 and 6. The result was to divide the whole terrace into three pens. Access from
the concourse to the middle pen was through the tunnel and to the wing pens round the sides o f the west stand.
Dr Eastwood suggested and illustrated an altered layout which would have provided separate access through
separate banks o f turnstiles to the north stand, to each end o f the west stand, and to each o f the three pens.
Whilst the main object o f this was segregation, such a layout would have enabled each o f those areas to be
monitored numerically via the turnstiles so as to ensure its maximum capacity was not exceeded. The plan was
not adopted. The maximum capacity for the new centre pen was calculated at 2,200, but no alteration was
made to the Safety Certificate so to limit it nor was there any means mechanically o f counting the numbers
going into that pen.

The 1985 Changes
   127. By 1985, Sheffield Wednesday had been promoted to the First Division and was drawing larger
crowds. The improvement o f the Leppings Lane end was raised again by the Club and Dr Eastwood prepared a
number o f drawings. These illustrated various schemes for achieving segregation by providing more turnstiles
in separate banks and divisions o f the concourse. The police wanted further divisions o f the terrace itself,
again to improve control and segregation. There was much discussion o f these schemes which included
suggestions o f 29 and even 34 turnstiles in total. In the result, the following alterations were carried out in
1985.

New Radial Fences
  128. On the terraces, two more radial fences were fitted. One divided the existing central pen into the
present pens 3 and 4. Gates were fitted at the mouth o f the tunnel to enable each o f those pens to be closed off.
The second fence was placed in the new pen 4 so as to create the narrow pen 5 intended to be a sterile area. Until
those two fences were added there existed only perimeter gates 1 ,2 ,4 ,5 and 6. The creation o f pen 3 required a
new gate 3 to be fitted which was done.

Barriers
   129. The lines o f the new radial fences ran across existing crush barriers so that without modification those
barriers would have run through the fencing. The police considered the barriers would be used by fans as
convenient mounting points to scale the new fences, thereby defeating their object. They therefore wished
spans to be removed from the barriers. Had their wishes been met in full the result would have been an
unimpeded run in pen 3 from the mouth o f the tunnel down the south side o f the new fence to the perimeter. Dr
Eastwood dug his heels in against that proposal which he rightly regarded as dangerous. He did however agree
to some modification to the middle row o f barriers in the newly created pen 3, chiefly to facilitate access.
Likewise in the new pen 5. The 1985 modifications to the pens are shown on the plan Appendix 4.

The Turnstiles and Concourse
   130. At the entrance, modification but no increase in number was made at the turnstiles. The bank 1 to 16
was divided from A to G by the metal fence now in place and that division was projected across the concourse
inside the turnstiles in the form o f a brick wall. A personnel gate was provided for access through that wall but
was enlarged to its present size at the request o f the police. Those alterations were made in the interests o f
segregation. The more elaborate divisions which Dr Eastwood had suggested, giving separate access to each
sub-division o f the accommodation, were not pursued for financial reasons. In May 1985 the Bradford
disaster occurred. The south stand at Hillsborough had wooden decking and the Club realised it would have to
undertake expensive remedial w'orks there. The cantilever roof o f the same stand was also discovered to
require expensive repairs.

   131. In fact, shortly after the new dividing fence and wall had been built at the Leppings Lane entrance and
concourse, the Club, by agreement with Chief Superintendent Mole, ceased to accommodate home supporters
at the Leppings Lane end. There was therefore no longer any need for segregation at that end, but the wall
remained.
   132. Also in 1985, electronic counting equipm ent was installed at all turnstiles. This conveyed the running
count for each bank o f turnstiles, for example A to G. to a television screen in the Club control room where the
figures were displayed. In 1986, an electronic eye was installed in each turnstile booth to catch and record
anyone who climbed over the turnstile.

Barrier 144
   133. In June 1986, the police requested that the crush barrier nearest to the tunnel at the entrance to pens 3
and 4 should be removed to assist the flow o f fans into the pens. They found it caused obstruction because it
was in a good viewing position and spectators liked to stand against it in numbers thereby blocking access by
others further into the pens. The police also suggested it might hamper effective evacuation through the tunnel
especially in an emergency. Dr Eastwood considered the pros and cons o f this proposal and accepted the police
view. The Officer Working Party approved the proposal at a meeting on 7 August 1986 on site. Authority was
given then and there by Mr Bowneson behalf o f the Sheffield City Council which had taken over responsibility
for the Safety Certificate from South Yorkshire County Council on 1 April 1986. Two spans o f the barrier were
therefore removed, leaving only one span in pen 4 as shown on Appendix 4.

Effects of the Layout
   134. The result o f these changes was to divide the terrace into a number o f small areas without providing
any computerised or mechanical means o f limiting entry numerically into any one area if all areas were open
for choice. Before the fences and pens had divided the terrace, the overall figure o f 10,100 could be monitored
via the turnstiles and in theory the crowd could even itself out laterally. Even then, it was not possible strictly to
ensure compliance with Schedule 3 Part 1 o f the Safety Certificate which prescribed a maximum o f 2,900 for
the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace. Paragraph 3 o f Schedule 2 o f the Safety Certificate
provides:

  “The number o f spectators admitted to the Stadium and to the several areas o f spectator accommodation
  within the Stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1 o f Schedule 3 ”.

  The Club had to rely upon visual monitoring.

   135. The situation became worse however with the division o f the west terrace into pens. Not only were
there more and smaller discrete areas but some were likely to attract more than their appropriate share o f the
 10,100 total. It is w-ell recognised that the area behind the goal is very popular. Moreover, the position o f the
tunnel vis-a-vis the turnstiles A to G, its labelling and the absence o f signposts advertising the wing pens would
draw to it those with terrace tickets. It was therefore highly likely that pens 3 and 4 would fill to capacity and
indeed exceed it unless preventive steps w'ere taken. Had Dr Eastw'ood’s plan for separate turnstile access to
separate sections with separate toilet and refreshment facilities been implemented, total computerised control
could have been kept.
                                                   CHAPTER 8

                               LACK OF FIXED CAPACITIES FOR THE PENS

  136. In 1981. when the terrace was divided into three areas, Dr Eastwood gave the Club the figure o f 2,200
capacity for the centre pen. He based this on the Green Guide, making such allowances as he thought right. N o
doubt the numbers could have been counted in via the turnstiles if only that pen was in use or if such pens as
were in use were filled sequentially, but not otherwise.

   137. After the 1985 changes, Dr Eastwood did not himself give any figures for the new pens 3 and 4.
Som eone on his staff however split the figure 2,200 into 1,200 for pen 3 and 1,000 for pen 4. Those figures did
not even take account o f the fact that pen 5 had been carved out o f pen 4 which was bound to have a reducing
effect on capacity. Nevertheless, the figures o f 1,200 and 1,000 were put on a drawing emanating from
Eastwood and Partners and the figures have been notionally regarded since as applicable by the Club and the
police. They are in fact too high.

  138. Dr Nicholson, at the Research and Laboratory Services Division o f the Health and Safety Executive,
has calculated that the figures for pens 3 and 4 respectively would be 1,015 and 1,036 if the strength and
spacing o f the crush barriers had complied with the Green Guide. But they did not.

Departures from the Green Guide
   139. In pen 3, four out o f five gaps in the lines o f crush barriers do not conform with paragraph 115 o f the
Green Guide (1986). In pen 4, nine out o f ten do not conform. In particular, the spans taken out o f the barriers
in pen 3 in 1985 left gaps well in excess o f the maximum o f 1.4 metres prescribed. One gap was 57% wider than
the Green Guide maximum. Moreover, that gap was in direct diagonal line from the mouth o f the tunnel to the
barrier which collapsed. Dr Eastwood justified these larger gaps by the absence o f gangways. Fans had to be
able to get in and out and standard gaps tended to get blocked up. The effect o f his reasoning was that the
absence o f gangways, recognised as having a safety function, led to the sacrifice o f a second safety feature,
namely gaps o f strictly limited width.

   140. Again, the removal o f barrier 144 was bound, as Dr Eastwood conceded, to affect capacity. In fact it
did more, as I shall indicate later.

   141. Capacity should also have taken account o f two further departures from the Green Guide. If, as w as
the case, the perimeter gates were not regarded as exits, some 40% o f those in pens 3 and 4 were more than~i~2
metres from an exit (and there was no gangway) contrary to the aim o f paragraph 96. Four out o f five o f the
crush barriers in pen 3 and six out o f nine in pen 4 were below the height prescribed in paragraph 110. These
were the old barriers which had been repaired and plated where their bases had corroded and fresh concrete
had been applied, raising the level o f the steps. The point is not academic since, in the event, many fans were
bent painfully over barriers under great pressure.

  142. Dr Nicholson calculated that when all relevant factors regarding the configuration and the Green
Guide are taken into account, the maximum capacity for pen 3 should have been 822 and for pen 4,87 1.

Safety Certificate
   143. Whatever should have been the maximum capacities for pens 3 and 4, the fact is that no figures at all in
respect o f them were put into the Safety Certificate. Despite all the changes in layout o f the fences and barriers,
the two figures, 2,900 for the north-west terrace and 7,200 for the west terrace, have remained as the only
maxima with which the Club has to comply.

  144. Section 2(1) o f the Safety o f Sports Grounds Act 1975 provides (so far as is relevant):

  “A Safety Certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in u s e . . . ”

  Section 2(2) provided (so far as is relevant):

  “Without prejudice to sub-section (1) above, a Safety Certificate-
  (a) shall specify the maximum number o f spectators to be admitted to the stadium;
  (b) may specify the maximum number to be admitted to different parts o f it;
  (c) shall include terms and conditions-
  ... (iii) as to the number, strength and situation o f any crush barriers.”
Section 2(2) was repealed by the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987. section 19. which
gave power to the Secretary o f State to lay down, by order, terms and conditions. No order has yet been
made and guidance from the Home Office has recommended local authorities to approach their
function under section 2(1) in accordance with the criteria in the repealed section 2(2). (See Home
Office Circular 71/1987 dated 25 November 1987, Annex A. paragraph 6.)

   145. It is clear that when the certificate was first issued the South Yorkshire County Council went
further than simply to fix the maximum numbers for the whole Stadium. They prescribed figures for
each part o f the ground not merely by the four points o f the compass but by specified sections.

   146. Section 8(1) o f the 1975 Act requires the holder o f the certificate before carrying out any
proposals to alter or extend the stadium or any o f its installations while a Safety Certificate is in
operation to give notice o f those proposals to the local authority. That obligation is specifically
repeated in Sheffield Wednesday's certificate at Schedule 2 Paragraph 5(2). The Club complied with
the requirement. Having received notice o f the alterations to the pens and the barriers, the local
authority ought, in my view, to have amended the Safety Certificate accordingly. They did not do so.

W hy was the Safety Certificate not Amended?
   147. Although Dr Eastwood acknowledged that the various changes to the layout would have had
an effect on capacity, he did not take active steps to see that appropriate amendments were made. He
says he mentioned from time to time that the alterations would have an effect on capacity and that he
did not realise the Safety Certificate was not regularly updated. However, I find two memoranda in
early 1987 highly significant. Dr Eastwood’s assistant Mr Strange was concerned with queries from
the FA as to Hillsborough’s capacity for a semi-final. Mr Strange recorded these questions in a
memorandum:-                                                                      —

  “Has any account been taken for alterations done on Leppings Lane over the last few seasons? Is the 10,200
  or so figure still correct? I said that in my opinion it needs to be adjusted, better do it now than later.”

  148. Mr Strange’s next memo (a few days later) records as follows:-

  “Dr Eastwood says leave the capacity at Leppings Lane end as it is, providing police have gates under West
  stand open so that people can distribute throughout the terrace evenly.”

Although he says the last nine words do not report him accurately, Dr Eastwood accepts the rest o f that
message.

   149. In my view the provisions as to capacity in the Safety Certificate ought to have been reviewed and
altered. The unhappy situation is that the police believed even the overall figure o f 10,100 to be too high as far
back as 1981. That was reported to the Club but apparently not to Dr Eastwood. Meanwhile, that global figure
had been rendered academic by the sub-division o f the terrace which was not reflected in the Safety Certificate
at all. If proper maximum figures had been inserted in the certificate for each o f the pens, the Club and the
police might well have been prompted to find some means o f limiting the numbers entering those pens other
than by visual monitoring. This could have been done by implementing one o f Dr Eastwood’s plans for totally
separate sections, turnstile to viewing area. It could have been done by insisting on sequential fillingof pens at
all matches; alternatively, by counting fans into each viewing area.

The City Council
   150. That the Safety Certificate was not amended and individual capacities not reviewed cannot be laid
solely at Dr Eastwood’s door. He was, after all, consultant engineer to the Club and responsibility for the
certificate was that o f the local authority. When the South Yorkshire County Council handed over to the
Sheffield City Council, the latter delegated all its powers and duties under the 1975 Act to its General Purposes
Panel. Apparently, therefore, the decision-making body on behalf o f the Council was that Panel, although two
specific functions were delegated to the Head o f Administration and Legal Department - the power to issue a
prohibition under section 10 o f the 1975 Act and the power o f entry and search under section 11 o f the Act.

  151. In practice, Mr Bownes. the Council’s Chief Licensing Officer in the Administration and Legal
Department, bore the brunt o f the Council’s duties under the Act.



                                                        25
   152.     The Officer Working Party was superseded by a Safety o f Sports Grounds Advisory Group, but
apart from the change o f the name the system continued as before. Mr Bownes attended the inspections
and meetings o f the Advisory Group together with the representatives o f the police, the fire service, the
department o f health and consumer services, and the building engineer’s division o f the Council. The
latter was an engineer and ought therefore to have been alive to the same issues as Dr Eastwood.

  153. The Advisory Group seems to have worked in a very informal manner. A short passage from Mr
Bownes’ evidence gives the flavour o f it:—

            Who was taking the lead in the working party as you understood it?

            That is a good question, sir. Leads were coming from several different directions really.

            Who chaired it, if anyone?

            Nobody as such, sir. It was an inspection rather than a meeting as I understand it.

            W'ho decided what should be inspected?

            Effectively the group itself, sir, it seemed to me. There was also some input from the Club
            representative as to, if you like, an element o f direction as to what should be looked at.

            Apart from the inspections the working party met, presumably, or did they only meet on
            inspections?

            No, sir, I have referred to three previous meetings.

            Who took the chair when it met?

            I suppose it could be said that I did, to some extent.

            There is no point in having inspections unless you form conclusions as a result o f that inspection, is
            there?

            That is correct.

            There must presumably have been some meeting following the inspection at which you all sat down
            together and decided what, if anything, should be done.

            There was not, to my recollection, no.

            How did you decide what should be done, if anything needed to be done?

            There were discussions on the site, particularly in relation to barrier 144, which took place at the
            time.

            Nothing more than that and no record anywhere o f any decisions that were made?

            No, sir.”

The decision to remove barrier 144 was assented to on behalf o f the City Council by Mr Bownes. It was not
referred to the General Purposes Panel. Whether Mr Bownes strictly had any power to assent to it is to say the
least very doubtful. But he himself admits that he was ill-equipped to do so. He knew very little about football
grounds. He had read the file passed on from South Yorkshire County Council and assumed all had been run
satisfactorily by them.

   154. It was recorded, however, in a report which Mr Bownes drafted that “the conditions (in the Safety
Certificate) give some cause for concern as they appear to be inadequate or inappropriate in some areas”. The
report to the General Purposes Panel suggested that new Safety Certificate conditions should be drafted.

   155. The task o f revising the Safety Certificate was begun in June 1986. In July 1987, a draft was sent to the
fire service to which they replied in August. In September 1987, the Panel was informed that the redrafting was


                                                        26
“progressing steadily" and should be subm itted to the Panel in October. T he final draft was not circulated until
30 March 1989. 16 days before this disaster.

   156. Meanwhile, the Safety Certificate has remained unamended since 1979. The enlargement o f the Kop
in 1986 increased its capacity to 21,000. Although this was known and agreed by the Council it had not been
the subject o f any change in the certificate which still showed the capacity o f the Kop as 16.850. MrMackrell,
Sheffield Wednesday’s Secretary, raised the question o f amendments to the Safety Certificate and in particular
with regard to the Kop in April 1987 with Eastwood and Partners but nothing resulted.'

  157. Sheffield United Football Club was designated under the 1975 Act on 3 July 1984. A Safety Certificate
was about to be issued by South Yorkshire County Council at the time it handed over to the Sheffield City
Council on 1 April 1986. N o certificate has yet been issued to Sheffield United.

   158. The explanation given for these delays was pressure o f work. Mr Bownes as Chief Licensing Officer
was responsible for 32 other licensing systems when this one was added to his burden. He had a staff o f only
five. I fully accept that the addition o f further statutory' responsibilities to the already heavy workload o f a local
authority with curbs on its expenditure creates problems. But it is clear that the attention given to this
important licensing function was woefully inadequate.

Summary
   159. The Safety Certificate contained no maximum figures for individual pens. There was therefore no
sanction or provision focussing attention as to the need to limit entry to the pens by numbers. The layout at
Leppings Lane as it evolved made electronic or mechanical control over numbers entering individual pens
impracticable if all pens were to be available. Given an important match and a capacity attendance, fans were
likely to crowd into popular sections like pens 3 and 4. Those pens were likely to becom e overfull well before
warning came from the turnstiles that numbers were approaching the terrace maximum o f 10,100. Control
over numbers and the avoidance o f overcrowding therefore depended entirely on visual monitoring o f the
crowd.
                                                   CHAPTER 9

                       LACK OF EFFECTIVE M O NITORING OF THE TERRACES

  160. Monitoring the spectators on the terraces so as to avoid overcrowding involves observing the numbers
and their distribution in each area, making decisions as to when an area is “full”, taking steps to close it off
and moving spectators from one area to another, if necessary, It is a function beset by three problems. 1) Who
should carry it out? 2) When is an area “full”? 3) Fear o f hooliganism.

Who should Monitor the Terraces?
  161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police? Should it be both? Or should it be by
arrangement, depending upon the ground or section o f the ground in question?

  162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:

         23. The safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
             administer the ground in which it is held, ie the “management”. This responsibility applies in
             both normal and emergency situations...

        195. ...there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

              (a)   controlling or directing members o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to
                    help achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on
                    the terraces or viewing slopes;

              (b)   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing
                    fires;

              (c)   manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                    are continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

              (d)   assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; and

              (e)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. There was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by Mr Justice Popplew ell
in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report, Mr Justice
Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the Minister o f Housing and Local Government in 1969 as
follows:-

  “The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating the
  ground. The broad line o f division being that police are responsible for movement o f spectators in public
  thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control o f
  spectators once they are on the club’s premises . .

Mr Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the police
have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3.8):

  “It follows, therefore, that as a matter o f practice, while the physical safety o f the building and the
  maintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground must always be the responsibility o f the club, the police
  have to take the de fa c to responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the game . . . ”

Mr Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

The Final Popplewell Report
   164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he came down more firmly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because, as a matter o f
practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been
assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement o f law and order. Those responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the primary’ and continuing obligation and responsibility to
ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises.” Mr Justice Popplewell ended that
section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier o f the ground
who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation rests.”

    165. There remains, however, the question whether there are some grounds or parts o f grounds where the
club may need to rely upon the police (w'hom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens and monitoring them
for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain circumstances. This very
difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
o f this Inquiry'.

Arrangements at Hillsborough
  166. What is clear, however, is that de fa cto the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
control o f the pens at the Leppings Lane end. The evidence o f the senior officers who had been concerned with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only Mr Duckenfield, who had not
policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

   167. Mr Lock is now security officer at Sheffield Wednesday and was formerly a police Superintendent at
Hillsborough matches occupying Mr Murray’s role. He claimed there had been a formal although unwritten
agreement between the Club and the police in about 1982, whereby the police agreed to steward the Leppings
Lane end o f the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other senior officers and I do not accept that any
formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrangement did develop* which was known and
accepted by both Club and police. Its effect was that throughout the ground the stewards were responsible for
manning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their seats in the
stands and for helping to control the exits after the match. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear and helping to control the crowd which usually consisted o f home
supporters. At the Leppings Lane end, however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
consisted usually (and always since 198 7) o f away supporters. Mr Mole and other senior officers accepted that
it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. They
would not have been effective there; moreover, they could well have been in som e danger from hostile away
supporters. The polic.e accepted, therefore, that the proper filling o f the pens and monitoring them for
overcrowding could and would not be carried out by stewards. Many stewards have tended to be either
extremely young or somewhat elderly. They are paid only a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
  168. Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence from senior police as already mentioned and from the
Club, Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued throughout the hearing to contend that the Club and
not the police were responsible for filling and monitoring the pens and that this was well known to both parties.
He maintained that the police were there essentially to secure and preserve law and order. Quite apart from the
police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance o f the South Yorkshire Police has not always
been to that effect.

Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club Limited
    169. In March 1986, the South Yorkshire Police Authority obtained a judgement against Sheffield United
Football Club for money due for police services provided at Sheffield United’s matches. The defence had been,
in ter alia, that the police were not providing “special police services”. They were doing no more than
performing their normal police duties o f securing and preserving law and order amongst a crowd. The police
argument was that they had additional duties. In his judgement, Boreham J summarised the instructions for
policing as providing for:-

 “(a) the maintenance o f enforcement o f law and order;

  (b) the enforcement o f the Club’s ground regulations, many o f which are concerned with law and order;

  (c) the safety and comfort o f the spectators, officials and players.”


                                                        29
     He referred to the argument o f Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police as follows:-

       “Thirdlv. here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public: they were in fact discharging the
       Club's duties to the spectators whom the Club invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large numbers
       to their private premises; it was the Club's duty to provide for their safety, health and comfort. They could
       have employed a security firm as banks and others have to do to protect their interests: they chose to request
       the police to perform those duties knowing that the police expected payment. Fourthly, the police within the
       ground provided serv ices which it was not within the scope o f their public duty to perform. For instance,
       they assisted in crowd management and in the enforcement o f such ground regulations as refused entry' to
       those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts o f the ground which
       their entry fee did not entitle them to enter. It may be, submits Mr Bentley, that the maintenance o f law and
       order was the predominant aim but there were other services performed."

     The learned Judge found:-

       “In addition to what may be called their law and order role the police were expected and did take part in
       crowd management, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the enforcement o f the Club’s regulations and to be on
       hand to assist in the event o f some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury.”

     Police Practice at the Leppings Lane End
        170. At League matches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how many and which
     pens would be used. If a modest crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed. It was better to
     confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (b) to reduce the number o f police
     required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved making a judgement as to when a pen
     was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
     and unsafe for police officers Oust like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
     This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
     police w'ere much better placed than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the
     television screens there. There were officers on the perimeter track. N o stewards were placed there because
     having both police and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
     could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the police a good appreciation o f
     the state o f the terraces. When it was necessary to shut off access to the pens officers on the concourse could be
     informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.

     “Find Their Own Level”
        171. At Cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were opened from the start and the
     policy was “to let the fans find their own level”. This phrase was repeated again and again by police officers at
     the Inquiry. What it meant was that no specific direction was given to fans entering through the turnstiles.
     They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. If they became uncomfortable or wished for any
     other reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
     the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police

•)   intervention. On these occasions, the gates at the top o f the radial fences were locked in the open position. It
     was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom o f movement from one pen to another enabling fans to
     “find their level”.

        1 72. This argument was bad both in theory and in practice. In theory, the whole object o f the radial fences
     had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
     freely from one pen to another would defeat the object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a more
     popular area without inhibition. In practice this did not happen because the position and size o f the gates was
     such that once a substantial number o f spectators were in, the gates were unnoticeable and inaccessible
     especially to those towards the front who might have most need o f them.

       173. The same argument was deployed to suggest that individual maximum capacities for individual pens
     need not be assessed since the presence o f the open radial gates still meant that the terrace was one area. In
     practice this simply was not so. The photograph at Appendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
     very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
     suggestion that the fans could, if uncomfortable, “find their own level”.

       174. The effect o f this policy was that whereas at League matches the police had to make a positive decision
     when to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likelv, the police


                                                            30
    left it to the fans th e m se lv es to “ find th e ir own level". Effectively, they were left to m o n i t o r their own c o m fo r t
    a n d safety so as to av o id overcrowding. T h e police w ould only in te r v e n e w h e n th e re was s o m e overt sign th a t an
    are a was "full".

    When is an Area “Full"?
       175. Over the years, spectators on terraces have come to accept conditions which are often very
    uncomfortable and not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to
    get in and out o f the terraces. They are packed tightly and exposed to surging and swaying during the match.
    They put up with these conditions because they are devoted to the game and because there is little they can do
    about them. They believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
    case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not. until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
    grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in on the assumption that if they are prepared to
    put up w ith it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
    in recent years, this has been due principally to the increased proportion o f seating as against standing
    accommodation. Terraces have still been packed.

       176. It is said that many fans enjoy these features o f terrace viewing. Clearly close proximity, shared
    discomfort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the sa m e songs a n d slogans en masse do evoke
    g oo d h u m o u r an d hav e p r o d u c e d a spirit or cult o f the terraces which many enjoy. Equally there are many who
    simply endure these things for the football, for a cheap ticket or indeed for the chance o f getting in at all. And
    before Hillsborough most fans on the terraces, even if they enjoy the hurly-burly, had not realised the narrow
    margin o f safety between an uncomfortable crush and a fatal one.

^       177. The Green Guide sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down criteria for maximum
    capacity, ie defining what is “full". The standard set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
    conditions but fewer, down to 27, in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to aim o ff too
    little from the higher figure for shortcomings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered appropriate in
    pens 3 and 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.

       178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the Green Guide, the problem remained that those
    supposed to be monitoring pens visually had and have little idea o f what 54 persons per 10 square metres look
    like. Mr Duckenfield’s opinion was that when a pen was full to capacity, the spectators would be “shoulder to
    shoulder and chest to back”. That view may derive from seeing the sort o f density crowds regularly endure
    without injury resulting. But it is much more dense than the Green Guide maximum.

        179. The South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs o f people standing in an area
    o f 10 square metres at various densities o f packing. Together with my Assessors and others, I took part in a
    similar experiment at the Health and Safety Executive’s Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f measured
    area at densities o f 54, 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
    experiment that the maximum density set out in the Green Guide left considerably more room than those
    monitoring the terraces would have left before declaring an area “full”.

       180. The tendency has been to allow the pens to fill until the fans complain or show signs o f discomfort. If
     he density at the front appeared less than at the back, the Tannoy would invite the fans to move forward to

«    nake room for more. The evidence before the Inquiry' and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
     there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused
    discomfort and sometimes, for brief periods, fear. Usually the surge recedes, the sway returns, the pressure
    eases and the incident passes unrecorded.

      181. After the crushing at the 1981 semi-final, Hillsborough was not chosen again by the FA until 1987.
    There was evidence that the central pens were uncomfortably overcrowded on that occasion and again at the
    1988 Cup semi-final, although entry to the tunnel was blocked} o f f by police shortly before kick-on in 1^8S
    because the pens were deemed to be “full”.

    Fear of Hooliganism
       182. Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matches has strongly influenced
    the strategy o f the police. In their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
    threats to public order. This is understandable and indeed commendable. But it has led to an imbalance
    between the need to quell a minority o f troublemakers and the need to secure the safety and comfort o f the
    majority. In the police Operational Order, the emphasis was upon prevention o f disorder and in particular
    prevention o f access to the field o f play. There was no express requirement that officers on the perimeter track


                                                                     31




                                                                                                                                            ,:v
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Summary
   183. Although the police had accepted de facto responsibility for monitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “find their own level” and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen became “full”, in practice they permitted the test o f
fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.
                                                   CHAPTER 10

                                    THE BUILD-UP AT THE TUR N STILES

   185. The decision to open gate C, and subsequently gates A and B too. was forced on to the police by the
crowd conditions which developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure could be swiftly relieved. Why the crowd pressure had built
to such intensity was one o f the principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes must be considered in
turn.

The Physical Layout
   186. I have already described and illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 and 2). At
Penistone Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and with a
sufficient waiting area for queues to form. Not so at Leppings Lane. The building line, the bridge over the Don
and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perimeter gates set in an arc, and across a short
forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. The pairs o f turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
as divided by the metal fence, provided little space for a waiting crowd.

The Number of Turnstiles
   18 7. The decision to fill the whole o f the north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
there to admit 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving the terraces had to admit
10,100, ie an average o f just under 1,450 through each turnstile. At the Penistone Road end, 29,800 were
served by 60 turnstiles, or just under 500 per turnstile.

   188. The Green Guide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rate at which spectators can pass through
turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circumstances but states “in general based on observation and
experience, it is unlikely that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would exceed 750 per hour”. Since the
semi-final was an all ticket match requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate of
about 1,000 per hour per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assumes the turnstiles
working at maximum efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly 1'k hours to admit all those with terrace
tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

   189. The Green Guide provides (paragraph 44):-

  “Turnstiles should be o f such numbers as to admit spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are
  kept waiting for adm ission..

   190. The Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 the need, and Dr Eastwood’s various schemes, for
improvement o f the turnstile arrangements. The mathematics are elementary. Both the police and the Club
should have realised that the Leppings Lane turnstiles and the waiting area outside them would be under strain
to admit all the Liverpool supporters in time. Success depended on the spectators arrivingat a steady rate from
an early hour and upon the maximum turnstile rate being maintained. In fact neither o f these requirements,
which are inter-linked, was fulfilled. That they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

The “Late” arrival of Liverpool Fans
   191. Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5,000 and became
unmanageable. The case made for the police was that large numbers o f Liverpool supporters arrived late; a
high proportion o f them were drunk and unco-operative; a high proportion had no tickets; all o f them were
hell-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

   192. Whether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were “late” was much debated. The ticket
simply requested its holder “to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick-off”. That may have been
intended to persuade those with stand tickets to take their seats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. Whether they were “late” or not,
however, there was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 pm and after.

Traffic Delays
  193. It is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
Liverpool traffic routes. There were roadworks on the M62 which was the recommended route. At various
points the carriageway was reduced from four lanes or three lanes to two, but no serious delays were reported.
On the M63 there were longer delays due to a contraflow and at its junction with the A560 there was heavy
congestion due to volume o f traffic. However, the Liverpool routes were clear by 2.20 pm and those witnesses
who complained o f delays en route had nevertheless managed to be in range o f the ground in ample time.

Fine Weather and Drinking
   194. The likeliest explanations for the sparse Liverpool attendance in the ground before 2.30 pm were four­
fold - the warm weather, drinking, disinclination to enter the ground early and prolong the standing, and a
tendency o f Liverpool supporters to cut it Fine.

   195. The police emphasised that at the 1988 semi-final there was no comparable build-up o f “late” arrivals.
They claim, therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988, although the weather
was fine, it was 11 ’ F cooler than in 1989. 15 April was the sort o f fine spring day which tempted fans to sit or
stand about in the sun with a drink. Ifyou had a ticket it would seem more pleasant and sensible to relax in that
way than to enter the ground early and stand on the terrace for an extra hour. Pre-match entertainment in the
ground had been advertised but did not take place. Even if it had, it may not have been an encouragement to
many fans to enter so early.

Was Drunkenness a Major Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very many had been drinking at public houses or had
brought drink from home or an off-licence. I am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
were not drunk nor even the worse for drink. The police witnesses varied on this. Some described a high
proportion as drunk, as “lager-louts” or even as “animals”. Others described a generally normal crowd with an
unco-operative minority who had drunk too much. In my view some officers, seeking to rationalise their loss
o f control, overestimated the drunken element in the crowd. There certainly was such an element. There were
youngsters influenced by drink and bravado pushing impatiently at the rear o f the crowd thereby exacerbating
the crush. But the more convincing police witnesses, including especially Detective Superintendent McKay
and Chief Inspector Creaser as well as a number o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in
describing this element as a minority. Those witnesses attributed the crush to the sheer numbers o f fans all
anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism o f the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
or even 2.35 pm. What happened then was not a sudden deterioration in the mood or sobriety o f those
assembled there. N o doubt those coming behind would have had more to drink and would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed into a confined
turnstile area and its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.

    197. Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police
exhortations to stop pushing and to ease back were not heeded. How could they be? In that crush most people
had no control over their movements at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. One
horse was found afterwards to have cigarette burns on its rump. Clearly that was the despicable work o f a
hooligan whether in drink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts o f a horse being physically
lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent but as an
involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which those by the horse’s flanks could not resist any more than the
horse itself.

Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
  198. The labelling o f the turnstiles in the order A, C, B was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
mistake to the wrong side o f the metal fence would have had the greatest difficulty in getting back and round to
the correct side. The colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to the
turnstile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. The information on the ticket printed by
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful, as Mr Mackrell frankly conceded.

   199. The result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans for help as to where they
should go. Later, as the crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrong turnstiles.
There were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Leppings
Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and after a while the police
instructed the operators to let them through. There was further delay because the crush made it difficult for
fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from behind was such as, on occasions, to jam
them in the doorway or against the paddle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets who soyght
to enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
holder. All o f these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
hour per turnstile. The waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed frustration grew. Visitors


                                                       34
who had paid for tickets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
increased pressure and induced panic at the front. Determination to get into the match was intensified by
determination to get out o f the crush.

Were Fans Without Tickets a Major Factor in the Build-Up?
  200. It has become a fact o f football life that fans do turn up at all-ticket matches without tickets. It is not
possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estimate o f the number without tickets on 15 April. Police
estimates varied from about 200 to about 2,000. There were certainly frequent requests for tickets or “spares”
during the hours before the build-up. Many o f those warned o ff by the police were seen to return to the area.
Some were hanging about on the bridge. Again, however, the police w itnesses who most impressed me did not
consider the number o f ticketless fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two other sources o f
evidence.

   201. First, there was a wide range o f witnesses who observed inside the ground that the Liverpool end was at
a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The north stand still had many empty seats and the wing
pens were sparse. The match being a sell-out, there were clearly many ticket holders to come and they could
account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. Had the Liverpool accommodation been full by 2.40
pm, one could have inferred that most or much o f the large crow'd outside lacked tickets.

   202. Secondly, such figures as are available from the Club’s electronic monitoring system and from analyses
by the HSE suggest that no great number entered without tickets. They show that the number who passed
through turnstiles A to G plus those w-ho entered through gate C roughly equalled the terrace capacity figure o f
 10,100 for which tickets had been sold. The Club’s record showed 7,038 passed through turnstiles A to G.
However, the counting mechanism on turnstile G w-as defective, so the HSE did a study using the video film
and projecting figures from the other turnstiles. This gave an assessment o f 7,494, with a maximum o f 7,644
passing through A to G. Again, using the video, the HSE assessed the number who entered the ground whilst
gate C was open at 2,240 with a maximum o f 2,480. Accordingly, the HSE’s best estimate o f the total entering
through gate C and turnstiles A to G was 9,734 with a maximum o f 1 0 ,1 2 4 .1 recognise that these can only be
rough checks because, for exampie, some with terrace tickets were aliowed through turnstiles 1 to 16 and there
would be other similar factors which have not formed part o f the assessment. Nevertheless, the figures do
suggest that there was not a very significant body o f ticketless fans in the crowd which built up.

The “Conspiracy” Theory
  203. On behalf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the “late” arrival o f so many
Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. The suggestion w-as that fans without tickets conspired
to arrive late and create such trouble as would force the police to admit them to the match. The slender
evidence upon which this theory rested came from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and
the antecedent history o f Liverpool supporters at away matches.

   204. One witness said he heard three Liverpool supporters saying, in effect, that they would manage to get
in without tickets by causing trouble so that police would open a gate, and that they had done this before.
Another witness heard two o f a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, that they would go to the
ground just before kick-off, that no-one would stop them getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
Statements were put in relating to two other small groups talking in similar terms.

Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
  205. The South Yorkshire police prepared a dossier o f reports on the behaviour o f Liverpool fans at away
matches with the object o f showing a pattern o f troublesome behaviour by large numbers either without tickets
or with forged tickets. Without setting out the whole history, it can be summarised as follows.

  206. On three occasions Liverpool fans without tickets were allowed into all-ticket matches upon payment.
(At Watford on 13 February 1988, 1,500 were admitted; at Southampton on 24 September 1988, 150 were
admitted; at Southampton again on 12 December 1988, 750 were admitted.) At Norwich on 1 April 1989,
Liverpool supporters arrived without tickets but 1,272 tickets had been returned and fans from both Liverpool
and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A similar situation occurred at Wimbledon on 13 May 1989.
There were six other occasions from 1986 to date, including the Cup finals o f 1986 and 1989, when numbers o f
Liverpool supporters turned up without tickets or otherwise behaved badly.

  207. Four points must be noted, however. On none o f the occasions when ticketless fans were admitted for
payment was the match a sell-out. There was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. At a sell-out fans
might not expect to be allowed in. even for payment. Secondly, no trouble of the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final when Liverpool visited Hillsborough. Thirdly, Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
January 1989 without any trouble. Finally, no forged tickets were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. I have already found that there was not an abnormally large number o f fans without tickets on this
occasion. With one or two exceptions, the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the “conspiracy”
theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Leppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. There were, I accept, small groups without tickets who were willing to exploit
any adventitious chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the minority who had drunk too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the police. But that main problem was simply one o f large numbers
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
  209. The Operational Order for 15 April followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. The
emphasis was on maintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked off to prevent damage in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash o f rival supporters”. Officers were to watch public
houses, shops and supermarkets “where looting could take place”. Outside the turnstiles, officers were to ensure
supporters entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles or alcohol.

  210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has made all these steps necessary. But the only written provision
aimed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers “to ensure orderly queues are
formed ’. There was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crowd into the turnstile area.

  211. As long ago as 1924, the Departmental Committee on Crowds stated:-

  “The control o f crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
  The advantages o f an arrangement o f this kind are... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds.”

This was particularly important at Leppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. If a large crowd was permitted uncontrolled entry through the perimeter gates, the forming o f queues at the
turnstiles and control by officers, whether on foot or mounted, would become impracticable. Those waiting at
the turnstiles would become a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. Whether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and a d hoc
instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
  213. The seniorpolice officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Leppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole o f the north
and west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 and 1988 . In 1987 , the match was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a quarter o f an hour because o f late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
  214. As to 1988, there was a very large and consistent body o f evidence that, on the day, the police in
Leppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those without tickets and
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. I do not believe that so many witnesses without either opportunity
or reason to put their heads together couid be mistaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet, the
police maintain that no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 and that their
policy and practice then were no different from those o f 1989.

  215. The answer to this conflict must, I think, be that whilst the policy may have been no different, in
practice the policing in 1988 was more efficient and was not put to the same test and strain as a year later. There
was not so large a swell in numbers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
Nevertheless, there had been warning signs in 1988. Detective Superintendent McKay gave the following
evidence:
  "Q Were you aware o f a build-up o f numbers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?

  A   Yes. . . There was a huge build-up around 10 minutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
      came at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw and there was quite a sizeable crush
      built-up - sizeable queue.

  Q   Queue or crush?

  A   Compacted queue, built-up in the area by the turnstiles which I believe are marked A to G. That crowd
      reached backaimost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
      freely and they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then t h e . . .

  Q   This crow'd that you have described o f the late arrivals at about 10 to - was it an orderly crowd?

  A   Oh no. N o. The orderly crowd had gone in, and when I say they were not an orderly crowd, obviousiy
      mixed amongst those people w ere. . .

  Q   O f course, but taking it generally?

  A   But by and large they had taken a lot o f drink on board and they were in such numbers that excluding
      them from the ground was completely out o f the question.

  Q   Were they standing in an orderly queue or w-as there some pushing and shoving?

  A   There was a lot o f pushing and shoving. There was an urgency to get into the ground.

  Q   But fortunately it does not appear to have been in nearly such numbers as this year.

  A   It wasn’t.”

Police Intelligence in Advance
  216. Apart from that experience in 1988, the tendency o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
unknown. Witnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at their home ground, Anfield, quite quickly and
tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to postpone arrival was noted by the
Sheffield City Council Advisory Group, with police present, on 23 March 1988. The minute reads:-

  “As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving some 15 minutes
  before the start o f the game hoping to gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning o f alcohol at
  sports grounds which could lead to people going elsewhere for refreshment prior to the football match. As
  the available turnstiles operated quite effectively for the majority o f the time, and that the late arrival
  problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education o f the spectators” (sic).

  217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ behaviour at away matches may have been indicative o f what police
problems might arise on 15 April, most o f the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
forces, South Yorkshire Police had a liaison officer whose job was to seek, receive and collate relevant
information as to the visiting supporters. The Association o f Chief Police Officers’ Guide to Policing Football
highlights the importance o f such liaison:-

  “It is important that the officer responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match planning in the
  light o f the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be obtained from a variety o f sources, the prime
  source for football intelligence is the Police National Intelligence System which is based on the network o f
  police liaison officers. Summaries completed by police officers o f the home club force are forwarded to the
  visiting club’s liaison officer making available intelligence about fans’ behaviour at both home and away
  fixtures. This information will be collated and made available for future matches involving that club”.
                                         .                                  -

  218. The FA had also laid down in a memorandum issued in the 1985/6 season measures to be adopted by
the away club which included the following: -

  “ It is the responsibility o f the aw'ay club to advise the home club o f the recent behaviour o f their supporters
  at away matches, irrespective o f whether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
  Association or not” .

  219. It does not seem that information o f this kind was passed to the Sheffield Wednesday Club or played
any p a n in me b o - in ''iorksnire Police plans. H ad :he latter been informed o f the history cor;tamed m. :he
dossier and summarised above it m a y we:: have in:'._encec police strategy m Leppmgs Lane.

  220. There is presently a proposal that a national computer-based police football intelligence system should
be set up to make the necessary, inform ation readily available.

Police Intelligence on the Day
  221. The unfilled space in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry a v a i l a b l e from the
Club's computer and observations on the video screen should have enabled those in the control room to
m onitor the numbers arriving and still to arrive at Leppings Lane. Radio contact with mobile (Tango) patrols
detailed to monitor licensed premises in the district could have indicated the num bers still to come. But at 2.30
pm when M r M u r r a y told Mr Duckenfield they would “get them all in by 3 o'clock" he seems not to h a v e
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were m a n y m ore still to come. Certainly. Mr
Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that there were still many
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.

M r M arshall and M r Greenwood
   222. The division o f c o m m an d between these two officers did not help. M r Marshal! was in charge o f the
serials outside the perim eter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice he operated
inside and just outside the turnstile area. M r G reenw ood's area as G ro u n d C o m m a n d e r extended from the
pitch to the perimeter gates. He in fact station ed h im self near the players' tunnel. He was wholly unaware o f the
growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were u n d e r
pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.

Control Lost
   223. In the result, the large concentration o f arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into
the turnstile area through the perim eter gates which were fully open. W hen that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the torecourt and even into the road. As a l r e a d y recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles became trapped and endangered a n d retired through the turnstiles. T he m o u n te d officers could not
operate amidst such a dense crowd in a confined space. They came out o f the turnstile area. There were then
the belated attem pts to close the perim eter gates a n d prevent more fans joining the m ass until it had a chance to
dim inish through the turnstiles; still later th e a tte m p t to put a cordon o f horses across the entrance.

  224. Despite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large n u m b e r o f fans to be got through so few
turnstiles and the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last half hour, no contingency plans w ere made to avoid a
crush such as occurred. Even on the dav. th e need to close Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm a n d the
other available intelligence already sum m arised, should have prom pted those in c o m m a n d to take i
aeainst such a crush. I f some o f the perim eter eates had been closed and c ordons o f m o u n te d and foot officers
had been placed a little distance from those cates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that area becam e eneulfed. It was the crush itself w hich produced the frustration a n d the
panic and brought out the worst in those who h a d drunk' too much. Ear ier control o f entrv would have
prevented the crush and m aintained the good m o o d which had prevailed until 2.30 am .

  222.     It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm. if not earlier, that a large part o f the crowd could
not be adm itted until well after 3 pm. H ad a decision to postpone kick-offbeen m ade and announced much of
the frustration and with it the im petus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A c om bination or1
controlled Altering a n d a postponed kick-d:':* would probably' have obviated the need to open the gates.

Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At various stages in his evidence. M r Duckenfield ga\ e three accounts o f why he thought it too late to
postpone kick-off. Once it was that one o f the team s had already come onto the pitch. T h e n it was that a group
o f photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were com ing out. Finally, he d id not
know' why he thought the team s were com ing out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm . twc
m inutes after gate C was opened. Police C onstable Buxton had asked for a p o stponem ent o f kick-off before
gate C was opened. It should not. however, have needed a police Constable in the thick o f the crowd I and there
were others of like m ind) to think o f postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the control
room.                                                          '                                                   1

  227. The truth was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with M r Murray.
Kick-off would not be postponed unless there were some major cause for delay ed arrivals e? a ja m on the

Summ ary
   22S.       T he lavout o f th e turnstiles and the num b e r they were required to serve left no margin o f safety against
an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it. the arrival o f a
large n u m b e r o f supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unm anageable crush. The presence o f
a substantia] m in o rity of1fans who had d runk too much aggravated th a t problem . Having lost control and
rejected the o p tio n o f postponing kick-off. the police were faced with a serious danger o f deaths o r injuries.
T h ey were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that
stage to ask for it a n d M r Duckenfield was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so d ram atic a step required
o th e r action.




                                                                         39

   229. The decision to order the opening o f the gates was not accompanied or followed by any other o rd e r to
ceal with the consequences.        hen gate C w as opened, a steady stream of about 2,000 fans poured through it
over some five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and unless they were d i\ erted
their likeliest route was through the tunnel te r reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control
room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. N either the Club control room
n or the C hief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was warned. Not even M r Greenwood, the G ro u n d
C om m ander, was informed. From 2.47 pm w hen Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52 pm when M r
D uckentield acceded to it, there were five m in u te s in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence. M r Duckenfield began by saying th a t no officer m ade any
wrong decision but he later conceded he had e rre d in this regard. He said he did not consider where the people
w ould go w hen the gate opened. Even after it opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens. M r Duckenfield said it did not cross his m ind to detail
officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how-
tull pens 3 and 4 were. T h a t was a m atter for th e control room to m onitor from its o w t i observations and using
intelligence from aro u n d the ground.

  230. Since pens 3 a n d 4 were full by 2.50 p m . the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to
be opened or not. T he exercise was a simple o n e and had been carried out in 19SS. All that was necessary was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entra n c e to the tunnel and divert fans elsew here. Unfortunately, the
1988 closure seems to have been unknow n to the senior officers on duty at the tim e. It did not figure in the
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.

  231. Planning apart, however, it should have been clear in the control room w here there was a view o f the
pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that th e tunnel had to be closed. If orders had been given to that effect
w hen gate C was opened, the fans could have been directed to the em pty areas o f the wings and this disaster
could still have been avoided. Failure to give th a t order was a blunder o f the first m agnitude.

   232. Significantly, w hen perm ission was given to open gate A. Mr Duckenfield did ord e r serials to go to th a t
p art o f the concourse to m o n ito r the influx tow ards the north stand. He did this because he feared th a t if fans
went to the north stand w ithout tickets, they would not get seats and, there being no perim eter fences at the
n o rth side, they might invade the pitch. This illustrates again the preoccupation with avoiding pitch invasion
as against safety and the risks o f overcrowding. Because those entering through gate C could not get onto the
pitch, it was not thought necessary to alert officers to m onitor them. The possibility o f overcrow ding simply
was not considered.

                                            T H E BARRIERS IN P E N 3

Barrier 144
   233. T he removal o f barrier 144 in 19S6 shouid have reduced the notional capacity o f pen 3 as already
m entioned. But it d id more. In the absence o f barrier 144. the influx o f fans after 2.52 pm met no retarding
structure as it came into pen 3. The pressure created was free to push fans straight down by the radial fence to
the lowest line o f barriers. The pressure diagonally from the tunnel m outh down to barrier num ber 124a which
collapsed was un broken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen
through the gap in the barrier above it created in 19S5.

   234. Inspector BuIIas, positioned in the west stand, described what he saw looking down on the pens
a ro u n d 3 pm.

  “... I saw from the direction of the tunnel a kind o f movement down the te rra c in g ... the ty~pe of thing th a t you
  see on the nature programmes, the molten lead tlowing down the side o f the m ountainside, the molten lava ...
  a “river o f people" ... going directly towards the p itch but there again spreading ... out."

   235. D r Eastwood conceded in evidence th a t the removal o f barrier 144 was likely to have contributed to
the collapse of 124a. Later, he sought to resile trom that answer, but I think his earlier admission was correct. It
was argued that if b a rrie r 144 had remained, the influx from gate C would have built up further back an d the
tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or might have broken barrier 144 itself. This is speculative a n d t
th in k unlikelv. W hat rem ained ot'barrier 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up: nor did it collapse. J^uf its
rem aining in position mav well have accounted lor no barrier turtne r down pen 4 collapsing and tor th e lesser
carnage in that pen!                                                                     — —            —— —

W h en did Barrier 124a Fail?
   236. Counsel for th e South Yorkshire Police sought to argue th a t th is barrie r collapsed or m a y have
collapsed a t about 2.47 pm. His purpose was to suggest that th e opening o f gate C was not causally linked w ith
the crushing and fatalities resulting from th a t collapse. I have already found th a t whilst the evidence does not
p erm it the tim e o f collapse to be fixed with certainty; it was after 2.52 pm . I now give m y reasons:

  (a) I have several times watched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
      identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at that time:

  (b) the evidence o f fans who were near or a t the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect that the collapse
      occurred at o r after 3 pm;

  (c) the biggest group of witnesses was that which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley s
      "near-m iss" at the Kop end at 3.04 pm:

  (d) the ap pearance on video and photographs o f fans in the area o fb a m 'e r 124a after the incident at 2.47 p m
      an d before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early.

  (e) it is highly unlikely that if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm. the police on the
      track and elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o'clock to realise som ething was seriously wrong.
      Indeed, if Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his timing o f the collapse, the failure ot
      the police to respond for so long w ould expose them to even graver criticism than that m ade in this
      Report.

D r Eastw ood's Testing of the Barriers
   237. Two sections o f barrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result o f the overcrowding. T hat collapse caused a
n u m b e r o f deaths. D r Eastwood and his staff had undertaken the periodical testing o f crush barriers required
by the Green G u id e and by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 19S5 and passed.

   23S.   T he test h a d been carried out in accordance with D r Eastwood's interpretation o f Annex C to the
G reen Guide. T h at requires an evenly distributed force of 6.0kN /m etre width to be applied for 3 five m in u te
periods, the interval between applications to be 25 short as possible. A record has to be kept of the am ount
deform ation during each loading and of the percentage of recovery. It the recovery is less than 50% after the
third application o f torce. the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% and "5%. there must be 2
re-test. The question is: 50% or 75% o f w hat? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position o f the b a rrie r
before the first application o f torce or before the third? If the former, a span o f 124a recorded 53% at the l v i S
test and should have been re-tested. If the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. Unfortunately the Green G u id e
is unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view"and so passed the barrier. He
justified his interpretation in evidence. He said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
"shake-down" effect related to some giving in the ashes under the concrete or to some other extraneous factor
rather than to any defect in the material o f the barrier itself.

  239. I think, after consulting Professor M aunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be bv
reference to the position o f the barrier before the first application o f force. I accept, however, that the G reen
G u id e is am biguous a n d D r Eastwood's interpretation is tenable. It has som e support trom the British
Standards tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the Green G uide should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
  240. Inspection o f barrier 124a, and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the HSE showed
considerable corrosion o f the metal at vulnerable points where water could accum ulate. D r Eastwood agreed
that if a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condem ned.

  241. The G reen G u id e does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides, in te r alia:

  "Crush barriers and balustrades should be exam ined for deform ation or any oth e r o v e n signs o f weakness".

Paragraph 6 o f Annex C provides:

  “ If during any test, even though the b a r r i e r ... satisfies the above loading requirem ents, doubt should arise
  for any reason (including such m atters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion o f connections) as to th e
  safety o f the b a r r i e r ... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
  remove the dou b t as to safety o f the b a r r i e r ... (it) should be deem ed to have failed the test".

  242. Since corrosion is a likely cause o f deterioration, a revision o f the G reen G u id e should m ake specific
reference to it.

Causation
  243. Tests done by th e HSE suggest that although barrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 and probably
would have been able to sustain a force which d id not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
im posed upon it by reason o f the num bers in pen 3. the excessive gap in the b a rrie r higher up the pen a n d the
absence o f barrier 144. Corrosion probably played a p a n , but the effective cause o f the collapse was th e
excessive and u n anticipated pressure to w hich the barrier was exposed.

                                     THE CRUSHING NOT RECOGNISED

Observation from Control Room
   244. As the stream from gate C flowed through the tunnel, the officers in the control room could be expected
to keep a close watch on pens 3 and 4. They had a direct view o f them from an elevated position through their
window. Although they had no field-glasses, there was the zoom facility on the TV cam era. The radio was by
then working again and although reception was difficult due to crow d noise a n d possibly excessive air traffic
on channel 25. attem pts could have been m ade to alert officers on the p e rim e te r track to watch for
overcrowding and report theirobservations. In the event, pens 3 and 4 becam e m ore a n d more crowded, surges
took place, fans were showing and signalling distress. None o f this was seen o r recognised in the control room.

Officers on the Track
   245. T h e 20 officers detailed to the perim eter track were distributed ro u n d the pitch so that some five
officers were at the west end. Their written instructions m ade no reference to the avoidance or detection of
overcrowding. The same applied to the officers in the west stand. M r G reenw ood adm itted that his oral
briefings also contained no mention o f monitoring the pens for overcrowding.

   246. T he O perational O rder for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone "access to the track from the
terraces w ithout the consent o f a senior officer (except to receive medical attention)'". At the end o f the 19S8
semi-final, there was a m inor pitch invasion. A c c o r d i n g l y , that prohibition was em phasised in the 1989
O perational O rder by being put into capital letters. The com bination o f no instructions as to overcrowding and
a strong p rohibition on opening the gates was likely to m ake police recognition o f crushing slow and their
response reluctant. Small wonder that tne growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 pm
w ent u nheeded or certainly unremedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem , the rule required
consent o f a senior officer before a gate could be opened.

  247. “Senior officer" m eant an officer o f Inspector rank or higher. T he Inspector in charge o f the 20 officers
on the track was M r Darling. He stationed him self by the players’ tunnel, th e m ost central position for
supervising his men. In evidence he said:

  “ I would only take action if I thought crow ding had got to such a stage th a t the fans were in danger. I'd then
  inform ground control and I would expect someone deployed to the back o f the s ta n d .-

  T h a t underlines the inhibition against opening perim eter gates. So d id the evidence o f one Constable who
said it had been so d ru m m e d into officers not to open the gates that when he saw- distress in pen 4. he “d e b ated -
with him self before opening the gate, thinking: “ If I'm wrong. I'm going to get a right bollocking for this."
Naturally, one would hope that common sense and hum anity would make some officers cut through the rules
an d open a gate if fans were clearly in distress.

  248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress a n d even then not immediately.
Hence, gates 3 and 4. having been opened, were shut again before they were f i n a l l y opened and at first those
seeking to climb out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction o f the police d id not go on tor as long as
som e witnesses believed. They probably misinterpreted the hand movem ents from M r Greenwood and others
aim ed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the pressure as attem pts to stop those climbing out at the
front.

  249. Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recogiuse the p roblem and the inhibition.
against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.

The Officers in Command
   250.    Even w hen realisation ot the problem came to officers on the track, it was some minutes before it
reached the control room. When spectators first appeared on the track, the im m ediate assumption in the
control room was tn at a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beeinnine o f a match. It
became still less likely w hen those on the track made no move towards the pitch. M r Motson. the BBC
commentator, recognised and said, well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be
overcrowding and no t misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary persisted in the control room. U ntil
M r Murray radioed tor a fleet of ambulances, about 3.06 pm, M r Duckenfield continued to treat the incident
as a threat to the pitch a n d to public order. Tne message calling up all available officers mentioned a pitch
invasion. O peration Su p p o rt was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
   -5 1 . U ntil Chiet S uperintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control or on
the pitch to harness a n d organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
pressure. Some o in ce rs did this on their own initiative. Apart from the T a n n o y request to clear the pitch, no
attem pt was m ade to clear a n d m ark off a casualty area where first-aid could be given without hindrance by
tans and photographers milling about between the bodies. There was no co-ordination o f the earlv provision o f
tirst-aid or ot stretcher parties or o f the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. No request for help was broadcast to
doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
have been achieved in m ost cases however soon doctors had been sum m oned, but there were marginal cases
where earlier attention m ight have made a difference.
   252. T he plight ot those b ehind the fencing and the existence o f injuries were known to officers at the scene
trom 3 pm. But the M a jo r Disaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the ambulance service
was called. No request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was m ade until 3.13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, but it is possible.
Police on the Pitch
    253. Despite the initial lack o f leadership, m any officers did all they hum anly could to rescue and revive the
victims. M any su pporters who gave evidence paid" tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say that the n u m b e r
o f officers who could at first b e usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily limited.
   254. C h ie f S u p e rin ten d e n t Nesbit's action in deploying a line o f officers across the m iddle o f the pitch has
already been m entioned-1 can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion that a
rush by som e fans tow ards the Kop end raised fears o f conflict are well borne out by the v ideo tape. In my
judgem ent. C hief S uperin ten d e n t Nesbit was well justified in using some o f the m any officers called up
pursuant to O peration S u p p o rt to prevent possible violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an unthinkable and obscene development.
Fans on the Pitch
   255. M any fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state o f collapse or close to it. Most of those w ho
retained their strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. They helped pull them clear, they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry the improvised stretchers.
  226,     There were tans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. T heir conduct in abusing,
assaulting an d spitttr.g at the police was disgraceful the more so since earlier police failures had little to do
with those officers now- doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
am bulance men and firem en in the course c f their rescue work. This was probably because their sim ilar
uniform s caused them to be mistaken for police. How ever, although the abuse was widespread, the n u m b e r o f
assaults an d spittings was on the evidence comparatively small. In deploring them, one must recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience w hich those responsible had just suffered and w ere still suffering.
False Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reponed in the press, and said to have em anated from
police officers present at the match, of “mass drunkenness". It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
police w hile they w ere pulling the dead and injured out. that others had even urinated on the bodies o f the dead
a n d stolen their belongings. N ot a single witness was called before the Inquiry to su p p o n any o f those
allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any o f the represented p a r ie s to have any witness
called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations I have m entioned were m ade in the press. Mr Peter
W right. Chief C onstable o f South Yorkshire, m ade a dignified statement dissociating him self from such grave
and emotive calumnies. T hose who made them , and those who disseminated them , would have done better to
hold their peace.

   25S.     The perim eter gates, in the pens were not designed as exits. They were intended to afford access b y the
police to cope with any local disorder or with an emergency. The kind o f e m e r g e n c y contem plated was not
massive crashing but. for example, the collapse or illness of an individual. Emergency evacuation of the pens
had been considered by the Officer Working Party. Although fire risk was m in im a l since the terraces, west
stand and tunnel were o f concrete construction, the fire brigade were the principal arbiters ot evacuation
procedure. They aim ed to be able to em pty the pens in six minutes. The plan was to evacuate spectators via the
tunnel. If for any reason that option becam e im practicable, eg due to a bo m b threat, then the alternative route
would be along the back o f the terraces, through the gates in the radial fences and round the sides o f the west
stand. The fire brigade were satisfied that each o f these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated m less
th an six minutes, w ithout relying on the gates to the pitch. Those gates would also be available, but their use
was excluded from the calculation o f evacuation time.

  259. The need to provide for s p e e d y and large scale evacuation from the front o f the pens to the pitch was
not anticipated. T he G reen G uide (19S6) provides as follows:

  “ 209. Access to the pitch must be m ade as difficult as possible in norm ai circum stances while at the same
  tim e ensuring that the police have effective access to the terraces for the p u rpose o f crowd control and
  enabling the pitch to be used (where appropriate) in the event o f serious emergency . . .

  214. . . . at som e m ajor soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd m ovem ent form s a necessary part o f the
  safety measures, it m ay be necessary to have a fence which prevents access to the pitch in normal
  c irc u m sta n ce s. . . but allows for access in emergency.

  215. For most m ajo r stadia, w hether used for association football or o th e r sports, the pitch perim eter fence
  will be required either to prevent access to the pitch as m entioned above, o r a t least to discourage a ttem p ts
  by spectators to enter the playing area. G ates o r o th e r access points ( m in im u m w idth 1.1 metres) should
  nonetheless be provided for use in an em ergency . . . Provision o f such gates o r access points is particularly
  im portant to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
  an emergency.          Such gates o r access points should be properly stewarded and                         clearly
  m arked so th a t im m ed ia te access to the playing area o r perim eter track c an b e e n su re d ” .

   260. G ate 3 was .82 metres in width; gate 4 was .79 metres in width. T here were therefore clear departures
from the Green G u id e standard.

  262. It was argued that there was no breach o f the Safety Certificate since the G reen G uide specifically
provided for flexibility. However, in m y view the Safety Certificate can n o t a n d certainly should not be
interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requirem ents as the size o f exit gates to the totaf
discretion of the club and its advisers. O ne ot the matters for consideration at stage two o f this inquiry- will be
whether, and in what respects, the G reen G u id e needs to be clarified and toughened.

   263. D r East’* c o d explained the small w idth o f the gates by reference to the d ile m m a facing the police. They
wanted a gate sufficient for its intended purpose ie police access and small scale emergencies. On m e o th er
hand, they did not want a flood gate o f such size as to endanger the prim e principle o f preventing pitch
invasions. In the light o f Hillsborough, this is perhaps the most poignant exam ple o f the difficulty o f achieving
a balance between stopping hooliganism a n d ensuring crowd safety.

  264. Even if the width o f gates 3 and 4 had com plied with the present G re e n G u id e standard, they would
have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
Green G uide says nothing about the n u m b e r o f gates required for a pen o f given size. Whilst th e Club.

                                      PART III - CONCLUSIONS
                                                   C H A P T E R 16

                                        B R IE F S U M M A R Y O F CAUSES

  265. The im m ediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was
opened, to cut o ff access to the central pens which were already overfull.

  266. They were already overfull because no safe m axim um capacities had been laid down. no atte m p t was
m ade to contra! entry to individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring o f crowd
density.

   267. NVhen the influx from gate C entered pen 3. the layout o f the barriers there afforded less protection
th an it should and a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack o f vigilant m onitoring caused a sluggish reaction am?
response when the crush occurred. T he small size and num ber o f gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So.
in the initial stages, did lack o f leadership.

   268. The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. T h a t occurred because, as
both Club a n d police should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with th e large num bers
d e m an d ed ot it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The O perational O rd e r and police tactics on
the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival o f large n um bers should that occur in a short
period. T hat it m ight so occur was foreseeable a nd it did. The presence o f a n unruly minority who had d runk
too m u ch aggravated the problem . So d id the Club's confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.

                                       T H E FA s C H O I C E O F G R O U N D

   269. The FA were strongly criticised by the Football Supporters' Association, and others for having
im posed the Hillsborough venue on Liverpool tor a second year running. T he Liverpool supporters had to
travel much further to Sheffield than their N ottingha m rivals. The police required tha: if the match was to be at
Hillsborough at all. Liverpool would have to have the west and north side a ccom m odation. The disadvantages
ot that and the disparate numbers ot home supporters o fth e two clubs have already been set out. Liverpool had
had to knuckle und e r to the arrangement in 1988. They resented having it im posed in 1989. To hoid the m atch
at Old TrafTord would have been a perfectly good and acceptable alternative. Indeed, the FA nom inated Oid
Trafford as the venue for the replay should there be a draw at Hillsborough.

   270. M r Kelly, the Fa ' s C hief Executive, sought to give reasons for preferring Hillsborough, but the only one
w hich seemed to have any validity was that the 1988 m atch had been considered a successfully managed event.
He ad m itted that a telephone call from the C h ie f Executive o f the Liverpool Club protesting and putting
Liverpool's case had n o t been mentioned to the Fa committee which finally decided the venue. M r Kelly
frankly conceded that "there was an element o f unfairness- to Liverpool in choosing Hillsborough for a second
tim e. I think the decision was ill-considered. N o do u b t in future the FA will be more sensitive and responsive
to reasonable representations.

  271. However, it was not suggested that the choice o f venue was causative o f this disaster. The only basis on
w hich that could be said would be that, because o f its layout, the Leppings Lane e n d was incapable o f being
successfully policed for this semi-final. I do not believe that to be so.

Choice of Ends by the Police
   272. There was m uch bitterness am ongst Liverpool supporters that they had to make do again for the
second year with the Leppir.gs Lane end. But. cogent as their com plaints were. they am ounted to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. G iven Hillsborough as the venue. I think the police were right to
allocate the sections o f the ground as they did. T he direction o f arrival an d the need for segregation m ade it
sensible and to reverse the i 988 arrangem ents would have m ade for confusion. As with choice o f venue. I do
not consider choice o f ends was causative o f t h e disaster. H ad it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a similar m a n n e r but to N o ttin g h a m supporters.

Police Planning
   273. The Operational O rd er for 1989 left m uch unsaid. A part from the lack o f any provision for late or
congested arrivals, o r any provision tor the avoidance o f overcrowding on the terraces, there was a n u m ber ot
oth er omissions. For example, there was no specific deploym ent o f officers to m an the perimeter gates. The
O rder did not detail the duties o fth e m o u n te d officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties o f S uperintendents (especially M r
Greenwood and M r M arshall) were n ot defined so as to achieve clarity a n d efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was o m itte d from the text.

   274. The 19SS O rder was never substantially review ed save to reduce the n u m b e r o f officers deployed in
shopping areas and to em phasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 19S3 event led to complacency. T h a t some thought the p£ns overfull in 19SS and that the tunnel was
closed off on that occasion did not figure in o r influence the plan for 19S9.

   275. M r Duckenfield w-as p rom oted and p u t in charge o f F Division only 21 days before this semi-final. T he
pre-planning w-as already in progress u n d e r M r M ole who had been in c o m m a n d b o th in 1987 and in 19S8. It
might have been wiser to have left M r M ole in charge o f this operation. On the other hand, it is q uite
understandable that M r Duckenfield should have been expected to take c o m m a n d o f events in his D ivision
from the date o f his prom otion. In view o f his lack o f experience at H illsborough and o f a semi-final m atch,
however, it was im perative that he be fully briefed and th a t he should also b r ie f him self.
   276. He was not inform ed o f the crushing incident in 1981 n o r did he m ake inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrang em ent as between Club and police for m o n ito rin g the Leppines Larse
terraces. He did not visit and tou r the ground before approving the O perational O rder. Although he attended a
match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control o f the gam e to the Superintendents.

Policing on the Day
  277. One o fth e regrettable features o f th e football scene as it has developed is the enorm ous expenditure c f
money, time and effort in employing large n um bers o f police all over the co un try to guard against the s o n o f
disorder and m isbehaviour which have becom e endem ic. Police m anagem ent o f a gam e ot football has becom e
a military operation. The problem s faced and the responses received m u st be disheartening an d m ay have
tended to harden police attitu des to supp orters in general.
  278. It is fair to state th a t over m any years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to tne
public. They have h andled crowd problem s sensitively and successfully at a large n u m b e r o f lootball games
including m ajor matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described and, although there were
other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure o f police control.
   279. In all som e 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I m ust report that for tne ~ -st
part the quality o f th eir evidence was in inverse proportion to th eir rank. T here were many young Constables
who as witnesses were alert, intelligent a nd open. On the day, they and many others strove heroically in gnastly
circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.

   280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in c o m m a n d we re defensive and evasive
witnesses. T heir feelings o f grief a n d sorrow were obvious and genuine. N o d o u b t those feelings were
 intensified by the knowledge that such a d isaster had occurred und er th e ir m anagem ent. But, neither their
handling o f problems on the day n o r th eir account o f it in evidence showed the qualities o f leadership to be
'expected of'their rank.             —        — —        -

   253. M ost surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly an d others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. This was not only u ntruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation against the
supporters which caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, a n d especially those from
Liverpool, accusations o f hooliganism which caused reaction not only nation'.*, ide bu t from Europe too. I can
only assume that M r Duckenfield's lack o f ca n d o u r on this occasion was out o f character. He said his reason for
not telling the tru th was that if the crowd becam e aware o f it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
might im pede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge w hat had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell M r Kelly the tru th did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant C h ie f Constable Jackson was at hand. M r Duckenfield did not disclose the tru th to him
until much later.

  254. The likeliest explanation o f M r D ucken field's co nduct is that he sim ply could not face the enorm ity o f
the decision to open the .sates and all that flowed therefrom . T h a t would explain what he said to Mr Kellv. what
he d id not say to M r Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control o f the
disaster situation. H e froze.

The Police Case at the Inquiry
  285. It is a m atter o f regret that at the hearing, a n d in their submissions, th e South Yorkshire Police were not
prep ared to concede they were in any respect a t fault in w h a t occurred. M r D uckenfield. under pressure o f
cross-examination, apologised for blam ing the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But. that apart, the police
case was to blam e the fans for being late and d run k , a n d to blam e the Club for failing to m o nito r the pens. It was
argued that the fatal crush was not caused by th e influx through gate C b u t was due to barrier 124a being
defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to w hether lessons have been learnt. It would
have been more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

  2S6. The perform ance by the City Council o f its duties in regard to the Safety C e m tic a te was inefficient and
dilatory'- The failure to revise or am end the certificate over the period o f three years preceding this disaster,
despite im p ortant changes in the layout o f the ground, was a serious breach o f duty. There were, as a result, no
fixed capacities for the pens. The certificate took no account o fth e 1981 a n d 19S5 alterations to the ground.

  287. A n u m b e r o f breaches of Green G uide standards were perm itted an d persisted eg the spacing ot the
crush barriers, the w idth o f perim eter gates an d the gradient in the tu n n e l ( J j n ^ as against the Green G u id e

  2SS.      The A dvisory G ro u p lacked a proper structure: its procedure was casual an d unbusinesslike. Its
accountability to the G eneral Purposes Panel was ill-defined. Decisions were taken informally and too m u ch
was left to M r Bownes. In particular, the decision to remove barrier 144 was not referred to the Panel a n d ought
not to have been m ade.

    _S9. It should be recorded tnat in general tr.e Ciub has over the years adopted a responsible and
 conscientious approach to its responsibilities. It retained the services o f D r Easr.vood as c o n s u lts ^ en -i^e e r
 and abided by his advice. For his part. D r Eastwood is skilled and experienced in this field, as a f r e a d v
 indicated, and he sought I hav e no doubt to act e ttin en tly an d professionally in his advice and cractical work.
 T he Club also retained M r Lock who had acquired great experience a n d knowledge o f Hillsborough during his
 poiice sen. ice. A n u m ber o f witnesses described Hillsborough as a v e r y good ground, "one o f th e best in the
 country . Tne police agreed that relations between them and the Club were eood. O ver the last four years, the
 Club had spent some £ 1~ million on ground improvements.

   -90. „^;Te\ ertheless. there a re a nu m b e r ot respects in which failure by the Club contributed to th is disaster.
They were responsible as occupiers and invltors for the layout and structure o f the ground. The Leppings Lane
end was unsatisiactory an d ill-suited to adm it the num bers invited, for reasons already spelt out. The Club was
aware of these p r o o k m s and discussed solving th em in various ways between 1931 and 1986. In the result.
there remained the same nu m ber of tu rn stiles, and the same problem s outside and inside inem T^e plan fo*
this semi-final, involving as it did the loss ot 12 turnstiles for the north stand a n d la re e numbers to be fed in
from Leppings Lane, was one agreed between the Club and the police. The Club knew best what rate o f
adm ission tne turnstiles could manage and ought to have alerted the police to the risks o f the turnstiles beins
swamped.                                                                  '                                            lS

   -91 • _The alterations inside the turnstiles and on the terraces clearly affected capacity, but no specific
allowance was m ade tor them. In that respect, b o th D r Eastwood a n d the Club should have taken a m ore
p o s itiie approach. Either a scheme such as one of those D r Eastwood put fonvard should have been adopted
giving more turnstiles and total separation o f areas or at the very least the capacity o f the new pens and o f th e
terraces a s a whole should have been treated more cautiously. The police view in 19 3 1 that 10.100 was too high
a figure was known to the Club (although D r Eastwood says not to him). Vet, despite that and the sub-division
into pens, the figure remained!                   ~                                                       — --------

  . -,9-- Although the police had assum ed responsibility for monitoring the pens, the Club had a duty to its
' isitors and the Club s officials ought to have alerted the police to the grossly uneven distribution of fans on the
terraces. T he Club operated and read the closed circuit television and the c o m p u te r totaliser. Liaison between
C lub and police o n the day failed to alert the latter to the n u m b e r o f Liverpool supporters still to come T he

the wing pens and over-filling o f pens 3 and 4. Poor signposting outside the turnstiles an d the unhelpful form a:
o f the tickets also led to confusion aggravating the build-up in the turnstile area.

No Fault by the Emergency Services
   296. 1 say at the ou tset o f this chapter th a t no valid criticism can be m ad e o f t h e response by the St John
Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the tire brigade on 15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any
criticism o f them . The only attack on SYMAS cam e from two Liverpool doctors. O ne claimed that am bulances
did not arrive swiftly o r with sufficient equipm ent and that there was a lack o f triage. He was proved to be
wrong in all three respects. U nfortunately he had seen fit to go on television on 1 5 April when he said m ore
lives could have been saved if staff and e q u ipm en t had arrived earlier. A part from being proved wrong in fact
as to the times o f arrival o f am bulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say whether lives
could have been saved. His com m ents on television were irresponsible. T he o th e r d octor com plained ot the
absence o f defibrillators. 1 am satisfied on overwhelming evidence that to a tte m p t to use a defibrillator on the
pitch with people milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk o f injury from the electric
charge,

  297. 1 find th a t all three o f the emergency services nam ed above responded pro m ptly when alerted, that
they brought a p pro priate eq u ipm ent and th a t th e ir personnel operated efficiently.

  298. It would be u n reasonable to expect, at any sports stadium , m edical facilities capable ot dealing with a
m ajo r disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
equipm ent and m edical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is n o t practicable.

   299. W hat is required is a basic level o f provision for first aid, for professional medical attention a n d for
am bulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination w ith the emergency services which will bring
th em to the scene swiftly in w hatever nu m b ers are required. W hat will a m o u n t to an app ropriate basic
provision for the future e ^ th e eq uipm ent in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice.

   300. O n the day', th ere w-as no clear un derstand in g betw een the Club and D r Purcell as to his role. H e
believed he was p rim arily there to attend to the players. The Club regarded him also as the “physician available
to attend at the first a id ro o m i f required”, as laid down in the Safety Certificate.

   301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the police a n d th e emergency services. It is clear
that SYMAS a n d the fire brigade should have been called earlier than they were. However, in view o f the n a tu re
a n d extent o f th e crushing, the tim e when police rescue began an d the pathetically short period for w hich those
unable to breathe cou ld survive, it is im probable th a t quicker recourse to th e emergency services would have
saved more lives.

   302. Finally, there w-as evidence that an advertising bo a rd h a d to be knocked dow n at the north-east c o m e r
o f ihe ground to allow an am bulance onto th e pitch an d that at the top o f the ra m p leading to the pitch the
access for am bulances was inadequate. T here was also evidence th a t the pre-m atch arrangem ent to r
ambulances to use th e two gates from Penistone Road at the north-east end o f the ground as in and out routes
was frustrated by th e presence o f vehicles ju st inside the ground. In the event, n one oi these matters affected
operations. T he hoard in g w-as quickly knocked down. T he difficult access to the ra m p was negotiated and
ambulances used one entrance satisfactorily by backing out when loaded.

out o f radio contact. E\ en when that was rem edied, it was only by using a hand set in the control room This

reached control from the perim eter track at the relevant time. M r G reenw ood's request for the match to be

crushing on terraces in the short term and to improve safety procedures. They do not and cannot meet all the
problems or address all the issues o f post-Hillsborough football. W ider issues such as m em bership schemes,
identity cards, all-seater stadia, super-stadia and long term recom m endations fail to be considered in my Final
Report. So do a n u m b e r o f oth er specific m atters such as a comprehensive review- o f t h e G reen G uide, the
problem o f excessive pre-m atch drinking, fans without tickets and ticket touts. I m ention these matters lest it
be thought I have decided no recom m endations need be m ade concerning them . I have not. But before
deciding what if any recom m end atio n s to make about these and other m atters, m ore evidence and stud y is
required.

  305. Accordingly, the m ain thrust o f these interim recom m endations, as a holding exercise, is to reduce
num bers on the terraces, to increase vigilance and to achieve a proper balance in crowd control between
prevention o f d iso rd e r an d m aintenance o f safety.


Perimeter Fences
  306. It would be im practical and unwise to recom m end works o f construction or radical structural changes
now-, before com pleting the extensive study and consultation which will form st 2 ge two o f this Inquiry. H asty
interim reco m m en d atio n s o f that kind might well prove to be ill-judged after further study and require to be
changed in a m a tte r o f m onths.

   307. In particular. I d o not at this stage make any recom m endation as to removing perim eter fences or
replacing th e m w ith structures o f different design. U nderstandably, there was a wave o f popular feeling against
such fences in the im m e d ia te afterm ath o f Hillsborough. The horrifying spectacle o f people being crushed
against the fencing focussed blam e for the disaster on the fences themselves. T h e re were pleas to dism an tle
th em an d em otive references to the fans being treated like “ caged anim als” . Some clubs removed their fencing
straightaway. It was therefore very tem pting to consider at an early stage m aking a recom m endation th at the
fences should be rem oved. I confess to being so tempted.

  308. Regrettably, only a m o n th after Hillsborough, there were incidents which showed that violence a n d
hooliganism are still liable to erupt at football grounds. On 13 M ay at Selhurst Park, B irm ingharnJTity
supporters inv ad ed the pitch a n d fought with supporters o f the hom e club. Crystal Palace. Five police otticers
and 16 supporters were inju red and required treatm ent at a local hospital. O n the same day at a m atch betw een
Bristol City and Sheffield U nited, spectators spilt onto the pitch and there wa.s fighting on the terraces. At the
Cup Final between Liverpool a n d Everton on 20 May, there was a pitch invasion. albeit a com paratively
benign one.

  309. Even the Football Supporters" Association (FSA) felt it necessary to say in th eir final submission.

       "W ith som e reserv ations, the FSA accept that perimeter fences are necessary tor crowd control.”

   310. Bearing in m in d those matters, and the need to consider furth er expert evidence. 1 have decided th a t it
would be unwise an d p rem atu re for me to make any recom m endations now either to remove or to preserv e or
to alter the structure o f p erim eter fences. I shall make recom m endations about them ;n my Final Report.

   311. For the present. I would emphasise that, although the fencing prevented esca;>e. the real cause ot the
 Hillsborough d isaster was overcrowding and it is against that danger that my in terim recom m endations are
"primarily directed, mist declining to recom m end the removal o f the fences. I do consider that the gates to the
pitch should be kept open whilst the terraces are occupied. This will have. I 'nope, three beneficial effects.
Obviously, an o pen gate is a m ore ready escape route than one which has to be locked. Secondly, the sight o f
open gates w ill be reassuring to spectators on the terraces. Thirdly, the existence o f gaps in the fencing by
reason o f the open gates will concentrate the minds o f police officers or stewards on the track to the need tor
careful m o nitorinz o f those on the terraces.
    312. It will or cou rse he necessary to hav e a police presence sufficient to p r e v e n t pitch invasion for i m p r o p e r
rea sons th ro ug h tn e o p e n gates. However. I a m e n c o u r a g e d to t h i n k that t h i s is n ot an insupera ble p r o b l e m bv
th e tact that, tor e x a m p l e at Antield. L iv e rp o o l' s g ro u nd , there were no gates in the p e r im e te r fencing be fo re it
was taken dow n. T h e r e were instead gaps o r " a cc ess p o in t s " as th e y are calle d in t h e G re en G u i d e ( p a r a g r a p h
215). T h e i r existe nc e d id not. so far as 1 a m aware, pr ev en t the au t h o ri tie s fro m m a in ta in in g order. Also, the
gates were o p e n th r o u g h o u t the replay o f this ill-fated semi-fi nal at O ld T ra ffo rd o n " M a y 19S9.


Reduced N u m b e r s
   313. In the assessment ot figures for capacity-, the criteria in C hapter 16 o f the Green G uide were not at
Hillsborough, a n d rnay not elsewhere, have been applied with sufficient rigour. Therefore, in a d d itio n to
rem inding a n d enjoining local authorities and clubs to make all necessary deductions when assessing the
figure for m a x im u m capacity in accordance with the G reen Guide, I recom m end reducing that figure bv a
further 15% as an interim measure.


Safety Certificate
  314. T he Safety Certificate procedure should, if it is properly adm inistered a n d enforced, go far towards
achieving crowd safety. W hether it succeeds depends upon the vigilance an d com m itm ent o f the local
authority' issuing the Certificate. I do not know w hether the poo r perform ance o f the local a u th o rity at
Hillsborough was typical. Arguments have been put to m e suggesting the need for som e national oversight or
inspection o f local a u th o rity certification procedures. This raises complex issues which I shall want to consider
further at stage two o f the Inquiry. For the present, I m ake recom m endations as to the content o f Safety
Certificates and arrangem ents for issuing, m onitoring, enforcing, reviewing, am ending and renewing them .
                                 C H A P T E R 24 - T H E R E C O M M E N D A T I O N S

   315. The re com m end ation s which follow are the m in im u m necessary to ensure that existing footbail
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence w hich I have heard at Sheffield and oth er
inform ation I have received. They com plem ent the recom m endations which M r Justice Popplewell set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

   316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 19S9/90 season starts. The rest should be
started forthwith a n d com pleted as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
-*■     1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
      should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

      A pen or area is to be deemed ‘‘self-contained" notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
      another pen or area and w hether such gate or gates be open or shut.

★      2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
      Guide (“the Green Guide figure") subject to the following qualifications:-

      (a) in arriving at *ithe Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
          which should reduce the permissible density in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
          in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide;

      (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure", a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
          margin.

★      3. Arrangements should be made:-

      (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
          figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
          ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

      (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
★      4. There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
      responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
      other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. .Any
      variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★      5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
      area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
      sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
      period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
      or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
      below-, and by radio to the control room.



Fences and Gates
        6.     Ail police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
      duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
      crowd densities, to the recognition of signs o f distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
      demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
      different crowd densities. •

 ★     7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
      different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit".



                                                           57
-*■     S. W here there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fu!I> open during the period
      w hen spectators are on the terrace.

-*•     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
      a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relie'e o'ercrowding.
      T he officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
      stewards and police officers in that vicinity. H e should be able to make radio contact with the control room
      either himself or via an officer close at hand.

-*•     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
      are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
      necessary. Agreem ent should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire
      brigade or stew ards. \ \ hoever is to use it should be trained to do so. W hether to use it should be a decision of a
      nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
★        11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
      to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

★        12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
      complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not. the assessment of the
      maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
      reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
        13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
      which should consult the club in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
      ambulance service and the building authority. Such a renew should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
      object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied w ith and to add or
      substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
      recommendations in this report.

        14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
      which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

        15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
      Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


         16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
      amending and renewing Safety Certificates. Such renew should require that there exists or is provided an
      accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and
      effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
      with the local authority's rules.

         17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an A d v is o r y Group consisting
      of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance service-s. of
      the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' club. The Adnsory Group's terms of
      reference should encompass all matters concerned with crow d safety and should require regular visits to the
      ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
      and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
      written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties of each Football Club
★       18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
      inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
      anticipated.


                                                             58
★     19. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
    as to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
    turnstiles within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
    accordingly.

★   ' 20. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area s e r v e d by them is about to be
    reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
    operators for this purpose.

      21.    Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
    concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

★     22. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
    reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
    and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
    area.

★     23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with
    the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
    should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

★    24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
    by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
    admitting spectators to the ground.

      25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
    entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
★     26. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
    should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
    concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

★     27. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
    officers on duty there should alert snch officers to the importance of preventing any overcrow ding and, if any
    is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

★     28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
    any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
    sufficient reserv es to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

★    29. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
    Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding w hether to exercise it.

       30. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television
    monitoring outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
    at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
    in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
      31. There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
    received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
    priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be
    used, where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
    sound-proofing the control room against excessive crow d noise.
      32. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines
    with telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements should be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crow d despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. L se should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should also be given to the use by police officers of a simple code of hand signals to indicate to
    the control room the existence of certain emergencies or requirements.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
*     35. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
    liaison concerning crowd safety at each stadium.

*    36. Before each match at a designated stadium, the police should ensure that the fire service and
    ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of
    spectators expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties
    concerning the control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control
    rooms of each of the emergency services.

*     37. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated stadium of emergency vehicles from all three
    services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility
    within the ground itself.

*     38. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for
    the arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such serv ices are called as to where and why
    they are required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
*     39. There should be at each stadium at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators. The
    club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

      40. There should be at each stadium one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms and the
    equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking professional
    medical advice and should be made a requirement o f any Safety Certificate.

*     41. The club should employ a medical practitioner to be present at each match and available to deal with
    any medical exigency at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be
    present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off and should remain until half an hour after the end of the
    match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in the police control room and he should be immediately
    contactable.

*     42. At least one fully equipped ambulance from the appropriate ambulance authority should be in
    attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

      43. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crow ds are expected should
    be specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a
    requirement of the Safety Certificate.

M r H icks' Evidence
    1. M r and Mrs Hicks’ two daughters died in the disaster. They had arrived early en famille but had tickets
for different sections. The two daughters had standing tickets: they went into pen 3. Mrs Hicks had a seat in the
n o rth stand. M r Hicks took up a standing position in pen 1just below an d to the west o f th e police box at about
2.1 5 pm From there, he had a view of the centre pens. He kept an eye on them as they tilled up since he knew his
daughters to be there.

  2. His evidence was that by 2.50 pm he could see people were in distress. At a b o u t 2.55 pm he and others
called to a senior police officer at the top o f the steps to the control box to draw his attentio n to the crushing. M r
Hicks was only about 10 feet from the officer. He described him as wearing a fiat cap with gold or silver braid
and a light coloured anorak. M r Hicks believed he was the officer who stopped the m atch. M r Greenw ood, who
did stop the m atch, was certainly not wearing a light coloured anorak, as can clearly be seen on the video.

  3. M r Hicks says that he and others shouted several tim es to this officer in a tte m p ts to alert him to the
distress in the pens. There was no reaction although Mr Hicks believes the officer m ust have been in earshot.

   4. T h at officer descended from the steps a n d two cam eram en w hom M r H icks believed were from
television cam e and appeared to direct their cameras towards the pens. A n o th e r senior officer appeared two
steps down from the platform. He was a stocky figure; he also wore a flat cap b u t w ith black braid. M r Hicks
say s that he and two or three others tried several times to capture this officer's atte n tio n w ithout success. Then
M r Hicks says he shouted “For Christ's sake! Can't you see what's going on? We can, a n d you have cam eras’*. The
officer is said to have replied dismissively “Shut your fucking prattle”.

  5. W hen the disaster occurred the two Hicks girls were crushed. Victoria was pu t in an am bulance an d M r
Hicks accom panied her to hospital where she was found to be dead. Sarah died a t the ground.

  6. M r Hicks was an impressive witness and. despite his grievous loss. re m a rk a b ly stoical. He gave his
evidence clearly a n d without rancour. H e was certainly m istaken about M r G re e n w o o d being one o f those on
the steps and it has not been possible to identify either officer from M r Hicks’ descriptions. He may well also
have been imprecise as to timings. Nevertheless. I see no reason to do ub t th a t w hat he described did occur in
relation to two officers. As M r Hicks generously said himself, the dism issive ab u se from the second officer
(although reprehensible) may have been due to his being preoccupied with trying to see w hat was happening at
pens 3 and 4 a ro un d kick-off time.

T h e Goalkeeper and Gate 4
   7. M r Barnbrock. a Liverpool supporter, said he went through the tun nel. H e w ould have liked to have
tu rn e d back w hen he saw how crowded the pens were. He went with his fath er a n d 13 year old b ro th er Stephen
tow-ards the front o f pen 4. He saw the teams com e onto the pitch. C o nd itio ns at th e front were, he said, alright
until about 2 m inutes to 3. T hen the pressure in th e pen increased and he a n d his fath er becam e separated. His
feet cam e off th e ground. He shouted to police officers through the fence to get th e m out and help them . The
police did not react. The Liverpool goalkeeper, Bruce Grobbelaar, spoke to a p olicem an on the track. T he gate
was then opened by a blonde policewoman and about 25 to 30 people went th ro u g h it. They included the
witness's father and his brother Stephen who had a broken arm . A police C on stable shut the gate. It was then
reopened by the same policewoman, the witness -bought, an d he got out.

  S.    M r Eccleston. a male nurse and an impressive witness, was sitting in the n o rth stand. He noticed pens 3
and 4 were full and realised something was wrong when fans started com ing over th e perim eter fence but did
not invade the pitch. He said the Liverpool goalkeeper appeared to notice th is too.

  9.      M r G robbelaar was oat of the country during the Inquiry and w as therefore not called. However, he
m a d e a statem ent which was put in as his evidence. In the course o f it he s a id :-

  “ Kick-off happened and we got into o u r stride pretty quickly - we forced a c o m e r pretty early on an d the ball
  came down to my end - I rolled it out to the full back once and play went on u ntil Peter Beardsley hit the
  crossbar o f the N ottingham Forest goal from a co m e r an d cam e back into piay. I rem em ber just after that
  there were shouts and screams from the crowd just b ehind me. it was different: not the ordinary crowd noise
  and 1 turned around to look. What am azed me first w as the concen tration a n d squash o f fans in the centre
section, the er.c areas still had plenty of spare. I: was cn!y then 1 became conscious that the crowd was
squashing forward and wasn't able to go sice-*a > i and that's when' 1 noticed the fencing alongside them
holding them in. I saw fans being pulled up into the stand above the terraces. I saw fans climbing over into the
empty areas at the side and I saw fans climbing out over the front onto the pitch which was particularly
difficult because o fth e spikes on the top o f the fencing but they were getting out.
   "Play was still going on and 1 was in a terrible position trying to concentrate on piay and having my
attention taken by w hat was happening behind me. The ball came down to our end and Nottingham Forest
won a corner, it was taken an d we cleared our box area and as play was going forward over the centre line I
heard a shout, 'B race - please help' - a desperate shout from a fan squashed up against the fencing to the
right o f my goal as I looked at Leppings Lane terraces. He screamed. 'Please get the fucking gate open - Help,
help’. All the people w ho could speak were pleading for help. There were two policemen near the gate right
alongside the fan who h a d shouted to me an d so I shouted to them. 'G et the gate open'. I was still try ing to
concentrate on play a n d was still having my attention taken by what was happening behind me - there were
lots o f fans on the pitch b e h ind the goal area by them too. I called again to the policemen. 'Open the fucking
gate' and one just tu rn e d away from me and looked back at the crowd but the other went to the gate and
opened it and it was like taking the top o ff a shaken coke bottle - people were everywhere on the play area
a round my goal. Piay was still going on and it cam e down towards me again for the left hand corner. It was
a Nottingham Forest throw-in, away to my left, the ball was out o f play a n d a fan came up to me on the
pitch and said. ‘Bruce, they're killing us'. I said 'W h o 's killing you?', and he said 'They're crushing us-our
fans’. I said ‘Go an d get some help', and then a policeman came on and spoke to this fan. I don't know
who the fan was. an d then he led him off. It was about this tim e I saw a policem an running onto the pitch
from my right across m y box and to the referee who blew up, recovered the ball an d told all players to clear
the pitch."
   10. It is clear from the video that M r G ro b b e la a r’s recollection o f the sequence o f events, even with regard
to the game, is inaccurate in a num b er o f respects. For example, the two N o ttin gh am Forest c o m e r kicks
occurred minutes before Beardsley struck the bar. Further, it seems highly probable from other evidence that
gates 3 and 4 were open continuously well before M r G robbelaar says the fan asked him to get the gate open. It
seems surprising too th a t with all the noise M r G robbelaar would hear the precise words o f an individual fan,
let alone respond twice to them , whilst the game was in progress.
   11. As to M r B a m b ro c k 's account, the evidence o f P C Fiona R ichardson was that she was the only
policewoman on the track in the early stages although others came from the seated area as the incident
developed. PC R ichardson began at gate 1 and, although she did go and help people out through gate 3. she
d id not go to gate 4, a n d did n o t open it twice or even once. The two officers w-ho spoke o f opening gate 4 were
b oth male.
   12. I think M r G ro b b e la a r did become conscious o f distress in the crowd b e h in d him and did speak to a
police officer at som e stage, probably earlier th a n he now thinks. Not to reach that broad conclusion would
involve attributing his whole account to invention or fantasy and I see no grounds for doing so. However, his
detailed account was not tested in cross-exam ination an d its inconsistencies an d errors when com pared with
o ther incontrovertible evidence would m ake it unsafe to derive more than the bro ad conclusion stated above.
T he incident shows how honest witnesses can becom e confused and their evidence flawed when recollecting
events experienced u n d e r tension or emotion.
   13. As to the opening o f gate 4 there was an apparent conflict o f evidence. PC Illingworth said that about
five minutes to 3 he opened it and guided fans emerging through it to gate 5. PC H ooson said that it was he
w ho opened gate 4 ju st before kick-off. I am satisfied from the evidence o f a n u m b e r o f fans that, like gate 3,
gate 4 was opened m ore than once. The probability is. therefore, that whilst PC Illingworth was shepherding
fans to gate 5. gate 4 h a d been closed again until it was re-opened by PC H ooson two or three minutes later.
Oxygen
   14. It was alleged by a doctor that an oxygen cylinder provided to him on the pitch w as empty. D r Phillips, a
Liverpool supporter, had been in pen 3 with his b rother and others. He cam e u n d e r pressure and climbed into
pen 2. W hen the disaster occurred and gate 2 was opened, he went through it. injuring his head as he did so. He
came onto the pitch som etim e after 3.10 pm and started resuscitation procedures. H e was given an oxygen
cylinder. He believes this was from St John A m bulance. It was. he thought, too early to be the fire service. The
cylinder was switched on b u t Dr Phillips sa>s it gave no oxygen since it was empty. There was one oxygen
cylinder on the St Jo h n's ambulance w hich cam e to the scene. M r Wells, the Divisional Superintendent o f St
John, took that cy linder onto the pitch. He said it was effective. In particular, he recalls going to a patient being
treated by D r Phillips a n d says that oxygen was flowing into that patient. Moreover. M r Wells tested the
cylinder afterwards and found it was still h a lf full. It has a capacity that will last for 5 hours 40 m inutes on a
hizh setting.
   1 5. There was evidence from Assistant Chief Fire Officer Hornsby that a M a x a m a n resuscitator h a a taiiec
10 work proper:--'. It w-as delivering an oxygen f:cw appropriate to a "chtic" setting ratfier mar. a lull “acuit
fiow. O n exam ination, it was found that a retaining nut in the control knob had worked loose, possibly cu e to
vibration in transit, and this had affected the flow- o f oxygen. The device had last been tested on 10 April i 9S9.
   16; I accept the evidence o f M r Wells that the St John A m bulance cylinder was charged with oxygen and
w orkine properly. In my view-. D r Phillips may have been mistaken as to the cylinder o f which he com plains
being empty. He agreed he was under great pressure, in an awkward situation; his head was injured a n d he
becam e very angry at what he regarded then as wholly the fault o f the police. He conceded that it the cylinder
was not empty there was a possible alternative - th a t the master tank top valve was shut. It seems unlikely that
he could hav e been referring to the fire service resuscitator as he was clear th a t the bottle he received was a
simple piece o f equ ipm ent not designed to breathe for the patient but merely to supply oxygen.
  17. I conclude th at on a balance o f probabilities the evidence does n ot justify a tinding that an em pty
cylinder was brought to the scene.
Calling the Fire Service
    18. P C Bichard's call to police H eadquarters at 3.13 pm for the fire service to bring hydraulic cutting
e q uipm ent to cut m etal fences (see paragraph 101 supra) was heard by Chief Inspector Edm undson. H e went
into the adjacent operations room to give instructions for the message to be passed to the fire service. There, a
tem porary control room assistant was already speaking to the fire service about a house fire. M r E dm undson
in terrupted the call a n d asked the assistant to tell the fire service that cutting eq uip m en t was w anted at
Hillsborough. There followed a conversation between the assistant a n d Miss D avies at the fire service m the
following terms: -
     Police         C an we have cutting gear for Hillsborough, please - straight away?
     Fire Control   Just a m inute. Right - w hat’s the address?
     Police         Cutting eq uipm ent for Hillsborough football ground - straight away.
     Fire Control   Hillsborough football ground?
     Police         Yes. Hillsborough football ground.
     Fire Control   W h at road is that on? D o you know?
     Police         T here has been a m ajo r accident, all the am bulances are u p there.
     Fire Control   W h at road is it on?
     Police         I have no idea; Hillsborough football ground.
     Fire Control   W hat road is it on? D o you know?
     Police         “Hillsborough football ground - what road is it on?” (this w-as said to someone in Police
                    Force Control) - “Penistone R o a d ” (to Fire Control).
     Fire Control   Penistone Road.
     Police         Penistone Road, OK.
     Fire Control   Penistone Road, just a m inute - w hat’s exactly involved?
     Police         It’s football, a big match, Liverpool v N otts Forest.
     Fire Control   Yes. but why do you w ant us; you said it was an RTA [Road Traffic Accident],
     Police         No. no. no: m ajor incident inside the ground.
     Fire Control   M ajor incident inside - do you know exactly what it is?
     Police         N o. I don’t: they want all the cutting gear.
     Fire Control   For what - do you know ?
     Police         H aneonasec.
  At that poin t C h ie f Inspector E dm u nd so n intervened and spoke for the police. The conversation
concluded:-
     Police         (Male voice) - Hello!


                                                            65
  Fire Ccrr.roi   Hel'.o! Now you wnt some cutting gear - what exactly is it for0

  Police          T here has been a m ajor accident at Hillsborough football ground where the semi-final is:
                  the crowds have forced their way in. they have broken fences and gates down. I don't know
                  exactly what it is but there are people trapped.

  Fire Control    Right! O K - leave it with us.

   T hat conversation took i minute 13 seconds. It was published in a num b er o f newspapers with strong
critical com m ent mostly against the fire service. T he thrust o f the criticism was that valuable time was wasted
by the fire service asking unnecessary questions as to where and why cutting eq uipm ent w as required.

   19. There was a m eeting o f the emergency services in August 1988 to discuss procedure in the event o f a
m ajor disaster at Sheffield W ednesday's ground. It was pointed out and m inuted that "It was imperative that
the Police Control give the exact location o f any fire or incident an d as m uch detail as possible. No senior fire
officer is on duty at the m atch. . . Fire service will attend via Penistone Road or Leppings Lane as directed by
the police.-

   20. The message from PC Bichard co ntained all the necessary inform ation - Leppings Lane end. hydraulic
cutting equipm ent, to cut metal fences. Regrettably, it was not passed on by H eadquarters in those terms. Miss
Davies had rightly been train ed to require a precise location and needed to know the problem which would face
the fire service so that the appropriate response could be made. In fact, there are several football grounds in the
Hillsborough district although clearly Sheffield Wednesday's ground is the principal one. In the result,
although C hief In spector E dm undson clarified, to an extent, the nature o f the problem, the locus which
emerged in the course o f the conversation (Penistone Road) was not that con tained in the original message
from ground control ( / e ‘'Leppings Lane en d .”) W hilst on the face o f the conversation the fire service may seem
to have been slow in the uptake or perhaps pedantic, in my view^ the police ought to have been more specific.
They had the necessary inform ation to be so.

  21. I am satisfied, however, that the delay o f 1 m inute 13 seconds over the call, and even the delay
occasioned by the cutting eq uipm ent going to Penistone Road rather than Lepptngs Lane, did not affect the
outcome. Even h a d those with cutting equ ip m en t gone directly after a briefer ’ph on e call they would not have
arrived at a stage early enough to make cutting the fencing a helpful exercise.

Mr Kenny Dalglish
   22. W hen the Liverpool manager went to the control room an d agreed to make the announ cem ent
broadcast at 3.56 pm , he says in a statem ent th a t he could not get the Tannoy to work. Spectators could see
h im trying to address them an d indicated to h im m anually that nothing could be heard. An officer pressed
buttons on the m achine a n d M r Dalglish says he tried again with similar lack o f success. He was then taken
un der the police box to the room used by the disc jockey to broadcast pre-m atch music. There, the m icrophone
worked and he broadcast his message.

   23. M r Dalglish was not called. There was no other evidence about this incident. I accept it occurred as he
described. W hy the Tannoy could not at that tim e be successfully operated from the police box is, however,
strange and unexplained. Unlike the radio, it had operated satisfactorily from th e police box at the critical
times save that its messages may not always have been heard above the prevailing noise. It had worked at ab ou t
3.30 pm when it called for medical staff. I can see no grounds for criticising the police in regard to this incident
a n d certain it is th a t the b rie f delav in relavine M r D a ld ish 's messaee can have had no sienificant effect.

         CHARGES FOR POLICING FOOTBALL MATCHES IN LONDON



       The Home Secretary and Lord Ferrers have seen your
   submission of 31 July and have agreed the recommendations at
   paragraph 8.  I have informed Mr Moynihan's office over the
   telephone of the Home Secretary's decision, but he has also
   asked for Lord Ferrers to write soothingly to Mr Moynihan
   explaining why "two bites are better than one".  Mr Le Vay has
   kindly agreed to set in hand a draft letter for Lord Ferrers'
   consideration as soon as possible.

We all w a/ked down to the                   g r o und;,    I w a l k e d with Francis and

                                                     I saw no d r unkeness                 violence     or

disorder,          and we    received        no Police D i r e c t i o n or escort.

I remember          there were more             than the usual           number       of    people as k i n g        for

It was        just a mass         of    people    trying        to get     in,     it was     like a free            for

all.         There was      no o r g a n i s a t i o n and      no queues at all.

  le only Police a ct i v i t y            I saw was o f f icers            helping         people     out     of the

crush to climb           in the ground.

I was        in the   crush outs i d e wit h                                      We were       there        for

aImost        h a 1f an hour        t ry i ng to get to a turnstile,

 iv^ptual ly the gate               to the      left of the N o r t h S t a n d t u rnstiles was

(/pined f o r a few seconds an d quite a few people flooded in, including

      and myself.    I have no idea who opened yo r closed the gate. I wai

not a s k e d for my ticket w h i c h              I have         now                   i ,o the club.

We    just went       straight         up to our seats -a                         'no    d i f f i c u l t y finding

that.

The    game was just           starting as we got to our                    seats.          I sat    next      to

We were      seated at        the L e p pings        Lane end of the North Stand and                   could

c learly see what was              h a p pening      in the     terracing.

I immediately          r e a l i s e d something was wrong                in the area behind               the

goals.       It was o ve rc r o w d e d you         could see         people      crushed up a g a i n s t            the

side    fences.        Whilst      the    pen next to          it was      virtually empty.

Police Officers           pushed at        least two      pe^pllT back            into    the    pen as      they

climbed out        over      the   front.        My first impr e s s i o n was            that      it was       a

pitch    invasion but          I q ui ck ly        realised that w i t h all             the    crushing         it

w a s n ’t that.

S h o r t l y after    that    the game       stopped.          I didn't       see any surge           in the

crowd.      People     then star t e d        to     pile out of that area                any way they

could.      I could see         pea pi e be i.ng given             r esus c i tat ion on the          pi t ch area

it became       obvious       people      had been killed.               There were        people      lying

with    their     faces      covered.

I could not        recognise        or describe any of the                  people       I saw dead there.

We    left the     ground f ol lo w i n g        the   loud    5   peaser a n n o u n c e m e n t    but    I d o n ’t

know what       time    it was .                           ^

Outside     the ground         I met

was    very u p s e t ? he said he'd been on the                      pitch giving         resuscitation.

We all     went    back towards           the vehicles         but we        realised      there were            quite

a few of our group missing.

E v e n t u a l l y we got    back to the          cars and        realised' that Francis              and

N i c h o l a s were missing.            We wa i t e d for some          iuyrisiderable time,

We then started m a k i n g          enquiries about               them.      We were      told at         the

gro u n d that     nobody was        in the ground and we were to                        check the

hospitals.         I checked        one and some         others        went     to the other

hospitals.         There      names w ere n ' t      on the        injured      list.

         We a ga i n went          back    to the ground and were a g a i n told there                       was’ no one

         there,       a Police S e r g ea nt          told us to go to a C o m m u n i t y Centra              w h i c h we

         did do,          and give a d e s c ri pt io n of them there at                    later at a Police

         Station.            The officer        told us to         come     back    later which we did do.

         They     sent us back            to the C om mu n i t y Centre.

         This was about              11.30 pm       <2330)     by now I felt we were              being given to

         run ar o u n d and         lost my temper with the o f f icials                     there.

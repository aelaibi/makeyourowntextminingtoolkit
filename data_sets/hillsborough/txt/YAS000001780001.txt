I                  born   on   17.10.35.       I am   a Qualified

Ambulanceman, employed by SYMAS. I am stationed at Batemoor.

I have been employed by SYMAS for 29 years.



I normally work shifts but on Saturday 15th April 1989 I was

off duty at my home.       The first I knew of an incident was

when I noticed on Teletext that reference was made to the

Liverpool match.      I did not take much notice because I am

not really interested in football.


It would be between 1600 and 1610          that I saw a news flash

on the television that indicated that there was some sort of

major incident at Hillsborough.



I avoided using the telephone because I knew they would be
busy so I went up to Batemoor on my motorcycle.         I used the

land line from Batemoor to ring Rotherham control and asked

what was happening.       I spoke to a control assistant.    I was

asked to make my way at once to Hillsborough.         I was joined

at Batemoor by                 .    He was also on his day off,

and together we took an ambulance to Hillsborough.



When we left Batemoor I used the radio whilst                 was

driving.   I used the emergency channel to try and contact

control; radio quality was poor and it was some time before

I got through.       We identified ourselves and headed for

Hillsborough.      It would be about 1630.
6.    We drove to Leppings Lane and were soon engulfed in a crowd

      of people.      Over the radio we heard a call from control to

      go to Herries Road bus station.         It was a general call.   We

      began to make our way towards Herries Road.             It was not
      easy because of the crowds of spectators.         I did not see any
      fighting and did not encounter any trouble with the crowd.

      Eventually we arrived at Herries Road bus garage, and stood

      by there for over half an hour.


7.    Around 1745 we were told to go to the main gate on Penistone

      Road.    We proceeded to the ground as instructed.        We parked

      inside    the     perimeter of the ground.          Several of our

      officers were present in particular Alan Hopkins, Don Page

      and David Jones.


8.    After a while we were required to move bodies from the gym

      to the public morgue.            We were not told when to move the

      bodies because they had not at that time been released.



9.    Between    1830     and   1900     I assisted    in the gym with

      preparation of the removal of bodies            i.e. to prepare the

      equipment for removal, not the actual bodies themselves.



10.   Sometime later David Jones advised                    and I that we

      were free to go if we wished, as they were not at that time

       ready to move the bodies.         We drove back to the Station and

                 then signed off.



        11   .   I did not experience any trouble or violence from the crowd.

                 Usually the radio contact is good with control at Rotherham,

                 but on this day it was poor.


        12   .   All ambulance staff carry an identification card, and on the

                 reverse of that card are instructions about what to do at a

                 major incident.         It really applies to first arrivals at

                 the   scene.    I had    no       need   to   refer   to   the    card   or

                 instructions.

      Subject: POLICE DISCIPLINE ISSUES: Q&A BRIEFING - HILLSBOROUGH

      Date: 23 June 1997 13:12

      Priority: High



      The Home Secretary is due to make an announcement on Hillsborough shortly,

      possibly this Thursday 2 6 /6 or next Monday (we are still awaiting

      confirmation from the business managers). As part of the Q&A briefing he

      wants material on police discipline matters. To put this in context, the PCA

      recommended that tw o senior officers on the day should be subject to

      disciplinary proceedings. The most senior medically retired and action

      against the other was dropped as the proceedings would in effect have been

      by way of joint allegation of neglect of duty. The announcement may be used

      to raise issues of officers escaping disciplinary action by retiring etc. I

      got the impression that SofS was happy to use the occasion to be upbeat

      about changes to disciplinary arrangements currently under consideration.



      A contribution by close tomorrow or earlier(!) if possible would be

      appreciated.

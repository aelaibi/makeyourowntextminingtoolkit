    TAYLOR INQUIRY : ESTIMATE OF COSTS

    I attach a detailed estimate of costs for the Taylor Inquiry.

    Whilst we have put considerable effort into the preparation of
    this estimate, the number of unknown factors is abnormally high
    Things may, and probably will, turn out very differently.

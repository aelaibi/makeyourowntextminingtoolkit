                               4X/\r
          In the course of your giving evidence to Lord Justice Taylor1s Inquiry,
          I understood you to say that you had had your photograph taken with a
          senior police officer by a photographer whom you believe to be from
          Sweden.  I have made enquiries and I believe that the man you spoke to
          was a Mr |            |     \                                         |
          Sweden. One of my officers has spoken to Mr       Iwho says that he was
          not at the game, but he saw you near the gymnasium about 9.30 pm. He
          goes on to say that he photographed you in discussion with a police
          officer.   He is now in possession of that photograph.

          I have not asked him to send the photograph to you or me, but have left
          it with you to decide what you would wish to d o . If you would like me
          to obtain the photograph on your behalf then I am most willing to do so.
          Please, therefore, feel free to contact me. In addition if there is any
          other way I or my officers can help please ask; nothing will be too
          much trouble.

          My deepest sympathies and those of my officers go out to you and yours at
          this sad time.

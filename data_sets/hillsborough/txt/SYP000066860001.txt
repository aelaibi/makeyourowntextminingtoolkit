           I am a schoolboy and I live at the above address with my Aunt and her

           family.

           On Saturday 15th April             1989 I attended the football match between

           Liverpool and Notts Forest at H^fIsborough Football Ground,                         Sheffield.
                                         CAT
           I personally am a Liverpool^fupporter

           I went to tha/football malfch with my Aunt who drove me and my cousin
                va.Ai /t v ^
                             at the same address to Sheffield.   We left Liverpool

           at abou1^10.30
                 u/lo T : am (1030 hrs).                    I had purchased a ticket for £6 from

           Anfield where         I am a season ticket holder,             for the Leppings Ln

           standing area.

           We travelled by car to Sheffield not stopping on route.                       Upon our

           arrival at Sheffield which was at about                    1230 pm (1230 hrs) we were

           dropped off at the junction of Leppings Ln and Penistone Rd.                          On route
                                                                                 PAGE      2

we were subjected to t r a f f i c a n d            road works which did slow down a

j our n e y .

Upon being dropped off in Leppings Ln I knew where                 I was to go because

I had attended the game there last Veap*                  Whilst walking down

Leppings Ln I was not directed oj^escorted by any police however I did
 C^fT    A3TH.C«£-   A t                    •— A i s T ^            ------
see police standing at the j/T z M junction in Leppings Ln which were

barriered off.

On route to the ground I did see a few fans near to a petrol                    station

drinking from cans.              I did not see anyone drunk or anyone fighting or

causing a disorder.               In fact the crowd was    in a good spirit

I arrived at the entrance point to the ground just befoj^'one o'clock

(•1300 hrs).        Upon my arrival       there was no crowds. >/f would say the

area was empty by the turnstiles.                 Ican't remember seeing any mounted

policemen however there was a police               officer on the outside of each

turnstile.         There was no queues to get in because                were very few

people going in.             We were able to     go right to t£»e turnstile to get in.

Upon reaching our turnstile              I was stopped andi searched by a     police

officer.        C A fT      vD^Ai

I will say that I had difficulty in fyfding our entrance point at

first because            I was   looking for entrance B and the entrances are in

the order of ACB when I expected them to be in the order of ABC.                       I in

fact walked down the left hand pavement and used the shop near to the

entrance ground and upon leaving this shop I could not see B entranee.

Upon getting through the turnstile which is the single one in B

section I had handed my ticket in.                (I wished to/retain my ticket).          I

was again confronted by even more policemen, / l think there was two
                       o v r    & o d 7
to each turnstile.  I was again searched tl/L^ t/ime by a police

                 the terraces through the tymnel.       I did not see any police or stewards

                 at the entrance to the tunnel          however there was a policeman on each

                 side of the tunnel aty*he exit on the ground side.               When I passed

                 through I had free passage into Pen 3.

S-O              Upon arrival    in Pen 3 which^/as at about        1.10 pm (1310 hrs)    there was

' W w £ D        only about 20 to 30 peopl^r in the Pen.           In fact some were    lying down

P£^n I           or sitting sunbathi n g .       and my cousin then made my way to a point

2)               about 7A on the diag/am.            I was in fact standing against the

                 separation fence between Pen 2 and Pen 3 directly in front of the

                 first barrier.        I remained in this position throughout the whole of

                 this   incident however     I was    left by my cousin who went to talk to some

                 friends at the back before the match had started.

                 Whilst waiting for the match to start            I thought that the ground was

                 filling up slowly in fact       I noticed that the next Pen (Pen 2)        had

                 hardly anyone    in it.     Whilst waiting for the match to start        I decided

                 that   I would stand on a rail which runs along the bottom of the

                 dividing fence.        I stood on this facing      into Pen 2 twisting my body to

                 the front.     This    lifted me about a foot from the normal        level of the

                 terraces.    I would get up and dovsHf but as the terraces filled I

                 remained up on the fence.

                 crowd was crushed but no more than any jsther game.

                unable to move off the fence.

                I could hear people shouting for the gate leading to the pitch to be

                opened but at this time there was no policeman or steward near it

                Where    I was standing at one/time    I could reach over to the front fence

                and support myself and push away from it so that I could breath and a

                boy who was about      10 yrs who was immediately in front of me could also

                breathe.       There was about two layers of people between me and the

                front fence.       To my left and slightly behind me I heard a man shouting

                "Ow Ow".       After a while he stopped shouting and I looked at him.         He

                was now slumped and unconscious and his face had turned red.           The

                Also at this point the poli ce/on the pitch sade were standing against

                policewoman shouting th>%.       I infact turned and shouted to the crowd

                to push back but nothing happened.

                This    carried on until the game had stopped.        At this point I was

                assisted by two men who were in Pen 2.         They   were on the railings and

                trying to lift me out.       I shouted to another man in Pen 2 to

                lift my feet up which he did.       I then got onto the front fence and

                tried to pull another fella up out of the crowd but I couldn't.              I

                then jumped down off the fence onto the pitch side.           I then walked

                onto the pitch a short way and sat down to recover.           I remained on the

         pitch until about 4.45 pm (1645 hrs) or 5.00 pm (1700 hrs).           I then

         left the ground via the pens into the tunnel and back, out of the

         ground because that is the only way I know.         We even asked a policeman

         how to get out and he replied "I haven't got a eftue ^Ttate. y            _

         At the |fiatch I was wearing dark blue cord trousers and a light sky

         blue shirt.

         Whilst at the match I did not see any drinking or fighting or any

         disturbances   inside the ground nor did I see any criminal offences.

         After the match was stopped I thought that the emergency services were

         slow in reacting to the incident.

         In fact    the fans seemed to have more control      ingiving
                                                                    /

         assistance than the police.              ,           [   /

         Also   I think that the control of the       fans with       pens was not very

         g^od by    virtue of fans being able to go whe^e they wanted so allowing

         too many into the centre p e n s .   The sams^nappened last season.       It

         could have happened again.     I also thfink that Liverpool      should have

         had the other end of the ground by virtue of the fan following.

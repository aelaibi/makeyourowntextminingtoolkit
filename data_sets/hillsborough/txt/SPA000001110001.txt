        the former officers, Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray, including:

        1.1     The decisions in July 1999 of the Stipendiary Magistrate at Leeds Magistrates

                1.1.1   Dismiss the former officers' application to have the prosecution
                        struck out on the grounds that they were an abuse of process; and

                1.1.2   To commit each of the former officers to trial on two charges of
                        manslaughter and one charge of -wilful neglect to perform a public

        1.3    To consider the advice of 19 November 1999 from Mr Mark Shaw of Counsel

               officers' costs.

               b.       A fresh application to the trial judge, Hooper J, to strike out the
                        prosecutions on the grounds that they are an abuse of process

           3     THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - KEY EVENTS FROM 15
                  APRIL 1989

           3.1    15 April 1999: FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and
                  Nottingham Forest Football Club at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield
                  Wednesday's ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped
                  when it was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal
                  had been severely crushed. As a result, 96 people died and over 400 received
                  hospital treatment.

           3.2   17 April 1989: Lord Justice Taylor was appointed

                  "to carry out an inquiry into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football
                  Ground of 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of
                  crowd control and safety at sports events”.

           3.3   17 April 1989: Geoffrey Dear QPM, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police,
                  appointed to carry out independent investigation of the disaster and gather
                  evidence.

           3.4   19 April 1989: West Midlands Police assumed responsibility for the inquiry.

           3.5   HM Coroner opened and adjourned inquests on 95 deaths that had already
                 occurred as a result of the disaster (the death of the last victim to die, Mr Tony
                 Bland, occurring at a later date).

           3.6   4 August 1989: Having head the oral testimony of over 170 witnesses
                 between 15 May and 19 June 1989, Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report was
                 made public. He found that the immediate cause of the gross over-crowding
                 which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off
                 access to the central pens behind the goal (which were already over full)
                 when gate C was opened. He found also a number of contributing factors

including the Club's "confused and inadequate signs and ticketing", police
planning, police operations on the day, "the presence of an unruly minority
who had drunk too much” and interaction of parties responsible for safety
issues. In respect of police operations on the day, Lord Justice Taylor in his
Interim Report, said (at paragraph 278)

"although there were other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the
failure of police control".

Hie then Chief Constable, Peter Wright, referred the questions of
manslaughter, by criminal negligence, to the Director of Public Prosecutions
for a decision as to criminal liability.

15 Aueust 1989: Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that the
matter should be subject of a criminal investigation. Mr Dear, Chief Constable
of West Midlands Police, was invited to undertake this investigation. He was
also asked that if he discovered any matters against the Police (Discipline)
Regulations, he should enquire into them on behalf of South Yorkshire Police.

30 November 1989: Peter W right Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,
offered in conjunction with insurers to open negotiations w ith representatives
of the bereaved to resolve all bona fide civil claims for compensation without
having to await the outcome of legal hearings.

35 December 1989: Agreement reached with representatives of the bereaved
for settlement of civil actions without a decision as to liability.

December 1989: Full criminal and disciplinary investigation formally
commenced.

18 Tanuary 1990: Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report was published.

31 March 1990.1 Mr Dear's report was submitted to Director of Public

6 August 1990: Two leading Counsel provide a joint opinion to the DPP
advising that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecutions.

30 August 1990: Director of Public Prosecutions Allan Green QC, concluded
that there was insufficient evidence upon which a prosecution for
manslaughter, or any other criminal offence, could be brought against any
officer in the South Yorkshire Police, or any other person.

               assistance for 6 officers including Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard

        3.19   November 1991: Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retired on medical
               grounds, having been on sick leave for some time.

        3.20   13 Tanuarv 1992: Police Complaints Authority gave leave not to proceed with
               the discipline charge against Superintendent Murray, as it would be
               inappropriate and unjust to pursue the charge against him alone, in the
               absence of his superior officer. Sometime thereafter. Superintendent Murray
               went on sick leave.

        3.21   26 August 1992'. Superintendent Murray retired on medical grounds.

                of the HFSG. That material related in particular to video evidence of the
                disaster and medical evidence about the time of death of the victims.

        3.26    30 Time 1997: The Home Secretary made an oral statement to the House of
                Commons during the course of which he stated:

                              "Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney
                              General and die Crown Prosecution Service have considered
                              very carefully all the evidence which has been put forward in
                              recent months.

                              The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the
                              material so far presented to her would not justify fresh
                              criminal investigations. The then Attorney General also took
                              the view, again on the material presented to him, that any
                              application to the High Court for a new inquest would not
                              have any realistic prospect of succeeding.

                              Nonetheless, 1 am acutely conscious that the families of those
                              who died at Hillsborough and many others including Hon
                              Members of this House are very concerned that unresolved
                              issues remain. I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure
                              that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not
                              reach a final conclusion without a full and independent
                              examination of the evidence.

                             I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General,
                             the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is
                             in the public interest that there should be an independent
                             scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
                             evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously
                             available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
                             senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose".

        3-27   18 February 1998: Lord. Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report was presented
               to die House of Commons. He concluded:

               3.27.1   None of the evidence he was asked to consider added anything
                        significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Justice
                        Taylor's inquiry or to the inquests;

                3.27.2   There was no basis upon which there should be a further judicial
                         inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's inquiry;

                3.27.3   There was no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court
                         or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the
                         Coroners Act 1988; and

                3.27.4   There was no material which should be put before the Director of
                         Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which m ight
                         cause them to reconsider the decisions they had already taken.

         3.28   18 February 1998: The Home Secretary announced in the House that he, the
                Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered Lord Justice
                Stuart-Smith's report, and said "we have no reason to doubt his conclusions".
                Following publications of the Scrutiny Report Trevor Hicks, the Chairman of
                the HFSG announced that he was disappointed with the Scrutiny's
                conclusions and that the HFSG were considering private prosecutions.

         3.29   27 February 1998: The Authority resolved to authorise the Clerk and
                Treasurer to consider applications for financial assistance from serving and
                retired officers in respect of possible criminal proceedings arising from the
                Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

         3.30   5 March 1998: Application made by Mr Duckenfield for financial assistance

4       THE RESOLUTIONS OF 21 MAY 1999

4.1    On 21 May 1999, the Authority made the resolutions in enclosure 6 on the
       applications for financial assistance received from the former officers. In
       reaching its decision, the Authority received written and oral submissions
       from or on behalf of:

       41.1 HFSG

       4.1.2 Mr Duckenfield

        4.1.3 Mr Murray

        and received written and oral reports from its legal advisors, Garretts, and the
        Chief Constable. The written reports from Garretts are in enclosures 4 and 5,

4.2    In summary, the resolutions were to die following effect:

        4.2.1 To pay the reasonable costs of the former officers in the Leeds criminal
              proceedings up to the conclusion of the committal proceedings,
              subject to certain conditions (see paragraphs 1,2,10 and 11 of the
              resolution.)

        4.2.2 To pay the reasonable costs of the former officers in the judicial review
             of the DPP's decision not to take over and discontinue the criminal
             proceedings ("the DPP judicial review") (see paragraphs 13 and 14 of the
             resolutions).

        4.2.3 To make no decision on the applications to pay

            (a) The former officers costs' of the South Sefton criminal
                        proceedings in the light of the possible award of costs from

                        central funds (paragraphs 4 and. 5 of the resolution).

                   (b) The former officers' costs of the judicial review of the Authority's
                       decision of 5 February 1999 given the award of costs against the
                       private prosecutor (see paragraphs 8 and 9 of the resolutions).

                    (c) The DPF 6 costs in the DPP judicial review that were ordered to be
                        met by the former officers until the amount of such costs are know n

               4.2.4 To defer consideration of the applications to pay the former officers
                     costs in the potential judicial review of the Chief Clerk of South Sefton
                     Magistrates Court until the Clerk's decision (i.e. whether central funds
                     would meet the former officers costs) is known-

        4.3   Following the decision of the Chief Clerk of the South Sefton Magistrates
              Court to meet the former officers costs out of central funds, the potential
              judicial review referred to in paragraph 4.2.4 above has been averted.

        4.4   The former officers solicitors are negotiating the amount of costs to be
              paid out of central funds, but have indicated that they may ask the
              Authority to meet the difference between the costs claimed and the
              amount paid. No information has been received from the former
              officers on the outcome of their negotiations w ith the Chief Clerk of the South
              Sefton Magistrates Court, nor the current position on the DPP's costs nor the
              claim for costs against the private prosecutor,

        4.5   The conditions referred to in paragraph 4.2.1 have been agreed in principle
              and are contained in die draft letters in enclosure 7. Finalisation of the
              conditions has been deferred as a result of the tax issue which was mentioned
               to the members at the meeting of 10 September 1999 (see the report of the
              Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable in enclosure 9.

        4.6   Further information on the level of costs claimed by the former officers
              pursuant to the resolutions referred to in paragraphs 4.2.1 and A.7. 2 above are
              detailed in section 6 below.

 THE PRESENT POSITION AND THE OPTIONS NOW BEFORE THE
 AUTHORITY

 The committal proceedings against the former officers commenced in the
 Leeds Magistrates Court on 5 July 1999. As a preliminary matter, the
 Stipendiary Magistrate was asked to rule on an application by the former
 officers to strike out the prosecutions as an abuse of process. His judgment
 was delivered on 15 July 1999 (a copy is in enclosure 8)- He concluded that
 the proceedings should not be struck out because:

 5.1.1   It was not oppressive to prosecute the forma: officers, despite the
         DPP's decision not to do so.

 5.1.2   Although there was delay in bringing the prosecution, the prejudice
         caused by the delay was not so strong as to render a fair trial
         impossible.

 5.1.3   There was no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights
         which entitle a Defendant to a fair and public hearing within a
         reasonable time.

 5.1.4   The publicity surrounding the trial was not so great as to render a fair
         trial impossible.

 5.1.5   There was no basis to criticise the prosecutor, Ann Adlington, for lack
         of objectivity or bias.

 5.1.6   The cumulative effects of these matters was also insufficient to render
         a fair trial impossible.

On 20 July 1997, the Stipendiary Magistrate held that there was sufficient
 evidence to commit the Defendants for trial on all charges. This was not a
finding of guilt. It is simply that he was satisfied that there was sufficient
 evidence on which a reasonable jury could (not would) find the former
officers guilty. No written judgment was handed down by the Stipendiary
Magistrate. He simply said, after listening to the evidence, that he had
decided that there was a case to go forward to the Crown C ourt

On 3 September 1999, Hooper J, the trial judge, made certain directions for the
further conduct of the criminal proceedings. We understand that he has
ordered among other things:




                                               anvnfts . m o i          6f •'91 (M l 66
               5.3.1 That there be a preliminary hearing, listed for 20 December for 2 or 3
                     days, to consider the admissibility of the evidence given by the former
                      officers to the Taylor Inquiry;

               5.3.2 There be a hearing on 4 January 2000, estimated to last 5 days, of a
                     further application by the former officers to stay the proceedings on the
                     grounds that they are an abuse of process; and

               53.3 That the trial of the action be listed for 6 June 2000, with a time estimate
                     of 6 - 7 weeks.

              Preliminary hearing on admissibility of evidence

        5.4   Bolh the former officers gave evidence to the Taylor Inquiry. It is to be
              contended that this evidence should not be admissible at the criminal trial.
              The ground is that neither of the former officers was given the statutory
              warning of their right to silence prior to giving evidence at the Taylor Inquiry.
              It is understood that Counsel at the Taylor Inquiry, Mr Collins QC (now
              Collins J) and Mr Bill Woodward QC have both been interviewed and confirm
              that the statutory warnings were not given. We further understand that the
              lawyers for the former officers consider this matter of crucial importance and
              that this will be the first occasion on which the point has been argued.

              If the application is successful, it is said that it may shorten the trial and, more
              importantly, that it may improve the merits of the Defence.

        5.5   The trial is likely to be shortened because:

              5.5.1 H ie evidence of the former officers to the Taylor Inquiry will not be read
                    out to the jury; and

              5.5.2 The prosecution will not be able to cross-examine the former officers on
                    their evidence to the Taylor Inquiry in order to highlight any differences
                    between the testimony they give at trial, the inquests and the inquiry.

        5.6    We understand that the trial may be shortened by 2 days, so the saving in
               time is not significant, and the solicitors for the officers have indicated that
               they would not wish the Authority to focus on this point.

        5.7    It is considered by their advisers that the merits of the former officers'
               Defence will be improved because there is less material on which they may be

 cross-examined and because die evidence of the former officers to the Taylor
 Inquiry, which was not helpful, will not be available to die jury.

 The further application to stay the proceedings on the grounds of abuse of
 process

The former officers will make a fresh application to stay proceedings. The
lawyers for the former officers believe that it would have been a brave step for
a Stipendiary magistrate to have stayed such a high profile case. They feel that
a High Court Judge will be willing to take a more robust view - see Walker
Morris's letter of 12 November 1999, a copy of which is enclosure 13.

The Authority has been provided with the advice of Mr William Clegg QC,
Leading Counsel for Mr Duckenfield, on the merits of a fresh application to
stay the proceedings, and on the merits generally (in enclosure 11). This advice
appears to have been provided following our suggestion that the members of
the Authority would want to see clear reasons why it should meet the costs of a
fresh application.

Mr Clegg*s view is that the merits of the application are "evenly balanced".

It is natural that the former officers and their lawyers would want to take every
opportunity available to stop the prosecution. If the application succeeds, it
will obviate the need for further funding but this benefit should be considered
in the light of the possibility of an appeal by the prosecution, which could lead
to the trial being re-instated.

Further information on the costs of and incidental to these applications is dealt
with in section 6. It should be noted that the information on costs do not detail
the likely costs in the event of an appeaL


COSTS

 On 10 September 1999, the Clerk and Treasurer and Chief Constable reported
 to the Authority on, among other things, the costs of the former officers
 solicitors. A copy of that report is in enclosure 9.

 Following that meeting, Garretts wrote to the solicitors for each of the former
 officers in terms of the copy letters of 17 September 1999 in enclosure 10.
 These letters made offers to the solicitors in respect of the costs they had
 incurred as follows:

           62.1    W inckworth Sherwood - for Mr Duckenfield
                   Winckworth Sherwood sought a total of £89,833.33 plus £15,7959 VAT for the
                   proceedings to 5 February 1999. The A u th ority offered to pay £84,633.33 plus
                   VAT. The proposed deductions reflected a reduction of 10% of the Counsel's
                   fees claimed. A response from Winckworth Sherwood is awaited.

           6,2.2   W alker Morris - for Mr Murray
                   Walker Morris sought a total of £146,905.50 plus £25,774-22 VAT. The
                   Authority offered to pay £120,975 and VAT thereon. The deduction of
                   £25,930.50 reflected a reduction £22,13250 from Walker Morris's fees and a
                   10% reduction in Counsel's fees. Walker Morris's counter proposal is that the
                   Authority pay £130,000, being Walker Morris's fees of £90,000, Mr Myserson's
                   fees of £10,000 (the Authority had offered £9,500), and Mr Harrison QCs fees
                   of £30,000. With regard to Walker Morris's fees, the view of the costs
                   draftsman was that the range of costs to be offered to Walker M oms should
                   be between £81,475 and £88,134.38 plus VAT. The initial proposal to Walker
                   Morris was at the bottom of the range proposed by the costs draftsman.
                   Walker Morris's counter proposal is only £1,863.72 above the range suggested
                   by the costs draftsman. We have met with Walker Morris to discuss their bill
                   and, in the light of their comments, would recommend acceptance of the
                   proposal, which represents a total deduction of £16,905.50 (exclusive of VAT)
                   on their original claim.

           6.2.3   Garretts are awaiting a detailed breakdown from Winckworth Sherwood of
                   their further costs to be met by the Authority pursuant to the resolution of 21
                   May 1999, namely, the criminal proceedings from 6 February 1999 to the end
                   of the committal proceedings on 20 July 1999 (for which they claim
                   £162,454.29 and £28,429.19 VAT, being a total of £190,883.79) and the costs of
                   the DPP judicial review (for which they claim £16,050 plus £2808.75 VAT,
                   being a total of £18,858.75). Winckworth Sherwood's claim for die criminal
                   proceedings to 20 July 1999 exceeds the maximum of £176,250 inclusive of
                   VAT prescribed in the draft letter in enclosure 7.

           6.2.4   Walker Morris have submitted detailed bills for the balance of the criminal

         6.3   Estimates for the costs of the hearings on 20 December 1999 and 4 Tanuary
               2000


               6.3.1    Winckworth Sherwood - for Mr DuckenfMd
                        [figures awaited]


                6.3.2   Walker Morris - for Mr Munrav

                        63.2.1 Walker Morris have estimated that their costs since the
                               committal up to but excluding the hearing on 20 December
                               1999 will be £27,500. Of this amount, £20,000 is estimated to
                               relate to the hearing and £7500 is for general work in
                               connection with the trial due to commence in June 2000.
                               Walker Morris have not broken down their estimate of
                               £20,000 between the hearings set for 20 December 1999 and 4
                               January 2000, but they have said that the bulk of the work is
                               connection with the 20 December hearing. We would suggest
                               a fair breakdown is £16,000 for 20 December and £4,000 for 4
                               January 1999.

                        6.3.2.2 Walker Morris's costs on the hearings themselves are
                                estimated at £2,000 per day. This appears to be based on
                                £125 per hour for 2 fee earners for 8 hours each day (to
                                include preparation, time in court and tune following court).
                                On this basis, the in court time for Walker Morris would be
                                £6,000 for the 20 December hearing and. £10,000 for the 4
                                January hearing.

                        63.2.3 Therefore, it seems that Walker M onis's fees for the 20
                               December hearing are estimated to be in the order of £22,000,
                               Their fees for the 4 January hearing are estimated to be
                               £14,000.

                        6.3.Z4 Counsel's fees for the hearings are somewhat unclear. We
                               understand that Mr Harrison QC will be available to appear
                               in both cases, and has suggested a brief fee of £15,000.
                               However, we do not know how this figure will be split

                                 between the two hearings. We guesstimate £10,000 for the
                                 hearing commencing 20 December and £5,000 for the hearing
                                 commencing 4 January. Daily refreshers of £1,500 are
                                 estimated. Incidentally, Mr Harrison's fees for the committal
                                 hearing were a brief of £12,500 plus refreshers of £1,250.

                          6.3.4.5 The position of Junior Counsel, Mr Myerson, is not clear. We
                                 understand that he will not be available for the hearing
                                 commencing on 20 December 1999 but will be available on 4
                                 January 2000. It is suggested that Junior Counsel's fee should
                                 be half of those for Leading Counsel

                         6.3.4.6 Therefore, a fair estimate for Counsel's fees for the hearings
                                 would appear to be as follows:

                          20 December 1999 (3 days)
                          Harrison QC brief                                    £10,000
                          Refreshers (2 days)                                   £3,000
                                                                               £13,000

                          4 January 2000 (5 days)
                          Harrison QC brief                                  £5,000
                          Refreshers (4 days)                                £6,000
                          Myerson brief                                      £2,500
                          Refreshers (4 days)                                £3.000
                                                                             £16.500


          6.4   Estimates to trial

                Winckworth Sherwood have estimated costs of £500,000 plus VAT up to and
                including the trial of this action. This estimate appears to include the costs
                of and incidental to the hearings on 20 December and 4 January. In our
                view, this estimate is low for a 6 or 7 week hearing and all the preparation
                that will be necessary. We think a more realistic figure is in the order of £1
                million.

                We have not received an estimate for Walker Morris but would think that
                their figures would be similar.

        7           TAXATION

        7.1         On 27 September 1999, Garretts wrote to Inland Revenue to seek clarification
                    of the taxation status of any financial assistance given to the former officers
                     (see enclosure 14). The Inland Revenue's response of 19 October 1999
                    states their view that the financial assistance:

                    7.1.1      Is taxable as an emolument. This means that the financial assistance
                               will attract income tax at 40%, of which 23% should be deducted at
                               source by the Authority under PAYE. This leaves the former officers
                               to meet the balance of 17%, and to pay to their solicitors the 23%
                               deducted by the Authority. The Authority will also need to meet
                               national insurance contributions. Or,

                    7.1.2      Is taxable as a benefit paid -under an unapproved retirement benefit
                               scheme (which will attract tax at 40%, but arguably not national
                               insurance contributions).

        7.2      If Inland Revenue is correct, it means that, in order for the officers to receive
                sums net of tax which will be sufficient to meet their legal costs, the Authority
                would need to pay or provide an additional 87% over and above the costs
                claimed.

        7.3     On 18 November 1999, William Massey QC advised the Authority in
                consultation on the tax position. Counsel confirmed Garretts view that the
                financial assistance was not taxable either as an emolument nor as a retirement
                benefit Counsel's written advice on these matters is awaited.

        7.4     In the light of Counsel's advice, it is proposed that Garretts should write to
                Inland Revenue enclosing a copy of Counsel's opinion and asking W and
                Revenue to reconsider their position in the light of Counsel's clear and firm
                view. Inland Revenue will also be informed that payments have been made to
                the officers on account of costs incurred to date but that, in the light of
                Counsel's view, it is not proposed to deduct tax from the payments, nor meet
                National Insurance contributions. It is understood that the Authority will also
                pursue its Home Office contacts to urge Inland Revenue to reconsider the
                matter urgently in the light of Counsel's advice.

          7.5   If Inland Revenue agree the position, the issue will be resolved to the
                satisfaction of the Authority, and the former officers.

          7.6   If Inland Revenue disagree, the onus will be on Inland Revenue to challenge
                the position before the Tax Commissioner. An early hearing could be obtained,
                as Inland Revenue recognise that fee issue is o£ "major public importance".
                However, even if the Commissioners were to decide the case in early
                2000, it remains possible that an appeal will be brought. It is unlikely that the
                appeal will be resolved until after the trial of the former officers.

          7.7   Counsel also confirmed that, were the former officers till in office, or had left
                office within 6 years of the payment of costs on their behalf by the Authority,
                the costs bome by the officers would be deductible Le. the net effect being that
                the assistance is not taxable. This is the consequence of sections 201AA Income
                and Corporation Taxes Act 1998 and section 92 Finance Act 1995.

                Arising out of this issue is the question of whether the Authority has power to
                pay or provide for tax and National Insurance contributions to enable tiie
                officers to receive sufficient funds net of tax to meet their legal costs. A written
                opinion has been obtained from Mr Mark Shaw (in enclosure 15), who was
                Junior Counsel for the Authority in the recent judicial review hearings. He has
                advised that the Authority does have power to meet the incidence of taxation.
                He has further advised that the Authority needs to consider the possible effect
                of income tax and national insurance contributions on any resolutions it has
                made or may make to provide financial assistance and to pass resolutions
                accordingly.


          8     vat

          8.1   Mr Massey QC was also asked to advise on the matter of VAT,

          8.2    Counsel advised that the Authority will not be able to recover the VAT on the
                 costs already incurred by the officers because the legal service has not been
                 provided to the Authority, but to the officers, However, Counsel advised that
                 if the Authority were jointly to instruct each of the firms of solicitors for the
                 further conduct of the proceedings, the Authority could recover VAT
                 provided the purpose of the Authority jointly instructing the solicitors was
                 not simply to avoid VAT but so that it could have a real input into the




s r o’d                                                         3 M )S .UIO I             IS:91 IXOW)66 . ’AO
                conduct of the Defences and so that it could ensure that the fonner officers
                got the best possible Defence that was available to them.

         8.3    Counsel also advised that the reason it is necessary for the officers and the
                Authority to be jointly the clients of each firm of solicitors is to minimise the
                possibility that, if the Defence is successful, the officers costs will not be met
                by central office. It will be recalled that the case of re Miller [1983] All ER186
                decided that where the arrangements between a Defendant and his solicitors
                is such that the Defendant will in no circumstances be liable to meet the costs
                of defending the criminal proceedings, the Defendant has not incurred costs
                and is not entitled to have the costs met by central funds. A joint retainer has
                the effect of preserving the former officers' liability to meet costs.

         8.4    The Authority will be entitled to recover the VAT on the whole of the amount
                of costs paid by it, not simply a pro-rata share of the costs.

         8.5   The arrangements between the Authority, each of the former officers and
               their respective solicitors needs to be carefully documented. This is to limit
               the A uthority s costs to those which are incurred w ith its authority and
               within any constraints it sets. This should enable the officers to be solely
               responsible to the solicitors for any costs which the Authority is not willing to
               meet e.g. if the Authority were to decline to provide financial assistance for
               either or both of the hearings on 20 December and 4 January.


        9      THE MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR ASSISTANCE

        Section 8 of the Garretts report of 13 May 1999 detailed the factors to be considered
        by the Authority when deciding upon applications for assistance. Those
        considerations remain relevant and need to be considered afresh, albeit in the light of
        the fact that, having considered those matters the Authority decided on 21 May that
        it was appropriate to provide financial assistance to the former officers.

        The following further matters need to be considered by the Authority.

        9.1    Whether there have been any material developments in relating to those
               factors
               We are not aware of any such developments, saive for the taxation issue.

        9.2    The possible incidence of taxation
               The Authority has received firm advice that the payment to the officers will

      not be subject to taxation. However, the matter remains to be determined. If
      the outcome is that any financial assistance will be taxable, the consequences
      will be either

      9.2.1            The officers will have to meet tax at 40% of the amount of the
                       costs which were authorised by the Authority of 21 May 1998
                       and any further costs that the Authority agrees to meet and
                       the Authority will have to meet national insurance
                       contributions on the costs; or

      9.2.2            The Authority would need to resolve that any financial
                       assistance it provides or has provided shall be net of taxation.
                       This will result in the Authority having to provide further
                       financial assistance equal to 87% of the former officers'
                        cost in order to pay or provide for the incidence of
                       taxation,

9.3   The purpose and merits of the application on 20 December 1999

      This application to exclude the evidence given by the former officers to the
      Taylor Inquiry is being made on the advice of Leading Counsel for each of the
      former officers. Its primary purpose will be to improve the merits of the
      former officers' Defence should the matter proceed to trial. An ancillary
      benefit is that the length of the trial may be shortened, But this benefit is
      mitigated by the fact that any reduction is unlikely to be materially different
      from the length of the application. The views of Leading Counsel for the
      former officers is a very powerful factor weighing in favour of assistance.
      However, Defendants to proceedings must always weigh in the balance the
      costs of interim applications, the merits of the application and the benefit that
      will follow. It should be recognised that a Defendant with limited resources •
      may have to decide to forego an application which a Defendant with
      unlimited resources may seek to pursue.

9.4   The purpose and merits of the application on 4 Tanuarv 2000

      Once again, Leading Counsel for each of title former officers has advised that
      this application be made. It will be the second time that a court considers the
      question of abuse of process. It is said on behalf of the former officers that the
      prospects of this application succeeding are better than before the Stipendiary

Magistrate because the Stipendiary Magistrate erred in law (see the written
advice of Mr Clegg QC in enclosure 11) and because a trial judge is likely to
take a more robust view. After assessing these factors, Mr Clegg QC
considers the merits to be evenly balanced. We understand that one fresh
factor which is being considered by the solicitors for the former officers is that
the delay in the prosecution has prejudiced the former officers' prospects of
obtaining funding from the Authority. This is on the grounds that, had the
prosecutions been brought within time to enable the defence costs to be met
within 6 years of the end of the tax year in which the former officers retired#
any financial assistance would not be liable to taxation in the light of the
provision of sections 201AA Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 and
Section 92 Finance Act 1995. The fact that the statutory provisions do not
apply to the former officers by reason of the delay means that the effect of the
possible increase in the costs of providing financial assistance is a factor
which must be weighed in the balance.

Costs of the applications

These have been dealt with in section 7 above. Additionally, the Secretary
and Treasurer to the Authority has the following observations:

"Financial Implications

The defence costs have so far been met out of reserves, along with legal costs
of the Police Authority and the Chief Constable. Estimated costs to the end of
the committal hearings in July were £0.95m, as reported to the Authority in
September. This figure will be reduced when the final results of the costs
draftsman's work axe available; it is also subject to resolution of the VAT
position.

The costs of supporting the defence up to and including the trial itself were
always going to be on a more substantial scale. In considering further
funding, therefore, the Authority needs to consider afresh the potential
impact on the Authority's available finances, options for meeting the cost, and
implications for the rest of the policing budget

The further issue of whether the payments are taxable adds additional
complications. If the Revenue's initial ruling is not reversed, it potentially
adds around 87% to the past payments. A 'w orst' scenario would have the




                                              aavnfts .mo i             CS--9I r\*0W) 66
same impact on future costs, although Counsel's advice received in the last
week suggests that it should be possible to structure any future support in
such a way as to avoid tax. While at the same time leaving the Authority in
the position of being able to recover costs from central funds in the event of
acquittal. However, the Inland Revenue having taken a firm position on the
matter so far, we cannot rule out the possibility of challenge to a future
arrangement, and the potential impact of that m ust be taken into account in
taking the decision to support.

Given the strength of Counsel's advice on the tax matter, the Authority hopes
to use aU available channels to seek confirmation that {here are no tax
implications, so that when the Authority considers funding for the main trial,
it can do so in full knowledge of the financial implications. However, the two
former officers face hearings in December and January for which they have
requested funding, and if the Authority were to decide not to make support
available, it would be necessary for the officers to seek Legal Aid. The
original intention was to consider these two hearings along with funding of
the main trial, and consideration has been postponed as long as possible in
the hope that the tax issue would disappear.

Therefore, the Authority is now asked to consider funding for the December
1999 and January 2000 hearings alone. To recap, die reasons for
recommending this approach are:

(i)     the potential uncertainties due to the tax issue are limited.

(ii)    it enables the officers to know where they stand in the short term.

(iii)   it provides time to resolve the tax issue permanently.

Section 6 of the report summarises the costs.

It is considered that this can be accommodated within the existing budget,
either from savings arising from the costs draftsman's work, or from
efficiency savings already identified in the vehicles budget."

         9.7   The views of the Q iief Constable

               We have been provided with a draft of the Chief Constable's comments,
               which are set out below. The Chief Constable will be present at the meeting
               to amplify these comments.

               "I do not propose to re-state all of the points that I have made in connection
               with previous applications for funding by Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.
               They axe well documented in papers appended to this report. However, I
               will summarise the key elements:

               1.      The Hillsborough Stadium Disaster occurred on 15 April 1989, over
                        10 years ago. Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield was in
                        charge of the policing operation. He was assisted by Superintendent
                        Bernard Murray.

               2.      A crush in the crowd led to the deaths of 96 people and injury to
                       many others.

               3.      Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry analysed the causes of the disaster and
                        apportioned blame.

               4.      In 1990 the Director of Public Prosecutions determined not to
                        prosecute any person for any alleged offence connected with the
                        disaster.

               5.      The jury at the Coroners' Inquest returned verdicts of accidental
                       death.

               6.      In February 1998, Lord Justice Stewart Smith, an appeal court judge,
                        published the results of his scrutiny into claims that fresh and
                        relevant evidence had been uncovered. He found there was no
                        relevant new evidence and found no fault in the decision by the
                        Director of Public Prosecutions in 1990 that there should be no
                        prosecution.

               7.      In mid 1998 the solicitor to die Hillsborough Family Support Group,
                       Ms Anne Adlington, began a private prosecution against Mr




m   -d                                                      MVfl&S A l l 3 I         £ S : 9 I I XOK) 6 6 . A(
V




                     Duckenfield and Mr Murray lor alleged offences of manslaughter
                    and other matters.

           8.       The South Yorkshire Police Authority resolved to meet the costs of
                    legal advice to the two former officers up to and including the
                    committal hearing. My advice to the authority was that Mr
                    Duckenfield and Mr Murray acted in good faith on the day of the
                    disaster. They were performing their duty as best they could.
                    Officers should feel confident that they will receive die backing of
                    their police authority if they face such a challenge in the courts. This
                    particular case is all the more acute because so much time has passed
                    and because this is a private prosecution.

            9.       The Authority have already determined to exercise their discretion in
                     support of the officers founded on the above facts. There have been
                     no changes to this position since ihe last exercise of this discretion.

           The prosecution could be brought to a dose if the Crown Court Judge accepts
           the defence's arguments in relation to the inadmissibility of evidence and the
           abuse of ihe process of the court If that is the case then a lengthy and
           expensive Crown Court trial will not occur.

           It is my professional opinion that a refusal to grant this request would
           weaken the confidence of officers in performing their daily difficult and
           dangerous tasks on behalf of the public of South Yorkshire.

           Chief Constable"

    10     THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THE AUTHORITY

    10.1   To reject funding for either or both of the applications.

    10.2   Defer consideration of the application until after the conclusion of the
           criminal proceedings on the grounds that only then can the Authority know
           the circumstances of the prosecution cases against Messrs Duckenfield and
           Murray, and the likely cost of granting financial assistance. However, the
           previous decision to provide financial assistance would suggest it that this is
           not a realistic option.

     LORD JUSTICE LAWS

15                   These are linked applications for judicial review which require the court
     to revisit the terrible disaster which took place at the Hillsborough Football Ground at
     Sheffield on -15 April 1989. In w'hat I will call the first case the applicants Mr
18   Duckenfield and Mr Murray (to whom I will refer as “D” and “M”), who are retired
     police officers, seek leave to move for judicial review of the decision of the Director
     of Public Prosecutions (“the DPP”) to refuse to take over and discontinue private
21   prosecutions which have been instituted against them by Ann Adlington (“AA”) on
     behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“the HFSG”). The decision was
     communicated by letter of 18 December 1998. On 15 March 1999 Latham J adjourned-
24   the leave application to 22 March 1999 and directed that the parties should then be
     ready to proceed with the substantive application if leave were granted. On 22 March
     this court granted leave and proceeded at once to hear the inter partes application. In
27   the second case the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire (“the CCSY”) seeks to
     challenge a decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority (“the SYPA”) made on 5
     February 1999 to the effect that it lacked the legal power to fund the defences of D
30   and M to the private prosecutions brought by AA, or to fund their prospective judicial
     review' applications against the DPP. On 12 February 1999 Latham J granted leave to
     the CCSY, joined AA as second respondent, abridged time and ordered expedition. On
33   24 March 1999 this court (having reserved judgment in the first case the previous day)
     granted leave to D and M to challenge the same decision and, again, proceeded at once
     to hear the inter partes application. We now deliver our judgments in both cases.
36
                    I will first set out the facts material to the first case, which also form the
     necessary background to the second. I will later describe the further facts which are
39   specifically relevant to the second case.

                 The football match at Hillsborough on Saturday 15 April 1989 was the
42   FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football
     Club. In the events which happened 96 people lost their lives. The Divisional
     Commander in charge of police operations at the match was D, then holding the rank
45   of Chief Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force. The second applicant,

                                                                 Ex Parte S o u th Yorkshire Police Authority



      then Superintendent Murray, held the position of Sub-Divisional Commander and was
      also on duty at the match.
  3
                     On 17 April 1989 Taylor LJ, as he then was, was appointed by the
       government to conduct a public inquiry into the disaster. He heard the oral testimony
  6   of 174 witnesses between 15 May and 29 June 1989, and presented an interim report
       on 4 August 1989. He found that the immediate cause of the gross overcrowding
       which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off access
  9   to the central pens behind the goal (which were already overfull) when Gate C was
       opened. He found also a number of contributing factors including the condition of the
       ground, police planning, police operations on the day, and the interaction of parties
 12   responsible for safety issues. Lord Taylor’s final report was delivered on 18 January
       1990 and included a number of recommendations relating to crowd control and safety
       at sporting events.

                     Meanwhile, immediately after the disaster, the West Midlands Police
       had been appointed to conduct a review of the policing operations of the South
 18   Yorkshire Police. In March 1990 the. West Midlands Police reported to the DPP. After
       taking the opinion of two experienced leading counsel the DPP announced on 30
       August 1990 that in his view there was insufficient evidence to justify any prosecution
 21   for a criminal offence, relating to the disaster, against any member of the South
       Yorkshire Police Force. Then from November 1990 to March 1991 HM Coroner for
       South Yorkshire conducted an inquest into the deaths in the course of v/hich 230
 24    witnesses gave evidence. On 28 March 1991 the Coroner’s jury returned verdicts of
       accidental death.

 27                 Disciplinary proceedings for neglect of duty were instituted against D
      and M by the Police Complaints Authority (“the PCA”). But D retired from the Force
      on 10 November 1991 on medical grounds, and so the proceedings against him fell
      away. On 13 January 1992 the PCA decided not to proceed with the case against M.
      On 27 August 1992 he too retired on medical grounds. Then on 5 November 1993 the
      Divisional Court dismissed an application for judicial review brought by family
 33   members of those who had died, refusing orders of certiorari to quash the inquest
      verdict and to require a fresh inquest to be convened.

 36                   On 5 December 1996 a documentary programme called “Hillsborough”
       was broadcast on ITV. The programme suggested that fresh evidence about the
       disaster had come to light. The allegations made in the broadcast were investigated by
 39   the Crown Prosecution Service between March and May 1997. At length on 30 June
       1997          the Home Secretary announced in Parliament that an independent scrutiny would
       be undertaken by Stuart-Smith LJ in order to ascertain inter alia whether there was
 42   evidence relating to the disaster which had not been available to Lord Taylor, or to the
       DPP or the Attorney General for the purposes of their discharge of their statutory
       responsibilities. Stuart-Smith LJ’s report was presented to the House of Commons on
4^5   18 February 1998. Chapter 1 paras 55-57 state:

                  “55. From my meetings with the bereaved families and their
                  representatives, I am left in no doubt that there was widespread
3                 disappointment at the DPP’s decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult
                  to understand in the light of Lord Taylor’s trenchant criticisms of the South
                  Yorkshire police and the fact that the force had been paying compensation.
 6
                   56. W hat the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however,
                   is the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is
 9                involved in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as
                   against the degree of negligence which gives rise to liability, and
                   compensation payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual
12                 police officer would have to establish his individual responsibility. It would
                   not be enough simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation.

15                57. The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two
                   officers [sc D and M] were concerned, the prosecution would have to prove
                   to the high standard required for a criminal conviction that the failure to
18                give the order to close off the tunnel when Gate C was opened amounted to
                   the serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute manslaughter.”

21   Para 5 of Chapter 7 (“Summary”) stated:

                   “... I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which
24                there should be a further judicial inquiry or a re-opening of Lord Taylor’s
                   inquiry... I do not consider that there is any material which should be
                   placed before the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints
27                Authority which might cause them to re-consider the decisions they have
                   already taken.”

30   On the same day, 18 February 1998, the Home Secretary announced in the House that
     he, the Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered Stuart-Smith LJ’s
     report, and said: “We have no reason to doubt his conclusions”.
33
                     The HFSG was clearly not satisfied with this result. There was first an
      abortive attempt on 26 June 1998 by AA to institute criminal proceedings against D
36   and M in the South Sefiton Petty Sessional Division. That was given its quietus on
      technical or jurisdictional grounds into which it is unnecessary to go. Then on 13 July
      1998          Miss Adlington laid informations against them before the Leeds Petty Sessional
39   Division, and summonses were accordingly issued by the Stipendiary Magistrate. The
      charges accuse D and M of the manslaughter of two of those who died at
      Hillsborough, John Anderson and James Aspinall. They also allege against both an
42   offence of “wilful neglect to perform a public duty”; and in the case of D, a further
      offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice, said to consist in his having lied
      about the circumstances in which Gate C at the football ground became open.

                     Both D and M made representations to the DPP that he should exercise
       his power under s.6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (“the POA”) to take
3      over the conduct of the proceedings initiated against them, and then discontinue the
       proceedings under s.23(3). In order to appreciate the contrary positions being taken
       and the issues in the case, it is convenient to set out the relevant statutoiy provisions at
 6     this stage.

                           Section 3(2) of the POA provides so far as relevant:
 9
                  "It shall be the duty of the Director -
                 (a) to take over the conduct of all criminal proceedings, other than specified
12              proceedings, instituted on behalf of a police force (whether bya member of
                 that force or by any other person);
                 (b) to institute and have the conduct of criminal proceedings in any case

                           (ii) it is otherwise appropriate for proceedings to be instituted by

                 (d) to take over the conduct of all proceedings begun by summons issued
27              under s.3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959...”

       S.6 provides so far as relevant:

                  ” (1) Subject to subsection (2) below, nothing in this P art shall preclude any
                 person from instituting any criminal proceedings or conducting any

                  of proceedings does not apply.

36               (2) W here criminal proceedings are instituted in circumstances in which the

24                 Representations had first been made to the DPP on behalf of D and M in
     early July 1998, after the commencement of the proceedings in the South Sefton Petty
     Sessional Division which proved abortive. In the course of correspondence the HFSG
27   again contended that it had discovered new evidence, which, it was said, had not been
     before Lord Taylor, the DPP, the Coroner, or Stuart-Sroith LJ. At length, after AA’s
     informations had been laid in the Leeds Petty Sessional Division, the considered views
30   of the DPP as to the approach to be taken to a request to take over and discontinue a
     private prosecution were set out in a letter to the HFSG on 27 July 1998. The letter did
     not contain a decision, but it explained the DPP’s policy:
33
               “The policy where proceedings have been commenced by a private
               prosecutor builds on that contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
36             The right to bring a private prosecution is preserved by s.6(l)... subject to
               the power under s.6(2). The CPS will take over a private prosecution where
               there is a particular need for it do so on behalf of the public...
39             In the instant case where we have been asked by the defendants to take over
               the prosecution in order to discontinue it, we would do so if one (or more) of
               the following circumstances applies:
42
                          • There is clearly no case to answer. A private prosecution
                            commenced in these circumstances would be unfounded, and
45                          would, therefore be an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution.

                         • The public interest factors tending against prosecution clearly
                           outweigh those factors tending.in favour.
                         • The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.
                         • The prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests o f justice.

               The CPS would then regard
                                    O    itself as having9 to act in accordance with our
               policy.

               If none of the above apply there would be no need for the CPS to become
               involved and we would not interfere with the private prosecution.

12             Clearly there is a distinction between the "realistic prospect of conviction’
               test in the Code [the Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under
               s. 10 of the 1985 Act] and the 'clearly no case to answer’ test mentioned
<              above. Accordingly we recognise that there will be some cases which do not
               meet the CPS Code tests where nevertheless we will not intervene. It has
               been considered that to apply the Code tests to private prosecutions would
 18            unfairly limit the right of individuals to bring their own cases.

               Before this decision can properly be made the CPS must be assured that all
21             relevant material has been considered...

               Until there has been a. detailed review of the many papers in the case the
24             Crown’s position cannot be determined...”


27                   There followed very substantial representations from D and M and from
      the HFSG. At length the DPP communicated Ms decision not to intervene, as I have
( ^   said by letter of 18 December 1998. The letter merely stated:

                ‘•"We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties
                and all the relevant circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we
 33            should not intervene to take over any of the charges.”

      The respective solicitors for D and M asked for reasons to be given. Ther^ followed a
 36   letter of 1 February 1999 (the “reasons lettef’) from the CPS’ Casework Director to
      M’s solicitor from which it is necessary to cite at some length:

 39            “As you know, the Code for Crown Prosecutors sets out the general
               principles applied by the Service when (inter alia) deciding whether to
               continue a prosecution it has taken over; or whether to institute
 42            proceedings, or whether to advise the police to do so. It is correct that the
               CPS decided in 1997 that the evidence available at that time was not

              follow that, when considering the evidence and the representations
              submitted by the private prosecutor, and by yourselves on behalf of your
 3           client, the CPS should seek merely to identify whether there is now any new
              evidence sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. The
              decision whether to intervene in a private prosecution with a view to
 6            terminating it calls for different considerations to be applied. It is quite
              possible for a private prosecution to continue, notwithstanding that the CPS
              is not satisfied, on the basis of its own assessment of the strength of the
 9           evidence, that the evidence would pass the evidential sufficiency test in the
              Code (that there should be a 'realistic prospect of a conviction’).

12           In broad terms, the reason for this is that s.6(l)... specifically preserved the
              right of private individuals and prosecuting authorities and bodies other
              than the CPS to bring criminal proceedings. This right is subject (among
15           other limitations) to the limitation in s.6(2) that the CPS may nevertheless
              take over the proceedings with a view either to conducting or to
              terminating those proceedings.
13
              Private prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code for Crown Prosecutors
              when deciding whether to institute proceedings, nor do the courts apply the
21            evidential sufficiency test in the Code when deciding whether there is a case
              to answer. The Service therefore recognises that it is not appropriate to
              intervene to terminate a private prosecution without good reason. That-
24            general principle has recently been endorsed by the Law Commission in its
              Consultation Paper No. 149 'Consents to Prosecution’ (see paragraphs 6.3 .
              and 6.4).
27
              [The letter then proceeds to set out the DPP’s policy in the same terms as those
              in which it had earlier been described by the three “bullet-points” in the letter
30            of 27 July 1998, save that it gives instances of the “public interest factors” test
              as follows:

33            “examples might be where the prosecution is malicious, or vexatious; or the
               offence is one for which the defendant should clearly have been cautioned;
               or where, although the offence may be serious, the defendant is terminally
36            ill.” Then the letter continues as follows]

              In this case, I took the decision not to intervene... I concluded in respect of
39            the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect .to perform a public duty
               (which, for the avoidance of doubt, were each considered against each
               individual separately) that I could not say that there is clearly no case to
42            answer. It was not right, therefore, for the Service to take over the
               proceedings with a view to terminating them.

                 I should add that, against that background and after specifically
                 considering the appropriate course to take in these circumstances, I
 3              concluded further that it would not be;right to intervene in respect of the
                 one remaining charge against M r Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the
                 course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
 5              to answer on that charge alone. The charge of attempting to pervert the
                 course of justice is a serious one, particularly when levelled against
                 someone who was, at the relevant time, a serving, senior police officer.
 9              Nevertheless, in the context of the case as a whole that charge is not the
                 gravamen of the criminality alleged against M r Duckenfield and I
                 concluded that my approach to that charge should be led by my conclusions
12              on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a public duty.
                 I also considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public
                 interest factors that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to
                 discontinuance, but I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
                 tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour; nor
                 did I consider that the prosecution is clearly likely to damage the interests
18              of justice...”


21                  The private prosecution of D and M presently stands adjourned in the
     magistrates’ court. Committal proceedings were due to commence on 19 April 1999.
     But we understand that date has been vacated. There is a directions hearing fixed for
24 hearing later in April. The matter was earlier before the magistrates’ court on 21
     December 1998, an occasion to which I should refer because Mr Jones QC for AA
     contends that the applications in the first case have not been made promptly, as Order
27 53 and the Supreme Court Act 1981 require (Mr Havers QC for the DPP likewise so
     contends but only in relation to the assault which is directed to the legality of the
 a   DPP’s policy; he says, as is plainly the fact, that D and M had notice of the policy by
   ■ the letter of 27 July 1998). On 21 December it is said by AA that Mr Harrison QC for
     D and M indicated his clients’ intention to seek leave to bring an application for
     judicial review against the DPP’s decision, whatever the reasons for it (the reasons
33 had not, of course, by then been supplied). Mr Jones contends that the application for
     judicial review could and should have been lodged then or very shortly thereafter.
      There is an issue as to the context in which Mr Harrison said what he said to the
36 magistrate. It is clear from an affidavit sworn by M’s solicitor Mr Manning that Mr
     Harrison took the view (as, if I may say so, one would expect) that he would have to
     consider the DPP’s written reasons before finally advising as to a judicial review. As
39 at 21 December 1998 a reasons letter was expected before Christmas, and Mr Harrison
      so informed the magistrate. In the event the reasons were not delivered until 1
     February 1999. These applications were lodged in the Crown Office on 1 and 5 March
42 1999.

    |                  In my judgment there is nothing in the delay point. It would have been
f   d   irresponsible to seek judicial review leave before the DPP’s reasons were available.
        .And the letter of 27 July 1998 could not have been a proper trigger to seek leave; it

        not strictly have awaited the DPP’s reasons for applying it as he decided to do; but
3       since D and M, very obviously, were at least as interested in the application of the
        policy as in its legality, overall it was perfectly proper and reasonable to wait for the
        reasons letter before lodging any application for leave.

    9   The First Case: the Decision o f the DPP

                       I may now turn to the substantive arguments in the first case. The lead
12      skeleton argument is that prepared on behalf of M, which is adopted by D who adds
        further submissions to challenge the distinct decision of the DPP not to take over and
        discontinue the charge against him of attempting to pervert the course of justice. To
15      that I will come in due course.

        S.3(2)(b) o f the Act o f 1985
18
                      The applicants’ first submission is that the DPP’s decision fails to pay
        any regard to his duty under s.3(2)(b), which I have set out. It is put thus at #2.6 of the
21      skeleton argument:

                 “The applicant’s point is that the policy and decision process in this case
24               have not recognised that the s.3(2)(b) duty is relevant to the exercise of
                 discretion whether to intervene under s.6(2) and apply s.23(3)”.

27      In the course of his oral submissions Mr Harrison expanded this argument. He
        submitted that in deciding whether to take over and discontinue a private prosecution
        where the case is one of “importance or difficulty”, the DPP should bear in mind that
30      it is ordinarily his duty to institute and conduct such proceedings. Accordingly, as I
        understand it, the suggestion is that the DPP should in some way entertain a
        heightened concern where such a private prosecution is launched, and his policy in
33      relation to the potential discontinuance of such cases under s.23(3) should reflect this;
        presumably (for otherwise I cannot see how the argument can assist Mr Harrison) by
        leaning more favourably towards discontinuance than in other classes of case.
36
                       In my judgment this is a bad argument. S.3(2)(b) speaks only of the
        institution of proceedings by the DPP; contrast s.3(2)(a), (c), and (d), which require
39      him to take over proceedings. Plainly the DPP would not institute proceedings with a
        view to discontinuance. Moreover, as Mr Havers submitted, had it been the
        legislature’s intention to require the DPP to treat “important or difficult” cases in a
42      different way from others for the purposes of ss.6(2) and 23(3), it could have readily
        so provided and it is to be supposed would have done so. In my judgment the right of
        private prosecution preserved by s.6(l) is in no way qualified by s.3(2)(b), which has
A       nothing to do with die discretion to take over such a prosecution under s.6(2) with a
        view to discontinuance under s.23(3). I consider that this conclusion is lent support by

          the decision of the Divisional Court in R v Bow Street Stipendiary, ex p. South Coast
          Ltd [1993] 2 WLR 621, in which Lloyd LJ, as he then was, said at 624;
     3
                   “It will be noticed that section 3(2)(a)... provide[s] for the Director to take
                   over the conduct of certain kinds of proceedings. By contrast, section
     6            3(2)(b) provides for the Director to institute certain other kinds of
                   proceedings where it appears to him to be appropriate, having regard to th e
                   importance and the difficulty of the case. The difference in language is not,
     9            in my view, accidental. It becomes of crucial importance when one turns to
                   section 6, which deals with private prosecutions... The effect of section 6(1)
                   is to preclude a person from bringing a private prosecution in cases covered
    12            by section 3(2)(a), (c) and (d) but not in the residuary category of C2ses
                   covered by section 3(2)(b). So far as section 3(2)(b) cases are concerned,
                   there is nothing to preclude a private prosecution.” (Lloyd LJ’s emphasis)


           The D PP’s policy fa ils to have regard to the fundam ental purpose fo r which private
    18    prosecution is preserved by statute

                        Mr Harrison’s second submission was that the right to maintain a private
    21    prosecution essentially operates as a constitutional safeguard in cases where there is
           some suggestion of “inertia, partiality or improper action” by the public prosecutor;
           End the implication is that where nothing of that kind is present, the DPP should lean
    24    towards intervention to stop the prosecution. Mr Harrison relies on statements of their
           Lordships in Gouriet v Union o f Post Office Workers [1978] AC 435. Lord
           Wilberforce said at 477B-C:
    27
                   “This historical right which goes right back tothe earliest days of our legal
                   system, though rarely exercised in relation to indictable offences, and
    '30            though ultimately liable to be controlled by the Attorney-General (by
                   taking over the prosecution and, if he thinks fit, entering a nolle prosequi)
                    remains a valuable constitutional safeguard against inertia or partiality on
    33             the part of authority.”

          Lord Diplock said this at 498B:
    36
                    “In English public law every citizen still has the right, as he once had a
                    duty (though of imperfect obligation), to invoke the aid of courts of criminal
    39             jurisdiction for the enforcement of the criminal law by this procedure. It is
                    a right which nowadays seldom needs to be exercised by an ordinary
                    member of the public, for since the formation of regular police forces
    42             charged with the duty in public law to prevent and detect crime and to
^                  bring criminals to justice, and the creation in 1879 of the office of Director
W                  of Public Prosecutions, the need for prosecutions to be undertaken (arid
    45             paid for) by private individuals has largely disappeared; but it still exists
                    and is a useful constitutional safeguard against capricious, corrupt or
                                      ^                         - 10-

              biased failure or refusal of those authorities to prosecute offenders against
              the criminal law.”
3
     Reliance is also placed on a passage at para 7.50 in the report of the Royal
     Commission on Criminal Procedure 1981, which refers to the retention of the right of
6    private prosecution “as an effective safeguard against improper inaction by the
     prosecuting authority”, and to a recent recommendation of the Law Commission,
     contained in para 5.26 of its final report on “Consents to Prosecution” (October 1998),
9    to the effect that private prosecutions might be made subject to a statutory provision
     requiring the consent of the CPS.

12                 In my judgment this argument is also misconceived. The obiter dicta in
     Couriet are not reflected in the 1985 statute, which was of course enacted some seven
     years after Gouriet was decided. More particularly, it is simply quixotic to suggest that
15   the DPP should allow a private prosecution to go ahead if there has been ‘’inertia,
     partiality or improper action” by the public prosecutor - namely himself - but not
     otherwise. Is he to be judge and jury on the question whether he has let the public
18   down? Their Lordships’ dicta in Gouriet do not with respect provide anything
     approaching a compulsory template of a lawful policy to be adopted by the DPP for
     the execution of his duty under ss.6(2) and 23(3).

24                  The argument here, at least as originally put forward in M’s skeleton
     argument, was that because of his view (referred to in the reasons letter) that private
     prosecutors are not bound to apply the Code when deciding whether to institute
27   proceedings, the DPP has erroneously proceeded on the basis that the principles in the
     Code are irrelevant to his discretion under ss.6(2) and 23(3). But the DPP has nowhere
     stated that he regards the Code as systematically or generally irrelevant to his power to
30   discontinue. Indeed," as I shall show, there are some aspects of the Code which are
     reflected in his approach to the question, how his policy should be applied in this case.
     In truth, however, it could not be right for the DPP to apply across the board the same
33   tests, in particular the “reasonable prospect of conviction” test referred to in the
     correspondence, in considering whether to take over and discontinue a private
     prosecution as the Code enjoins Crown Prosecutors to follow in deciding whether to
36   institute or proceed with a prosecution themselves; the consequence would be that the
     DPP would stop a private prosecution merely on the ground that the case is not one
     which he would himself proceed with. But that, in my judgment, would amount to an
39   emasculation of s.6(l) and itself be an unlawful policy; and in fairness Mr Harrison
     (#7 of M’s skeleton) made it clear that he did not submit so much. The very premise of
     s.6(l) must be that some cases will go to trial which the DPP himself chooses not to
42   prosecute.

                    As it seems to me the only points remaining in relation to the Code
45    concern the application of the DPP’s policy to the facts of this case, and I will deal
      with that shortly.

          The “clearly no case to answer” test
  3
                         The argument here (#7 of the skeleton) is that such a test is
          impermissibly rigid. It is said that the policy excludes “any assessment of evidential
  6       deficiencies” and so amounts to an unlawful fetter of the DPP’s discretion; and that it
          “also leads to a distorted evaluation of the public interest factors” . In my judgment
          the test involves no unlawful fetter of discretion. It is plain from the formulation “there
     9    is clearly no case to answer” (my emphasis) that the DPP only intends to stop private
          prosecutions on this ground where no reasonable decision-maker could conclude that
          there wras sufficient evidence for the case to go forward. That seems to me to be a
 12       perfectly proper approach. Such a prosecution could offer no legitimate benefit to
          anyone and would, potentially at least, be an abuse of the process of the court. The
          test rightly identifies a class of case which should always be stopped; if the case is not
< #       within the class, then the decision whether to stop it will, of course, depend on the
          other two tests which, in my judgment, amply contemplate an exercise of discretion in
          which all material factors will be considered and whose application accordingly
 18       negates any unlawful fetter of discretion.

                        As regards any “distorted evaluation” of the public interest test, it is
 21        clear that the three aspects of the policy are individually self-standing. Their
           respective application in this case is a another matter, to which as I have said I will
           come. But the applicants have a separate argument about the public interest test.
 24
           The “public interestfactors” test

 27                       Here it is submitted (#8 of the skeleton) that the public interest
           necessarily involves consideration of the likelihood of conviction, so that the
           evidential test should not be hived off from that relating to the public interest. Mr
to         Harrison also argues that the public interest test as formulated - “the public interest
          factors tending against prosecution clearly outweigh those factors tending in
          favour” - gets it the wrong way round; the test should be whether the public interest
 33        factors in favour of the private prosecution outweigh those against.

                          I see no reason why quite aside from the evidential test of no case to
 36       answer the DPP should not, within his policy as presently formulated, have in mind
           the livelihood or otherwise of conviction when considering where the public interest
           lies. And I see no basis for the suggestion that the law should compel the DPP to
 39       reverse the effect of the public interest factors' .so as to favour discontinuance unless in
           his judgment they clearly point in the other direction. The test as presently formulated
           seems to me designed to allow proper scope for the operation of the right of private
 42       prosecution. The private prosecutor is very likely to take a different view as to where
           the public interest lies than does the DPP, and s.6(l), I think, implies that he is entitled
 )        to do so. The approach urged by Mr Harrison would in effect reqiire the private
 45       prosecutor to persuade the DPP that his view of the public interest is plainly right I
           consider it strongly arguable that that would place an illegitimate constraint upon the

     right of private prosecution; but it is enough to hold, as I would, that the present public
     interest policy is perfectly consistent with the objects of the statute and thus well
 3   within the proper discretion of the DPP.

                   Mr Harrison directed similar criticisms to the third limb of the policy,
 6   but in light of what I have said about the public interest test they possess no separate
     force.

 9                                                       ***

                      For all these reasons, the DPP’s policy overall is in my judgment a
12    lawful one. The real question in the case is whether it has been lawfully applied. It is
      clear that (a) the DPP maintains his view that the “reasonable prospect of conviction”
      test in the Code would not be met in this case, but that (b) the “no evidence” test is not
15   met either (save as regards the charge against D of attempting to pervert the course of
     justice, with which I deal separately below). In those circumstances, the application of
      the public interest test w'as crucial. In this context it is convenient to deal first with Mr
18   Harrison’s submission that the reasons letter shows that the DPP has given improper
      and perhaps decisive weight to the “no evidence” test He relies on the sentence which
      follows the conclusion that that test is not satisfied: “It was not right, therefore, for
21   the Service to take over the proceedings with a view to terminating them”, and.
      submits that it suggests the author of the letter considered that that was the end of the
      matter. However after dealing with the particular issue concerning the charge against
24   D of attempting to pervert the course of justice, the letter continues: “I also
      considered whether, nevertheless, there were overriding public interest factors
      that should lead to the Service intervening with a view to discontinuance”. I think
27   the letter could have been better expressed, so as to make it clear that the public
      interest test is by no means secondary to the “no evidence” test. However I am quite
      satisfied that there was no intention to downgrade or sideline the balance of public
30   interest factors. It is not really credible to suppose that author of the letter
      misunderstood or failed to apply the very policy which he had just clearly set out.

33   The DPP's judgment o f the public interest

                     Mr Harrison submitted that in light of everything that had gone before,
36   and not least Stuart-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny, there were no public interest factors
      favouring continuation of the prosecutions of D and M. He said that there is nothing in
      the reasons letter to show that the DPP accepted the suggestion, urged forcefully and
39   at length by the HFSG in the course of their representations, that further evidence had
      come to light since the Scrutiny. With this latter proposition I agree. But the reasons
      letter clearly implies an acceptance that some factors existed which favoured the
42   prosecutions. It stated: “I came to the conclusion that any public interest factors
      tending against prosecution did not clearly outweigh those in favour” . What were
      those in favour? If in truth there were no factors which a reasonable decision-maker
45   could regard as going in favour of the prosecutions, then the DPP’s decision would be

     vulnerable to a challenge on Wednesbury1 grounds (as indeed Mr Harrison claims it is)
     since there would be nothing in public interest terms to weigh in the scales against
3    discontinuance. When the case was opened there was no affidavit from the DPP
     dealing with the point, nor did Mr Havers’ skeleton argument articulate any such
     factors. So it was that, effectively at the court’s invitation so that the matter could be
 5   clarified, Mr Newell swrore an affidavit for the DPP on 22 March 1999. He is the CPS’
     Director of Casework and the author of the reasons letter. Paras 2 - 4 are as follows:

 9             “2. As I now recall, the public interest factors tending against prosecution
               which I considered were as follows:

12                       (1) Previous reviews of the case, in particular those carried out by
                         the DPP when considering the question whether criminal
                         proceedings should be taken against M r Duckenfield and Mr
                         M urray and the more recent report of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

                         (2) The fact that the Applicants had been told on previous occasions
18                       that the DPP did not intend to prosecute.

                         (3) The delay which had occurred between the commission of the
 *
zI                       alleged offences and the commencement of this prosecution and its
                         likely effect on the Applicants, although I took the view that delay
                         may be offset by the seriousness of the alleged offences (as is reflected
24                       in paragraph 6.5(d) of the Code...).

                         (4) The effect of the delay on the evidence, for example in terms of
27                       the potential impairment of the recollections of witnesses.

                         (5) The assertion made on behalf of M r M urray of ill-health,
                         although I noted that no medical evidence had been put forward in
                         support of this assertion and that, as again reflected in the Code (at
                         paragraph 6.5(e)), ill-health may be offset by the seriousness of the
33                       offence.

               3. As against these factors tending against prosecution, there was in my
36             view one extremely important factor in favour of prosecution, namely the
               very serious nature of the alleged offences, in particular, the alleged
               offences of manslaughter. In my opinion, the allegation that two senior
39             police officers were responsible for the deaths of a number of people as a
               result of criminal negligence was a very grave allegation.

42             4. Paragraph 6.2 of the Code reflects the considerable weight attached by
               the CPS to the seriousness of the alleged offence when seeking to strike the
               right balance as to the factors for and against prosecution. (I refer also to

                 the opening words of paragraph 6.4.) Having carefully considered the
                 factors tending against prosecution and this extremely important factor in
 3               favour of it, I came to the firm conclusion that the factors tending against
                 prosecution did not clearly outweigh what I considered to be the very-
                 strong public interest in favour of prosecution.”
 /■**
 D



                       One of Mr Harrison’s complaints, advanced before this affidavit was
 9      sworn, was that the policy should have taken account of para 10.1 of the Code which
        includes this:

12               “Normally, if the Crown Prosecution Service tells a suspect or defendant
                 that there will not be a prosecution... that is the end of the matter... But
                 occasionally there are special reasons why the Crown Prosecution Service
15               will re-start the prosecution, particularly if the case is serious.”

         This is one of the points relating to the Code which, as it seems to me, bear on the
18      application of the policy rather than the policy itself; and para 2(2) of Mr Newell’s
        affidavit shows that regard was had to assurances or statements made to D and M that
        for his part the DPP would not prosecute. Clearly it was right to do so, within the
21      public interest balance. But I think there is a qualitative difference between the
        situation w'here the DPP himself goes back upon a previous assurance not to prosecute
        and one where the DPP does not change his mind but a private prosecutor chooses to
24      instigate proceedings.

                      In reply, having by then seen Mr Newell’s affidavit, Mr Harrison made
27      further submissions. While accepting that there could be a case in which a single
        factor favouring prosecution might not be outweighed by a multiplicity of factors
        going the other way, he submitted that if the raft of public interest considerations
30      favouring discontinuance in this case was held not to be enough to outweigh the single
        factor of the allegations’ gravity, it was difficult or impossible to imagine what set of
        considerations might do so; and the court should conclude that DPP had fettered his
33      discretion by treating the seriousness of the allegations as overriding everything else,
        so that he had not in truth carried out a proper balancing exercise at all.

36                    I would reject this argument. There is no reason to suppose that the
        factors against prosecution were not properly weighed and considered, and certainly
        no basis for the supposition that once faced with a private prosecution for something
39      as serious as manslaughter the DPP would inevitably decide to allow it to proceed.

                     Mr Harrison submitted next that Mr Newell’s affidavit showed that the
42      DPP had transposed from the Code the “seriousness of the charge” factor as a
        consideration favouring the prosecution without also taking account of his own view
        that the Code test of “realistic prospect of conviction” was not m et I agree that the
45      DPP’s view of the prospects of conviction is a proper matter for him to consider,
        within the public interest test contained in the policy, when deciding whether ic

     discontinue; but, as it seems to me, para 2(1) of Mr Newell’s affidavit shows that in
     this case he has done so.
3
                    Then Mr Harrison suggested that para 3 of the affidavit demonstrated
                                                     w w                X

      that the DPP’s view of the gravity of the allegation was informed simply by the fact
 6   that there was a manslaughter charge. He had not properly considered the red degree
      of culpability inherent in the facts alleged; and the gravity of the offence of
      manslaughter can vary very widely. There is nothing in this. Mr Newell made it
 9   perfectly clear that he had regard to the species of manslaughter in question
      (“criminal negligence”) and it cannot sensibly be doubted that he was well aware and
      took account of the circumstances in which the alleged offences are said to have been
12   committed.

                   Lastly on this part of the case Mr Harrison submitted that the refusal to
     discontinue was simply perverse, given the “enormous weight” of the public interest
     considerations going the other way.

18                The DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to discontinue.
     The tragic events at Hillsborough have been the subject of repeated, detailed, thorough
     enquiries. Nearly ten years have passed. But the judgment was for the DPP to make. If
21   we acceded to Mr Harrison’s submission, we would I think usurp the role of the
     primary decision-maker.

24                 In my judgment the decision not to discontinue is no more unlawful than
     is the policy which the DPP applied.

      The first applicant: attempting to pervert the course ofjustice

                     Mr Harrison discretely submits that the decision to let the charge of
      attempting to pervert the course of justice go ahead was unlawful, because it runs flat
33    counter to the “no case to answer” test in his own policy. It will be recalled that the
      reasons letter said:

36             “I concluded further that it would not be right to intervene in respect of the
                one remaining charge against M r Duckenfield, of attempting to pervert the
                course of justice, albeit I had formed the view that there was clearly no case
39             to answer on that charge alone... in the context of the case as a whole that
                charge is not the gravamen of the criminality alleged against Mr
                Duckenfield and I concluded that my approach to that charge should be led
42             by my conclusions on the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to
                perform a public duty.”

A     Paras 5 and 6 of Mr Newell’s affidavit state as follows:

               “5. I was fully aware of the seriousness of the additional charge. I also
               tentatively concluded that partial intervention... was in law open to the CPS
 3            and I proceeded on that assumption. However, the existing policy did not
               cover the situation which arose in this case, namely where the conclusion
               was reached that there was clearly a case to answer in relation to some of
 6            the charges but not in relation to others. (I can say that with some
               confidence, since I had overall responsibility for formulating the policy.) ...
               I concluded that it was in fact inappropriate to intervene only to take over
 9            (with a view to discontinuing) this additional charge.

               6.              First, partial intervention was not, in my view, either appropriate or
12             desirable. It seemed to me that the DPP should either intervene so as to
               take over the proceedings in their entirety or not at all. To have intervened
               partially would still have left the criminal proceedings in place in relation to
15            the other charges which included the even more serious charge of
               manslaughter. Secondly, I took into account the fact that M r Duckenfield
               would not be left without any remedy in relation to this additional charge.
18            On the contrary, he would be entitled to invite the Magistrates’ Court to
               dismiss it on the basis that there was no case to answer. Thirdly, the charge
               arose out of essentially the same events as the events which gave rise to the
21            other charges and thus those events would be scrutinised in any event.”


24                    I of course accept that Mr Newell did not subjectively believe - or intend
      - that the policy covered this situation. But the policy has to be read objectively; there
      can be no doubt that it gave rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of D and M
27   that it would be applied according to its terms. The first question, then, is as to the true
      meaning of the policy on a fair reading of the letter of 27 July 1998 and the reasons
      letter. It is true that the letters use the singular: “the prosecution” and “a private
30   prosecution”. But it is elementary that in criminal cases each count constitutes a
      separate indictment; it is as if there are separate trials relating to each. And this is no
      mere technicality; for it means, of course, that where there is more than one charge
33    any question whether there is “no case to answer” is, as regards each individual
      charge, wholly discrete. I do not consider that the policy can fairly be read as
      indicating that the DPP would necessarily either take over or discontinue a private
36   prosecution in its entirety. In my view the articulation of the “no case to answer” test
      would be taken by any informed reader, facing a multiple private prosecution, to imply
      that the DPP would consider whether in his view there was clearly no case to answer
39   on each charge.

                     The DPP concluded that there was clearly no such case in relation to this
42   charge against D, and yet decided to allow it to proceed. It follows, in my judgment,
      that there is a breach of D ’s legitimate expectation that the policy would be applied.
      The pragmatic factors spoken to by Mr Newell in para 6 can make no difference. Nor,
45   of course, can the vigorous assertion by the HFSG that there is in fact a case to
      answer. What matters for present purposes is the DPP’s conclusion on that issue.

     The Second Case: the Decision o f the SYPA
12
                    First I should describe the further facts which are specifically relevant to
     the second case. These must be read into the narrative of events which I have already
     given in relation to the first case; it seems to me clearer and more convenient to isolate
     here the particular facts which bear on the challenge to the decision of the SYPA.

18                  The history shows that at earlier stages the SYPA had been prepared to
      provide financial support for D and M (and other officers) to be legally represented in
      matters arising from the Hillsborough disaster. On 7 December 1990 they resolved to
21   fund the representation of six police officers, including D and M, at the inquest. They
      had earlier resolved not to do so; the decision of 7 December was taken after
      considering “the most recent legal advice available”. Then on 1 August 1997 the
24    SYPA resolved to set aside £500,000 for financial assistance for police officers in
      connection with Stuari-Smith LJ’s Scrutiny. In both instances they had considered a
      report from the Chief Constable (or a joint report of the Chief Constable and the Clerk
27   and Treasurer). The latter decision was said to be taken “in accordance with the
      principles set out in Home Office Circular No 77/87 Financial Assistance to Police
^    Officers in Legal Proceedings”, to which I will have to refer.

                     On 27 February 1998, following publication of the Scrutiny, and
      considering that “there were indications that private prosecutions could be brought
33   against 3 officers”, the SYPA resolved in principle to authorise consideration btmg
      given to applications by officers for financial assistance. On 5 March 1998 D’s
      application for such assistance was approved by the SYPA, and M’s was approved on
36   29 June 1998. It will be recalled that three days earlier, on 26 June, AA had first
      sought to institute criminal proceedings against D and M in the South Sefton Petty
      Sessional Division. On 20 November 1998 M applied for further financial assistance
39   in relation to the judicial review which was then seen to be in prospect should the DPP
      decide to allow the private prosecutions to continue; and the HFSG had made it clear
      that were the DPP to take over the prosecutions and discontinue, they would seek a
42   judicial review. On 21 December 1998 counsel for D and M indicated to the
      Stipendiary Magistrate their intention to seek a judicial review of the DPP’s decision; I
      have already referred to this in dealing with Mr Jones’ misconceived argument that the
f     first case should be dismissed on grounds of delay. The following day, 22 December
      1998, in a letter of over six pages AA made written representations on leading
                                     v                     -18 •

     counsel’s advice to urge the SYPA that the decision to fund the defences of D and M
     was “unlawful, irrational, ultra vires and procedurally improper on various
 3   grounds”. On 23 December 1998 D applied for further financial assistance in relation
     to the prospective judicial review proceedings. On 5 January 1999 AA wrote a further
     lengthy letter to the SYPA repeating and expanding her assertions that the funding
 6   decisions were unlawful.

                    Then on 5 February 1999 the SYPA passed the resolutions under
 9   challenge, “that, on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial
     assistance” to D and M in respect either of the private prosecution or a judicial review
     of the DPP’s decision. On 10 February 1999 the CCSY’s application for judicial
12   review in these proceedings was lodged, and on the same day solicitors for the SYPA
     wrote to the Crown Office to consent to the grant of leave and seek expedition. They
     stated:
15           “SYPA passed these resolutions with great reluctance on the basis of advice
             received from ourselves and Counsel...”

                   The legality or otherwise of the decisions under challenge ultimately •
21   toms on the construction and application of s.6(l) of the Police Act 1996 and s. 111(1)
     of the Local Government Act 1972. I shall have to look at other statutory provisions,
     but it is convenient to set these out at once. The cross-heading to s.6 reads “General
24   functions of police authorities”, and ss.(l) provides:

               “Every police authority established under section 3 shall secure the
27             maintenance of an efficient and effective police force for its area.”

     S. 111(1) of the Act of 1972 in its present form provides:
30
               “Without prejudice to any powers exercisable apart from this section but
               subject to the following provisions of this Act, a local authority shall have
33             power to do any thing (whether or not involving expenditure, borrowing or
               lending of money or the acquisition or disposal of any property or rights)
               which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the
36             discharge of their functions.”


39                 S.                 111(1) applies to police authorities (but in light of my conclusions it is
     unnecessary to go into the legislative history relating to that). Now, it might be
     thought - indeed this is the applicants’ case - that by s.6(1), securing “the
42   maintenance of an efficient and effective police force” is plainly made the function
     of a police authority, and that accordingly it is no less plain that s. 111(1) empowers
     the police authority to do such things as fund the legal representation of police officers
45   in proceedings if tfie authority reasonably concludes that to do so is conducive to that
     function’s discharge. That has been the setded view of the Association of Chief Police

          Officers, the Police Superintendents Association, and (until 1998) the Home Office.
          The decision to provide such finance, in common with any decision taken under
      3   s. 111(1), would of course be subject to well known public law constraints enshrined in
          the Wednesbury and PadfielS principles. There is before the court an affidavit of Mr
           Daines, Assistant Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, in which he describes what he
      5   regards as the “absolutely vital” requirement “that officers should know that if they
           act in good faith in performing their duties their Police Authority will support
           them in the event that they face litigation”. If as a matter of vires s. 111(1) allows a
      9   police authority to incur expenditure in furtherance of the general function seemingly
           confeued by s.6(l), then in my judgment the use of s. 111(1) to finance police officers’
           legal expenses in litigation, including private prosecutions brought against them and
  12      the bringing of judicial review proceedings, cannot in principle be ruled unlawful on
           Wednesbury or Padfield grounds. The circumstances in which such funding might be
           provided in any particular case is another matter. The policy has in the past been to the
 ,^       effect that the authority must be satisfied that the officer has acted in good faith in the
' w       discharge of his duty; and I can .see that, at least where a private prosecution is
           involved, there may be issues for the authority to consider which would involve their
  18      taking a view of the merits in advance of any trial. But in these proceedings we are not
           concerned with any question whether, when, or to what extent the SYPA might
           provide financial assistance to D or M. We are only to decide whether the power
  21      exists to do so at all.

                         In fact the argument of the CCSY was put two ways by Mr Baker QC. It
  24      was first said that s.6(l) of itself, without the aid of s.. 111(1), enabled the funding
          decision. Alternatively, it was enabled by s. 111(1) read with s.6(l).

  27                   Upon this issue Miss Baxendale QC for the SYPA submits that the
          apparently obvious relation between s.6(l) and s. 111(1) is in fact no relation at all.
          The essence of her argument may be expressed very shortly, as follows.

                        (a)                     S.6(1) confers no powers of any kind. All the powders posse
          police authorities are confeued elsewhere in the Police Act and by the local
  33      government legislation. S.6(l) does no more than to provide the purpose for which the
          authority’s powers are to be exercised; it states the Act’s “policy and objects”, in the
          language of the Padfield case, as they apply to police authorities. If this is right, it
  35      would contradict Mr Baker’s first argument, that s.6(1) alone is enough to empower
          the SYPA to fund D and M.

  39                     (b) S. 111(1) cannot be read as: .enabling the authority to do anything
           which is not ancillary to a power which is elsewhere conferred upon it. If this is right,
           then taken with (a) it contradicts Mr Baker’s second argument which relies on
  42      s .lll( l) .

                    There is no doubt that express powers are conferred on police authorities
      by a raft of statutory provisions. Miss Baxendale says that such provisions support
 3   proposition (a) which I have set out, by application of the canon of statutory
      construction expressed by the Latin maxim exprsssio unius est exclusio altsrius. Thus,
      she submits, where Parliament has seen fit to confer a range of specific powers on
 6   police authorities, the intention must have been thereby to set the limits on what such
      an authority may do and it cannot be supposed that s.6(l) provides an undefined and
      open-ended power to do anything else which the authority may choose, merely on the
 9   ground that in some way it may be said to support the general aim of “the
      maintenance of an efficient and effective police force”. The high water-mark of this
      submission is found in s.88(4) of the Act of 1996 which confers an express power to
12    fund police officers’ costs in certain circumstances which do not include the defence
      of private (or any) criminal prosecutions or participation in proceedings for judicial
      review.
15
                    I shall have to look in a little more detail at s.88(4). I have concluded,
      however, that the correctness or otherwise of proposition (a) is not in the end at the
18   centre of the case. The reason is that in the particular statutory context proposition (b)
      is in my judgment wrong; so that the SYPA is enabled by s. 111(1) (subject to
      Wedmsbury and Padjield). to finance D and M in the criminal and judicial review
21   proceedings even if s.6(1) confers no powers as such.

                     The scheme of the Act of 1996 involves the distribution of
24   responsibilities between three bodies: the Chief Constable, the Secretary of State, and
      the police authority. The Chief Constable’s role is principally given by s. 10:

27            “(1) A police force maintained under section 2 shall be under the direction
              and control of the chief constable appointed under s.ll."

30            (2) In discharging his functions, every chief constable shall have regard to
               the local policing plan issued by the police authority for his area under
               section 8.”
33
      (S.ll provides for the appointment and removal of the Chief Constable, by the police
      authority with the approval of the Secretary of State.) I should notice also ss.22(l) and
36   44(4):
             “22(1) Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
             financial year, submit to the police authority a general report on the
39          policing during that year of the area for which his force is maintained.”

               “44(4) Every chief constable shall, as soon as possible after the end of each
42            financial year, submit to the Secretary of State the like report as is required
               by section 22(1) to be submitted to the police authority.”

45   The role of the Secretary of State is principally given by ss.36 and 37(1):

 3             as appears to him to be best calculated to promote the efficiency and
               effectiveness of the police.”

 6              37(1) The Secretary of State may by order determine objectives for the
               policing of the areas of all police authorities established under section 3.”

 9   As regards the Secretary of State’s position I should notice also these provisions of the
     Act of 1996:
            “38(1) Where an objective has been determined under section 37, the
12         Secretary of State may direct police authorities toestablish levels              of
            performance (performance targets) to be aimed at in seeking to achieve the
            objective.

               39(1) The Secretary of State may issue codes of practice relating to the
               discharge by police authorities established under section 3 of any of their
18            functions.”

     The role of the police authority is given first by the subsections of s.6 which follow
21   subsection (1):

               “6(2) In discharging its functions, every police authority established under
24            section 3 shall have regard
                                     9    to -

               (a) any objectives determined by the Secretary of State under section 37,
27
               (b) any objectives determined by the authority under section 7,

               (c) any performance targets established by the authority, whether in
               compliance with a direction under section 38 or otherwise, and

33           (d) any local policing plan issued by the authority under section 8.

               (3)               In discharging any function to which a code of practice issued under
36            section 39 relates, a police authority established under section 3 shall have
               regard to the code.

39            (4) A police authority shall comply with any direction given to it by the
               Secretary of State under section 38 or 40.”

42   These provisions, of course, confer duties rather than powers. In relation to the police
     authority I should next notice ss.7 - 9:

      S. 14 is important:

                  “ (1) Each police authority established under section 3 shall keep a fund to
                  be known as the police fund.

18                (2) Subject to any regulations under the Police Pensions Act 1976, all

21
                  (3) Accounts shall be kept by each police authority of payments made into

      Then s.43(l):

27                “A police authority shall, whenever so required by the Secretary of State,
                  submit to the Secretary of State a report on such matters connected with
                  the discharge of the authority's functions, or otherwise with the policing of
                   its area, as may be specified in the requirement.”

       S.92:
33                “(1) The council of a county, district, county borough or London borough
                   may make grants to any police authority established under section 3 whose

                    (a) the views of people in that area about matters concerning the
                    policing of the area, and

                    (b) their co-operation with the police in preventing crime in that area.

               (2) Except as provided by subsections (3) to (6), arrangements for each
               police area shall be made by the police authority after consulting the chief
               constable as to the arrangements that would be appropriate.”


                     Looking at the whole picture displayed by these provisions, it is clear
12   that the Chief Constable is in charge of day-to-day policing (s. 10(1)); the police
      authority has a role in relation to policy, or strategy (ss.7, S and other provisions); but
      this is subject to the overall direction of the Secretary of State (ss.37, 38, 39 and other
15   provisions, taken with s.6((2) - (4)). The police authority holds die purse (s. 14). Those
      provisions specifically concerned with the police authority’s role confer duties rather
      than powers, though in some cases there is clearly a discretion as to how the duty is to
18   be performed (as for example under s.37). Other powers (including those contained in
      s. 111(1)) are conferred on the police authority by the local government legislation, to
      the extent that measures there contained were applied to police authorities by
21   s,146A(l) of the Act of 1972. The powers so conferred are listed in a helpful note
      provided by Miss Baxendale. I do not propose to set them out. They include (apart
      from s. 111(1)) such matters as the disposition and treatment of staff and the
24   acquisition and disposal of land.

                       The critical point which in my judgment emerges from a consideration
27    of the interlocking roles of Chief Constable, Secretary of State and police authority is
       that it cannot have been within the contemplation of Parliament in enacting the
       scheme, and in embracing within it s. 111(1), that the police authority should only be
30    empowered to incur expenditure in support of those duties, and ancillary powers,
       which are specifically conferred upon it. The police authority holds the funds from
       which expenses for its local police force will be supplied: s. 14. It is inherent in the
33    system (as Mr Baker submitted in reply) that the Chief Constable will apply to the
       authority for authorisation to incur expenditure; it may be for the use of resources such
       as helicopters, or the installation of video surveillance systems in city streets, or a host
36    of other things. No doubt the Chief Constable presents a general budget. We were not
       referred to any provision in statute which shows or suggests that the police authority’s
       power to accede to such requests rests in anything other than the combination of s.6(l)
39    and s.l 11(1). Given this, it seems to me plain that, in the particular context before us
     ' in this case, the legitimate scope of the ancillary power provided by s. 111(1) cannot be
       restricted so as to support only those powers and duties which are expressly conferred
42    on the police authority. Those powers and duties are themselves ancillary; though they
       are very important, they take second place to the Chief Constable’s tactical role, and
       second place also to the Secretary of State’s strategic role. S. 111(1) must in context
45    (whatever it does in other cases) allow' the police authority to support what its express
       Dowers and duties also support; and this is no less than its general function conferred

by s.6(1). If that is right, the authority may in principle decide to fund officers’ legal
representation in proceedings no less than they may fund any other activity which the
Chief Constable might propose as being conducive to “the maintenance of an
efficient and effective police force for its area”.

               This result is supported, if only ex silentio, by the decision of this court
in R v Derbyshire Police Authority ex p. Wilson (8 August 1989, unreported save in
The Times). The court had to consider a decision of the police authority not to
contribute to the legal expenses of two police officers in relation to an auditor’s
enquiry. The court assumed that s.4 of the Police Act 1964 (the predecessor of s.6(1))
provided the power to grant financial assistance. However the point of principle was
not argued. The applicants also point to other materials. In 1962 the report of the
Royal Commission on the Police was published. It indicated the then current practice
in relation to the provision of financial support to police officers in civil proceedings,
which included a requirement that “a constable must have acted in good faith in the
intended execution of his duty” (para 196(a)). Para 197 stated:

          “In England and Wales a distinction is made between a private prosecution,
          in which the decision as to the support of the constable will be taken on the
          same basis as in the case of a civil action, and a public prosecution brought
          by the police or the Director of Public Prosecutions.”

Home Office Circular 77/1987, published on 4 December 1987, stated:

          “... acting in pursuance of its general statutory duty to maintain an
          adequate and efficient police force for its area, the police authority has
          discretion to meet expenditure incurred by officers in all kinds of legal
          proceedings w'here the officers have acted in good faith in pursuance of
          their duties, or the interests of the force as a whole are involved...
          [Then under the heading “Private Prosecutions”]
          A police officer should be able to carry out his duties in the confidence that,
          if he acts in good faith and exercises his judgment reasonably, his police
          authority will support him. If, in a case where a member of the public
          brings a prosecution against an officer, the authority is satisfied that the
          officer has acted in this way, the authority should provide or fund legal
          advice and/or representation.”

  On 17 February 1998 Home Office Circular 4/1998 was published. Unlike its
predecessor it sits on the fence as regards tHe power of a police authority to fund
defences to private prosecutions. It has no persuasive effect one way or the other upon
the issues in these proceedings. The earlier Circular, though obviously not a source of
law, may possibly possess some force as regards the purposes to be fulfilled by
s.6(l)’s predecessor in s.4(l) of the Police Act 1964: see per Scarman LJ as he then
was in Bristol DC v Clark [1975] 3 AER 976, referred to in Wilson. But there are
great dangers in treating government pronouncements, however helpful, as an aid to
statutory construction. I would prefer to base my conclusion, that s.l 11(1) in principle

     empowers the SYPA to support D and M’s defence (and their participation in the
     judicial review against the DPP), upon those considerations touching the correct
 3    construction of the material statutory provisions which I have already set out.

                     If my Lords agree with this conclusion, it is enough to dispose of the
 6     case in the applicants’ favour. However we heard much argument on the question
      whether s.6(l) conferred on the police authority any power, in any circumstances, to
      take action not otherwise expressly authorised. This engages Miss Baxendale’s
 9    proposition (a) as I have described it, and her reliance on the expressio unius est
      exclusio alterius doctrine. It only has relevance if I am wrong to hold, as I have done,
      that s. 111(1) in principle enables the SYPA to fund D and M even if s.6(l) does not
12   itself empower the authority to do anything. In this context I will deal only (and that
      shortly) with s.88(4) of the Act of 1996, which as I have said is the high water-mark of
      this part of Miss Baxendale’s argument.
15
                    S.88 contains a comprehensive scheme as to liability on the part of the
     police for torts. By ss.(l) the chief officer of police for a police area is liable in
18    respect of torts committed by constables under his direction and control in the
      performance or purported performance of their functions. Without this provision there
      would be no such liability because police officers are not servants but office-holders.
21   Ss.(2) provides in part:

                 “There shall be paid out of the police fund -
24
                           (a) any damages or costs awarded against the chief officer of police
                           in any proceedings brought against him by virtue of this section and
27                         any costs incurred by him in any such proceedings so far as not
                           recovered by him in the proceedings...”

30   Ss. (4) provides>
             “A police authority may, in such cases and to such extent as appear to it to
             be appropriate, pay out of the police fund -
33
                           (a) any damages or costs awarded against a person to whom this
                           subsection applies in proceedings for a tort committed by that
36                         person,

                           (b) any costs incurred and not recovered by such a person in such
39                         proceedings, and

                           (c) any sum required in connection with the settlement of a claim
42                         that has or might have givenrise to such proceedings.”

     In my judgment this provision offers no support for Miss Baxendale’s reliance on the
45   exclusio alterius rule. S.88 is self-standing. It has no implications for the general reach
     of the police authority’s functions. And once s.88(4) was to allow the police authority

         to cover damages awarded against an officer in a tort action, it is no surprise that it
         covers costs as well. If it did not, there might well be an argument - based on the
         exclusio alterius rule - that costs were deliberately excluded.


     5                   In all these circumstances I do not think it necessary to go into the
          legislative history of s.6(1), or to canvass the arguments which were addressed to us as
          to the construction or effect of its predecessor, s.4(l) of the Police Act 1964. In the
     9   end there are two possibilities: s.6(1) empowers the police authority to do things, or it
          does not. I have so far proceeded on the assumption asserted by Miss Baxendale that it
          does not; but given that assumption, nevertheless for reasons I have sought to explain
 12      the SYPA possesses in principle the legal power to fund D and M.

                       In fact I think the better view is that s.6(l) enables the police authority to
£ 10      do things which reasonably support the function which s.6(l) confers. Such a power is
          by no means open-ended. It would not allow the authority to invade the provinces of
          the Chief Constable or the Secretary of State; and this is an important and
 18      considerable constraint.

                          In the course of argument some time was spent, in fairness at the
 21      encouragement of the court, in seeing whether the specific provisions in the Act of
           1996 or the local government legislation, conferring specific powers on the police
          authority, left gaps which only s.6(1) could fill. Points were made about lower ranks’
 24      rights of representation in legal proceedings, which are covered as appropriate by the
           Police Federation; and about the representation of higher ranks in various forms of
           legal proceedings. But the answer to the question we must decide, whether the power
 27       to fund D and M in principle lies in the hands of the SYPA, cannot in my judgment
           depend on a trawl through all the things a police authority is expressly empowered to
           do. The provisions which expressly confer and impose powers and duties on police
 fp        authorities do not constitute an independent code. The police authority’s functions are,
           to use a questionable modernism, symbiotic with those of the Chief Constable and the
           Secretary of State. So judged, and for the reasons I have given, they allow the use of
 33        s. 111(1) to fund officers in the defence of private prosecutions and in judicial review
           proceedings.

 36                     I would allow this application. It will be appropriate to hear counsel as
         to relief, and costs.

Civil Actions Acair.st Individual Police Officers

/   _Alternatively, the plaintiff ray be avarded darages against ar.
individual police officer, though he cannot recover "the damages
 -vice over against the chief officer as veil.   Section 48(4) cf the
Police Act IS54 specifically erpovers a police authority "to such
extent as they think fit" to pay* out of the police fund any darages
or costs avarded against an officer,’ any costs he incurs himself,
and any suns paid in connection vith the settlerent of a claim,
phis   provision    applies  to  actions   against   officers  of the
authority's cvn force, officers cf another force serving the police
area under rutual aid arrar.gerents, and special constables for the
police area.    In considering whether to.give financial assistance
the authority will vish to consider in particular whether the
officer concerned acted in good faith and- exercised his judgement,
reasonably.   VThere the court finds for the officer, he ray seek his
costs from the plaintiff; should the costs not be avarded cr
avarded only in part, the police authority should consider whether
mo reimburse any ccsts not covered,         taking * into account the
reasons, if any, given by the court for failing to award all ccsts


                           :th the chief officer and an individual
police officer nay be brought in sore cases.   In such cases it is
important that any discussion of the rerits and cuantur cf the
proposed settlement should involve all the parties naned in the
  ? “ together vith advisers even if they are represented by
    .fferer.t a d v i s e r s .


Civil Actio-': Ur.d~ — th® Data P IT O t   SCt   r*.C ^


5.    Under sections 22 and 2 3 of the Data Protection Act           ar.
individual vho suffers darage as a result of the inaccuracy, less
cr unauthorised     disci csure   of personal   data  is  entitled to
compensation frcr the data user.     In the absence of any case lav cr.
these provisions,     it is unclear whether the acts covered by
sections 22 and 2 3 a.rcunt to torts, to vhich the guidance in
paragraphs 5 and 7 above applies.     If not, section 48 of the Police
Act IS 64 does not apply.       Hovever, the position is broadly the
sare.     Under section 38 (3) (a) of the 1984 Act constables are
treated as servants of the chief officer for the purposes cf the
Act.    A chief ccnsta_ble is therefore liable for the acts cf his
officers falling vithin sections 22 and 23 in the sare vay as he is
liable for their torts under section 48(1).       The position cf nor.-
police officers is less clear but it is possible that in sere cases
the chief constable right be regarded as having liability for their
acts.   It follows that it vould be proper for the police authority
                                                                               3
to   reet ail costs, including any award cf compensation, arising
        .s liability.    It. should be noted that the liability cf the

' *3         Therefore his cvn care in having instituted a system cf
obtaining, checking and recording data vhich vould reasonably ^guarc.
against error and loss under section 2 3 ( 3 ) cf the Act s h c u l c = e = t
his responsibility under section 22(3) and he should not be ^helc
liable if one cf his officers disregards the system establishes•

10.   nhere compensation is sought frcr an individual officer, the
police authority will v i s h , in considering whether to meet tne
costs which would otherwise fall on the officer, to take account cr
the sane ratters as in exercising their rower under section 4o(4)
cf the Police Act 1964 (see paragraph *7) .      Police authorities
should apply the sane broad principles and in particular, — eet tne
costs cf any compensation awarded against a chief constable where a
non-police officer is at fault and the chief constable is found to
have liability for the actions performed.

but at his own expense since expenses are payable cr.iy to witnesses
and jurors.    An interested party vill normally be entitled to be

'Where the interest cf the force is affected, it vill be appropriate
for the police authority to provide at its expense for the chief

 13.    Separate representation for individual officers whose interest
 is involved may be necessary.         For example, there vill be occasions

 and (b) the police authority considers that such interests shculc
 be represented.         In such cases the authority should give financial
 assistance to the officers.              In considering    (b) above,  the
 authority vill wish in particular to assess whether the officers
 are at risk cf being held to blame for actions in connection vith
 the death to which the inquest relates and vhether any such finding

Tnrrnr.'icfjnn


1.     I: is i—ponan: that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
± t confidence that their police authority will support them, if they act in good faith
and exercise their judgement reasonably. The following guidance, which has been
prepared in consultation with ACPO, the Superintendents Association, the Police
Federation and the Association o f Police Authorities, should be read against this
principle.

Civil Proceedings

2.      T’r.der secrion 88 (1) o f the Police Act .1996 which re-enacts section 4SH) of
the PnH~? Ac: l?n^ chief officers are liable lor tons committed by officers under
their direction and control. Section 8S(2) provides that any damages or costs
awarded against the chief officer and any costs they incur themselves (which are not
recovered) should be met from police authority funds.

3.      Ahematively, a court may award damages against individual police officers.
Section S3(4) c f the Police Ac: 1995 empowers a police authority “to such an extent
as appears to it to be appropriate'’ to pay any damages or costs awarded against
officers (this includes both officers of other forces serving in the police area under
mutual aid arrangements and special constables), any costs incurred by the officers
themselves and any sum paid in connection with the settlement o f a claim. It is for
police authorities to decide when to mahe assistance available, tailing account o f the
circumstances of a particular case.

4.       Police authorities are reminded that the discretionary powers in sections
S S('41 ;=nd_r5'' of the Ac^ enabling them to provide financial assistance to officers
involved In legal proceedings, apply to civil proceedings orJv. Sections SS(4) and
S3(5) may also apply to police officers who were members at the time of the action
which gave rise to the claim but who are no ior.ger members.

Criminal Proceedings

5.      Section 8S(4) does not apply to criminal proceedings, but police authorities
may wish to consult their legal 2 dvisers as to whether they have any other power to
provide such assistance (whether in respect of private prosecutions or prosecutions
brought by the CPS). In this context, they may wish to note that section 111(1) of
the Local Government Act 1972 enables police authorities to do anything “which is
calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of any o f their
functions'1. The provision applies to provincial authorities (but not the Metropolitan
or City o f London police) by virtue of Section 146A of the 1972 Act (as inserted
by Schedule 14 to the Local Government Act 19S5 and amended by Schedule 4 of
the Police and Magistrates’ Courts Act 1994). It could be argued that to allow
payment to be made to officers (either former or serving) involved in criminal
proceedings would in some way facilitate or be conducive to a police authority's
broad functions. For example, failure 10 provide financial assistance could
adversely affect the morale o f the force if officers had to meet their own costs arter



6.      It is for individual police authorities to decide in the particular circumstance
of a case, and on the basis o f legal advice, whether to make f i n a n c i a l assistance
available to officers in criminal proceedings.      —             *

Other types of legal proceeding1;

7.      S'^iisriv rherft is no exDrAC!: sranuory author'tv for providing financial
assistance m nro^ccuings brougnt against pOii<_= officers in tribunals otner than me
v-uuiis. It is for police authorities outside London (bearing in mind the
recommendations of chief officers) to decide whether to make financial assistance
available to officers (either former or serving) involved in Public Inquiries and
Tribunals. Police authorities will therefore need to consider whether section 111(1)
of the Local Government Act 1972 provides sufficient scope to enable financial
assistance to be given in any particular case. In this respect tribunals may include
certain industrial tribunals where it is clear that officers have acted in good faith in
pursuance of their duties and the interest of the force as a whole is involved. It is t
be expected that, where appropriate, the service’s grievance procedure
arrangements should be exhausted before there is recourse to legal proceedings.
These arrangements are set out in Home Office Circular 16/93, issued 10 March



S.      There are srecific provisions in the Race Relations Act 1976 and the Sex
Discrimination Act 1975 for compensation, costs and expenses awarded against the
chief officer of police and any sum required for settlement, if approved by the
police authority, to be paid from the police fund.

9.      There is no express statutory authority for providing financial assistance to
an officer wishing to initiate cou n proceedings. The considerations set out in
rarasranhs 5 to 7 above aoolv to such cases.

                                              OUTLINE SUBMISSIONS

         1. DECISION OF DIVISIONAL COURT

         The Court decided that a Police Authority has power “....but subject to ordinary Law
         principles, to provide financial assistance to police officers and former police officers in
         respect o f their costs and expenses incurred in relation to private prosecutions brought against
         them and judicial review proceedings in which they participate.” The court refused to make
         the decision specific to the two defendants. Furthermore, whilst clarifying the power to fund, -
         the court declined to state when that power should be exercised, that is, whether it should be
         exercised at the start o f proceedings, during them or on their conclusion.

         The Court also refused to set out matters which the Authority should consider or disregard in
         determining whether or not it should provide financial assistance to officers. Indeed, to quote
         Lord Justice Laws: “It is important that the declaration should not indicate any view taken by
         the court, for the court has none, as to whether the financing should actually be provided.”

         2. PREVIOUS SUBMISSIONS BY H FSG

         KFSG continues to rely on the written submissions forwarded to the Authority on 22nd
         December 199S and 5* January-1959 with the exception o f those which touch upon the
         legality o f the funding. The submissions relating to the fourth charge against Mr Duckenheld,
         (attempting to pervert the course o f justice) are also irrelevant at this stage as the DPP has
         discontinued that charge.

         La particular, if the Authority decides that it has power to grant funding prior to any costs
         being incurred, the HSFG relies upon Annex C o f its submissions o f 5!h January (copy
         appended). Annex C contains a summary o f the evidence on the charges o f manslaughter and
         misfeasance.

          3 RELEVANT MATTERS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION

          i)         As a primary submission HFSG strongly disagree with the Chief Constable’s
                     contention that the defendants should have all their costs paid “up front”. Parliament
                     could not have intended to provide for a system which is so open to abuse and
                     manipulation. The previous conduct o f the defendants and their lawyers gives rise to
                     serious concern. In the Judicial Review proceedings the Chief Clerk to South Sefton
                     Magistrates provided affidavit evidence. In his affidavit he stated:-

                     “The defendants’ solicitors each submitted their claims for costs in September 1998. I
                     was extremely surprised at the level o f costs which were being claimed, particularly in
                     view o f the fact that neither o f the defendants or their solicitors had actually appeared
                     before the court in relation to this matter” .

                     Any decision to pay costs “up front” would offend against public policy.

           ii)          Availability' o f legs! aid or alternative sources offending

                        The question o f the extent and scale o f the supply o f money from the public revenue
                        for legal proceedings is a public and controversial issue. Detailed and highly regulated
                        provision is made by the Legai Aid Act. A proposal to give police officers a more
                        expensive and privileged facility at public expense than is available to others would be
                        deeply contentious and socially divisive.

                        The legal aid scheme is available to a defendant but not to a prosecutor. Section 1 o f
                        the Legal Aid Act 1988 declares that its purpose is to establish a framework for the
                        provision o f advice, assistance, and representation which is publicly funded with a view
                        to helping persons who might otherwise be unable to obtain the same on account o f
                        their means. According to Judicial Statistics for 1998, almost everyone who applies
                        for legal aid for criminal proceedings is awarded it. If a defendant is ordered to make a
                        contribution, the Court can remit such an order or order that any contribution should
                        be repaid where there has been an acquittal.

                        In addition, if press reports are correct, it would appear that the Superintendents’
                        Association are prepared to consider funding the defendants if approached. The
                        Association certainly contributed to their legal costs in the recent Judicial Review
                        proceedings.

            iii)        Whether the applicant for financial support has yet been found guilty or acquitted. A
                        police authority’s funds should not be paid to an officer who is said to be criminally
                        liable in his personal capacity. An officer who is iater acquitted should receive his
                        costs from central funds or from the private prosecutor. An officer who is later
                        convicted should not be funded by the Police Authority.

            iv)         The extent to which financial support from the Authority, during the course o f
                        proceedings might preclude an award o f costs in those proceedings in favour o f the
                        individual so supported. (It is clear from the assistance presently sought by the
                        defendants that the Oerk to South Sefton Justices has not yet decided whether the
                        defendants costs can be met from central funds.)

            v)          The extent o f financial support previously granted to the defendants. During the
                        Judicial Review proceedings, KFSG became aware for the first time that both
                        defendants had their legal costs paid by the Authority throughout the 80 day inquest.
                        Both had separate legal representation. The costs o f this must have been quite
                         staggering, Families paid £3,500 each for block representation at the inquest. Further,
                         the amount expended to date in the criminal proceedings must be quite considerable.
                         It is clear that open ended funding encourages delaying tactics and costmongering.

            vi)         responsibility to serving officers in South Yorkshire Police not to deplete the already
                         overstretched resources o f the Police Authority..

            vii)         South Yorkshire Police, presumably with the support o f the Authority has always
                         accepted that the deaths of the 96 victims were caused by negligence.

                                                             Page 2 o f 3
'99 12:27      01512361936                  H F S G               -->01132079001                        Pg.




 viii)     South Yorkshire Police have accepted, or at least have never challenged, the findings
           o f Lord Taylor that the negligence o f which the defendants are accused was “a blunder
           o f the first magnitude” and an immediate cause o f death.

 ix)       The negligence o f which the defendants are accused cannot on any view o f the facts be
           attributed to a “split-second decision”.

 x)        The PC A directed in July 1991 that the defendants should face disciplinary charges o f
           neglect o f duty. Mr Duckenfield also faced a charge o f discreditable conduct. (At that
           time, Mr Duckenfield had been suspended from duty for two years.) Two weeks after
           the PCA direction, Mr Duckenfield, though suspended, went on “sick leave” . The
           Chief Constable retired him from the force on “medical grounds” in November 1991.
           The charge against him, therefore, lapsed. In January 1992 it was then considered
           unfair to proceed against Mr Murray. Next year, Mr Murray, too retired from the
           force on “health grounds”.

 xi)       The interests o f the defendants and the Chief Constable may be different in this case.
            It is in the interests o f justice that the defendants are represented by lawyers who are
            not paid for by a police authority whose Chief Constable has a powerful interest in
            maintaining exclusive control over so many documents o f relevance to the criminal
            case. Justice must be seen to be done.

  xii)     The DPP has decided that there is a case to answer. The Divisional Court has refused
           to overturn that decision. This surely is an indication o f the strength o f the case
           against the defendants and undermines previous decisions not to prosecute.

         FUTURE CONDUCT OF PROCEEDINGS

  The Defendants are, o f course, entitled to legal representation and HFSG has no wish to deny
  them access to proper legal representation. If the Authority’ does decide to fund them, then
  strict conditions should be attached to the funding to ensure value for money. Checks and
 (balances have to be imposed. Regular reviews should be undertaken by the members o f the
  Authorin' themselves.

                       David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray, then respectively a Chief Superintends.': and-
                       a Superintendent in the South Yorkshire Police Force, were on duty in the ccntro: box
                       a: Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15th April 1989. when a semi-final o f the F.A.
                       cup was ;o be played between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football clubs
                       A::?.ched are chapters 1 to 5. 9 to 11, and 16 o f the Taylor Report. The facts set cut
                       therein form the basis o f the allegations against the two potential defendants. These
                       extracts from the Taylor report are attached as A nnex J).

                        Other sections o f the Taylor report make other criticisms o f the police in general, and
                        o f other bodies.

                        Lord Taylor said at paragraph 265 o f his report:

                               “The immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster wss
                               the failure, when Gate C was opened, to cut off access to the central pens
                               which were already overfull.”

                       The evidence o f forensic pathologists called at the mini inquests in 1990 was that in
                       almost all cases death resulted rapidly from unconsciousness that was caused by the
                       crushmg that followed the inrush o f spectators, in full view o f the two men, following
                       the order to open the gates, and a failure to diver: the incoming spectators from pens 3



                       Mr Duckenfieid was in overall charge, and primarily responsible for the decisions and
                       iack o f decisions which led to the crushing. Mr Murray shares in this responsibility He
                       knew the ground better Ke had been in an important position o f responsibility at the
                       identical semi-final the year before, when the Liverpool supporters were also at the
                       Leppings Lane end o f the ground. A similar concentration o f supporters in the pens 3
                       and 4 had occurred but crushing had been avoided by the simple expedient of diverting
                       the incoming supporters from the tunnel which led to those overcrowded pens.

                6       In 1989. Mr Duckenfield was entitled to call on Mr Murray’s experience., Mr Murray,
                        like Mr Duckenf:e!d failed, in breach o f his duty, to take, demand or recommend the
                        obvious steps to avoid the obvious dangers.

                7      The decision to open the gates without raking steps to divert the oncoming spectators
                       was, in the wo res o f Lord Taylor, a “blunder o f the first magnitude" and was an
                       immediate (and therefore substantia!) cause o f death. The. decision w as taken by
                       Duckenfieid. with the agreement or acquiescence o f Murray.

           3         The witness statements already provided to the defence provide cogent evidential
                     support for the manslaughter and misfeasance allegations, combined with admissions
                     o f fact made by each defendant in his various statements, and evidence to the Inquest
                     and the Taylor Inquiry. Many exhibits such as videos, photographs, plans etc,
                     gathered and prepared for the purposes o f the Taylor Inquiry by the West Midlands
                     Police, are not to hand because the South Yorkshire police have so far refused to hand
                     them over.

           Some fear ures o f the prosecution evidence already served.

           9         In the course of. and after, the “Scrutiny", many statements became available to the
                     HFSG which it had never seen before, because the South Yorkshire police controlled
                     the entire archive o f statements and exhibits. The statements o f 35 witnesses have
                     been served now on the defence, and show as follows. In 19SS police officers diverted
                     spectators away from the tunnel leading to those pens, (eg Hilton). The unedited
                     statements o f the officers White and Lang prove the same, and suggest that it had been
                     the practice o f senior officers to ensure that the tunnel was closed when the pens were
                     full, something that could be seen easily by Inspector White from the steps near the
                     Control Box. This police evidence was suppressed until 1998. (The question of
                     eoutng statements is discussed below.) In 19S9, when the gate was opened, a rush of
                     people carried spectators straight into the tunnel, and it was impossible to turn back
                     (Cook).

                      i here was r.o obvious alternative to the tunnel (Harvey. Murray. Feliowes. Southern.)
                     Tnere was r.o diversion away from this tunnel (Ocger. Murphy, Langley). Spectators
                     had to go wi;h the crowd, for fear of falling underfoot. (Edwards). Spectators were
                     carried by the surge o f people into the tunnel when Gate C was opened. (Anderson.
                     Burns, Campbell.) The centra! pens in the terraces were packed at 2.50 pm (Blayr.ey.
                     Mullec). PC Gires: said tha: at 2.40 it was not going to be possible to accommodate
                     the crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrance in those pens. P.C. Walpole says the
                     overcrowding was obvious at 2.55pm. P.C Brooks says the central pens were too fj.'i
                     at 2.50pm.

           / he pos,‘     o f the defendants

           1!        Duckenfieldand Murray were in the Control Box. They could see the central pens.
                     Closed circuit television gave them an even better view of the pens. Five minutes after
                     Superintendent Marshall had asked for help to relieve possibly life-threatening pressure
                     at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane, Duckenfield, with the acquiescence and tacit
                     support o f Murray, finally ordered the gate to be opened without closing o ff access to
                     the already crowded pens. Thousands surged in: the deaths o f 96 people were the
                     immediate and direct consequence. Murray had been on duty at the semi-final in 19S8
                     in the Control Box. He culpably failed in 1989 to give the proper and obvious advice.
                     Duckenfield, in Lord Taylor’s words, “froze”. Both defendants admit their presence in
                     the Control Box, 2 nd Duckenf.eld admits that he lied about matters shortly afterwards,
                     saying the Liverpool supporters broke open the gate. It is a travesty c f the case to
                     suggest that it concerns a “split-second decision.”

                  (Taylor Inquiry. 24/5 p ! 16) in preparation for the match. He does not dispute that he
                  appreciated the problems o f tunnel and pens. He was aware o f the central tunnel, (p
                  113)

         14       He accepted that fans were likely to gravitate towards the central tunnel, if they liked
                  to watch the game from the back of the goal (24/5/89, p 119), and that the obvious
                  way to the terracing was through the tunnel; anyone coming in would gravitate
                  towards the tunnel, whether or not he wanted to go directly behind the g o a l..

         15       Ducker.f.eld's defence, at first, was that crowd management and filling o f pens was not
                  a police responsibility but that o f the club (120), but later he said he did appreciate the
                  importance o f ensuring that there was no overcrowding in the pens. ( I24B) He sr.ic
                  that officers at the back, that is, in the concourse behind the tunnel, should k n o w the
                  problems. Inspector White knew the location (127). Duckenf:e!c’s own document
                  emphasised that “cur job is to ensure the safety of spectators” (137)

          u:      Duckenfield noticed by 2.30 that there was a concentration in pens 3 and 4 and asked
                  the spectators to move forward and spread along the terraces. (25/5 page 1213)- In
                  performing his duties, he was acting on the “advice" o f Superintendent Murray (2SA)
                  About 2.44 pm it was becoming clear that they were not going to get all the cro’^ c in
                  by 3 pm (33A -3). Duckentlelc appreciated that opening gates was “likely to cause
                  potential problems Inside" (page 39).

          !7      D'jckenfielc conceded that when the second request came to open the gate's, that was
                  the time when he thought about where they would go. (413). There was o f course
                  five minute between the first request and the command to open the gates. He knew
                  that ii was p r e tty crow ded in central sections; and that the tunnel gave on to those ire
                  central suctions: that they would want to g et to positions as cpiickly as possible; and
                  tha' they w ould take the obvious, easiest route to terraces. (25'hM ay. p 43G-H). h e
                  d id not then think o f the tunnel. He might then have given instructions to close the
                  tunnel, hut hti d id not because he d id not think o f the risk.

          3S      Duckenfieid then conceded, however, that he had said in his statement “I watched the
                  Leppings Lane terraces intently for any developments as a result o f the gates opening.
                  (47D-E) “ I was concerned to see what the effects o f opening the gates and allowing
                  people into the ground would have." (47E-F.) “There was a possibility o f
                  overcrowding everywhere." (52G)

          19       Duckenfieid accepted that “I made a mistake but in fact other officers should have
05 ' 9 9 1 2 : 3 0       01512361936               H F S G               -->01132079001                     Pg. 08




                     remecied tha: mistake by using the:r initiative." (92B). He would have expected tha:
                     an inspector or individual officers would have raced to the tunnel and taken action.
                     (933). (O f course, only those in the Control Box had sight o f al! relevant parts of tha:
                     end c f the ground and the area behind the turnstiles).

                     On 26MMay I9S9, Duckenfield accepted that it was important to warn police officers
                     and stewards inside the ground that the gates were to be opened. Supt Murray took on
                     the responsibility o f trying to contact Lock o f Sheffield Wednesday, (page 10-11) Ke
                     also told Lord Taylor that he knew when Gate A opened that a serial o f officers
                     rormed a funnel to divert them from seeking to enter the stands, where entry was by
                     special ticket. There were'r.o such arrangements for the tunnel. This important
                     evidence shows forethought about the consequences o f opening the gates, and made
                     the possibility o f crushing even more obvious.

                     s ne prosecution will invite a court to conclude that these admissions show gross
                     negligence, causative o f death; and furthermore, they will submit tha: they disclose ?.
                     wanton and perhaps angry disregard for the safety o f people in the pens, when other
                     psopie, whom Duckenfieid regarded as o f the same ilk. were causing him ?. serious
                     problem outside the ground.

                     i:. alternatively, these facts suggest incompetence, and a very bad or crass attempt to
                     avoia an already dangerous situation, attention is drawn to R v. Bateman (1925) 10
                     Cr. App. R. S, approved by the House c f Lords in R v. Adom ako, in which
                     incompetence in a person exercising specialised or expert functions was held capable
                     c: amounting to gross negligence (in tha: case the defendant was a doctor)


                ■Jen e      nst M urray an M anslaughter an d Misfeasance

                         is submitted that the responsibility c f Murray for manslaughter and misfeasance is if
                     anytnmg greater than Duckenf’eid's. The following extracts from his evidence to the
                      i aylor Inquiry' and Inquest are relied on for the purposes o f the present review, as
                     evicer.ce c f these two offences.

         ■L-.        Murray had occupied the same role in 1988 and 1589 and had written a report on the
                     mater, afterwards, in May 1988. He had taken a leading part in policing a Hillsborough
                     game between Sheffield Wednesday and Liverpool in January 1989, (Taylor Inquiry.
                     3 1/i. p 63). ( His involvement was well summarised in cross-examination at ls! June
                      1989, page I, by Mr Woodward: he had been involved in the 1988 semi-final; the
                     review o f the 1988 semi-final; and the planning and preparation for the 1989 sem i-.
                     final. A copy o f his review in May 19S8 o f the 1988 game was read out at to him a: the
                     Inquest (Day 67. page 140)).

         25          i he
                        pens were often filled up in accordance with directions from the Control Box.
                     Omcers would direct fans down the tunnel. This did not apply to the semi-final,
                     however. No officers were briefed to keep a specific eye on the filling o f pens 3 and 4
                     15/4. (31/5, p 67). Neither Duckenfield nor Murray gave instructions at oral briefing.

                        v'ur:?.y’s rose was overall charge o f the Control Room and adviser to Duck'

                        Murray said his role was as “adviser” to Duckeriield. (68D-E). The policy was to let
                        the fans “find their own level" (75B). At about 2.30 pm, “I did not consider whether
                        there was room in any particular pen. I vyas locking at the terrace as a whole ar.d the
                        North Stand and the West Stand.” Murray thought there were gates which supporters
                        used to move between pens.

            27          Murray conceded that no instruction was given to close o fn h e tunnel to any police
                        officers or stewards, and that there may have been four requests to open the gates
                        (3 1/5/89. p 92). The request was to open the gates “in the plural".

            2S          It ’.s submitted that Murray’s account at page 93G is in effect an admission to criminal
                        recklessness. H e admitted at E, “When I saw the gates opened I was obviously
                        looking in that [pens 3 ar.d 4] direction". It was put to Him that "the obvious phvce to
                        for them to go was down the tunnel:

                                “It is r.ovv that I know. I know the ground. I know where the tunnel is. I
                               know where C gats is. I had never drawn any sort o f realisation that people
                               coniine through C gate would go towards the tunnel, or whatever, I have never
                               envisaged C gate as an entry gate o f course, but the two things did n.oi register,
                               cid r.o* tie up. It seemed so obvious after the event but certainly I gave it no
                               thought and r.o realisation before.”

            29          In cross-examination, Murray emphasised that he thought tha: fans could move from
                        pen ic pen. However, he conceded that pens 3 and 4 filed up first because they were
                        popular; and they tended to fill up to the back ( 1 18D-F)

            30          I: Is submitted tha: this fact makes his assertions that supporters could walk through
                        the gates between the pens meaningless and irrelevant, when thousands were pouring
                        through gates that had been opened to relieve a terrible and constantly intensifying
                        crush. Murray conceded to Mr Woodward, for South Yorkshire police, tha: at 2 -6.
                        according tc photographs, the terraces looked “pretty full". (1/6/89, page 3)

                        In answer to questions from Lord Taylcr, Murray seemed tc acknowledge that it had
                        been an option for the police to fill up the pens in series at the match (17)

                        At the Inquest. Murray accepted that he had full authority to take steps to avoid the
                        risk to occupants o f the ground as a result o f opening the gates, had he recognised
                        such a risk. (Day 67, page 3 1B-C). He would not have been dependent on
                        Duckenfield’s authorisation for any such steps.

                        .Murray accepted at page 43D that the police “had a role to play as regards the
                        distribution o f spectators across the Leppings Lane terraces.” See also 45A. At page
                        48C, he accepted that the police had a duty to monitor the build-up and filling o f the
                        terraces before kick-up. At page 56B-D, he accepted that “there may well have come a
                        time when it w as necessary “ for him to divert supporters from the central pens. (It is

                                                                 5

                the prosecution case that he should have put in hand this diversion in any event,
                because the outer pens were sparely occupied).

        34      He accepted tha: if it had been brought to his attention that the central pens were run.
                and there was space in the side pens, he would have taken seme action. 53D-E. I: is
                the prosecution case that that fact was abundantly clear to anyone who looked.

        3 5     Murray accepted ihat he could have got manpower to block the tunnel in the five
                minutes that Duckentleld was considering the request that the gates be opened. (773
                and 78 A) He knew that the tunnel was in tha: pan o f the concourse, (pace S5C-S/E)

        36      It is submitted that once it is shown by photographs, video recordings and television
                 film that the pens were effectively full, or ever, nearly full, at the time the gates were
                 open, the cases against both Murray and Duckenfield becomes very powerful. The
                 state o f the pens was clearly visible from the Control Box and on the cameras,
                 equipped with “zoom" facilities, in that Box.

        37      The nature c f the relationship between Murray and Duckenfield is not manifest from
                 the evidence, but it may be inferred that there was at least coolness between them
                 Duckenfieid was entitled to look to Murray for advice and support. Duckenfieid had
                 been promoted to a higher rank than Murray very recently. Murray was three years
                 cider, ar.d more experienced at policing c f this kind. The question by Murray. "Are
                 you going to open the Gates, Mr Duckenfieid?" does not show a warm or co­
                 operative relationship.

        3 3     i: is submitted that the Police Complaint Authority rightly recognised that the charge
                  o f neglect was “joint". The reckless c t grossly negligent decision to open the gates
                  without closing o ff the pens was the responsibility o f both defendants.

        3v      The evidence becoming available, and previously concealed, about practices in iQSS,
                adds to the weight c f the evidence. It suggests that other evidence exists, proving
                fur.her the element c f foreseeability. However, even without that new 19SS evidence,
                ar.d irrespective c f the belief that the South Yorkshire Police is guarding much mors
                evidence showing cross negligence, it is submitted that there is powerful’evidence
                 against both defendants.

        40      It is not proposed to se: out further evidence, giver, by ether police officers, about tr.e
                 conduct o f the tw o defendants. The prosecution may call some o f them as witnesses,
                 as they think appropriate after a review o f the Sheffield archive, once it becomes
                 available.

        41      Ail these facts, drawn from the Taylor report and the available evidence, are to be
                 contrasted with Mr Dair.es’ inappropriate suggestion that funding by the SYPA was
                 necessary to maintain morale among officers who had to make “split second
                 decisions."

              die extent that measures there cccmiced w oe applied to polite authorities by
              s.!45A(l) of th* Act of 1972. The powers so conferred are Ksted in a helpful note
              provide by Miss Bcteadale. I do net propose to set them 0UL They include (apart
              from s. 111(1)) such matters-as fee,;disposition and treatment of staff ted the

     12                     The critical point which in a y judgmear enlarges from 1 consideration
             of the interlocking roles of Chief Constable. Secretsry of Sate and police authority is
                  it csaaot hsve been within the conuanplarion of Parliament in enacting the
             scheme, tad in embracing within it s. 111(1), tint the police authority should only be
             empowered to incur expenditure in support of those duties, and aaciliiry powers,
             *tich are speeinwUy conferred upon it. The police authority holds the .funds from
     18     which expenses for its local police force will be supplied: s. 14. It is inherent in the
            system ( « Mr Baker submitted in reply) that the Qs'ef Constable will apply to the
            authority for euthcrisaticn to incur expenditure; it may be for the use of resources ruch
 21
            is helicopters, or the installation of video surveillance systems in city streets, or a host
            o f other things. No doubt the Chief Ccnsable presents a general budget. We were not
           referred to to y provision in statute which shows o r yuggwts that the police sodiority’s
 24        power to accede to such requests rests in anything other ihta the combination of s.6(l)

      Dear Sirs

      R - v - South Yorkshire Police Authority ex pa rte C hief Constable o f South Yorkshire
      Police

      We refer to recent correspondence, and Mr Eastwood’s discussion with Mr Harlock in
      regal'd to the further Opinion from Mr Clegg QC we have provided. We confirm that this is
      to be treated as confidential to your firm and the South Yorkshire Police Authority and not
      to be released further without reference to ourselves or Leading Counsel.

      We are grateful for vour fax confirming the venue for Friday’s meeting and will await
      further advice as to the time when we are expected to attend for the oral submissions. In
      this regard, we have o f course seen the Skeleton Argument submitted on behalf o f Mr
      Murray, and have discussed this at length with Mr Manning o f Walker Morris. In the
      interests o f cost-effectiveness, and given that much o f that Skeleton deals with matters
      relating to both Defendants, we will not be submitting a separate Skeleton Argument but
      naturally will adopt the submissions made by Mr Manning. We will, in an oral submission,
       ’eal with particular aspects relating to Mr Duckenfield, as set out in previous
      correspondence, and one or two other aspects which arise from the history o f this matter.

      Naturally i f you require any further information or assistance prior to Friday’s meeting
      please let us know.

      Yours faithfully

1      PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT

The purpose of this report is to consider:

1.1    the judgment of the High Court on 31 March 1999, in response to the Chief
       Constable's application for judicial review of the Authority's decisions taken
       on 5 February 1999 ("The Powers Judicial Review"), that the Authority does
       have legal power to provide financial assistance to current and former police
       officers, so long as that power is exercised on normal public law principles;

1.2    the legal effect of decisions taken by the Authority in 1998 to provide financial
       assistance to Mr David Duckenfield (who w as the Divisional Commander,
       then holding the rank of Chief Superintendent in charge of the police
       operations on the day of the Hillsborough Stadium disaster) and Mr Bernard
       Murray (who was the Sub-Divisional Commander, then holding the rank of
       Superintendent, w ho w as also on duty at the match) in relation to private
       prosecutions alleging manslaughter, wilful neglect of a public duty and
       (against Mr Duckenfield) intentionally perverting the course of justice (the
       "Leeds Criminal Proceedings" and the "South Sefton Criminal Proceedings")
       brought by Ms Ann Adlington, Solicitor, on behalf of the Hillsborough
       Family Support Group ("HFSG");

1.3    the legal effect of the decisions taken bv the Authority on 5 February 1999 to
       reverse the earlier decisions to award funding for the criminal proceedings to
       Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray;

1.4    new applications for financial assistance from Mr Duckenfield and Mr
       Murray to meet their respective legal costs and disbursements in the
       following proceed!: tgs:

       1.4.1    the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings, which were discontinued on
                jurisdictional grounds;

       1.4.2   the Leeds Criminal Proceedings which are continuing;

       1.4.3   the judicial review (the "DPP Judicial Review"), judgment in respect
                of which was given on 31 March 1999, of the decision of the Director
                of Public Prosecutions not to intervene to take over the conduct of
                the private prosecutions referred to in paragraph 1.2 above which
                resulted in the charge of wilfully perverting the course of justice




                                             1
                against Mr Duckenfield being withdrawn but no intervention in the
                other criminal proceedings against the former officers;

       1.4.4    the Powers Judicial Review, in which an award of the former officers'
                legal costs was made against Ms Adlington (so that only the balance
                of their legal costs, after Ms Adlington's contribution, would be
                payable by the Authority if it grants the former officers' application);
                and

       1.4.5    a potential judicial review ("the South Sefton Judicial Review’") of an
                adverse ruling by the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices (should one
                be made) in respect of claims made for the payment of Mr
                Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's costs from central funds (which to
                the extent that the Authority is legally bound to provide assistance in
                relation to the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings w’ould effectively
                be for the benefit of the Authority).



2     RECOMMENDATIONS

The Authority is recommended to consider this report, the appendices to it and all
other relevant material put to it and:

2.1   subject to being satisfied on the issues referred to in paragraph 7.6.7 below, to
       resolve to pay Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's reasonable and proper
       legal expenses incurred up to 5 February 1999 in relation to the Leeds
       Criminal Proceedings and to request a legal costs draftsman to review the
       expenses claimed a n d /or apply to the court for an assessment of the costs
       under section 71 Solicitors Act 1974 so as to have those reasonable and proper
       costs determined;

2.2   defer a decision in relation to the costs of the South Sefton Criminal
       Proceedings and the South Sefton Judicial Review' until the Court Clerk's
       decision in relation to the payment of Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's
       costs from central funds is known;

2.3   defer a decision on the application for financial assistance in respect of the
       Powers Judicial Review, pending assessment and payment of Ms Adlington's
       contribution to those costs; and
consider the options set out in paragraph 9 of this report in relation to the
applications for financial assistance for costs incurred in the DPP Judicial
Review and, since 5 February 1999, in the Leeds Criminal Proceedings and if
the Authority decides to approve financial assistance for those costs to do so
on terms which limit the Authority's financial exposure.



THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - KEY EVENTS FROM 15
APRIL 1989

15 April 1999:    FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool Football Club and
Nottingham Forest Football Club at Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield
Wednesday's ground.       Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped
w hen it w as realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal
had been severely crushed. As a result, 96 people died and over 400 received
hospital treatment.

17 April 1989: Lord Justice Taylor was appointed

"to carry out an inquiry into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football
Ground of 15 April 1989 and to make recommendations about the needs of
crowd control and safety at sports events".

17 April 1989: Geoffrey Dear QPM, Chief Constable of West Midlands Police,
appointed to carry out independent investigation of the disaster and gather
evidence.

19 April 1989: West Midlands Police assumed responsibility for the inquiry.

HM Coroner opened and adjourned inquests on 95 deaths that had already
occurred as a result of the disaster (the death of the last victim to die, Mr Tony
Bland, occurring at a later date).

4 August 1989:      Having head the oral testimony of over 170 witnesses
between 15 May and 19 June 1989, Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report w'as
made public. He found that the immediate cause of the gross over-crowrding
which had taken place, and thus of the disaster, had been the failure to cut off
access to the central pens behind the goal (which were already over full)
w hen gate C was opened. He found also a number of contributing factors
including the Club's "confused and inadequate signs and ticketing", police
planning, police operations on the day, "the presence of an unruly minority




                                     3
       who had drunk too much" and interaction of parties responsible for safety
       issues. In respect of police operations on the day, Lord Justice Taylor in his
       Interim Report, said (at paragraph 278)

       ’’although there were other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the
       failure of police control".

       The then Chief Constable, Peter Wright, referred the questions of
       manslaughter, by criminal negligence, to the Director of Public Prosecutions
       for a decision as to criminal liability.

3.7    15 August 1989:      Director of Public Prosecutions recommended that the
       matter should be subject of a criminal investigation. Mr Dear, Chief Constable
       of West Midlands Police, was invited to undertake this investigation. He was
       also asked that if he discovered any matters against the Police (Discipline)
       Regulations, he should enquire into them on behalf of South Yorkshire Police.

3.8    30 November 1989: Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police,
       offered in conjunction with insurers to open negotiations with representatives
       of the bereaved to resolve all bona fide civil claims for compensation without
       having to await the outcome of legal hearings.

3.9    15 December 1989: Agreement reached with representatives of the bereaved
       for settlement of civil actions without a decision as to liability.

3.10   December 1989: Full criminal and disciplinary investigation formally
       commenced.
                                                                                          )
3.11   18 lanuarv 1990: Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report was published.

3.12   31 March 1990:       Mr Dear's report was submitted to Director of Public
       Prosecutions.

3.13   6 August 1990: Two leading Counsel provide a joint opinion to the DPP
       advising that there was insufficient evidence to warrant prosecutions.

3.14   30 August 1990: Director of Public Prosecutions Allan Green QC, concluded
       that there was insufficient evidence upon which                a prosecution for
       manslaughter, or any other criminal offence, could be brought against any
       officer in the South Yo-kshire Police, or any other person.




                                             4
    3.15   19 November 1990 to 28 March 1991: HM Coroner resumed inquests on 95
           deaths in the Hillsborough Disaster. Jury returned a verdict of accidental
           death.

    3.16   7 December 1990:       South Yorkshire Police Authority approved financial
           assistance for 6 officers including Mr David Duckenfield and Mr Bernard
           Murray in connection with legal proceedings relating to the inquest.

    3.17   7 Mav 1991:     The Police Complaints Authority recommended discipline
           charges to be brought against Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and
           Superintendent Murray.

^   3.IS   11 Tulv 1991:     The Police Complaints Authority directed that Chief
           Superintendent Duckenfield should face four disciplinary charges of Neglect
           of Duty and one of Discreditable Conduct.        In addition, Superintendent
           Murray should face one charge of Neglect of Duty.

    3.19   November 1991:        Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retired on medical
           grounds, having been on sick leave for some time.

    3.20   13 Tanuarv 1992: Police Complaints Authority gave leave not to proceed with
           the discipline charge against Superintendent Murray, as it w ould be
           inappropriate and unjust to pursue the charge against him alone, in the
           absence of his superior officer. Sometime thereafter, Superintendent Murray
           went on sick leave.

    3.21   26 August 1992: Superintendent Murray retired on medical grounds.

    3.22   6 April 1993: The relatives of six deceased were granted leave for judicial
           review into the inquest verdicts. The)' sought certiorari to quash the jury's
           verdict.

    3.23   5 November 1993: The judicial review concluded that the inquest verdicts
           should not be overturned.

    3.24   December 1993: Inquest held by HM Coroner for West Yorkshire into the
           death of Tony Bland (the 96th victim of Hillsborough). A verdict of accidental
           death was returned.

    3.25   5 December 1996: The drama "Hillsborough" written by Jimmy McGovern on
           behalf of Granada Television was broadcast to the ITV Network. Following
           this programme further material was submitted to the Hom e Office on behalf
      of the HF5G. That material related in particular to video evidence of the
      disaster and medical evidence about the time of death of the victims.

      30 Tune 1997: The Home Secretary made an oral statement to the House of
      Commons during the course of which he stated:

                     "Madam Speaker, my Department, the office of the Attorney
                     General and the Crown Prosecution Service have considered
                     very carefully all the evidence which has been put forward in
                     recent months.

                     The Director of Public Prosecutions has taken the view that the
                     material so far presented to her would not justify fresh
                     criminal investigations. The then Attorney General also took       )
                     the view, again on the material presented to him, that any
                     application to the High Court for a new inquest would not
                     have am- realistic prospect of succeeding.

                     Nonetheless, I am acutely conscious that the families of those
                     who died at Hillsborough and many others including Hon
                     Members of this House are very concerned that unresolved
                     issues remain. I am determined to go as far as I can to ensure
                     that no matter of significance is overlooked and that w e do not
                     reach a final conclusion without a full and independent
                     examination of the evidence.

                     I can therefore tell the House today that the Attorney General,    )
                     the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is
                     in the public interest that there should be an independent
                     scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
                     evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously
                     available. We are appointing Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a
                     senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal, for that purpose".

.27   18 February 1998: Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report w as presented
      to the House of Commons. He concluded:

      3.27.1   None of the evidence he was asked to consider added anything
               significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Justice
               Taylor's inquiry or to the inquests;




                                          6
           3.27.2   There was no basis upon which there should be a further judicial
                    inquiry or a reopening of Lord Taylor's inquiry;

           3.27.3   There was no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court
                    or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the
                    Coroners Act 1988; and

           3.27.4   There was no material which should be put before the Director of
                    Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which might
                    cause them to reconsider the decisions they had already taken.

    3.2S   18 Februar\r 1998: The Home Secretary announced in the House that he, the
%          Attorney General and the DPP had very carefully considered Lord Justice
           Stuart-Smith's report, and said "we have no reason to doubt his conclusions".
           Following publications of the Scrutiny Report, Trevor Hicks, the Chairman of
           the HFSG announced that he was disappointed with                  the Scrutiny's
           conclusions and that the HFSG were considering private prosecutions.

    3.29   27 February 1998:     The Authority resolved to authorise the Clerk and
           Treasurer to consider applications for financial assistance from serving and

           and (ii) Mr Duckenfield had committed an act tending to pervert the course
           of justice (this charge was later discontinued by the DPP after being directed
           by the High Court to reconsider it in the DPP Judicial Review).

           10 Tulv 1998: The South Sefton Criminal Proceedings were withdrawn
           following a challenge to the jurisdiction of the court. The court ordered the
           costs of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray to be assessed and paid from Central
           Funds under Section 16, Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.

    3.33   13 Tulv 1998: The Leeds Criminal Proceedings, alleging the same offences,

                  Magistrates' Court not to pay costs out of central funds should he
                  decide not to do so (as he had indicated he was considering); and

         3.36.3   To make an application to strike out the Leeds Criminal Proceedings

         further points on the alleged impropriety of the financial assistance to

         challenge.

3.42     10 February 1999:

         3.42.1   Garretts, solicitors for the Authority, wrote to the solicitor for

3.43     11 February 1999: The Chief Clerk, South Sefton Magistrates Court, wrote to
         Messrs Duckenfield and Murray stating his provisional conclusion that, in
         view of the Authority's decisions (in 1998) to provide financial assistance, it

         Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, and the decisions of the Court were as
         follows:-




                                              9
M eeting of the Police Authority on 1st August 1997

At this meeting, the Clerk and Treasurer and the Chief Constable submitted a
joint report informing members of the appointment of Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith to conduct a scrutiny into aspects of the Hillsborough disaster. The
Authority made the following resolutions:


"2 - That approval be given to the provision of up to £500,000from resents for
expenditure likely to be incurred in respect of the scrutiny.


2 - That approval be given to a commitment to provide financial assistance for legal
representation for officers (serving and retired) in connection xcith Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith's scrutiny in accordance with the principles set out in the Home Office
Circular 77/S7 Financial Assistance to Police Officers in Legal Proceedings.

3 - That the Clerk and Treasurer be authorised to determine individual applications
for financial assistance in consultation with the Chief Constable”.

M eeting of the Police Authority on 27 February 199S

Shortly after the presentation of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny report to
the House of Commons, the members of the Authority agreed to consider an
item relating to Hillsborough. Assistant Chief Constable Daines gave an oral
report to the Authority on the findings of the scrutiny and advised members
that private prosecutions had been threatened against three of those who
were officers on duty at the time of the disaster. The general issue of the
provision of financial assistance to those concerned w as addressed. It was
recognised that actual decisions about financial support could be made only
on individual application. Members were accordingly invited to delegate the
determination of individual applications to the Clerk and Treasurer.
Members resolved as follows:


"1 - That in the light of the findings of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's inquiry and his
comments on the outcome, members do not believe there is any new evidence to cause
them to reconsider the Authority's previous view, and remain of the opinion that the
officers acted in good faith.
2 - That the Authority agrees to authorise the Clerk and Treasurer to consider
applications for financial assistance from officers (sewing and retired) in accordance
with the provisions of Home Office Circular 77/87, Financial Assistance to Police
Officers in Legal Proceedings".

Application of 28 February 1998 from Mr D avid D uckenfield

On 28 February 1998, Mr Duckenfield applied to Assistant Chief Constable
Daines for financial assistance from the Authority for legal representation.
On 2 March 1998, Assistant Chief Constable Dames wrote to the Clerk and
Treasurer asking him to approve Mr Duckenfield's request. At the request of
the Authority's solicitor, Ms Maureen Oades, Assistant Chief Constable
Daines provided supporting information on 5 March 1998 to the Clerk and
Treasurer. These letters are attached at appendix 1. Following receipt of this
letter, the Clerk and Treasurer approved Mr Duckenfield's application for
financial assistance towards the costs of legal representation in the event of a
private prosecution being brought against him in connection with the
Hillsborough disaster.


M eeting of the Police Authority on 24 April 1998

On 24 April, the Chief Constable and Clerk and Treasurer submitted a joint
report to members requesting that members note the expenditure of £11,900
on the Chief Constable's costs in connection with the Scrutiny from the
earmarked reserve and requesting members to agree that the earmarked
reserve continue to be held for purposes related to the Hillsborough disaster.
The Authority resolved as follows:


"1 - That the use of the funds to date be noted.

2 - That the Authority agree, for the time being, to maintain the earmarked reserve
for future costs associated with the Hillsborough Stadium disaster, subject to periodic
reports on expenditure fivm the resenoe".

Application of 28 June 1998 from Mr Murray

By letter dated 28 June 1998, Mr Murray informed the Chief Constable that
his wife had accepted a summons on his behalf arising from the events of the
Hillsborough disaster and requested that the Police Authority reimburse any
legal expenses that he may incur in defending himself. The next day,
Assistant Chief Constable Daines wrote to the Clerk and Treasurer setting out
the reasons for his support of Mr Murray's application and the application
was approved by the Clerk and Treasurer that day. (Copies of these letters
are attached at appendix 2 to this report.)


The Clerk and Treasurer's decisions

In approving both of these applications, the Clerk and Treasurer consulted
the Authority's legal advisor and         took into account a number of
considerations which were detailed in the Garretts' report which the
Authority considered at its meeting on 5 February 1999. (Appendix 3).

Challenge by Ms Adlington

On 22 December 1998, following a report by the BBC that the Authority had
agreed to pay the legal costs of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray, Ms
Adlington wrote, on behalf of the HFSG, to the Clerk and Treasurer to the
Authority (appendix 4) challenging the Authority's power to provide such
assistance on a number of grounds, including the following:


•       that there was no legal power under statute for the Authority to pay
        the legal costs of a police officer (serving or former) in relation to
        criminal proceedings against him /her (a view dismissed by the Court
        in the subsequent Powers Judicial Review); and

•       that even if such power existed, it had been exercised improperly in
        this case as the Authority had taken into account a number of
        irrelevant considerations, ignored a number of relevant considerations
        and delegated powers, which it should itself have exercised, to the
        Clerk and Treasurer.

Legal advice received by the Authority

4.9.1    On 5 January 1999, the solicitor to the Authority sought preliminary
         advice from barrister, Mr Bernard Phillips. He confirmed that the
         general principle of whether to afford assistance at all was a matter
         for the discretion of the Authority. In the light of the representations
         received from Ms Adlington, however, he believed that the decision
         should be reconsidered by the Authority.
On 5 January 1999 Ms Adlington wrote a further letter to all the
members of the Authority (in appendix 5) making additional points
about the propriety of the decision to make financial assistance
available to the officers. She subsequently supplem ented that letter
with a fax to Garretts, the solicitors instructed by the Authority,
dated 29 January 1999 (appendix 6).

On 12 January 1999 the solicitor to the Authority took legal advice on
the two letters received from Ms Adlington from Leading Counsel,
Richard Mawrey QC.

His advice was that there was a power to provide financial assistance
to police officers in legal proceedings. However, this could only be
exercised in appropriate circumstances and only to cover "out of
pocket” expenses (but not expenditure which would otherwise be
paid from central funds or by the Legal Aid Board). H e added that
the HFSG might seek to challenge the procedure by which such
powers had been exercised because it covered more than "out of
pocket’’ expenditure, with som e prospect of success and that
accordingly the Authority should be asked to reconsider its original
decision in order to ensure it took take account of all relevant
considerations, including those Ms Adlington alleges might have
been overlooked earlier.

On 15 January 1999, the Authority instructed Garretts, solicitors, to
advise the Authority in reconsidering its decision to make financial
assistance available to the officers for the criminal proceedings and
considering the new applications for financial support for judicial
review proceedings. Garretts, w hose advice is also referred to below
in more detail, expressed its ow n concern about the statutory power
to give financial support to officers in these circumstances and
recommended that a second opinion be sought from Miss Presiley
Baxendale QC and Mr Mark Shaw.

Counsel advised that w hilst they had initially been attracted by the
argument that the Authority had power to pay "out of pocket" legal
costs and expenses of officers in all types of proceedings, where they
had acted in good faith and it was otherwise appropriate, there were
powerful arguments against this interpretation, particularly in the
light of the relevant case law in respect of public authorities'




                           13
                 ancillary powers to incur expenditure to facilitate the discharge of
                 their principal functions.

       4.9.7     Counsel stressed that they had both found this issue difficult and
                 that there was no guarantee which w ay a Court w ould decide.
                 There were certainly strong policy reasons w hy the Authority should
                 have power to support its officers (current and former) in this way.

       4.9.8     Accordingly, their recommendation was that the Authority should
                 resolve that it has no power to provide the financial assistance which
                 had been sought. It should then co-operate with the Chief Constable
                 in bringing the matter before a court for an early decision on whether
                 that view of their legal powers was correct.

4.10   Decision of the Police Authority on 5 February’ 1999

       4.10.1    On 5 February, in addition to the legal advice received, the Authority
                 considered a report from the Chief Constable and submissions and
                 presentations from:

       •        Mr T Hicks and Ms A Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough Family
                Support Group;


       •        Mr S Eastwood of Winckworth Sherwood, Solicitors on behalf of Mr
                Ducken/ield; and


       •        Mr R Manning of Walker Morris, Solicitors on behalf of Mr Murray.
                                                                                                  .
       4.10.2    Following consideration of the reports and representations made to
                 it, the Authority resolved as follows:

                 "1 - In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, that
                 on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial assistance
                 to Mr D Duckenfield or M r B Murray of South Yorkshire Police in relation
                 to their costs and expenses of defending the private prosecutions brought
                 against them by the Hillsborough Family Support Group, by Information
                 dated 10 July 1998 and accordingly to determine that any previous decision
                 of the Authority or any officer acting under its Authority, to make such
                 assistance available is null and void.




                                              14
         2 - In the light of legal advice, including advice from leading Counsel, tint,
         on balance, the Authority has no legal power to provide financial assistance
         to Mr D Duckenfield or M r B Murray in relation to the costs of any judicial
         reviexv proceedings brought by either o f them whether relating to the
         decision of the Crown Prosecu tions Sennce, not to take over the conduct of
         the private prosecutions and discontinue such prosecutions, of to any
         decision of the Clerk to the Sefton Magistrates' Court to challenge the
         payment of the officers' costs of proceedings before that court from central
         funds, or to any other decision of any court, authority or body arising from
         such prosecutions; and, accordingly, that the applications of M r
         Duckenfield and M r Murray for financial assistance in relation to such
         proceedings be rejected.

         3 - In recognition of the fact that legal advice provided to the Authority is
         that it remains arguable that power exists to provide the assistance referred
         to in 1 and 2 above, to take such action as the Clerk and Treasurer, in
         consultation with the Chief Constable, the Authority's legal advisors and
         the Chairman of the Authority may decide as appropriate to have the
         decisions referred to in 1 and 2 reviewed by the High Court and to expedite
         such a review with a view to clarifying the Authority's powers in this
         regard.

         4 - To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington,
         in her letters of 22 December 199S to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January
         1999 to the members of the Authority, until the legal power of the Authority
         to provide financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been
         resolved to the satisfaction of the Authority".

4.10.3   The solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray were informed of
         the decision following the meeting on 5 February 1999.                   On 10
         February 1999, Garretts, the solicitors instructed by the Authority,
         wrote to the solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray setting out
         the Authority's reasons for its decision. Copies of these letters are in
         appendix 7. Similar letters were written to Ms Adlington and the
         solicitors for the Chief Constable.

The Chief Constable's Application

The Chief Constable applied on 10 February 1999 to the High Court for a
judicial review of resolutions 1 and 2 above. However, Ms Adlington was
given leave to be joined as a part}' to the proceedings and challenged the legal
standing of the Chief Constable to make such an application. As a result, Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Murray also applied to be joined as parties to the
litigation as there was no doubt that they had legal standing to challenge the
Authority's decision. On 31 March 1999, the Court gave its judgment at the
same time as it gave judgment in respect of the DPP judicial review.

The D ivisional Court's decision

4.12.1   The Court declared as follows:

         "A police authority lias the statutory power, but subject to ordinary public
         law principles, to provide financial assistance to police officers and former
         police officers in respect of their costs and expenses incurred in relation to
         private prosecutions brought against them and judicial review proceedings
         in which they participate".

4.12.2   It is significant that the Court did not quash the resolutions of 5
         February 1999, although the Court did observe, in the proceedings
         following delivery of the judgment, that the Authority is to revisit
         the decision. Therefore,' the resolutions of 5 February
                                                               * 1999 which
         declare the previous decisions to provide financial assistance null
         and void remain in force.

4.12.3   The Chief Constable's application to the Court also sought guidance
         on how the Authority should exercise its power to grant financial
         assistance if the Court held that such power existed, and in particular
         whether the availability of legal aid was relevant to the decision on
         funding to be taken by the Authority. The Court declined to give
         any guidance on how the Authority should exercise its power to
         provide financial assistance to current or former officers in legal
         proceedings arising from the conduct of their duties, other than by
         confirming that general public law principles applied. During the
         proceedings immediately following judgment, however, Lord Justice
         Laws observed that:-

         "... I think it is very important, in truth in the interests of everyone
         concerned in this matter, that the Court should not attempt to steer public
         authorities such as [the Authority] into any particular course of action on
         the merits''.
                  and:


                   " the parties know from the judgment that has been delivered that the vires
                  [poxcer] exists in principle mid it xi'ill then be for the [Authority] to decide,
                  subject to ordinary public law rules ... when and how they may use that
                  power".


          This makes it clear that although the Authority does have the basic power to
          support officers and former officers costs in legal proceedings arising from
          the performance of their duties, how this power is to be exercised is a matter
          for them.

    5     THE LITIGATION FOR WHICH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS SOUGHT

    5.1   The South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the proposed South Sefton
          Judicial Review

          5.1.1   On 24 June 1998, informations were laid before the South Sefton
                  Magistrates Court by Ms Adlington, the Solicitor representing the
                  HFSG, alleging:

                  (a)     against both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray offences of
                            manslaughter of two of those who died as a result of the
                            Hillsborough disaster, John Anderson and James Aspinall
                            and an offence of wilful neglect to perform a public duty; and

                  (b)     against Mr Duckenfield alone, a further offence of perverting
                            the course of justice, said to consist in his having lied about
                            the circumstances in which gate C of the football ground
                            became open.

          5.1.2   Following representations from the parties, the Clerk to the Justices
                  took the view that the South Sefton court had jurisdiction to deal
                  with the offences, but that there was an argument that the
                  sum m onses were ineffective unless the defendants submitted to the
                  jurisdiction of the court. It w as agreed that the proceedings w ould
                  be brought forward to 10 July 1998 and that Ms Adlington would


•
                  apply for them to be withdrawn.




                                                17
5.1.3   On 10 July 1998, in the absence of all parties, the South Sefton
        Criminal Proceedings were withdrawn and the court made an order
        for Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's costs to be assessed and paid
        from central funds in accordance with Section 16 of the Prosecution
        of Offences Act 1985.

5.1.4   In September 1998, the solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
        (being Winckworth Sherwood and Walker Morris respectively) each
        submitted their claims for costs.

5.1.5   On 11 February 1999, the Clerk wrote to the solicitors for Messrs
        Duckenfield and Murray.       He stated that, as the Authority had
        agreed to pay Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's costs in relation to
        the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings, they had not themselves
        incurred any costs and were not entitled to be reimbursed from
        central funds.    He based this view on the decision in R -v- Miller
        (Raymond) and Another (1993) 3 All ER 186 ("Miller").

5.1.6   He drew attention to the fact that he was aware of the pending
        judicial review in relation to the Police Authority's decision of 5
        February and advised that he w ould await the outcome of that
        hearing before he made a final decision. A final decision is expected
        from the Clerk shortly.

5.1.7   Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have stated their intention to
        seek a judicial review of the Clerk's decision should it be
        unfavourable to them and have sought financial assistance from the
        Authority so to do - see further paragraph 6.2.1 below To the extent
        that the Authority is legally bound to provide assistance in relation
        to the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings (an issue on which Garretts
        advise in paragraph 7.6 below), the South Sefton Judicial Review
        w ould effectively be for the benefit of the Authority in reducing the
        costs it is liable to pay.

The Leeds Criminal Proceedings

5.2.1   On 13 July 1998 and 10 July 1998, fresh informations, alleging the
        same offences as the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings were laid by
        Ms Adlington before the Leeds Petty Sessional Division and
        summ onses in respect of these offences were issued by the
        stipendiary magistrate against Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray.
        Copies of the summ onses are in appendix 8.

5.2.2   Following the discontinuance on 12 April 1999 of the charge of
        perverting the course of justice against Mr Duckenfield, the
        remaining charges against both officers are of manslaughter and
        wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

5.2.3   The legal elements of these alleged offences are basically as follows:-

        (a)    Manslaughter

               Manslaughter
                      O
                            mav
                              j
                                be classified as voluntary or involuntary.
                                                            *                 *



               Involuntary manslaughter may be committed as follows:-


               (i)    A person upon whom the law im poses a duty or who
                       has taken upon himself any duty, tending to the
                       preservation of life, and w ho, regardless of the life,
                       safety, welfare and health of others, neglects to
                       perform that duty or performs it negligently and
                       thereby causes the death of another person may be
                       euiltv of manslaughter.
                            *            O




               (ii)   Similarly, a person w ho acts recklessly in such a
                       manner as to create an obvious and serious risk of
                       causing physical injury to some other person and who
                       thereby causes the death of any person m ay also be
                       guilt}' of manslaughter.

              It is important to note that a higher degree of negligence is
              necessary to render a person guilty of manslaughter than to
              establish civil liability against him and mere carelessness is not
              enough. The number of persons affected by a single act of
              negligence does not affect the degree of negligence. This
              offence is punishable by imprisonment for life or any shorter
              term at the discretion of the court.




                                  19
(b)     W ilful neglect to perform a public duty

      • A public officer w ho wilfully and without reasonable excuse
        or justification neglects to perform a duty imposed on him
        either by common law or by statute may be guilt}’ of this
        offence.   The   penalty   for   the   offence   is   a fine   and
        imprisonment at the discretion of the court and loss of office.

Leading Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have provided
to the Authority a joint opinion on the merits of the prosecution
dated 26 April 1999. In a letter dated 30 April 1999 from Walker
Morris to Garretts a copy of Mr Murray's representations to the DPP
was enclosed (appendix 9).

Committal proceedings are due to commence on 5 July 1999. It is
understood that they have been given an estimate of 3 weeks.            A
number of hearings on ancillary matters, such as a witness summons
requiring the Chief Constable to produce various statements and
documents, were heard on 10 May.

At the committal hearing, Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray will argue:

(a)     There is no prima facie case of manslaughter or wilful neglect
        to perform a public duty; and

(b)     That the prosecutions are oppressive and an abuse of the
        right of private prosecutions.

If either submission succeeds, the Leeds Criminal Proceedings will
come to an end and an order for payment of the officer's costs out of
central funds is likely to be made.

If both submissions fail, the Leeds Criminal Proceedings will
continue to a Crown Court trial. There is currently no estimate of the
length of the trial. If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray are acquitted,
an order for payment out of central funds is likely to be made unless
the presiding judge were to decide that Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray:
        (a)    brought the prosecutions upon themselves for example by
               suspicious behaviour; or

        (b)    were acquitted on a technicality; or

        (c)    had not incurred any costs (for example because              the
               Authority paid their costs - see further paragraph 5.2.8
               below).

5.2.8   Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have requested financial assistance
        for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.           If the Authority provides
        financial assistance, there is a risk that the Chief Clerk of the Leeds
        Crown Court might conclude that, on the basis of Miller, they had
        not incurred costs and are not entitled to be re-imbursed out of
        central funds, although so long as the arrangements between the
        former officers, their lawyers and the Authority are properly
        structured, this risk can be reduced if not entirely eliminated. (See
        further paragraph 8.11.3 below).

The DPP Judicial R eview

5.3.1   In July 1998,      Both Mr Duckenfield         and   Mr Murray made
        representations to the Director of Public Prosecutions that he should
        exercise his power under Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences
        Act 1985 to take over the conduct of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings
        and then discontinue all charges under Section 23(3).

5.3.2   Following representations from Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and the
        HFSG, the DPP communicated his decision not to intervene by letter
        of 18 December 1998. It stated:

        "We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the
        parties and all the relevant circumstances of the case. We have
        concluded that w e should not intervene to take over any of the
        charges".

5.3.3   The respective solicitors of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray asked for
        reasons to be given. There followed a letter of 1 February 1999 from
        the CPS Case Work Director, Mr N ewell, to Mr Murray's solicitor (a
        copy of which is included at appendix 10).
Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray applied in March 1999 for a judicial
review of the DPP's decision. The DPP opposed the application. Ms
Adlington was given leave to intervene to support die D PFs
decision. Mr N ew ell made an affidavit expanding on the reasons
given in his letter of 1 February 1999. A copy of the affidavit is in
appendix 11.

On 31 March 1999 the Divisional Court delivered its decision on this
application. A copy of the judgment is in appendix 12.

The Divisional Court dealt with the application in two stages:

(a)   The charges against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray of
       manslaughter and wilful neglect; and

(b)   The charge against Mr Duckenfield of perverting the course
       of justice.

Manslaughter and w ilfu l neglect

(a)   The DPP concluded that there was no reasonable prospect of
       conviction on these charges.      This is consistent with his
       previous conclusions and the outcome of the scrutiny.

(b)   However, the DPP stated that he

      "could not say there was clearly no case to answer. It was not
      right therefore, for [him] to take over the proceedings with a
      view to terminating them"

(c)   The Divisional Court decided there was no reason for it to
       interfere with the D P F s decision.   Lord Justice Laws (with
       w hom the other judges agreed) concluded

       "the DPP might, in my judgment, lawfully have decided to
       discontinue. The tragic events of Hillsborough have been the
       subject of repeated, detailed and thorough enquiries. Nearly
       10 years have passed. But, the judgment was for the DPP to
       make. If w e acceded to [Counsel for Messrs Duckenfield and
       Murray's] submissions, w e w ould I think usurp the role of
       the primary decision maker".
                 (See the judgment in appendix 12 at pajre 16)

5.3.8    Perverting the course of justice

         On this charge, the DPP concluded

         "that there was clearly no case to answ er..."

         But he decided not to intervene for 3 reasons:

         (a)     He did not think partial intervention was appropriate or
                 desirable;

         (b)     Mr Duckenfield could invite the magistrate to dismiss the
                 charge (at committal) on the grounds that there was no case
                 to answer; and

         (c)     The charge arose out of the same events which gave rise to
                 the other charges which w ould be scrutinised in any event.

         The Divisional Court rejected this approach. It held that Mr
         Duckenfield was entitled to expect that the DPP w ould consider
         whether intervention was appropriate on each charge individually.
         Therefore, the D P F s decision on this charge alone was quashed and
         the DPP invited to reconsider it.

         On 12 April 1999, the DPP decided to take over and discontinue this
         charge (See the letter from Mr N ew ell to Winckworth Sherwood
         Solicitors in appendix 13).

5.3.9    Costs

        Mr Murray w as ordered to pay the D P F s costs. Mr Duckenfield was
        ordered to pay 80% of the D P F s costs of the DPP Judicial Review.
        This reflects the fact that he enjoyed partial success in his application
        in having the charge of perverting the course of justice referred back
        to the DPP (w ho subsequently intervened to quash the charge). As it
        is not usually appropriate to award costs in favour of a party which
        has intervened to support the decision under review, Ms Adlington
        did not seek costs against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray. She did
        peek costs from central funds but these were refused.
5.3.10   Messrs Duckenfield and Murray have applied for financial assistance
         from the Authority to m eet both their own legal costs of their
         application to challenge the D PP's decision of 18 December 1998 and
         the costs of the DPP's legal advice which were awarded against them
         (see paragraph 6.2.3 below).

The Powers Judicial Review

5.4.1    The events leading up to the Powers Judicial Review’ and the
         judgment of the Court in relation to that review’ are summarised in
         paragraph 4 above.

5.4.2    Despite succeeding with their legal arguments in the Powers Judicial
         Review’, neither the Chief Constable nor Messrs Duckenfield and
         Murray sought an order for costs against the Authority.        Messrs
         Duckenfield and Murray did, however,        seek an order for costs
         against Ms Adlington, which she opposed.       The basis of the costs
         application against Ms Adlington wras that Messrs Duckenfield and
         Murray would not have commenced their ow’n application for
         judicial review’ against the Authority's decision if Ms Adlington had
         not contended in her affidavit and skeleton argument that the Chief
         Constable did not have legal standing to challenge the Authority's
         decision.   In the light of this submission, the court ordered Ms
         Adlington to pay Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's costs.

5.4.3    Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have applied to the Authority for
         financial assistance in respect of their costs in these proceedings to
         the extent not met by the costs awarded against Ms Adlington.

5.4.4    It should also be noted that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray w’ere
         offered support in relation to the Powers Judicial Review from the
         Police Superintendents Association. The terms of that support are
         summarised in a letter from the Police Superintendent's Association
         of England and Wales to Winckworth Sherwood Solicitors dated 5
         March 1999 (appendix 14).



PRESENT APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

Following the judgment in the Pow’ers Judicial Review, the Authority's
solicitors, Garretts, sought clarification from Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray
                  ot their application for financial assistance by letters dated 7 April 1999 and 30
                  April 1999. Copies of the responses from Mr Duckenfield dated 16 April 1999
                  and Mr Murray dated 22 April 1999 to the Authority, together with responses
                  from Walker Morris (solicitors to Mr Murray) to Garretts dated 7 May 1999
                  and Winckworth Sherwood (solicitors to Mr Duckenfield) dated 13 May 1999
                  are at Appendix 15.

            6.2   Their applications are for financial assistance to meet their legal costs and
                  disbursements in the following proceedings:

                  6.2.1    The South Sefton Judicial Review

                           (a)    As noted above in paragraph 5.1.7 both Mr Duckenfield and
                                  Mr Murray have stated their intention to seek a judicial
                                  review of the decision of the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices
                                  should he refuse to allow their costs to be paid from central
                                  funds. The solicitors representing Mr Duckenfield have
                                  provided a cost estimate of £5,000 to £7,000 (excluding VAT
                                  and disbursements) for such judicial review. The risk of the
                                  Respondent’s costs being awarded against Mr Duckenfield
                                  and Mr Murray if the Clerk's view on costs is vindicated
                                  should, however, be borne in mind.

                           (b)    To the extent that the Authority is legally bound to provide
                                  assistance in relation to the South Sefton Criminal
                                  Proceedings, (as to which see paragraph 7.6 below) the South
                                  Sefton Judicial Review would effectively be for the benefit of
                                  the Authority. However, the Authority is recommended to
                                  defer its decision in respect of this part of the applications
                                  until the decision of the Clerk to the Justices and reasons for
                                  that decision are known. Any decision of the Authority to
                                  grant financial assistance before then could be open to
                                  potential challenge on the ground of irrationality, as it is not
                                  possible to properly consider the merits of the case until the
                                  Clerk's decision and reasons are known.

6 .2 .2   The South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the Leeds Criminal
          Proceedings

          Both Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have applied for financial
          assistance in respect of costs and disbursements incurred in the
          conduct of their respective defences in the criminal proceedings
          referred to in paragraphs 5.1 and 5.2 above. As noted at paragraphs
          4.4   and   4.6 above, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray were each
          informed in writing in 1998 that their reasonable expenses in respect
          of the criminal proceedings (that is, both the South Sefton Criminal

          The legal costs and disbursements incurred by Mr Duckenfield in
          respect of the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings amount to
          £8,716.63 (including VAT). Legal costs and disbursements incurred
          by Mr Murray in respect of the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings
          amount to £5,874.40 (including VAT). It is not yet known how much

         Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have both applied for financial
         assistance in respect of their legal expenses incurred and those costs
         awarded against them in the judicial review (referred to at paragraph
         5.3 above) of the DPP’s decision not to take over and discontinue the
         prosecutions.

         Mr Murray was ordered to pay the D P F s costs. As Mr Duckenfield's
         application to the court was partially successful, in that the decision
         not to take over and discontinue the charge of perverting the cause of
         justice was quashed, he has been ordered to pay 80% of the D PFs
         costs. The DPP has not yet provided an account of his costs.

6.2.4    The Powers Judicial Review

         Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have also both applied for financial
         assistance in respect of any legal expenses incurred in the judicial
         review of the Authority's decisions that it had no power to provide
         the financial assistance sought by the former officers, but only to the
         extent not reimbursed under the costs award made against Ms
         Adlington.

         Both officers applied to be joined as parties to these proceedings after
         Ms Adlington disputed the Chief Constable's legal standing to bring
         the application. Ms Adlington has been ordered to pay their costs of
         the application.

         It is recommended that the Authority defer its decision on this part
         of the applications pending assessment and payment of Ms
         Adlington's costs liability’' to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.



LEGAL FEES INCURRED IN THE CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS UP TO 5
FEBRUARY 1999

As noted above at paragraphs 4.4 and 4.6 the Authority originally agreed in
1998 to meet the reasonable expenses of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in
the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and Leeds Criminal Proceedings. (See
the letters in appendices 1 and 2 )
On 13 January 1999 the Clerk and Treasurer wrote to Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray's solicitors stating that the Authority w ould be reviewing the issue of
financial assistance and that the Clerk and Treasurer was not in a position to
authorise payments in respect of the private prosecutions. In response to a
query from Mr Murray's solicitors, Walker Morris, the Clerk and Treasurer
wrote to Walker Morris on 14 January 1999 stating

"you should not incur further costs pending the meeting of the Authority and
that, if you do so, it will be at your ow n risk".

Copies of the Clerk and Treasurer's letters are attached at appendix 16. On 5
February 1999, the Authority resolved that it had no legal power to provide
funding and, accordingly, that its previous decisions to provide funding were
null and void.     Whilst the High Court held on 31 March 1999 that the
Authority did in fact have a statutory power to provide funding, the decisions
of the Authority on 5 February 1999 were not quashed by the High Court.
Therefore, the resolutions remain in force in effect although the court expects
the Authority to revisit the resolutions. It is the opinion of Garretts that Mr
Duckenfield and Mr Murray both have a strong case that they have a legally
enforceable right to recover from the Authority their costs in the Leeds
Criminal Proceedings and the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings incurred up
to 5 February 1999 (to the extent that those costs are reasonable).

In relation to the costs incurred by Messrs Duckenfield and Murray in the
Leeds Criminal Proceedings since 5 February 1999 and in the DPP Judicial
Review, Garretts' opinion is that the Authority may decide to offer assistance
to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray on the same or different terms as
previously given, or it may decide not to provide assistance. This report deals
further with these questions in paragraphs 8 and 9 below.

The remainder of this paragraph 7 explains w hy Mr Duckenfield and Mr
Murray may have a strong claim for the costs of the criminal proceedings up
to 5 February 1999, but not after, and the principles on which the strength of
that claim should be judged.

Legitimate expectation

7.6.1    Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray may allege that they have a
         "legitimate expectation" in respect of the costs they have incurred in
         the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings and the Leeds Criminal




                                     29
Proceedings up to 5 February 1999.         The concept of "legitimate
expectation" has developed through a number of cases and has
emerged as an enforceable right which may arise when a public
authority seeks to withdraw from an assurance previously given bv
it concerning the way in which it will exercise its powers.

While "legitimate expectation" is now capable of giving rise to
substantive rights, the concept of a legitimate expectation was
initially formulated to ensure that a person would not have a right or
interest which had been granted by a public body withdrawn or
varied without an opportunity to make representations. Therefore, it
was appropriate that the Authority heard from Messrs Duckenfield
and Murrav when it met on 5 Februarv 1999 and did not withdraw
funding of the criminal proceedings from them until that date.

While the boundaries of legitimate expectation are still developing,
the elements needed to be established in this case are:

(a)    a clear and unambiguous representation to Messrs
       Duckenfield and Murray that they w ould receive funding;
       and

(b)    that they acted in reliance on the representation to their
       detriment (there is some question as to whether reliance to
       detriment is a necessary ingredient. However, recent cases
       indicate that it is necessary).

The concept is always subject to the right of public bodies to
withdraw from a position in appropriate circumstances.          This is
consistent with a principle that there cannot be a fettering of a public
authority's discretion by a fixed policy. But if a public body wishes to
withdraw from a position it has taken, it may be required to honour
undertakings or assurances it has given on which someone has relied
up to that date, unless there is an overriding public interest
consideration against so doing.

The concept is also subject to a public body acting within its power.
A public authority cannot be required, nor is it entitled, to do
something outside its basic statutory powers, even if it has given an
assurance so to do. If the public body has the basic statutory power,
however, but exercised it irregularly in giving the relevant assurance,
then it mav still be bound bv that assurance. The decision of the
           •>                   j



Divisional Court on the Powers Judicial Review has confirmed that
the Authority has the basic statutory power to meet current and
former police officer's legal expenses in appropriate circumstances.
Therefore, an enforceable legitimate expectation may w ell have
arisen in favour of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray that their legal
expenses of the criminal proceedings up to 5 February 1999 (when
the original decision to meet those expenses was reversed) would be
met by the Authority, even if there were procedural irregularities in
the original decision.

It is important to note that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's
application should be considered separately and in particular
whether the}' relied on the assurances given to their detriment. It is
conceivable that one might establish an enforceable legitimate
expectation whereas the other might not.

What the Authority needs to decide, therefore, is whether the officers
case for funding up to the 5 February 1999 satisfies the following
conditions:-

(a)   Clear and unam biguous representation

       There seems little room to doubt that the letters of 5 March
       and 29 June to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray constitute a
       clear and unambiguous representation that their legal costs of
       the criminal proceedings w ould be met.

(b)   Reliance to detriment

      It w ill be for each of the former officers to establish whether
      they have acted in reliance to their detriment on the letters
      from the Authority. It is likely that they did so, however, by
      instructing solicitors to represent them, without applying for
      legal aid. While it is not too late to seek legal aid, it w ill not be
      granted retrospectively (i.e. w ill not cover costs they have
      already incurred with their solicitors) but, if granted, will only
      meet future costs and then subject to the former officers
      making substantial contributions from their ow n resources.
(c)     Are there any public interest factors w hich should override
       a decision to meet such expenses?

       The Authority should consider whether any circumstances
       such as public policy or other overriding factors in the public
       interest exist which would mitigate against meeting the
       former officer's costs up to 5 February 1999. Garretts have
       not, however, identified any such circumstances.

If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray establish the three elements for
legitimate expectation, which it appears likely that they will, it is
difficult to see that the Authority has any real alternative but to meet
their reasonable expenses of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up to
the time the Authority effectively reversed its previous decisions on
financial assistance for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.         Having
regard to the requirements of reasonable notice and their right to be
heard, it is submitted that the date the Authority effectively reversed
                                                  j          *


its decision and to which therefore reasonable expenses of the
criminal proceedings should be met, is 5 February 1999. This was the
first opportunity that representatives of Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray had to be heard on the issue of whether funding was to be
withdrawn and an unambiguous decision was taken by the
Authority to withdraw funding for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings.

It is submitted that the Authority was entitled, as from 5 February
1999 to withdraw the assurances given to the former officers about
funding their legal costs of the Criminal Proceedings, on the basis of
the legal principle that in areas of ongoing public expenditure, a
public body must not fetter its discretion. Therefore, it is entitled to
revoke, vary or suspend an expenditure commitment after proper
notice and an opportunity to challenge that decision has been given
to those affected by the change of policy. The Clerk and Treasurer's
letters of 13 and 14 January 1999 (referred to in paragraph 7.2 above),
and the opportunity afforded to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray to
be heard on 5 February 1999 would appear to meet the requirements
of notice and opportunity to be heard.
Recom mendations w ith regard to costs of the Criminal Proceedings up to 5
February 1999

       A.       If the Authority are satisfied following presentations made by
                or on behalf of Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and Ms
                Adlington at their meeting that:-

                (i)      a clear and unambiguous assurance of funding for the
                         Criminal Proceedings was given by or on behalf of the
                         Authority;

                (ii)     the former officers relied on that assurance to their
                         detriment (for example by not seeking funding from
                         other sources such as legal aid); and

                (iii)    that no overriding public interest factors exist which
                         means it would be inappropriate to confirm such
                         funding

                Garretts' recommend that the Authority should meet Mr
                Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's reasonable legal expenses for
                the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up to 5 February 1999.          A
                decision on the South Sefton expenses should be deferred
                pending the decision of the Clerk to the Justices of the South
                Sefton Magistrates Court as to whether Messrs Duckenfield
                and Murray are entitled to be reimbursed out of central
                funds.

       B.       In order to assess the reasonableness of the legal expenses
                claimed, the costs incurred should be reviewed by a legal
                costs draftsman specialising in criminal costs. If his or her
                advice be that the costs claimed are not reasonable, the
                Authority should apply to the Court to have the costs
                assessed under Section 71 Solicitors Act 1974 (assessment of
                costs on application of third parties liable to pay costs) unless
                the costs to be paid can be agreed. H owever, it should be
                noted that the Court is not bound to grant an application by
                the Authority for such assessment.
THE MERITS OF THE APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE

It will be recalled that:

8.1.1       On 22 December 1998 and 5 January 1999, Ms Adlington wrote
            letters challenging the Authority's decisions on 2 grounds namely:

            (a)    There was no power for the Authority to pay die legal costs in
                    relation to criminal proceedings against officers; and

            (b)    Even if such power existed, it had been exercised improperly
                    in this case. (See paragraph 4.8 and 4.9.2).

8.1.2       On 5 February 1999 the Authority resolved, amongst other things

            "4 - To defer consideration of the procedural issues raised by Ms Adlington,
            in her letters of 22 December 1998 to the Clerk and Treasurer and 5 January
            1999 to the members of the Authority, until the legal power of the Authority
            to provide financial assistance referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 has been
            resolved to the satisfaction of the Authority".

8.1.3       The Divisional Court has recognised that the Authority has
            committed itself to revisiting its decision to grant (and revoke)
            financial assistance in the light of the finding of power.                The
            application    for   financial    assistance      for   the   Leeds   Criminal
            Proceedings (after 5 February 1999 only) and the DPP Judicial
            Review should now be considered afresh by the Authority.

In making the decision whether to exercise its discretion to grant such
financial assistance to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray, the Authority must
bear in mind that, whilst the court has confirmed that it has die power to
grant such financial assistance, it by no means follows that the Authority
should grant such financial assistance.

In deciding whether to meet the legal costs of Mr Duckenfield and Mr
Murray, (whether in relation to the criminal proceedings or any of the other
proceedings referred to above) the Authority is subject to the public law
principles of decision making. Briefly, these are that it must (amongst other
things):

•          act within whatever statutory powers conferred upon it by Act of
           Parliament;
•       act with procedural fairness (including by giving a hearing to directly
        interested parties);

•       take all relevant considerations into account;

•       ignore all irrelevant considerations;

•       not act irrationally;

•       not fetter its discretion; and

•       not unlawfully delegate the decision making function.

Failure to comply with any of these principles will expose the decision to
challenge by judicial review. The Authority must individually consider each
of Mr Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's applications in respect of each separate
set of proceedings (and, in the case of the criminal proceedings, each charge)
separately.     All relevant considerations should be taken into account and
w eighed against each other.     Garretts consider that the major considerations
include:-

8.4.1    whether the Authority is satisfied that the former officers acted in
            good faith in directing the police operations on the day of the
            disaster;

8.4.2    whether the former officers exercised their judgment reasonably, in
            the light of die circumstances they faced, and if not, whether other
         relevant factors outweigh this consideration;

8.4.3    whether it is appropriate to require Mr Duckenfield or Mr Murray to
         look to alternative sources of finance to pa)' their legal costs, such as
         legal aid, the Police Superintendent's Association or their own
         resources, given the likely adverse financial effects for them of
         seeking legal aid;

8.4.4    the seriousness of the charges and whether it is appropriate to agree
         to provide funding, before a verdict is reached on them;

8.4.5    the Authority's view on the merits of the charges;

8.4.6    The impact on the Authority’s resources of funding the former
         officer's costs and the "knock on" effect on policing in South
          Yorkshire (the Chief Constable will be present to advise on this at the
          meeting); and

8.4.7     the impact of a refusal to provide financial support on police morale
          and on the confidence of officers to exercise their judgment in
          difficult circumstances.

Factois which may assist in reaching a decision include:-

•       Guidance in Hom e Office Circulars;


•       The circumstances of the Hillsborough Stadium tragedy as recorded,
        inter alia, in:


        (a)       The interim report of Lord Justice Taylor into the
                  Hillsborough Stadium disaster; and


        (b)       The Scrutiny of Lord Justice Stuart Smith into the
                  Hillsborough Stadium disaster.


•       The decision of the DPP in 1990 that there was insufficient evidence
        upon which prosecution for manslaughter or any other criminal
        offence could be brought against any officer in the South Yorkshire
        Police or any other person.


•       The decision of the Director of the Public Prosecutions in 1997 that the
        material so far presented would not justify fresh investigations.


•       The decision of the Director of Public Prosecution in 1999 that in
        respect of the charges of manslaughter and wilful neglect to perform a
        public duty, the Director of Public Prosecutions was not satisfied that
        there w as clearly no case to answer and decided not to take over and
        discontinue the prosecutions.


•       The fact that the D P F s decision in 1999 not to take over and
        discontinue the prosecution of Mr Duckenfield for perverting the
        course of justice was quashed by the High Court on judicial review
        and remitted to the DPP for reconsideration, and that the DPP has
        now taken over and discontinued this charge.


•       The inquest findings of accidental death.


•       The fact that disciplinary charges of neglect of duty were directed by
        the Police Complaints Authority against Mr Duckenfield and Mr
        Murray but were never determined due to the retirement of Mr
        Duckenfield.


•       The fact that after several years of service to the police force, each of
        Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray retired with clean disciplinary
        records.


•       The likely costs of the financial assistance.


•       The financial resources of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.


•       Relevant representations put to the Authority by the Chief Constable,
        Mr Duckenfield, Mr Murray and the HFSG.


Guidance on a number of these matters was given in the Divisional Court
decision of R - v - Derbyshire Police Authority ex parte Wilson & Dalton (19S9).

Hom e Office Circulars

In I Yilson and Dalton, the court considered the relevance of the Hom e Office
circular then in effect in relation to the funding of police officers' costs, HOC
77/87. A copy of HOC 7 7/87 and the replacement circular, HOC 4/1998 are
in appendix 17. The following principles emerged on the relevance of Home
Office guidance:

8.7.1     Circulars do not have statutor}’ force but are a good indication of the
          matters to be taken into account.
8.7.2   Lord Justice Gibson further commented

         "that is not to say that in considering an application for reimbursement of
         costs by an officer, a Police Authority is necessarily limited to factors in the
         circular."

8.7.3    The central principle in HOC 4/1998 is

        "it is important that police officers should be able to carry out their duties in
         the confidence that their Police Authority xvill support them, if they act in
        good faith and exercise their judgment reasonably".


Good Faith and Reasonableness of Conduct

8.8.1   In drawing any conclusions as to good faith and reasonable exercise
         of judgment, the Authority must consider all relevant evidence
         including the findings of the various investigations and reports. It is
         also   important     that the      Authority      does    not limit     itself      to
         consideration of good          faith but also considers whether Mr
         Duckenfield or Mr Murray exercised their duties reasonably. If the
         Authority decides either or both of them acted unreasonably,
         however, it may still decide that other factors pointing to supporting
         the relevant former officers outweigh this consideration (whilst it is
         difficult to envisage circumstances justifying supporting an officer
         w ho the Authority considers acted in bad faith).

8.8.2   On the relevance of the conduct of theofficers in Wilson and Dalton
         and more specifically on "good faith" and "reasonable exercise of
         judgment", Lord Justice Ralph Gibson commented



         "if therefore, there was, on the part of the officer, negligence, i.e. failure to
         exercise such care as was reasonably to be required in the circumstances of
         an officer of his rank and experience, doing his job in the force, tlien in my
         view, the Police Authority is entitled to have regard to it if such negligence
         urns connected to the subject matter of the legal proceedings, or to the
         causing of the legal proceedings to be taken, that it can fairly be regarded as
         a substantial cause of the incurring of the costs. 1 have no doubt that a
         Police Authority, if satisfied of good faith on the part of the officer, would
         normally act, and be pleased to act, on the central principle stated in the
         circular [i.e good faith]; but the discretion is given to the Authority and it is
         impossible, in my view, to hold that, once good faith is established, a Police
         Authority must disregard clear evidence of negligence or a failure to
         "exercise judgment reasonably". So to hold icould mean that a Police
         Authority would be required to disregard acts of substantial negligence,
         such that it could fairly be said that, although acquitted on bad faith, the
         officer had "brought the proceedings upon himself.



8.8.3    The decision whether the evidence of such negligence in a particular
         case justifies withholding reimbursement, w holly or in part, is,
         therefore, entrusted to the Police Authority.

5.5.4    While the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police has admitted
         negligence in certain civil actions which have been brought, it must
         also be remembered that:

         (a)     the admissions were in respect of civil, not criminal liability;

         (b)     the other parties w ho were held responsible contributed to
                 the damages paid to the victims; and

         (c)     there was no finding that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
                 were themselves individually negligent and responsible for
                 the disaster.

8.8.5   Whilst all the relevant factors must be considered as a whole, it is
         worth drawing attention to the following from Lord Justice Taylor's
         interim report and Lord Justice Stuart Smith's Scrutiny as relevant to
         an assessment of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray's behaviour:

(i)     From Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report (appendix 18) -
         ''Postponement of kick off"

"226 - At various stages in his evidence, Mr Duckenfield gave three accounts
of w hy he thought it w as too late to postpone kick off. Once it was that one of
the teams had already come onto the pitch. Then it was that a group of
photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams
were coming out. Finally, he did not know w hy he thought the teams were
      coming out. They did not in fact come on to the pitch until 2.54pm, two
      minutes after gate C w as opened. Police Constable Buxton had asked for a
      postponement of kick off before gate C was opened. It should not, however,
      have needed a police constable in the thick of the crowd (and there were
      others of like mind) to think of postponing the kick off. The need should have

      been clear in the control room.


      227 - The truth was that Mr Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had
      discussed with Mr Murray. Kick off w ould not be postponed unless there
      w as some major cause for delayed arrivals e.g. a jam on the motorway or fog.
      I accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. If
      kick-off is postponed whenever a proportion of fans choose to leave the
      public houses late, the practice may grow and kick off times w ould become
      meaningless. But, a commander must deal with the problem of the day.
      Faced with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should
      have been his paramount consideration. Kick off should have been delayed.


Summary

      22S - The layout of the turnstiles and the number they were required to serve
      left no margin of safety against an uneven flow of fans. Because police
      strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it, the arrival of a large
      number of supporters between 2.30pm and 2.40pm created an unmanageable
      crush. The presence of a substantial minority of fans w ho had drunk too
      much aggravated that problem. Having lost control and rejected the option
      of postponing kick off, the police were faced with the serious danger of
      deaths or injuries. They were left therefore with no alternative but to open
       the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that stage to ask for it and Mr
       Duckenfield w as right to agree. But the possible effects of so dramatic a step

       required other action.


The blunder on opening the gates


       229 - The decision to order the opening of the gates was not accompanied or
       followed by any other order to deal with the consequences. When gate C
       w as opened, a steady stream of about 2000 fans poured through it over some
      five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere and
      unless they were diverted their likeliest route was through the tunnel for
      reasons already given. N o warning was issued from the control room that the
      gate w as to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. Neither the
      Club control room, nor the Chief Steward at the Leppings Lane end was
      warned. N ot even Mr Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was informed.
      From 2.47pm when Mr Marshall made his first request until 2.52pm when Mr
      Duckenfield acceded to it, there were five minutes in which orders could have
      been given as to how the influx w as to be absorbed. It w as not done. In
      evidence, Mr Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any wrong
      decision but he later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not
      consider where the people w ould go when the gate opened. Even after it
      opened, when he could see the influx on the television screen, no order was
      given to steer the fans to the w ing pens. Mr Duckenfield said it did not cross
      his mind to detail officers on the copeourse to shut off the tunnel. Those
      officers could not have known from their position how full pens 3 and 4 were.
      That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its ow n observations
      and using intelligence from around the ground."


      ''231...it should have been clear in the control room where there w as a view of
      the pens and of the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If
      orders had been given to that effect w hen gate C was opened, the fans could
      have been directed to the empty areas of the w ings and this disaster could
      still have been avoided. Failure to give that order was a blunder of the first
      magnitude".


"The Officers in Command


      250 - Even when realisation of the problem came to officers on the track, it
      w as som e minutes before it reached the control room. When spectators first
      appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the control room was
      that a pitch invasion w as threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning of a
      match. It became still less likely when those on the track made no m ove
      towards the pitch. Mr Motson, the BBC commentator, recognised and said
      w ell before the match was stopped, that the trouble seem ed to be
      overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary
      persisted in the control room. Until Mr Murray radioed for a fleet of
      ambulances, about 3.06pm, Mr Duckenfield continued to treat the incident as
      a threat to the pitch and to public order."


      "281 - Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray's experience. Between
      them they misjudged the build up at the turnstiles and did little about it until
      the received Mr Marshall's request to open the gate.            They did not, for
      example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with
      Tango units as to the numbers still to come.              They did not alert Mr
      Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of command. They gave
      no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings Lane.
      Inflexibly, the}’ declined to postpone kick off.


      282 - When Mr Marshall's request came, Mr Duckenfield's capacity to take
      decisions and give orders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the
      opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary consequential orders or to
      exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the
      emergence of fans from pens 3 and 4. When he w as unsure of the problem, he
      sent down others to "assess the situation" rather than descend to see for
      himself. He gave no information to the crowd."


      (ii)     From Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny Report (appendix 19)

Chapter 1

      "25. The Director of Public Prosecutions had the responsibility of deciding
      whether criminal proceedings, in practice charges of manslaughter, should be
      brought against any corporate body or individual. In their submissions to me
      Counsel for the Family Support Group have only invited me to make a
      recommendation to the DPP in the case of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray...


      26. the DPP, accepting the advice of two very experienced Queen's Counsel,
      concluded in 1990 that there was not sufficient evidence to justify such
      charges against either of these officers. The fresh evidence, therefore, would
      have to be of sufficient significance that there is, in my view , a real possibility
      that in considering it the DPP might change her mind and institute
proceedings for manslaughter, or any other offence, against one or both of
these officers".


"52. I have read the joint opinion of Counsel dated 6 August 1990 which gave
advice to the Director of Public Prosecutions on the possible criminal
proceedings against Mr Murray and Mr Duckenfield, amongst others.
Although the material available to Counsel was more extensive than that
which w as placed before Lord Taylor, because by that time the criminal
investigation carried out by the West Midlands Police had been completed,
Counsel stated that
"the criminal investigation, for all his thoroughness, Ims not significantly added to or
contradicted Lord Justice Taylor's findings. In our judgment, therefore, the Taylor
analysis of the facts is as firm a base as any from which to approach the question of
Criminal Liability"


53. Counsel then set out a full, detailed and careful resum e of the facts based

on the evidence then available. I have not found any error or omission in this
resume, nor in my view is any particular aspect understated or exaggerated. I
have also considered the statement of the law set out in the opinion. Counsel
considered both the offences of manslaughter and culpable misfeasance in
public office. They were plainly correct to consider that the latter offence
w ould be no easier to establish than manslaughter in the circumstances of the
case.


54. In order to recommend that the DPP reconsider the decision not to
prosecute, therefore, I must be satisfied that any fresh evidence establishes, or
may establish, facts not previously considered by Counsel or the significance
of which w as not appreciated, which makes it more likely that charges of
manslaughter could be established. Essentially this relates to Mr

Duckenfield's and Mr Murray's knowledge and appreciation of the risk of
injury in doing what they did or omitted to do....


55. From my meetings with the bereaved families and their representatives, I
am left in no doubt that there was widespread disappointment at the DPP's
decision not to prosecute. They find it difficult to understand in the light of
Lord Taylor's trenchant criticisms of the South Yorkshire Police and the fact
that the force have been paying compensation.


56. What the Director of Public Prosecutions had to bear in mind, however, is
the significantly different and greater degree of culpability which is involved
in manslaughter, or culpable misfeasance in public office, as against the
degree of negligence which gives rise to liability, and compensation
payments, under civil law. Any prosecution of an individual police officer
w ould have to establish his individual responsibility. It w ould not be enough
simply to prove the composite failure of the police operation.


57. The causes of the disaster were many and complex. So far as these two
officers were concerned, the prosecution w ould have to prove to the high
standard required for a criminal conviction [i.e. beyond reasonable doubt]
that the failure to give the order to close off the tunnel when gate C was
opened amounted to the serious degree of recklessness necessary to constitute
manslaughter".


Chapter 7


''5....I have come to the clear conclusion that there is no basis upon which
there should be a further Judicial Injury or a reopening of Lord Taylor's
Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed application to the Divisional Court
or for the Attorney General to exercise his powers under the Coroners Act
19SS. I do not consider that there is any material which should be put before
the Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints Authority which
might cause them to reconsider the decisions they have already taken.


"6...None of the evidence I was asked to consider added anything significant
to the evidence which was available to Lord Taylor's Inquiry' or to the

Inquests".


The nature of the charges against the former officers and the merits of the
charges

8.9.1     Each of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray face two charges of
          manslaughter and one charge of wilful neglect to perform a public
                 duty. Paragraphs 5.2.3 (a) and (b) above set out the elements of these
                 offences.

       8.9.2     The Authority has requested Leading Counsel for each of the former
                 officers, namely William Clegg QC for Mr Duckenfield and Michael
                 Harrison QC for Mr Murray, to provide an opinion on these matters.

       8.9.3     In appendix 9 is a copy of their joint opinion and a copy of Mr
                 Murray's representations to the DPP.

8.10   The lik ely costs to the Authority of providing financial assistance sought
       for the Leeds Criminal Proceedings

       These are referred to in paragraph 6.

8.11   A vailability o f alternative sources of funding

       S .ll.l   In Wilson and Dalton, the court considered whether the fact that Mr
                 Wilson and Mr Dalton's costs had been met by the Police Federation
                 was a relevant consideration which could be properly taken into
                 account in considering whether to reimburse those costs to Mr
                 Wilson and Mr Dalton. The report of the Police Authority's decision
                 in that case stated "any reimbursement of costs w ould in effect be a
                 reimbursement to the Police Federation of its costs". The court held
                 that the fact that an officer has been provided with legal
                 representation by the Federation w as an irrelevant consideration.
                 Lord Justice Ralph Gibson said
                 "Mr Underhill [Counsel for Mr Wilson and Mr Dalton] submitted
                 that this was w holly irrelevant; the fact that these two officers had
                 been supported by thu Federation did not affect in any relevant way
                 the merits of their applications, and, if their applications were good,
                 so that they were entitled to reimbursement in w hole or in part, they
                 should be allowed. It is, of course, a commonplace of the exercise of
                 discretion as to costs in our courts that in general, no attention is paid
                 to the fact that a plaintiff or defendant is entitled, in right of his
                 membership of a trade union, to legal representation. His right to an
                 order for costs depends in the ordinary case, upon the merits of his
                 claim thereto. The fact that his union supports him is as irrelevant as
                 the fact, if it should be the case, that he borrowed the money for his




                                             45
         costs from his parents on terms that he w ould not be expected to
         repay it.... for my part I have no doubt that Mr Underhill's primary
         submission is correct and that, having regard to the terms of the
         circular, the mere fact that an officer has been provided with legal
         representation by the Federation is irrelevant to the question whether
         an application for reimbursement should be granted....that
         conclusion does not mean that a Police Authority could in no case
         whatever have regard as to whether the Federation had provided the
         legal representation or whether it had been paid for by the officer
         personally. An application might be very finely balanced, having
         regard to the various factors to be weighed. If, in a particular case, a
         Police Authority was minded to take into account, in support of a
         plea based on severe financial hardship, that an officer was
         personally liable for the costs, I consider the Authority w ould be
         entitled to have such regard to it as it w ould think proper in the

         circumstances".

8.11.2   In Garretts' opinion, the availability or otherwise of Legal Aid should
         be considered in light of the following:

         (a)   The fact that Legal Aid is not available to Mr Duckenfield and
                Mr Murra\T in the judicial review proceedings and that a
                significant personal contribution may be required in respect
                of the Leeds Criminal Proceedings and the South Sefton
                Criminal Proceedings may add w eight to any plea from the
                former officers of severe financial hardship in support of their
                applications;

         (b)   It is arguable that both R i’ Gloucestershire County Council and
                another, ex parte Barry [1997] 2 ALL E.R. 1 and R r> Chief
                Constable of Sussex, ex parte International Trader's Ferry Ltd
                p.997] 2 ALL E.R. 65 indicate that the availability of funding
                sources other than the Authority's ow n resources w ould be
                relevant.   Both cases emphasise the fact that the legal duties
                of an authority are qualified by the resources available to that
                authority. It is acknowledged that where an authority has a
                limited budget to satisfy various demands which it has a duty




                                   46
        to fulfil, it is entitled to decide how to best allocate that
        budget to the maximum advantage of the maximum number
        of persons w ho are entitled to its services, and m ust w eigh up
        the needs of one such person against another;

(c)     Given the acknowledgement in these cases of the need for
        police or other relevant authorities to spread                 limited
        resources between a number of different obligations, and to
        weigh up the needs of one potential beneficiary against
        another, it w ould seem inappropriate to exclude from
        consideration the fact that the officers, in this case, might
        receive financial support from the legal aid fund to mitigate
        their costs, whilst paying the costs might deprive the force of
        the funds required for other police purposes;

(d)    An}' assistance provided by the Authority in respect of future
        legal costs will be added to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray's
        capital resources in assessing their eligibility for legal aid. In
        effect this means that anv funding bv the Authority w ill
                                       ^         O    ^                 v


        corresponding!}’ reduce any contribution which the Legal Aid
        Fund would otherwise make to their costs; and

(e)    It is unlikely that Legal Aid w ill be awarded retrospectively
        and accordingly the former officers costs after 5 February
        1999 may be recoverable from no-one, if the Authority are
        unwilling to meet these costs.

We have asked the Solicitors for Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray to
provide details of their clients eligibility for legal aid, but this is still
awaited.

Criminal Costs - Central Funds

If Messrs Duckenfield and Murray -were tried but acquitted, or the
charges against them were dismissed at committal, or otherwise did
not proceed to trial in the Crown Court, an order for costs in their
favour to be paid out of central funds w ill be made unless there are
positive reasons for not doing so. Examples of such reasons include:
•      circumstances where their conduct has brought suspicion on
       themselves and has mislead the prosecution into thinking that
       the case against them is stronger than it is; and

•      circumstances where there is ample evidence to support a
       conviction but they are acquitted on a technicality which has
       no merit.

It w ill be recalled that such an order for costs was made in the South
Sefton Criminal Proceedings but that the Clerk to the Justices of the
South Sefton Magistrates' Court is considering whether Messrs
Duckenfield and Murrav should have their costs reimbursed.            The
Clerk to the Justices has based his reasoning on the decision in Miller.

In Miller, the Defendant was acquitted of causing an affray
whereupon an order was made in his favour for payment of his costs
out of central funds. When the costs were submitted for assessment
by the court, the court declined to assess the costs on the grounds that
the Defendant had not "incurred" costs as these had been met by his
employer.

On appeal to the High Court, it was held that a Defendant has
incurred costs if he is responsible for their payment, even though his
employers w ould have met the costs. In order to show that costs were
not incurred bv
              * the Defendant,' it was necessary
                                               •> to establish that there
w as an agreement binding on the solicitors that they w ould in no
circumstances seek to recover costs from the Defendant.
                                                                             )

The Clerk to the Justices contends that, in the light of Miller, the
assistance evidenced by the Authorities letters of 5 March 1998 to Mr
Duckenfield and 29 June 1998 to Mr Murray establishes that they have
not incurred legal costs. The solicitors for Messrs Duckenfield and
Murray have challenged this view, and Garretts opinion is firmly that
their challenge is correct (unless of course they have entered into
agreements with their respective clients to the effect that they w ill not
seek to recover costs from them).

Therefore, if the Authority were to re-instate the financial assistance
granted in 1998 in respect of both past and future costs, Messrs
Duckenfield and Murray should not be denied payment of their costs




                            48
       out of central funds on the principle enunciated in Miller. However,
       as the South Sefton Case shows, it is not uncommon for a court to
       deny a successful party its costs if another party is meeting these costs.
       There is therefore a risk that, even if Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
       are acquitted, the Authority will not be reimbursed the costs it has
       funded, even though Miller indicates this is wrong.

       Whilst the former officers could challenge such a refusal, there is also
       a danger that, were a further challenge to the High Court to be made,
       it might be held that Miller was wrongly decided and that Messrs
       Duckenfield and Murray should not have their costs paid out of
       central funds. Further, even if such a challenge were m ade and failed,
       this w ill entail further applications to the court which the Authority
       w ould need to support as the Authority w ould be directly affected by
       the outcome.

       It should also be observed that were Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
       to be convicted, orders for the prosecution costs may be made against
       them where a court is satisfied that the convicted person has the
       means and ability to meet the costs. A court m ay be more inclined to
       find that Messrs Duckenfield and Murray had the means to meet the
       prosecution costs if it were aware that the costs of their Defence were
       being met by the Authority.

       In the light of these matters, w e recommend that, if the Authority
       w ishes to grant financial assistance in respect of the Leeds (and South
       Sefton) proceedings, Garretts be instructed to draw up an agreement
       with each of Messrs Duckenfield and Murray’. This agreement should
       try to minim ise the likelihood of the court declining reimbtxrsement
       on grounds that Messrs Duclcenfield and Murray had not incurred
       costs.



OPTIONS OPEN TO THE AUTHORITY

South Sefton Criminal Proceedings

As noted above, it is likely that Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have a strong
case that the Authority is legally bound to pay their reasonable costs incurred
in the South Sefton Criminal Proceedings. However, in view of the fact that
the Clerk to the South Sefton Justices has yet to make a decision as to
payment of the costs from central funds, the Authority is recommended to
defer its decision on the costs of these proceedings until the Clerk's decision is
known.

South Sefton Tudicial Review

The Authority is recommended to defer consideration of whether to provide
assistance in the proposed judicial review of the decision of the Clerk to the
South Sefton Justices whether to pay the former officers' costs from central
funds until it is known what his decision is.

The Leeds Criminal Proceedings

9.3.1    As noted above, Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray have a strong case
         that the Authority is legally bound to pay their reasonable costs
         incurred in the Leeds Criminal Proceedings up until 5 February' 1999.
         The Authority is therefore recommended to pay these costs and to
         ask a legal costs draftsman to review the expenses claimed a n d / or
         apply to the Court for an assessment of the costs under Section 71
         Solicitors Act 1974.

9.3.2    In relation to costs incurred since 5 February 1999, the options open
         to the Authority include:-

         A.        Rej ection

         B.        Deferring consideration of the costs of the charge against
                   Mr D uckenfield of tending to pervert the course of
                   justice to await the outcome of his application to central
                    funds for costs

         C.        Deferring consideration on the other charges until after
                   the conclusion of the proceedings or the conclusion of
                    the committal proceedings on the grounds that only then
                   can   the Authority know          the   circumstances    of the
                   prosecution cases against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray,
                    and the likely cost of granting financial assistance.

         D.        Approving     the   application     subject   to   terms    and
                    conditions, e.g>
1.   that an agreed overall budget for the defendant's maximum
     costs should be fixed and other conditions for meeting the
     legal costs imposed including:-

            (i)   that the number of solicitors working on the case
                  should not exceed a specified number, nor should
                  there be more than a specified number of partners;

            (ii) the hourly rates payable for each level of fee earner is
                  fixed;

            (iii) rules on attendance of solicitors at hearings, meetings
                  and interviews are set;

            (iv) the circumstances in which Counsel and Leading
                  Counsel may be used, and the hourly or daily rates
                  payable for Counsel is agreed;

      (v)         that the costs of any other party which are awarded
                  against Mr Duckenfield or Mr Murray w ill not be met
                  bv the Authority;

      (vi)        that the costs be monitored on a regular basis;

      (vii)       that the Authority's contribution to Mr Duckenfield or
                  Mr Murray's legal costs may be withdrawn an d /or
                  clawed back if they have misled the Authority about
                  their case, failed to provide adequate evidence of the
                  costs they have incurred or otherwise conducted their
                  case unreasonably;

     (viii)       that the Authority' reserve the right to have the former
                  officer's costs up to Committal reviewed by a legal
                  costs draughtsman appointed by the Authority and to
                  pay such costs only to the extent that the Authority
                  advise these have been reasonably and properly
                  incurred.

2.    The Authority approves funding, at this stage, only up to the
      conclusion of the committal hearing, w hen the prosecutions
      may in any case              come   to an end,     further relevant




                              51
         circumstances come to light and the costs of funding to a full
         trial become easier to predict by the Authority.

E.      That the Authority w ill m eet a specific proportion of the
        costs only.




F.      That financial assistance is approved in principle, subject to
        the outcome of the proceedings. For example, it might be
        provided that costs be met upon acquittal of the officers and
        equally, costs could be conditional on conviction because,
        arguably, Messrs Duckenfield and Murray w ould not require
        financial assistance if they were acquitted because their costs
        w ill be met out of central funds. However, it w ould appear
        unreasonable or irrational to provide assistance conditional
        on conviction, and w ould increase the likelihood of a costs
        order being made against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray if
        it were known that their costs on conviction were being met
        by the Authority.

G.      to provide financial assistance b y w a y of loan on the basis
        that if Messrs Duckenfield and Murray are acquitted, they
        should have the funding to repay the authority from the costs
        award made from central funds.

Taking no decision, pending any decision by the Legal Aid
Authorities as to whether, and if so on what terms, to make legal aid
available to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray w ould appear not to be
an option, as w e are told by their solicitors that the legal aid
authorities are not w illing to decide on any application from them
for funding, unless and until the Authority itself rejects funding
them.

It is recommended that, if financial assistance is to be provided, it
should be provided:-

(a)     until the end of committal only at which time any further
        applications should be considered afresh;
        (b)    under an agreement with Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murray
               which makes the Authority's obligation to reimburse their
               costs subject to specific limits and conditions such as these set
               out at paragraph 9.3.2 D above; and

        (c)    within a structure designed to fall within Miller so that, as far
               as possible, an order for costs from central funds is not
               precluded in the event of an acquittal.

The DPP Judicial R eview

9.4.1   The options for the Authority are to

        (a)    reject the applications; or

        (b)    grant the applications subject to assessment of the costs by a
               legal costs draftsman; or

        (c)    award a proportion of the costs, for example by refusing to
               pay the costs awarded against Messrs Duckenfield and
               Murray in favour of the DPP.

9.4.2   The application should, however, be deferred pending details of die
        costs claimed by the DPP against Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.

The Powers Tudicial R eview

It is recommended that the application for Messrs Duckenfield and Murray's
costs for these proceedings be deferred to await assessment and payment of
the costs order obtained against Ms Adlington.

176   EXCLUSION OF PUBLIC AND PRESS

      RESOLVED - That, in view of the nature of the report before the Authority, under
      Section 100A(4) of the Local Government Act 1972, the public be excluded from
      the meeting for the following item on the grounds that in view of the nature of the
      item it is likely that if they were present exempt information as defined in
      paragraphs 5 and 12 of Part 1 of Schedule 12A of the Local Government Act 1972
      would be disclosed to them:-

      Paragraph 5 - Information relating to any particular applicant for, or recipient or
                    former recipient, of any financial assistance provided by the
                    Authority.

      Paragraph 12 - Any instructions to Counsel and any opinion of Counsel (whether
                     or not in connection with any proceedings) and any advice
                     received, information obtained or action to be taken in connection
                     with -

                      (a)   any legal proceedings by or against the Authority, or

                      (b)   the determination of any matter affecting the Authority.

                      (Whether, in either case, proceedings have been commenced or
                      are in contemplation).

177   FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

      The Clerk and Treasurer explained that the purpose of the meeting was to
      consider applications for financial assistance from two former officers, Mr David
      Duckenfield and Mr Bernard Murray, to meet their respective legal costs and
      disbursements in certain legal proceedings. He briefly explained that the Authority
      had, at its meeting of 5 February 1999, in the light of legal advice received from
      leading Counsel that there was doubt as to whether the Authority had legal power
      to provide such assistance, declared its earlier decisions to provide such
      assistance to Messrs Duckenfield and Murray null and void. The Clerk and
      Treasurer then introduced the Authority’s legal advisers, Garretts.

      Mr Painter of Garretts took the Authority through Garretts’ report dated 13 May
      1999, summarising its contents. Mr Painter described the different proceedings in
      respect of which Messrs Duckenfield and Murray were seeking financial
      assistance. He then summarised the previous decisions taken by the Authority in
      relation to financial assistance applications from Messrs Duckenfield and Murray.
      Mr Painter explained that the Divisional Court had on 31 March 1999 declared that
      a police authority had power, subject to ordinary public law principles, to provide
      financial assistance to police officers and former police officers in respect of their
      costs and expenses incurred in relation to private prosecutions brought against
      them and judicial review proceedings in which they participated.



                                            2
                                                                                SYPA
                                                                              21.5.99
Mr Painter explained that the Court had not expressed a view on whether the
Authority should provide financial assistance in this instance and that it was for the
Authority to decide, subject to ordinary public law principles, when and how to use
that power.

Mr Painter then summarised each of Messrs Duckenfield’s and Murray’s
applications for financial assistance and handed out a schedule of estimated costs
and expenses incurred and to be incurred by each of them together with a
schedule of the Police Authority’s and the Chief Constable’s costs and expenses
incurred and to be incurred in connection with the applications.

(Paragraph removed in accordance with section 100C o f the Local Government
A ct 1972)

Mr Painter explained that each of the applications in respect of costs and
expenses incurred in respect of each set of proceedings should be considered
afresh and should be considered separately. He summarised the public law
principles of decision making and drew attention to the considerations set out in
Garretts’ report.

In relation to the resources available to the Authority, the financial implications of
the applications for financial assistance and the operational considerations, the
Chief Constable took the Authority through the joint report of the Clerk and
Treasurer and Chief Constable dated 21 May 1999, summarising its contents.
The Chief Constable explained the operational impact on the Authority’s financial
position that the provision of financial assistance would have and commented that,
in his view, the negative effect that a decision not to provide financial assistance
would have on the conduct of the force outweighed that impact.

The Authority then considered whether Mr Trevor Hicks, a representative of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group, should be permitted to address the Authority
in relation to Mr Duckenfield’s and Mr Murray’s applications. Having taken advice
from Garretts and considered and debated the issue, the Authority resolved as
follows:

RESOLVED - That the Authority:-

1     Permit Mr Hicks to address the Authority in relation to Mr Duckenfield’s and
      Mr Murray’s applications for financial assistance.

2     Hear such representations from Mr Hicks before hearing representations on
      behalf of Messrs Duckenfield and Mr Murray.

The Authority then heard representations from:-

(a)   Mr Hicks.
(b)   Mr Manning of Walker Morris on behalf of Mr Murray.
(c)   Mr Eastwood of Winckworth Sherwood on behalf of Mr Duckenfield.
                                                                               SYPA

               Adlington —v -> David DuckertfSeld and Bernard Murray

 Ruling

 This case concerns the tragic events which took place on the 15 April 1989 during a
 F A Cup Semi-Final Soccer Match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at
 Hillsborough Stadium In Sheffield the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.
 Play was stopped after 6 mins when it was realised that Liverpool Spectators on the
 Standing Terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground had been seriously
 crushed. 95 people died, over 400 required hospital treatment. In 1993 a 96mvictim
 died.


 There followed a series of investigations and other enquiries. L.J. Taylor conducted
 a public enquiry for which the West Midlands police collected a large amount of
 evidence. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) considered criminal charges
 against police officers and others.   The Police Complaints Authority considered
 complaints against senior police officers.      There was a coroner's inquest whose
 conduct was itself later considered by the Divisional Court. These enquiries and the
 inquest and the hearing in the Divisional Court covered the period from 1989 to
 1993. L.J. Stuart-Smith carried out a scrutiny in 1997, the conclusions of which I
 shall return to later.


 Private prosecutions began in Leeds Magistrates’ Court in July of 1998 with the
 laying of informations against David Duckenfield and Bernard Murray.            Each
 defendant now faces two allegations of manslaughter and an allegation of
 misfeasance of public office. David Duckenfield also faced a further allegation of
 perverting the course of justice which in the meantime has been discharged. The
  Defendant's first appeared at Leeds Magistrates’ Court on the 20 August 1998 when
 it was made clear that a section 6(1) ’old style' committal would be necessary in this
 case.    It subsequently became apparent that the defendants would make an
  application to stay these proceedings on the grounds that in all the circumstances
 they are so unfair as to amount to an abuse of process. This application has now
  been made and has been taken as a preliminary and discrete point before the
  committal proceedings.   I have heard evidence and submissions taking five days

          it today Thursday 15^ July.


          The Law


          It was agreed by Counsel that the Magistrates' Court whether conducting a summary
          trial or acting as examining magistrates has power to stay proceedings on the basis
          of an abuse of process. I have been referred to numerous authorities on this topic
          and I am most grateful to ail Counsel for their assistance.                 The power of the
          magistrates' court has been refined over the years. In R - v - Derby Crown Court
          ex-parte Brooks (1984) 80CR.APP.R.164, the Lord Chief Justice said at page 168


          "The pow er to stop a prosecution arises only when it is an abuse of the process of

          the court.         It m ay be an abuse o f process if either a) the prosecution have

          manipulated or misused the process of the court so as to deprive the defendant of a
          protection provided by the law or to take unfair advantage of a technicality, or b) on

          the balance of probability the defendant has been or will be prejudiced in the

          preparation or conduct of his defence by delay on the part of the prosecution which

          is unjustifiable.       Fo r example, not due to the complexity o f the enquiry and

          preparation of the prosecution case, or to the action of the defendant or his co-

          accused, or the genuine difficulty in affecting service.        We doubt whether the other

          epithets which are sometimes used in relation to delay, such as "unconscionable ",

          ",inordinate " or "oppressive" do more than add an emotive tone to an already

          sufficiently difficult problem



          Further assistance was given in the case of R - v - Telford Justices ex*parte Badhan
          (1991) 2Q.B.78 when Mann L.J. said at page 90


          “We emphasise that the power which the Justices have is one fo prevent an abuse of
          process. They have no power to refuse to embark on an enquiry because they think

          that a prosecution should not have been brought because it is for example, '‘mean-
          minded", “petty" or emanated by personal hostility.             It is for this reason that the

          powers o f the justices are said to be ‘very strictly confined”. '

               "as in a case o f delay, we think the onus will normally be on the accused to show
               that on the balance o f probability a fa ir trial is now impossible. How the accused is to
               discharge the onus upon him must depend on all the circumstances o f the case.
               Thus, he m ay find his task more difficult in a case wholly dependent on
              contem porary and available documents than he would in a case such as is the
              present which is dependent wholly upon a late complaint and oral testimony.


               In R - V - Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court ex parte Bennett (1994) 1A.C.42
      £        House of Lords, Lord Griffiths gave yet further guidance to the Magistrates' Court
               page 62. He said


               "the po w e r has recently and most comprehensively been considered and affirmed by
               the divisional court (in the Badhan case.) Provided it is appreciated by magistrates
               that this is a pow er to be most sparingly exercised, o f which they have received more
               than sufficient ju dicial w arning        it appears to me to be a beneficial development
               and l am unpersuaded that there are any sufficient reasons to overrule a long line o f
               authority developed by successive Lord C hief Justices and Judges in the Divisional
               Court who are daily in much closer touch with the work in the m agistrates’ court then
              yo u r Lordships.           N or do I see any force in an argument developed by the
      ®       respondents which sought to equate abuse of process with contempt o f court.                               I
               would accordingly affirm the pow er o f the magistrates whether sitting as committing
              justices o r exercising their summary jurisdiction , to exercise control over their
              proceedings through an abuse o f process jurisdiction.                   However, in the case o f
               magistrates this pow er should be strictly confined to matters directly affecting the
               fairness o f the trial o f the particular accused with whom they are dealing, such as
               delay o r unfair manipulation o f court procedures.           Although it may be convenient to
               label the w ider supervisory jurisdiction with which we are concerned in this appeal
               under the head o f abuse o f process, it is in fact a horse o f a very different colour
               from the narrow er          issues that arise when considering domestic criminal trial
              procedures".

Trie one fundamental principle which anaes from these authorities and many others
is one of fairness an imprecise concept and often as in the present case open to
debate.


In Tan - v - Cameron (1993) 96CR.APP.R 172 Lord Mustill at page 184 identified
the question there as


"whether it was unfair any longer to hold the defendant to account


He stated it was a question to be considered in the round; “a single appreciation of
what is o r is not unfair".


In the unreported case of R - v - Reade Morris and Woodwiss. Mr Justice Garland
added the following propositions to the basic concept of fairness:


1     the burden of establishing unfairness rests on the defendant alleging it.


2     the standard of proof required is on the balance of probabilities, but


3     the jurisdiction to grant a stay should be regarded as exceptional and to be
       used sparingly and only for compelling reasons


4      in(assessing the relevant degree of unfairness or prejudice a court must bear
       in mind


       i)      the power of a judge to regulate the admissibility of evidence.


       ii)     the trial process, which should ensure that the jury have any relevant
               issues placed before them.


       iii)    the power of the judge to give appropriate directions at any stage of the
               trial and. not least, in summing up.

             therefore take all these matters into account.


              I particularly remind myself that when I consider the concept of "fairness" I should
             restrict it to matters directly affecting the fairness of the trial of these particular
             accused and put aside issues which would come under the label of the “wider
             supervisory jurisdiction” of the High Court.


             History


              It is necessary to set out the history of this case in some detail in order to understand
             the arguments that are put forward by both the defendant applicants and the
             prosecution. The disaster occurred on the afternoon of the 15 April 1989. It was
             captured live by BBC and other cameras and was broadcast immediately on
             television and radio. Not surprisingly the media coverage was immense from the
             cutset. At 9.00 am on the 16 April 1989 a debriefing took place at which Mr Wright
             the Chief Constable was present. Also present were the two defendants and many
             other senior and junior police officers. There was a further debriefing the following
             day at which both defendants were present. The briefing notes will be referred to
             later in this ruling. Also on the 17 April 1989 L.J. Taylor was appointed to conduct a
             public enquiry. The terms of reference were as follows;


             "to inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the 15 April
              1989 and to m ake recommendations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at
             sports events".


             The hearing began on the 15 May. It continued for 31 days, concluding on the 29
             June. In that period. 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsels' submissions were
             delivered in writing on the 7 July and on the 14 July L.J. Taylor heard their brief oral
             submissions supplementing the written argument. Witnesses were not sworn, there
             was evidently no power to administer the oath. L.J. Taylor also took into account
             many written statements in addition to oral testimony.                       The interim report was
             published on the 4 August 1989. It was known that the statements provided to the
             enquiry by the West Midlands Police had been edited. The effect of the editing has

               b e e n su b jec t to m uch arg u m e n t sin ce then. S ta te m e n ts had initially b e e n obtained
               from police officers of the South Yorkshire Police who had been on duty on the 15
               April 1989 and they included their evidence of feelings and opinion. It w a s thought
               right to edit that evidence of feeling and opinion from the statements that were
               provided to the Taylor enquiry.           Unfortunately, the tenor of the editing which has
               been illustrated to me during this case shows that many adverse comments about
               the control by senior police officers were removed from the statements of junior
               police officers.         In the event that did not prevent Lord Taylor concluding that ' the
               main reason fo r the disaster was the failure o f police control" (Interim report
               paragraph 278). I consider it is unnecessary to explain the reasons for the disaster
               in great detail in this ruling. In brief, David Duckenfield had been promoted to Chief
               Superintendent some 21 days before the match was due to take place. He was in
               overall charge of the policing operation for that day. He had no recent experience of
               policing at any football match let alone a sell-out semi-final. Superintendent Murray
               had the relevant recent experience and basically was Mr Duckenfield’s right-hand
               man. There was a dangerous build-up; of spectators outside the turnstiles at the
               Lepping’s Lane end of the ground between 2.30 and 2.45 pm for a 3 00 pm kick-off.
               As a result at 2.47 pm a request was made to the police control room for permission
               to open the exit gates to relieve the pressure of the build-up at the turnstiles. David
               Duckenfield gave permission for the gates to be opened at 2.52 pm when pens 3
               and 4 behind the Liverpool goal were already over full. Gate C was opened and a
               large number of spectators entered the ground fairly quickly and made their way
               through a tunnel to the rear of pens 3 and 4. immediately behind the goal. This led                               m

               to the crushing of spectators in pens 3 and 4 and the stopping of the game at 6
               minutes past 3. At chapter 16 Lord Taylor gave a brief summary of the causes of the
               disaster.


               P aragraph 265. The immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the
               disaster was the failure . when Gate 0 was opened, to cut-off access to the central
               pens which were already over full.


               P aragraph 266.           They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities
               had been laid down, no attempt was made to control entry to individual pens                                       £
               numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring o f crowd density.


                                                                                                                         6

The findings in an earlier paragraph are also important.


P aragraph 231. It should have been clear in the control room where there was a
view o f the pens and o f the crowd at the turnstiles that the tunnel had to be closed. If
orders had been given to that effect when Gate C was opened, the fans could have
been directed to the empty areas o f the wings and the disaster could still have been
averted. Failure to give that order was a blunder o f the first magnitude.


As I have indicated the police in genera) have been criticised by Lord Taylor, but
Oavtd Duckenfield in particular came in for heavy criticism.


P aragraph 281.    Mr Duckenfield lent heavily on M r Murray's experience, between
them they m isjudged the build-up at the turnstiles and did little about it until they
received M r M arshall’s request to open the gate.       They did not. fo r example, check
the turnstile figures available from club control or check v/ith Tango Units as fo the
numbers still to come. They did not alert M r Greenwood to the situation at the fringe
o f his area command. They gave no instructions as to the management o f the crowd
at Leppings Lane, inflexibly they declined to postpone kick-off.


P aragraph 282.    When M r Marshall's request came, M r Duckepfield's capacity to
take decisions and give orders seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at lastr the
opening o f the gates , he failed to give necessary consequential orders to exert any
control when the disaster occurred.


P aragraph 283. Most surprisingly, he gave M r Kelly and other's to think that there
had been an in-rush due to Liverpool fans forcing open a gate.              This was not only
untruthful it set o ff a widely reported allegation against the supporters which caused
grave offence and distress.


Lord Taylor was then prepared to assume that Mr Duckenfield's lack of candour on
that occasion was out of character.


In Paragraph 284. Lord Taylor described Mr Duckenfield a s having "frozen".


                                                                                            /

         Lord Taylor also criticised the police in the way in which they conducted their case at
         the enquiry,


         Paragraph 285. It is a matter o f regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions,
         the South Yorkshire Police were no t prepared to concede that they were in any
         respect at fault at what occurred .              M r Duckenfield, under pressure o f cross
         examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans fo r causing the deaths but,
         that apart, the police case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to
         blame the club fo r failing to m onitor the pens.


         After the interim report a large number of witness statements were sent to the DPP
         for his consideration. It became apparent that it was the edited statements which
         were sent to him and of the huge number of witness statements obtained by the
         West Midlands Police both from police officers and spectators at the ground, the
         DPP was sent approximately 11% of those witness statements. Although it must be
         the case that there was a great deal of duplication in those witness statements it is
         unknown precisely upon which information the OPP subsequently made the decision
         not to bring any criminal prosecutions against any police officer in this case. Two
         Senior Queen's Counsel advised the OPP in relation to this case, the advice has not
         been made public.              On the 18 April 1990, Ooctor Popper, the Coroner for South
         Yorkshire began the first of 95 mini-inquests to decide the statutory questions as to
         who each of the deceased was and when and where he or she died. He did not deal
         at that stage with the remaining statutory question of how each victim died, since that
         could not be answered pending the decision of the OPP as to whether or not any
         prosecutions should be brought against any of those involved.


         The decision by the DPP not to prosecute was taken in August of 1990. On the 19
         November 1990 the inquests were resumed at Sheffield. These proceedings have
         been referred to as the ‘main inquest’ since they were concerned with the question
         common to all the then 95 deceased of how they came to their deaths. Around 200
         witnesses gave evidence at these resumed inquests including 56 who had done so
         before Lord Taylor.



                                                                                                            8

On the 28 March 1991 the Jury returnea veroicts of accloeniai oeam    !n   an 93   cases,

by majorities of 9 to 2. The families of the bereaved were unhappy with the way in
which the inquests were conducted, in particular the decision of the Coroner to
impose a 3.15 pm cut-off time in relation to evidence to be called before him.
Evidence has subsequently come to light to suggest that some of the deceased were
still alive at 3.15 pm and died later.


On the 11 July 1991 the Police Complaint's Authority directed disciplinary
proceedings against both Duckenfield and Murray for neglect of duty. In November
1991 Duckenfield retired from the Police on grounds of ill health.          Disciplinary
proceedings against him were then withdrawn and shortly afterwards the disciplinary
proceedings against Murray were also withdrawn.


In April 1992 the bereaved families approached the Attorney-General inviting him to
exercise his powers under the Coroner's Act 1988 to appfy for new inquests and that
was on the basis of evidence that had come to light since the original inquests. In
A jgust that year the Attorney-General announced that he had declined to do so.


In April 1993, six families who had lost relations at Hillsborough were granted leave
to move for judicial review to quash the verdict of the inquests and seek a fresh
hearing. On the 5 November 1993 the Divisional Court dismissed that application.
Civil claims for compensation have been made throughout the period since the
disaster. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has not contested liability for these
claims, thought tie has sought contribution from other parties.


On the 5 December 1996, Granada Television broadcast a programme entitled
"Hillsborough''. The programme presented an emotive and powerful picture of the
plight of the bereaved immediately following and in the aftermath of the tragedy, it
also suggested that there was fresh evidence, which had not previously been
considered which called into question the verdict at the inquests and perhaps some
other decisions.


On the 30 June 1997, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, the Right
Honourable Jack Straw MP, appointed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to conduct a

                                      previously considered by them which may be relevant to their
                                      respective duties; and to advise whether there is any other action
                                      which should be taken in the public interest.


            The nature of the scrutiny was that H was not a public hearing. Lord Justice Stuart-
                Smith was provided with a number of witness statements and that included the
                unedited and edited statements of police officers. He was also provided with a list of
            submissions made on behalf of the bereaved families which was prepared by Mr A
            Jones QC in advance of the hearing without him knowing exactly what Lord Justice
                Stuart'Smith had been provided with or being able to see that evidence.                           The
            submissions concerning new evidence centred around:


                i)       video camera evidence
            ii)          the 3.15 pm cut-off time in relation to the inquests



                                                                                                                    10

The bereaved families were also given the opportunity of putting forward not only
their own submissions but witnesses they considered important and that is how a Mr
Houldsworth was put forward. He was the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club video
technician. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith read those submissions, he read a number of
witness statements and himself interviewed a total of 14 witnesses. The Scrutiny
was published on the 18 February 1998 and is a total of 222 pages in length. Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith considered what his terms of reference meant and in relation to
evidence which was not previously available, he concluded that that meant either it
had not been given in evidence to Lord Taylor or the Coroner or that evidence had
not been considered by the DPP so long as it was not in the public domain. For the
evidence to be significant he concluded it must first be credible but then must also
differ in some important way from evidence which has already been given,            in
relation to this prosecution the evidence which was of potential significance was the
video evidence. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith read the statements of Mr Houldsworth
and also interviewed him during the Scrutiny.


Chapter 2 paragraph 96 o f the Scrutiny sets out Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
conclusions about the evidence of Mr Houldsworrh and how it affected the video
evidence. He was unable to accept that Mr Houldsworth recollection of the events
was accurate. To further summarise LJ. Stuart-Smith's conclusions ( quote from
chapter 7 paragraph 6 . "None o f the evidence I was asked to consider added
anything significant to the evidence which was available to Lord Taylor's enquiry or
to the inquests."


The evidence he was asked to consider included about 100 police witness
statements in their edited and unedited form in order to assess the significance of
the deletions. L.J. Stuart-Smith declined to describe the deletions as a cover up or
misleading but he did state that in a few cases it would have been preferable if the
deletions had not been made.

             in   April 1 9 9 9 a decision w a s m a d e by the Hillabocough Fam ily Support C r^ u p

             (hereinafter referred to as HFSG) to commence private prosecutions against
             Duckenfield and Murray. Initially proceedings began in South Sefton Magistrates’
             Court but the defence took a jurisdictional point.            Without conceding that
             jurisdictions? point the prosecution withdrew those proceedings and began new
             proceedings in the Leeds Magistrates' Court,         This had the effect of delaying
             proceedings for a matter of a couple of weeks only.         Informations were laid and
             summons signed on the 18 July 1998 requiring the defendants Duckenfield and
             Murray to attend for the first hearing on the 20 August. Almost immediately the
             Defendants made submissions to the DPP to intervene in the proceedings and
             discontinue them pursuant to the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.                  The
              Prosecution also prepared detailed submissions. The DPP announced the decision
             not to intervene on the 18 December 1998.           He gave written reasons for that
             decision in a letter dated 1 February 1999. The defendants applied for a judicial
             review of that decision.


             The hearing was consolidated with another hearing concerning the legality and
             correctness of the defendants' funding by the South Yorkshire Police Authority. The
              DPP’s decision not to intervene was upheld by the Divisional Court on 31 March
              1999.


             The issues


              I have already indicated the charges each defendant faces. The prosecution case
             put simply is as follows:


             The primary and immediate cause of the deaths was traumatic asphyxiation, caused
              by the gross negligence of the two defendants in allowing severe overcrow ding in
              pens 3 and 4 of the west terraces to develop between 2.30 and 3.06 pm. The
             defendants were on duty in the elevated control box at the south west corner of the
              ground which had dear views across the pitch along the 9 0 a! line of the west end of
              the ground and of the west terraces. In addition to being able to look out of the
              window and use their own eyes they had a number of monitors in the control &ox
              from which they could observe the condition of the terraces and th e Leppings L ane


                                                                                                   12
ta   c b t-’on                                    GSSciA 93ZT0 - aaHnOS-.MIDT        S t-:iT    bb iO ST
e n tra n c e to th e grouno.   They had a zoom facility allowing them to focus «r< any
problem areas covered by the equipment, which included pens 3 and 4 of the
Leppings Lane terraces and the areas around and outside the turnstiles.               The
supporters of Liverpool club were allocated the north and west sides of the ground,
and arrived from Leppings Lane.


By 2.30 pm there was a very substantial crowd at the turnstiles where there was no
queuing system, and an insufficient number of turnstiles and police officers to
process the crowd. Between 2.30 and 2.45 pm the crowd grew in size more quickly
than the turnstiles could admit spectators. A press was caused by the increasing
numbers funnelling into the turnstile area, anxious to get into the ground by Kick-off
time. The spectator witnesses and video tape show that the crowd was enthusiastic
and cheerful, some supporters climbed over the wall to get into the ground,
apparently to escape the crush.         Although there was some misbehaviour as the
video tape and spectator evidence illustrates there was no genera) misbehaviour.


At about 2.45 pm Superintendent Marshall asked for gate C to be opened to relieve
the press. At 2.45 pm that gate was opened from the inside to eject a supporter, and
a number of peopie came in. That gate was shut. Insistent further demands for the
gate to be opened were made as it was considered by officers near the turnstiles
that the press was a danger to life.         The risk to life at the turnstiles, which had
steadily developed from 2.15 pm was a grave crisis and the prosecution contend
required two things by 2.45 pm:


i)     an announcement to supporters inside and outside the ground by the public
        address system at the start of the game would be delayed;


ii)    that any further supporters entering the west end of the ground even if by
       turnstiles alone should be diverted from the tunnel which led to the central
        pens.


At 2.52 pm Mr Quckenfield gave an order to open the gates, gate C was opened.
Between that time and Kick off at 3.00 pm many hundreds of supporters went in.
Those in the control box could or should have seen both the condition of the central
pens and the conditions at the turnstiles.   W h e n gat©   c   w as   ih e central pens

numbered 3 and 4 were already full and should have been apparent to the
defendants whose responsibilities for ensuring the safety included monitoring the
pens. Access to the pens was through the tunnel under the west stand.             If the
defendants had ordered police officers to block or close off the tunnel to pens 3 and
4.   the tragedy would have been avoided.       The defendants owed a duty of care to
those in the pens, adults and children alike, and those entering the ground, to
prevent them from being crushed.       Diversion from the tunnel was a simple and
obvious step that could have been taken and should have been taken at 2.45 pm
before the request came to open the gates. It obviously should have been taken in
any event between the time of the request to open the gates and the kick-off. It was
criminally negligent not to have taken this obvious precaution between at the lates*
2.45 pm and the time when the game was stopped 3.06 pm.


The prosecution therefore simply say that the defendants are guilty of manslaughter
because a) they owed the deceased a duty of care; b) that they were negligent; c)
that their negligent actions or omissions were a substantial cause of death and d)
that their negligence was of such a gravity as to amount to a crime within the
principle in R —v - Adomako (1995) 1A.C.181


"the essence o f the matter, which is supremely a ju ry question , is whether having
regard to the risk o f death involved the conduct o f the defendant was so bad in all
the circumstances as to amount in their judgem ent to a criminal act or omission" at
page 107.


The prosecution submit that the only apparent issue in this case can be whether the
negligence was of such a gravity as to amount to a crime.


I have set out these matters in my ruling because it is clear from the case of R - v -
Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex parte DPP (1992) 95CR.APP.R.9
that in order to consider prejudice particularly in relation to delay l need to consider
the issues in the case.     In their initial submissions neither Mr Clegg QC nor Mr
Harrison QC set out what the issues were and how either defendant was prejudiced
by the delay in this case. An issue then arose during argument in this way. The
 A Si.   J V |* .   | «l V   1 «l I ( . W ,
                                                                                            ttu. M j u     r.   n




            prosecution h a s stated that its case is Dasea upon ihe nnoings of xne Tayior enquiry.
            The Defence said well what about paragraph 78 which reads as follows:


             "in the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding o r anything amiss in pens 3
             and 4 until the first fans spilt out onto the perimeter track ju s t before kick-off. Then
             the officers in command assumed that there was an attempted pitch invasion".


            The prosecution apparently do not accept this particular finding and intend to put
            their case in the alternative, in this way; that the defendants did notice or. in the
            alternative, should have noticed the overcrowding in pens 3 and             In the light of that
            the defence now say that the issue of what the defendants in fact saw in the pens is
             a relevant issue in the case and therefore by inference what other witnesses,
            particularly police officers on duty on the touch line and in the west stand themselves
            saw is an important issue and that their memories on the point are bound to be
             affected by the passage of time. Mr Clegg QC also argued that the decision to open
            the gates was a difficult one for Duckenfield and goes to the issue of foreseeability.
             He went on that in any consideration of foreseeability it was important for
             Duckenfield to rely upon other people's perception which would be difficult after 10 or
             11      years. I shall now move on to deal with this and other arguments raised during
            submissions.


            Counsels’ Submissions


            Mr Harrison expressly adopted the submissions of Mr Clegg and then expanded
            upon them particularly on the topic relating to publicity. They both submitted that in
            the light of the history of the case the prosecution reflected a refusal on the part of
            those responsible for bringing the case to accept the decisions of various
            investigations into the tragedy, including the Taylor enquiry where Duckenfield and
            Murray gave evidence over a lengthy period, the decision of the OPP not to
            prosecute either defendant in August 1990, the accidental death verdict of the
            Coroner’s Jury and the findings of the Stuart-Smith Scrutiny. It was argued that the
            findings of the Scrutiny impliedly affirmed that the decision of the DPP not to
            prosecute was right and that there was no significant evidence to alter that decision.
            They argued that after 10 years of enquiry, investigation, inquest and scrutiny it is


36t-‘0H                                            668c*Li S e e TO <- BciHnOS-.MI jT    S f .J L T      6 6 \LO S T
O ppressive m e n to DrJng a private prosecution.          I tak e th e u s e nf the word
"oppressive” to mean unfair in the context of this application.


They further submitted that the essential criminality' alleged by the prosecution is the
same as that which was investigated at the Taylor enquiry, that the evidence upon
which they rely is essentially the same as the evidence the DPP had in deciding not
to prosecute and that to commence private prosecutions based on the same
evidence so long after the event is unfair and would test the public confidence in and
the integrity of the system. They also submitted that the delay of 10 years is such
that a fair trial is impossible; that would be the case irrespective of any fault by the
prosecution but in any event the prosecution, they say. could and should have been
brought many years earlier than it has been.


They then submitted that in the context of delay the court should consider the
alleged breach of article S of the European Convention on Human Rights. They both
went on to make strong submissions about the media coverage in the case; that it
had been very extensive and intense; that much of it had been instigated by the
prosecution and by that they meant the HFSG; that it was overwhelmingly prejudicial
and that there cou)d not be a fair trial at any time in the future.


They further submitted that the Prosecutor Ann Adlington had lost all sense of
objectivity, had unfairly selected evidence upon which the prosecution rely and had
failed to consider the effect of bringing a prosecution upon either defendant.


Mr Jones submitted that the prosecution did accept the findings of the Taylor enquiry
and that was the basis of the prosecution case. He did not accept the verdict of the
Coroner's Jury and did not accept Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny save in so far
as it supported the Taylor findings. He said that neither the prosecution nor the court
were bound by these decisions because there is no doctrine of issue estoppel in
English criminal law. He also submitted that the South Yorkshire Police had carried
out a concerted cover up, had concealed evidence, edited statements and had
misled the DPP. the Coroner's Court and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.            He further
submitted that the onus was on the applicants to show unfairness and or oppression
and that they had not called any evidence to support their submissions. He said of
delay mat the defence had not at any stage ioentiffed th e is s u e s in the c a s e so a s to
enable the court assess an y prejudice the defendants may have suffered or will
suffer. He argued that the essential issue was one of gross negligence and that the
vast majority of the evidence would not be in dispute, much of it was captured on
video, witness statements were taken at the time, and therefore the issues would not
be adversely affected by the delay in this case. He argued that the delay was not
the fault of the prosecution in this case, that there were good reasons for the delay
which included; a lack of funding; the concealment of evidence; the difficulties over
disclosure and the drip feed effect of the evidence in this case. He submitted that
the publicity was not such as to render a fair trial impossible. He argued that there
were two conflicting interests of the police and the Liverpool fans both of whom had
influenced the media and that they balanced each other out to some extent.


Of necessity these are only brief summaries of careful, detailed and extensive
submissions, but further arguments put forward by both parties will be referred to in
the remainder of my ruling.


Many of these submissions have been made both by the prosecution and the
defence at various stages of this case,           p a rtic u la rly   in relation to the recent
proceedings concerning the OPPs decision not to intervene in these private
prosecutions.


It follows from what I have just said that the applicants did not call any evidence to
support their submissions of oppression or how that and the delay and the alleged
adverse publicity has directly affected the defendants.                Neither has any written
evidence of the defendants' health, state of mind, personal circumstances or how
these proceedings have in any way affected them been put before me so I am,
therefore, only able to make proper inferences where I can. The court clearly has
power to hear evidence during an abuse of process application and ought to if either
party wishes to call evidence. See R - v - Clerkenwell Stipendiary Magistrate ex
parte Bell (1991) S5J.P.669.


On the other hand the prosecution has called the Prosecutor Ann Adiington to
explain various aspects of the background to this prosecution. She is a solicitor who

               she became the Solicitor for the Hillsborough Disaster Working Party and in that
               capacity advised bereaved families generally in relation to all aspects of the disaster.
               In August 1997 she was seconded to become the Solicitor for the HFSG.                         She
               explained that she had been chosen as the prosecutor as a kind of figurehead and to
               avoid any clash of personalities within the HFSG had a bereaved member of the
               HFSG been chosen instead.


                    deal now with the various submissions in turn.


                I              Oppression
                               I reject the defence submission that the prosecution or this court is in any way
                               bound by eariier decisions or findings, accepting as I do that there is no
                               doctrine of issue estoppel in English criminal law.         See Director of Public
                               Prosecutions - v - Humphrys (1977) A.C.1 House of Lords.            Regarding the
                               Taylor enquiry the prosecution does accept the findings of the Taylor enquiry
                               and bases its case upon them. The defence pointed to an earlier submission
                               made by Mr Jones when he stated that the Taylor enquiry "almost" amounts
                               to a prima facie case, but \ accept Mr Jones' response during which he
                               reminded me of the terms of reference which in no way permitted Lord Justice
                               Taylor to give an opinion upon anyone's criminal responsibility let alone
                               recommend criminal proceedings.      In that sense the findings of the Taylor
                               enquiry do stop short of a prima facie case.


                               Regarding the DPP's decision not to prosecute, I do not know the basis upon
                               which a decision was reached, I do not know what evidence the DPP was
                               provided with and I have not seen the QCs advice which has not been made
                               public. I do not accept that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's Scrutiny implies that
                               the DPP was right in its decision not to prosecute and that as a result of the
                               Scrutiny no subsequent prosecution ought to be brought although I have
                               borne in mind the Scrutiny as a whole.         It was further argued that it can
                               amount to an abuse of process in circumstances where a prosecution is
                               brought after a defendant has been informed that he will not be prosecuted.
                               The defence referred to a number of authorities, including R - v - Croydon


                                                                                                               18

                            I agree with Mr Clegg when he stated that it must be a question of fact and
                        degree        w h e th e r   a private prosecution amounts to an abuse of process after a
                            decision by the DPP not to prosecute has been made and communicated to a
                            suspect. Clearly if a decision to prosecute privately is made immediately after
                            the decision by the DPP it will be almost impossible to establish abuse
                            because the effect would be to fetter the right of a private individual to
                            prosecute when the state declines. Mr Clegg argues that where, however,
                            nine years elapses between the two decisions then the existence of
                            unfairness can be presumed, if it were argued that this amounts to an unfair
                            manipulation of the court proceedings I would reject that argument because
                            whatever the delay the effect would be to fetter right of a private individual to
                            prosecute. This point, therefore, is better left to be considered with the other
                            points relating to the issue of delay.


                            There is little I need to say about the inquest. The purpose of an inquest is
                            specific and the verdict of accidental death in my view does not undermine
                            this prosecution or in itself make it unfair.                   L.J. Stuart-Smith indicated in
                            chapter 1 paragraph 66 that the verdicts of accidental death did not. as had
                            been suggested, undermine or reverse the findings of LJ. Taylor.


                            Regarding the Scrutiny I have already made comments about the Scrutiny in
                            so far as it affects the issues in this application. The terms of reference were
                            very specific and related to the evidence of Mr Houldsworth, video evidence
                            and the editing of police statements to which I shall return later.                          Neither
                            Ouckenfield nor Murray were called before the Scrutiny, and i have no
                            evidence as to how the fact the Scrutiny took place affected them,                                it is
                            difficult in those circumstances to infer oppression or unfairness in relation to
                            this matter. The defence have argued that the failure of the prosecution to
                            accept the various findings can be equated with the Maxwell No.2 case
                            (unreported) where Mr Justice 8 uckley said at page 24.

                            s h o u l d b e unusual   for a s econ d trial to laka place. The reason is th a t it would
                            be very likely to appear to the public that the authorities were not prepared to
                            accept the verdict o f a ju ry and were determined to pursue the defendant at
                                whatever cast to the public purse, court time o r disruption o f the defendants
                            personal life , business o r professional career. That must not happen. “


                            That case is wholly distinguishable from the present case in that there had
                            already been a jury trial and the issues in the second trial were very similar,
                            although relating to a different transaction, essentially boiling down to a
                            question of the defendant's honesty. A jury's verdict after a very lengthy trial
                            cannot in my view be equated to decisions that have taken place in these
                            present proceedings. The Maxwell No. 2 case is an illustration of a case
                            where oral evidence was given {by Kevin Maxwell’s wife) of the terrible strain
                            and stress suffered by the whole family. As a result Mr Justice Buckley said
                            this at page 27.
                                "Finally ,; an important, though not decisive consideration; fairness to the
                            defendants. I have mentioned the time that these criminal proceedings would
                            have been hanging over their heads in the event o f a further trial, at least five
                            years, that would be so in M r Kevin M a x e ll's case, not withstanding that in
                            going through the extremely lengthy trial process he gave evidence before a
                            ju ry for twenty days and not withstanding the acquittals, the disruption to
                            personal and business life is inevitably considerable. The stress and pain that
                            crim inals inflict on their families is a sad but inevitable consequence o f their
                            m isdeeds . Courts are mindful o f it but obviously cannot allow it to outweigh
                            consideration fo r victims and the general public interest in punishing crime,
                            bu t l remind m yself here that these defendants have been acquitted in the
                            circumstances I have described."


                            There is no similar situation in the present case, neither defendant has
                            already faced a criminal trial, the cases are not sufficiently similar to place any
                            great weight on the defendants’ submissions. Finally the defence have also
                            suggested that the prosecution must show that the earlier decisions were in
                            some way flawed. 1 disagree for the reasons I have already given; although
                            Mr Jones spent time trying to show that various people including the DPP, the

                C o ro n e r e n d Lord Ju stice Stuart-Sm ith had b e e n misled, in m y view without
                much success.


                I should also mention that my attention has been drawn to the submissions
                made by the Defence to the DPP in their attempts to persuade the DPP to
                intervene      in   these   proceedings and     discontinue.      The    defendant’s
                submissions to the DPP are similar to those put forward before me and failed
                to persuade the DPP to discontinue, therefore the prosecution says how can I
                come to a different decision to his where it is said he has a wider discretion
                than I.


                    I have already indicated that 1 am not bound by earlier decisions .in these
                proceedings, and it is particularly so in this instance, where it is clear from the
                DPP's reasons that he is able to take into account the seriousness of the
                offences charged in weighing up the ‘public interest1.. 1 cannot take such a
                matter into consideration although as Buckley J said in Maxwell No.2 there
                are matters of "public interest" which go to the issue of “fairness” to both the
                prosecution and the defence and can properly be taken into account.


                    I am not persuaded that these submissions give me grounds for staying these
                proceedings as an abuse of process.


                    Delay


                    In a case involving delay the court will consider the reasons for the delay and
                the responsibility, If any, of either the prosecution or the defence for the delay.
                    The court will also consider the issues which are likely to arise at the hearing
                and the nature of the evidence which is likely to be relevant (See Badhan). I
                have already set out the history of the case which goes some way to
                    explaining the delay.    Further Ann Adlington refers to the history in her
                    statement which she adopted as her evidence in chief and upon which she
                was cross-examined.          The reasons for the delay can be summarised as
                follows.
A lthough I w ould   not go so   fa r   ae to say that   th«r^ has b e en   a   co ve r up,   the
South Yorkshire Police have made it difficult for anyone considering a private
prosecution to obtain the evidence to bring one. 1agree with LJ. Stuart-Smith
(Chapter 4 paragraph 1 00) that "in the days following Hillsborough the South
Yorkshire Police perceived themselves to be on the defensive. This was a/so

the perception of their Legal Advisers.          There was an understandable desire
not to give anything a w a y ”          Statements were edited for use at the Taylor
enquiry and for consideration by the DPP, South Yorkshire Police via the
West Midlands Police were able to influence what evidence went before the
Coroner.    The HFSG fairly and reasonably did nothing about a private
prosecution between the DPP’s decision not to prosecute in August 1990 and
the Jury verdict in March 1991. Again, fairly and reasonably they awaited the
outcome of the disciplinary proceedings during which there was an embargo
on further disclosure of evidence and then awaited the outcome of the judicial
review of the Coroner's inquest. After the outcome of the judicial review in
1993, Ann Adlington states at paragraph 41 of her statement that the HFSG
were demoralised and believed that they had come to the end of the legal
road. No money was available nor was there any prospect of raising it. This
was not challenged.      So even if private prosecutions were considered the
HFSG had no funds.


An approach was then made to Jimmy McGovern about making a drama
believing this to be the best way to raise public awareness. The Drama was
shown in December 1996. it did raise public awareness, there was great
interest in the media and in Parliament and the Scrutiny then followed. About
this time a memorial concert took place which raised substantial funds. The
Scrutiny was published in February 1998.                 The decision to bring private
prosecutions followed in April 1998 soon after the Scrutiny was published and
further evidence had been made public in the House of Commons Library.
Once private prosecutions began the only delay has been the defendants
decision to apply to the DPP to intervene, a course of action which they are
entitled to take. The prosecution encountered further problems concerning
disclosure from the South Yorkshire Police which was only resolved by them

                          Magistrates' Courts Act 1980.


                          The defence argue that private prosecutions should have been brought earlier
                          and ideally that is the case but I consider there are good reasons for that not
                          being done.         The prosecution say that the defendants themselves have
                          directly or indirectly contributed to the delay by participating in an alleged
                          cover up or by the concealment of evidence or in the lack of disclosure.
                          There is no evidence to support those submissions but I take the view that the
                          South Yorkshire Police must take some responsibility for that, not these
                          defendants.         I. therefore, conclude that neither party is responsible for
                          "unjustifiable" delay in this case.


                          I have already set out the issues under that heading, and in the absence of a
                          great deal of help from the defence on this point they appear to me to be fairly
                          narrow. I conclude that much of the relevant evidence relating to the issues is
                          contained on video tape and in transcripts of evidence at the Taylor enquiry
                          which took place very shortly after the disaster. The only specific prejudice
                          alleged by the defence concerns the possibility of calling police witnesses as
                          to the state of pens 3 and 4 at the relevant time and those police officers who
                          may have had a perception of the opening of the gates. I do not consider this
                          to be a strong argument because it is these defendants’ perceptions and what
                          they saw or ought to have seen which is important. If other officers did not
                          have a perception of the danger when the gates were opened, or the state of
                          pens 3 and 4, it could be construed as a further example of the lack of care of
                          the police, but it was these two defendants who had overall responsibility on
                          that day. In so far as the case will depend upon the memory of witnesses,
                          these defendants and those witnesses will have had every reason to have the
                          events very much in mind since the day of the disaster. I, therefore, consider
                          that the prejudice caused by the delay is not so strong as to render a fair trial
                          impossible.


                          When Lord Justice McCowan said this at page 41 of the judgement in relation
                          to the judicial review of the Coroner’s inquest 1 have to consider the interests

                 revive them and matters of that sort.                            He was therefore talking about a
                 completely separate issue.


                 European Law


                 In support of their submissions on delay the defence allege a breach of article
                 6    of the European Convention on Human Rights which provides


                 "in the determination o f his civil rights and obligations or o f any criminal

                 charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a

                 reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law".



                 A number of authorities have been put before me. The principal argument
                 between the prosecution and defence concerns the period to be taken into
                 account in determining the length of the proceedings. According to those
                 authorities the time runs from what has variously been described as when the
                 person is "charged". This may occur upon "arrest" or "official notification given
                 to an individual by the competent authority o f an allegation that he has

                 committed a criminal offence " or the opening of aa preliminary investigation ’.
                 Thus the defence have argued that time runs from the time of the Taylor
                 enquiry i.e. the opening of a preliminary investigation. But the prosecution
                 say that the use of the expression the 'opening of a preliminary investigation*
                 has been taken from the case of Ringeisen - v - Austria 1 EHRR.455 and
                 ignores the basic fact that a preliminary investigation i$ a stage in criminal
                 proceedings in Austria which follows the charge. The prosecution states that
                 the time must run from the date of commencing these proceedings i.e. when
                 the defendants were first charged in Sefton Magistrates in June of 1998                                                    i

                     determining what is a reasonable time, I refer to Boddaert - v - Belgium
                     (1992) EHRR 242. In the judgement of the court at paragraph 36, I quote.
                     “the reasonableness of the length of proceedings is to be determined with

                     reference (o the criteria laid down in the court's case law and in the light o f the

                     circumstances of the case,        which in this instance call for an overall
                     assessment " and paragraph 39 “article 6 commands, that judicial proceedings

                     be expeditious, but it also lays down the more general principle of the proper

                     administration of justice. In the circumstances of the case the conduct o f the
                     authorities was cons/stenf with a fair balance which has to be struck between

                     the various aspects o f this fundamental requirement.'' )n Allenet De Ribemont

                     - v- France (1995) 20.EHRR 557, l quote paragraph 86 of the Commission's
                     opinion, “the commission reiterates that the reasonableness o f the length of
                     proceedings must be assessed in the light o f the circumstances of each case

                     and having regard to the follov/ing criteria; the complexity o f the case, the

                     conduct of the parties and that of the authorities dealing with the case and in

                     the light of the circumstances of the case, which m ay call for an overall

                     assessment".     The Commission further recalls that in civil cases exercising
                     the right to a hearing within a reasonable time is subject to diligence being
                     shown by the party concerned. Nevertheless this principle does not absolve
                     the court from ensuring that trials are conducted within a reasonable time.
                     The principles laid down in these authorities therefore are no different, in my
                     view, to the principles I have to decide in the abuse of process application
                     according to UK Law. This appears to be confirmed by L.J. Buxton in R - v -
                     Stratford Justices ex parte Imbert. The Times, February 25 1999 when
                     considering another part of article 6 of the Convention, he said this, “the
                     principle o f looking a t the fairness in their entirety of their particular criminal

                     proceedings that were under criticism permeated the whole o f the Strasbourg
                     jurisprudence". Therefore if I were to accept the defence su bm ission upon the

                     length of the proceedings (approximately 10 years) any consideration of a
                     breach of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights adds
                     nothing to the matters I already have under consideration in the abuse of
                     process application.


                                                                                                             25

                4               P ublicity


                                I have been taken through an enormous volume of material which was mainly
                                made up of newspaper articles over the last 10 years. \ have also s e e n video
                                tapes of various television programmes, including the M cG overn drama
                                'Hillsborough'. I have been shown samples of internet coverage, three books
                                on the subject and the words of a song by the Manic Street Preachers called
                                *SYMM’ which stands for South Yorkshire Mass Murderer. It is clear that the
                                media coverage has been widespread, extremely voluminous and unrelenting.


                                From the outset the media coverage was vast, which is not surprising as this
                                is the worst disaster in British sporting history and was therefore of the
                                greatest public interest and concern. In the early stages, the South Yorkshire
                                Police decided to deflect blame onto the drunken Liverpool supporters so that
                                on Wednesday 19 April, for example, we see on the front page of the Daily
                                Express "Police Accuse Drunken Fans", and on the same day on the from
                                page of the Sun "The Truth. Some fans picked pockets of victims, some fans
                                urinated on the brave cops". These allegations were roundly rejected by Lord
                                Justice Taylor; but I accept Mr Jones’ point that in the early stages the media
                                coverage reached saturation point and it may be those early perceptions
                                which sink into the public consciousness.              However, both before and           ^
                                particularly since the Taylor interim report, the blame for the disaster has been
                                laid on the police. In the early stages it was Superintendent Marsha!! who
                                received a lot of attention because it was he who had “opened the gates".


                                During and after the Tayior enquiry Duckerrfieids name appears regularly in
                                newspaper articles, Murray's not so often. There has been substantial media
                                coverage of each step in the history of the case. For example. The Guardian,
                                31 August 1990 *Prosecutions ruled out in Hillsborough disaster.               The
                                decision by the Director o f Public Prosecutions was attacked by Liverpool

                                M Ps as a scandal and a whitewash.'' Terry Fields. Labour MP for Broadgreen

                                said Httm y initial reaction is one o f shock and absolute disgust, this                  £

" H i l l s b o r o u g h inqvest ends with t e a r s and s c u f f l e s .   T h e angetr of t h e relatives
o f those who died spilled over as the jury's verdict of accidental death was

read out. People in court screamed and began crying, one woman shouted *it
was no accident".             The Times, 30 October 1991, “Police Chief blamed over
Hillsborough retires e a r l / ’.          The report stated that David Duckenfield was to
retire from the South Yorkshire Police Force on health grounds and not face a
planned disciplinary tribunal. Philip Hammond of the HFSG whose 1 * year-
old son was among those who died said “we feel we have been cheated of
justice". There appears to have been something of a lull after this until 1996

when there was substantial media coverage of the McGovern drama and the
alleged new evidence that had come to light. A headline in the Daily Mirror for
Thursday, December 5 1996. provides an example "Why e v e r y o n e in Britain
m ust watch , at last we've seen the terrible truth . . . now why doesn't someone

say sorry ", and the Daily Mirror the following day contained headlines as

follows "It took us back into heir. "Victims who still wait f o r justice'’ and "My
rage o v e r the cover-up, the paramedic".



The prejudice the defence allege is that much of the media coverage has
been generated by the prosecution and by that they mean the HSFG and that
they have linked many of the legitimate grievances they have concerning the
tragedy {e.g. the inquest and the 3.15 pm cut>off time, the lack of disclosure,
and poor treatment by the authorities) with their calls for justice. Further many
allegations of police cover up (lying about the video evidence, the editing of
statements) in the light of the Scrutiny are, the defence say. inaccurate, unfair
and prejudicial. There was, of course, much media coverage to mark the I 0 ,h
Anniversary of the disaster in April of this year, with renewed calls for justice.


I do accept that the media coverage in this case is bound to create some
prejudice against these two defendants, more so against Mr Duckenfield than
Mr Murray. However. I also bear in mind Mr Jones' argument that unusually
in this case there are two polarised views and each have used the media to
put forward their point of view, and that any potential jury will be from a cross
section of the community. I note that there is no evidence as to the effect of
the publicity on the public, there are no opinion polls concerning the publicity

                                                                                                           M. yyj u ' r. w



                               as th «re w e re in the M a x w e ll ca3c, although I   aoceot that   Mr   Justice   Phillips

                               said that the opinion polls in the Maxwell case should not set a precedent or
                               become the norm. Having accepted that there is some prejudice against the
                               defendants I have to weigh that up against the need to report matters of public
                               interest and concern and ask myself this question: Is the prejudice so great
                               as to make a fair triai impossible? Bearing in          m ind   those matters to which I
                               have just referred and the powers of the Judge at trial to regulate the trial
                               process and give appropriate directions to the jury I answer the question in
                               the negative.


                 5             Other Matters


                               The defence have argued that the prosecutor lacks objectivity and the
                               selection of the evidence is unbalanced and unfair.                Ann Adlington gave
                               sworn evidence before me. She clearly feels very strongly about the case
                               and has been involved in it, indirectly at first, and then directly for many years.
                               However, 1 found her evidence to be reliable and credible and she certainly
                               did not give me the impression that she had lost her sense of objectivity. She
                               came across as a responsible prosecutor mindful of her duties as such. An
                               example can be given when she was asked about the media coverage. She
                               considered the Manic Street Preachers ‘SYMM’ song to be in bad taste and
                               was prepared to support the defence application to the Attorney-General to
                               prevent its publication (N.8 . the defence application to the Attorney-Generai to
                               have the song stopped failed). She further indicated that she had been very
                               careful to avoid adverse publicity, that she had given members of the HFSG a
                               severe telling off when they made various outbursts to the press and she said
                               that she didn't want anything to prejudice the prosecution case. The defence
                               have criticised Ann Adlington for relying upon Mr Houldsworth as a
                               prosecution witness after he had been discredited by Lord Justice Stuart-
                               Smith. In my view he did not go quite that far. In chapter 2 at paragraph 99,
                               he said this 7 am unable to accept that his (Mr Houldsworth) recollection of
                               events now is accurate. £ven if it was correct it would not have any effect on

                               the previous proceedings.        It would simply have been the evidence of one

                               more person who thought that the central pens were full at 2.52 pm." He


                                                                                                                         29

          th erefo re d e sc rib e s Mr HouW sw orth evidence as inaccurate and e v e n if
          accurate of marginal relevance.             Ann Adlington said she found Mr
          Houldsworth a truthful witness and I accept her evidence on that point,
          whether the jury were to find Mr Houldsworth truthful is a matter for them. 1
          was referred to the case of R - v - Epping & Harlow Justices ex parte
          Massaro (1972) 1.Q.B.433 in which the Lord Chief Justice Lord Widgery had
          to decide the purpose of committal proceedings At page 435 he said this 7s
          it as the prosecution m ight contend, sim ply a safeguard fo r the citizen to
          ensure that he cannot be made to stand his trial without a prim a facie case
          being shown o r is it as M r Beckman would contend, a rehearsal proceeding
          so that the defence may try out their cross examination on the prosecution
          witnesses with a view to using the results to advantage in the Crown Court at
          a later stage?       F o r my p a rt I think it is clear that the function o f committal
          proceedings is to ensure that no-one shall stand his trial unless a prime facie
          case has been made out” The way in which the prosecution have prepared
          the committal bundle accords with the duties of the prosecution at committal
          proceedings.


          The defence have also criticised Ann Adlington for failing to have various
          police witnesses in the committal bundle, in particular Superintendent
          Marshal! who is invoked in the opening of gate C or any of the three police
          officers, apart from the defendants, who were in the control box. I accept the
          reasons given by Ann Adlington for their absence in that bundle.                      Ann
          Adlington was also criticised for failing to take into account the DPP’s decision
          not to prosecute the defendants. She said that she had taken that matter into
          account but was unaware of the reasons for the decision. I reject that
          criticism. I therefore find that the defence have not made out a case of lack of
          objectivity or bias on the part of the prosecutor.


          Finally, during cross examination of Ann Adlington the defence suggested that
          a primary purpose of bringing these proceedings was to enable the
          prosecution to obtain disclosure of further evidence after committal
          proceedings and that it was an unfair manipulation of the court process. Ann
          Adlington denied that this was a primary p u rp o s e of the prosecution and I


                                                                                                  29

                   accept that. Although I find that the bringing of this prosecution m ay have that
                   consequence it is not an unfair manipulation of the court process.


                   It was alleged by the prosecution that new and important evidence had come
                   to      light since the commencement of these proceedings, particularly
                   concerning the closing of the tunnel in 1988 at the corresponding match the
                   previous year. The prosecution referred to debriefing notes and also a ‘new*
                   statement from Inspector White which arrived from the South Yorkshire Police
                   archive during the submissions. On the face of this statement, it purported to
                   show that Superintendent Murray had been aware of the practice of closing
                   off the tunnel at the semi-final the previous year In 1988 and that he knew
                   before the 15 April 1989.      If that were right it would be very important
                   evidence in this case. Upon a close analysis of that evidence, however, Mr
                   Harrison was able to demonstrate that the submissions of the prosecution
                   were incorrect     He showed that Inspector White was referring in this new
                   statement to the practice of filling up pens 3 and 4 first, then closing off the
                   tunnel before redirecting spectators to outside pens at league games only.
                   This practice was known at the Taylor enquiry and paragraph 170 of the
                   interim report makes that clear.


                   Mr Harrison further demonstrated that Murray had referred to this practice of
                   filling up pens 3 and 4 first and then redirecting the fans to the wings at league
                   matches during the Taylor enquiry. Inspector White's statement further shows
                   that he was not on duty in the Leppings Lane area of the ground at either the
                   semi-fmal in 1987 or the semi-final in 1988.           So when he refers in that
                   statement to speaking to Superintendent Murray about the way in which the
                   pens were to be filled it is clear he was referring to the difference between
                   filling up those pens at a league game and how they were to be filled on that
                   day the 15 April 1989. The fact that the tunnel had been closed off in 1988
                   was also known to the Taylor enquiry (see paragraph 230 of the interim
                   report) ‘since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2.50 pm, the tunnel should have been
                   closed whether gate C was to be opened or not. The exercise was a simple
                   one and had fceen carried out in 1938. A ll that was necessary was for a few

                   officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans


                                                                                                    30

e lse w h e r e .   Unfortunately, the 1988 closure seems to h a v e b e e n unknown to
the Senior Officers on duty at the time.             It did not figure in the debriefing
notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989”. The statement
of Inspector White therefore sheds no further light on Lord Justice Taylor's
findings that I have just quoted. The prosecution have referred me to the
briefing notes of the 17 April 1989 at which these two defendants were
present. It is not known who made these notes. From the top of page 3 I
quote:


CC - Go back to the control inside the tunnel. Whose responsibility is it there
to divert people * anybody?


Duckenfield - Inspector White with serials 14 and15. Specific instructions on
the order at phase 2.


 CC - Inspector White experienced individual.


Mole - M r Creaser was the Inspector who worked it before M r White.


N esbitt - A t the crucial time Inspector White was returning having dealt with an
arrest.


Top o f the tunnel solid with horses - that procedure happened last year."


That is the only reference which may relate to the tunnel being blocked off the
previous year, it is not known who said this and therefore does not assist me
greatly.


I have also had my attention drawn to the debriefing notes dated 19 April
1989, this was with Supervisory Officers deployed at Leppings Lane on 15
April 1989. neither of the defendants were present. In relation to this point I
quote from the first page "there is nothing in the operational order nor a t the
briefings about contingency fo r police protection o f the tunnel to restrict or
prevent spectator entry.          Officers remembered (particularly C hief i n s p e c t o r
I    r e a s e r ) t h a t i n p r e v i o u s y & a r s t h e a b o v e h a d k e e n d o n e b y t h e vso o f h o r s e s
     nd static police lines (referred to as Superintendent Freeman's policy).


    Neither of these passages support the prosecution's submission that either of
    these defendants knew about the policy to close off the tunnel at the match
    the previous year. At its highest the prosecution may be able to argue that
    this policy of closing off the tunnel was known to some officers of a senior
    rank and therefore was above junior level.                              I want to make it quite clear
    therefore that l have not placed any weight on the prosecution's submissions
    of new evidence concerning what happened in 1988 in determining this
    application.


    In conclusion I have considered all the above matters, everything l have read
    in the case papers and all that Counsel has urged upon me.                                              Although I
    appear to have dealt with various aspects of the argument one by one. 1 have
    c o n sid e re d their cumulative effect and therefore have considered matters in

    the round. I have concluded that the defence have not persuaded me to the
    required standard of proof that a fair trial is not possible in this case.                                                 I
    therefore dismiss this application.

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

10 September 1999

Joint Report o f the Clerk and Treasurer and Chief Constable


FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO FORMER OFFICERS IN LEGAL
PROCEEDINGS


1     Purpose of the Report

      To update members on progress regarding applications for funding of
      defence costs in legal proceedings arising out of the Hillsborough
      disaster; and to seek confirmation of the basis on which previously
      agreed funding will be provided.



            Recommendations

                   The Authority is asked to note the current
                   situation and to aw ait detailed reports if and
                   when further applications fo r funding are
                   received.

                   The Authority is asked to confirm the proposed
                   terms under w hich financial support w ill be
                   provided in connection w ith the com m ittal
                   proceedings, in the period between 5 February
                   and 20 July 1999.

                   The Authority is asked to consider and give
                   guidance on the specific issues referred to in
                   sections 4.1 to 4.6, 5.2 and 6.3 of this re p o rt



3     Progress and Legal Proceedings

3.1    Following the committal hearing which concluded at Leeds Magistrates
      Court on 20 July, a Directions hearing was held on 3 September 1999.
      We await a copy of the order made at the hearing but it has been
      reported to our solicitors that a trial date has been set for 6 June 2000
      and that the prosecutor, Miss Ann Adlington is to serve all the witness
      statements on which she proposes to rely by the end of November
      1999.




                                                                              1
3.2   It is also been reported that the former officers applied for and were
      granted a hearing for a further application that the prosecution should
      be stayed on the grounds that it is an abuse of process. This
      application will be heard by a circuit judge on 4 January 2000. It is
      expected to last 4-5 days. An identical application had been heard by
      the Magistrate during the course of the committal proceedings, but was
      rejected. Similar issues were considered by the DPP and the court
      during the judicial review of the DPP’s decision not to take over and
      discontinue the prosecution.

3.3   An application to the Authority was made by the former officers in early
      July 1999 to meet the costs of the further hearing to stay the
      prosecution on the grounds that it is an abuse of process. Upon being
      informed that the Authority could not consider the application within the
      time frame sought by the officers, the application was effectively
      withdrawn. The Authority can expect to receive further application on
      the abuse of process proceedings and for the costs of and incidental to
      the trial of the action. The former officers’solicitors havebeen
      informed that the detailed estimates of their costings will be required
      before the Authority will be in a position to consider these applications

4     Agreement on costs authorised on 21 May 1999

4.1   Costs to 5 February 1999

      a      Costs of Walker Morris (solicitors for Mr Bernard Murray)

             Messrs Walker Morris have claimed costs to 12 January 1999
             totalling £173,055.47 which are made up as follows:


                                          Fees            VAT             Total

             Solicitor’s fees       103,687.50       18,145.31     121,832.81
             Harrison QC             32,750.00        5,731.25      38,481.25
             Myerson                 10,468.00        1,897.66      12,741.41

             TOTAL                  146,905.50       25,774.22     173,055.47


             Following review by the Authority’s solicitors and costs
             draftsman engaged by them, it is recommended that Walker
             Morris be offered £81,475 in respect of their fees and that
             £30.000 and £9,500 be offered in respect of Mr Harrison QC
             and Mr Myerson’s fees. All sums will be subject to VAT. This
             would represent a reduction of approximately 20% on Walker
             Morris’s fees and 10% from Counsel’s fees. If agreement
             cannot be reached with Walker Morris, the costs should be
             referred to the court of assessment.
                  Winkworth Sherwood’s costs to 5 February 1999

                  The total costs claimed by Winckworth Sherwood are
                  £105,612.92 which are made up as follows:


                                               Fees             VAT             Total

                  Solicitor’s fees        33,133.33         5,798.33       38,931.66
                  Clegg QC                45,125.00         7,896.88       53,021.88
                  Isaacs                  11,625.00         2.034.38       13.659.38

                  TOTAL                   89,883.33        15,729.59      105,612.92


                  It is proposed that Winckworth Sherwood’s fees be allowed as
Id)               claimed, but that £41,000 and £10,500 be offered in respect of
                  the Counsel fees for Mr Clegg QC and Mr Isaacs. Once again,
                  this represents a 10% deduction in Counsel’s fees. If these
                  deductions cannot be agreed, it is proposed that the bills be
                  referred for assessment.

      4.2   Terms of support for costs from 5 February 1999

            It was reported to the meeting on 16 July that informal acceptance had
            been received of the terms set out in the Authority’s offer of support
            following the 21 May resolutions. The solicitors have been asked to
            confirm this acceptance and this has now been received. Attached as
            appendix A1/A2 are copies of the formal letters which the Authority is
            now asked to approve for forwarding to the two officers, subject to the
            confirmation from the Authority’s tax inspector referred to in 4.6 below.

      4.3   The costs indicated by the solicitors for the committal proceedings from
            5 February to 20 July 1999 are as follows:

            a      The costs for Walker Morris (for Mr Bernard Murray)

                                                Fees            VAT             Total

                    Solicitor’s fees       79,012.50        13,827.19      92,839.69

                   * includes Counsel’s fees




                   The costs for Winckworth Sherwood (for Mr Duckenfield)


                                                                                    3
                                         Fees              VAT            Total

             Solicitor’s fees       84,200.00         14,735.00      98,935.00

             TOTAL                162,454.29       28,429.19        190,883.79


      c     The indication of costs from Winckworth Sherwood totals
            £190,883.79. This exceeds the prescribed maximum set out in
            the draft agreement of £176,250. Winckworth Sherwood, on
            behalf of Mr Duckenfield, have asked the Authority to approve
            the reimbursement of the additional £14,600.

4.4   It is recommended that the Authority authorise Garretts, and the costs
      draftsman retained by them, to review the detailed costings received or
      to be received from Walker Morris and Winckworth Sherwood and to
      advise the Authority of the costs which should be offered to Walker
      Morris and Winckworth Sherwood. If the costs to be offered to
      Winckworth Sherwood are less than £176,250 and this offer is
      accepted by Winckworth Sherwood, there will be no need to consider
      the additional sums claimed by them.

4.5   Costs in connection with the DPP judicial review

      a     Walker Morris {for Mr Murray) have cla/med the following:

                                        Fees               VAT            Total

             Solicitor’s fees      22,506.25          3,938.59      26,444.84
             Disbursements         15,785.30          2,641.34      18,426.64

             TOTAL                 38,291.55          6,579.93       44,871.43


      b     Winckworth Sherwood

            Winckworth Sherwood’s costs on the DPP judicial review are as
            follows:

                                Fees            VAT               Total

             Solicitor’s fees   16,050.00       2,808.75          18,858.75

      c     It is recommended that the Authority’s solicitors and costs
             draftsman review the costs claimed by Walker Morris and
             Winckworth Sherwood in order to advise the Authority on an
             offer in settlement of the costs.


                                                                              4
      It will be recalled that the DPP obtained an order that Messrs
      Duckenfield and Murray should contribute towards his costs of the
      judicial review. The DPP has yet to provide details of his costs to
      Walker Morris and to Winckworth Sherwood.

4.6   Potential tax liabilities

      It has been suggested to the Authority that the assistance to be
      provided to the former officers is taxable income which will be subject
      to PAYE deductions by the Authority and national insurance
      contributions. If this were to be the case, it could significantly affect the
      attraction of Police Authority support from the officers point of view
      and/or result in substantial additional liabilities for the Authority if it
      were to meet the additional tax. Confirmation is being sought from our
      tax inspector that PAYE and Nl are not payable. A response is
      expected within 4 to 6 weeks. It is recommended that pending receipt
      of that confirmation, no further financial assistance to be approved and
      that formal confirmation of the tetters setting out the terms of funding
      for the period from 5 February 1999 be deferred.

5     Travel and incidental costs

5.1   The solicitor representing Mr Duckenfield has also asked that the
      Authority treat as part of the approved support his clients travel and
      accommodation costs for the Leeds hearing and any other meetings or
      proceedings. Mr Duckenfield lives in Hampshire, a distance of over
       260 miles from Leeds, and needed to find accommodation for himself
      and his wife during the recent hearing. Similar costs will arise at future
       hearings.

5.2   The matter was not specifically considered at the 21 May meeting and
       it is not felt that the terms of the offer as currently drafted could be
      interpreted to cover it. The estimated costs are approximately £1,000
       to date. Members views are invited.

6     Financial and budgetary im plications

6.1   The Authority has sought advice from Garretts on the potential total
      financial implications. The latest forecasts, broken down over the
      different elements of the proceedings, is set out below in summary,
      and in more detail in Appendix B.
      Costs to 5 February as claimed                                    279
      Costs 5 February to 20 July as claimed                            326
      Costs of Judicial review of DPPs decision as claimed              64
      Chief Constable’s legal costs                                     100
      Police Authority legal costs                                      186

                                                                        955

      This estimate is slightly lower than the figures circulated at the May 21
      meeting, which at that stage estimated total costs to the conclusion of
      the committal hearing of £1,013,000.

      The estimates above require qualification on a number of grounds.

      i)     no provision has been made for:

                     unfunded costs arising out of the South Sefton
                     proceedings

                     unrecovered costs from Ms A Adlington (HFSG) arising
                     out of the ‘powers’ Judicial Review

                     costs in connection with the September 1999 Court
                     Hearings

                     any further tax liabilities which may arise.

      ii)    the estimates include at this stage provision for VAT on the
              former officers legal costs. It is anticipated that the Authority will
              receive confirmation that this is recoverable. The amount
              involved is approximately £100,000.

      iii)   the costs draftsman retained by the Authority has put forward             ^
              proposals lor reducing the claims in the period up to 5 February         Wk
              by approximately £37,000 (13%). His assessment of further
              cost claims is in progress and will be reported.

6.2   The Authority originally set aside £0.5m in reserves to cover costs,
      arising out of the initial offer of support in February 1998. The cost
      estimates were updated at the meeting on 21 May. The latest
      estimates outlined above now confirm that the costs incurred as
      committed during 1998/9 have exceeded the original budgetary
      provision, and that the commitments resulting from the further support
      agreed in May will require additional provision.

6.3   Provision is being made in the 1998/9 Accounts for expenditure
      incurred or committed to 31 March, and earmarked provision will be
      made for further costs estimated to be committed during 1999/2000.
      The issue will be dealt with in more detail as part of the report on the
      1998/9 Accounts which is to be presented to the special meeting on 28

        September. However, the Authority is asked at this stage to approve a
        supplementary estimate - to be financed out of reserves - of £500,000
        to cover the potential liabilities identified to date.

7      Contributions to the Authority’s costs

7.1    A formal approach is to be made by the Chairman to the Home
        Secretary for financial Support towards the Authority’s costs in
       connection with Hillsborough. Home Office have the power to provide
       specific financial assistance to a Police Authority; in practice it is
       exercised infrequently, but there have been a number of recent cases
       where assistance has been granted. The Authority’s costs are not only
       those in connection with the criminal proceedings, but also resulting
       from outstanding insurance liabilities beyond the original insured limit.

        In the light of the implications of the outcome of the Hillsborough case
        for the police service generally, it is also intended that discussions will
        be held with the Superintendents Association and the Police
        Federation.

   Deav Richard

   South Yorkshire Police A uthority - C osts

   Thank you for your letters of 9 and 15 September.

   As you know, the Authority m et last Friday to consider a number of matters. My instructions on
   the various matters which are outstanding betw een the Authority and Mr Murray are as follows:

   Costs in the Leeds Magistrates Court to 12 Tartuarv 1999

   The total of your fees (£103,607.50) and Counsel's fees (£43,218) is £146,905.50 plus £25,774.22 VAT.
   The Authority proposes to pay £120,975 and VAT thereon. In reaching this figure, the Authority is
   m inded to allow your fees at £81,475 and w ould seek reductions to £30,000 and £9300 for Mr
   Harrison's and Mr Myerscm's fees respectively. If agreement cannot be reached on the costs to be
   paid to you, the Authority, naturally, reserves the right to require assessm ent by the court and to
   make such objections on assessm ent as m ay be appropriate.

   The terms of the draft letter on costs of the committal proceedings from 5 February 1999

   In view of the issue w e have raised on taxation, w e are to defer despatching the letters pending the
   view of the local inspector. It occurs to m e that one further amendment is appropriate. This is that
   any costs recovered from central funds or die prosecution shall be first applied to repay, reduce or
   discharge the Authority's paym ent of, or obligation to contribute towards, legal costs. Although
   this is implicit, I think it w ould be sensible to make it explicit

   Fees from 13 Tanuarv 1999 (including the DPP judicial review)

   We w ill be asking our costs draftsman to review your papers on these matters. Thank you for the
   papers on the gap betw een 13 January and 5 February.

    Mr Harrison's further fees

    You will recall that the Authority sought an opinion from Mr Harrison on the merits of the
    defence. The Authority agreed to meet Mr Harrison's fees up to a maximurn of £1,000 plus VAT,
    A similar opinion was sought from Mr Clegg. In the event, a joint opinion was received. Each of
    Mr Clegg and Mr Harrison have claimed £1,000 plus VAT.

    1do not think that the fees proposed for the opinion are reasonable. Would you like to consider
    hov/ to deal with this matter, or shall I take up the matter direct with Mr Harrison's clerk?

    Further application

    I assume you will want to make a fresh application for assistance. I await receiving details of the
    applications and would remind you that it should include estimates of the costs involved. I will
    then let you know hew the Authority would propose to deal with that application.

    Kind regards

   Dear Simon

   South Yorkshire Police Authority - Costs

   Thank you for your letter of 9 September.

   As you knew, the Authority met last Friday to consider a number of matters. My instructions on
   the various matters which are outstanding between the Authority and Mr Duckenfield are as
   follows:

   Costs in the Leeds Magistrates Court to 5 February 1999

   The total of your fees (£33,133.33) and Counsel's fees (£56,750) is £89,833.33 plus £15,729,59 VAT.
   The Authority proposes to pay £84,63333 and VAT thereon. In reaching this figure, the Authority
   is minded to allow your fees as daimed but would seek reductions to £41,000 and £10,500 for Mr
   Clegg's and Mr Isaacs' fees respectively. If agreement cannot be reached on the costs to be paid to
   you, the Authority, naturally, reserves the right to require assessment by the court and to make
   such objections on assessment as they may be appropriate.

   The terms of the draft letter on costs of fee committal proceedmeg from 5 February 1999

   First of all, I would re-iterate the points made in the third paragraph of my letter of 7 September on
   the maximum costs that the Authority will meet On brief fees and refreshers, the figures we
   proposed are to remain. It is difficult to see why different fees should be allowed when the hourly
   rates agreed for your Counsel and Mr Manning's Counsel are the same. Further, I did canvas a
   range of views and opinions on the appropriate rates before fixing them.

   In view of the issue we have raised on taxation, we are to defer despatching the letters pending the
   view of the local inspector. It occurs to me that one further amendment is appropriate. This is that
   any costs recovered from central funds or the prosecution shall be first applied to repay, reduce or

      discharge the Authority's payment of, or obligation to contribute towards, legal costs. Although
      this is implicit 1think it would be sensible to make it explicit-

      Fees from 5 February 1999 fincluding the DPP judicial review)

      We will be asking our costs draftsman to review your papers on these matters. Before he will be
      able to do this, I will require the analysis requested in the third paragraph of my letter of 7
      September for the committal proceedings. We already have the relevant analysis for the DPP
      judicial review.

      Mr Duckenfield's application for travel and incidental costs

      The Authority has rejected this application.

      Mr Gegg's further fees

      You will recall that the Authority sought an opinion from Mr Clegg on the merits of the defence.
      The Authority agreed to meet Mr Clegg's fees up to a maximum of £1,000 plus VAT. A similar
      opinion was sought from Mi Harrison. in the event a joint opinion was received. Each of Mr
      Clegg and Mr Harrison have claimed £1,000 plus VAT.

      I do not think that the fees proposed for the opinion are reasonable. Would you like to consider
      how to deal with this matter, or shall I take up the matter direct with Mr Clegg*s clerk?

      Further application

      I assume you will want to make, a fresh application for assistance. I await receiving details of the
      applications and would remind you that it should indude estimates of the costs involved. I will
      then let you know how the Authority would propose to dead with that application.

      Kind regards


      Yours sincerely

                                                            NOTE




                            This note is written for the benefit of the South

                   Yorkshire Police Authority and represents ray views on

                   the merits of the defence of Mr. Duckenfield to the.

                   two charges he has been committed for trial on.




                             It       was      obviously     a       disappointment           that       the

                  magistrate found that a prima facie case existed and

                   furthermore declined to stay the proceedings                                   on the

                   ground that the continued prosecution of the defendant

                   amounted to an abuse of the process of the court.                                       I

                   propose to consider each of these separate submissions

                   in     turn.         Annexed       to    this      note    is    a     copy   of      the

                   these    submissions            ought to be refined                   and advanced

                   afresh before the trial judge.                         As can be seen from

                   the   skeleton        the       submissions        are      advanced             under         a

                   number     of       separate          heads   of   which          I     believe             two

                   warrant some further explanation in this note.

                   Duckenfield that the prosecution contravened Article

                   6 of the European Convention of Human Rights requires

                   further explanation.                   This submission was dealt with
                                                                                                                      «*


                   at page 24 - 25 of the judgement when the magistrate

                   held having reviewed some of the European authorities

                           "The principles               laid down in these authorities

                           therefore are no different,                      in my view,               to the

                           principles          1    have    to     decide      in        the        abuse        of

                           process application according to U.K. laws."




                           With due respect to the magistrate this is not a

                   correct         statement         of    the     law.          One         fundamental

                   difference exists between the domestic law on abuse of

                   process       and    the    protection          a citizen             receives              from

      Article 6.




             Under domestic law the burden is on the accused

      to prove on the balance of probabilities that he has

      suffered      prejudice             by    reason       of    the     delay.       Under

      Article       6      no      evidential             burden    is      placed      on    a

      defendant at all and the existence of                           p re ju d ic e    is not

      a necessary ingredient of a "breach".                                The Convention


V     provides

             "in    the          determination of            hie    civil        rights      and

             obligations             or    of       any    criminal        charge      against

             him,       everyone i s .entitled to a fair and public

             hearing             within         a     reasonable            time       by     an

             independent and impartial tribunal established by

             l a w ,"



» •
             The    Convention does not require a defendant                                   to

      prove prejudice to his case by reason of the delay as

      U.K.   Domestic            law doee         and this crucial distinction

      was not recognised by the magistrate.




             The second submission that attention ought to be

      focused       on      in    this     note       relates       to     the     impact     of

                                                     3

           publicity       in    the   case.        It was      submitted            that          the

           effect    of    the media       coverage was            such     that          a        fair

           trial    of    the defendants           is not possible.                   Although

           rejecting this submission the magistrate did describe

           the coverage as

                   "widespread,            extremely              v o lu m i n o u s               and

                   unrelenting"

           and concluded that,

                   ”1 do accept that the media coverage in this case

                   is bound to create some prejudice against these

                   two defendants, more so against Mr.                        Duckenfield

                   than Mr. Murray."




                   The    assessment      of     the    degree      of     prejudice                is

           obviously a personal one and the trial judge would be

           perfectly       entitled      to     conclude       that       the      prejudice
              «

           found by the magistrate was such that no fair trial

           was possible.




                   I have no doubt that a strong case exists that

           thie prosecution amounts to an abuse of the process of

           the court, whether in fact the trial judge will come

           to the    same       conclusion is difficult               to assess.                    He

                  declined         to       prosecute        against            the       rights          of     an

                  individual             to     a     fair        trial            not          brought            in

                  circumstances of oppression and not prejudiced by pre­

                  trial publicity.




                          It is clearly impossible to predict the decision

                  of the trial judge, grounds certainly exist that could

                  justify a decision in favour of Mr. Duckenfield while

                  in one sense the high profile nature of the case may

                  be     a        subconscious          influence                in       favour           of        a

                  prosecution.




                          I am      certain that           grounds           exist         to      support         an

                  application to stay, many cases in the past have been

                   stayed on grounds less strong than those in this case.

                  Whether in fact the trial judge will actually order

                  the proceedings be stayed is a matter of speculation

                  but must be evenly balanced.




                          In one sense I am more confident that the trial
                                                                                                                 «

                    of the prosecution case.                   This is a decision that does

                    not depend on the exercise of judicial                             judgement as                      ;

                            In my judgement the Crown at committal failed to

    ¥               prove a prima facie case against Mr. Duckenfield and

                    the magistrate          erred       in      law in committing them for

                    trial.

                            The charge is one of involuntary manslaughter and

                    as was stated in the leading case of R. v. Adoroako 99

                    C.A.R.     3S2

                            "in my opinion the ordinary principles of the law
                        i

                            the defendant has been                   in breach of a duty of

apply the principles of Che law of negligence to the

facts of this case.




            Arguably          Mr.       Duckenfield owed               a ducy        of      care

to all those who attended the match and the standard

of      care          that    he    owed       was     that       of       a    "reasonably

competent              commander".             The     important               question           is

w h e t h e r the Crown can prove a breach of the standard

of care owed.

             The       causes       of     the       disaster          were       many        and

included           a dangerous            build-up of          supporters              in     che

area        outside          the    stadium prior            to     the        match,        poor

crowd control                 in Leppings Lane            itself,              insufficient

police/stewards                    to       control the                queue         at       the

turnstiles,                 poor    or    non-existent            signs         inside        the

ground,         a dangerous crash barrier on the terrace,                                         no

separate              monitoring          of     the     individual               pens        and

insufficient                 egress       from the pens             either laterally

or onto the pitch.

the         disaster          these        are       all causes            that     are       not

suggested              by    the    prosecution         to     be      a       result        of    a

failure of Mr.                 Duckenfield to provide a "reasonable"

         standard of care to the supporters.




                 With hindsight it is easy to see how the police

         plan    for the          match       was    defective         and    it    may      have

         fallen below the necessary standard required under our

         civil    law.        If it did this was a fault of the plan

         generally        and       was      not     the       responsibility          of        Mr.

         Duckenfield.             A person in command is entitled in law

         to delegate          responsibility to someone he reasonably

         assumes is competent.                     Here the plan was prepared by

         others and Mr. Duckenfield acted reasonably in law in

         accepting the plan as a basis for policing the match.

         Indeed     it       was       not    suggested         at    committal        by        the

         prosecution         that he had been negligent in following

         the plan        or allowing the build-up of fans outside to

         reach      a    dangerous             level.           This        area      was        the
I        responsibility of another senior officer who had been

         delegated the task of policing that area.




                 The     immediate           cause        of   the    disaster        was        the

         decision       by       Mr.    Duckenfield            to    open    Gate     C     which

         resulted in an influx of supporters most of who went
                                                                                                  r

               overcrowding and consequent deaths in each pen.




                     The order to open the gates was made                         following

               the   receipt       of a radio message by the control                      room

               stating      that     unless    the    gates     were    opened      someone

               would die.          Against this background the prosecution

               did   not    suggest     that    the       opening of        the   gates     was

               negligent and based the case against Mr. Duckenfield

I*
               on the proposition that he ought to have prevented the

               supporters from entering the tunnel after the gate had

               been opened and that it was negligent of him not to

               have done so.




                     This     raises     the   issue       of whether        a reasonably

               competent      commander ought             to have   foreseen        that      by

» •            opening the gate he would cause gross overcrowding in

               the central pens,           it must be emphasised that it was

               never suggested that he foresaw any danger to anyone

               (this is not, of course, a defence to the charge,                            the

               relevant     question      is whether          a reasonably        competent

               commander     ought to have foreseen the risk and taken

               action accordingly).

                                    Normally             in a case of involuntary manslaughter

                          the court will be assisted by expert                                   evidence,       front       .

                          for example a doctor, who will give evidence of what

                          in certain circumstances a reasonably competent doctor

                          ought to do.                   In this case no expert evidence i9 being

                          called            by     the     prosecution.              It   follows        that     the

                          assessment                of    whether    the      hypothetical            reasonably

                          competent commander ought to have foreseen the danger

     I                    must be based on the other evidence in the case.                                       This

                          all points one way and in favour of Mr.                                  Duckenfield.

                          Not only did he not foresee the danger but none of the

                          other officers in the control box did who all had more

                          experience                of    the    stadium      than        him,     nor    did     the

                          officer requesting the opening of the gates,                                     nor the

                          officer who opened them, nor any of the officers who

                          had the responsibility of policing that                                   area   of the

 I                        ground            and          could   hear        the     radio        transmissions

                          requesting               the     opening    of     the     gate    and            latter

                          complying with the request.




                                    In my opinion there is no evidence that can prove

                          that a reasonably competent police commander ought to

                          have foreseen danger to those in the central pens when

            giving the order to open the gate.                          If that is correct

            then    Mr.       Duckenfield          cannot       be     convicted          on       tnxs       ;

            indictment and the trial judge will inevitably direct

            a verdict of not guilty at the close of the case for

            the C r o w n .




                    I             consider that Mr. Duckenfield acted reasonably

            on the day of the disaster, the tragic consequences of

            opening       the      gate     cannot          legally       (or       in    my       view

            morally) be his responsibility and the causes of the

            disaster are far more complex and far-reaching than

            hi/G.




                    In    this      advice     I       have         sought        succinctly            to

              Dear David

              South Y orkshire Police A uthority

              Thank you for your fax of 29 October notwithstanding the contents.

              I appreciate the meeting you have on Tuesday 2 November. At the present time, in terms of
              future costs 1 think I can do no more than echo what I said in my letter of 13 October,
              following on Walker Morris’ correspondence with you and likely estimates o f costs
              potentially in the region o f £500,000 plus VAT to include the trial. I think what we would
              be looking to do is to take matters in stages, for instance up until the end o f our application
              to Mr Justice Hooper for abuse o f process to be heard 4-7 January 2000. If we have been
              succcssful at that point of course any other applications become irrelevant, but otherwise we
              can take stock and hopefully assess what fiiture work would be needed if the trial is to
              continue.

              I look forward to liaising with you closely regarding the implications o f the Inland Revenue
              advicc, particularly as this will require my client to seek separate advice, in the sense
              separate from myself, concerning the implications. Insofar as possible I would like to liaise
              with you on this aspect so that we can maintain a joint approach given the tenor of your
              original submissions.

               Yours sincerely




              Siwrfm Eastwood

Dear David

South Yorkshire Policc Authority
R c : Costs

Thank you for agreeing a meeting on 11 November. Wc believe that we have persuaded you
that some of the proposed deductions from our account, as suggested by the law costs
draftsman would not be appropriate upon the explanations that you have received. We acccpl
the initial deduction of the monies which are referable to the South Seftou proceedings. In
that regard as you appreciate, the indications from South Sefton are that they arc not going to
pay all that has been requested, and therefore we obviously then would revert to the Authority
for the balance with the Authority having the ability to instruct us if they wish to fund a
hearing for assessment of costs.

As to the payment of costs we understand the problem of the Inland Revenue considering this
to be a benefit in kind. We think that our Client is in a unique situation in that he is no longer
employed by the Authority. You have told us of the interest of the Metropolitan Policc. You
have told us that you are going to sec Leading Counsel next week. We will certainly leave the
matter in short abcyancc but as you will appreciate there are considerable strains in cash flow
terms and we trust the Authority will both accept your rccommcndation in relation to fees and
Counsel’s fees and will take steps to make a quick payment. As to the future, we obviously
understand why the Authority would like to see the tax position resolved. Wc trust that we are
not misplaced in our belief that the Authority does intend to provide continuing financial
assistance to o u r Client and Mr Duckenfield. There is of course a way in which tax would not
be a consideration and that is if we believe that the Authority made a direct agreement with
this firm. The downside of that is the case of Miller, which would suggest that in that event if
and when our Client is succcssful wc may not be able to claim costs out of Central Funds.
You will he considering thin method.

The urgent decision that is needed is with regard to the hearings on 20 December
(admissibility) and 4 January (ahuse of process).

A brief will have to be delivered to Counsel. Wc think for this little package o f two discreet
hearings, Counsel would be persuaded to deal with the matter separate from the main issue.
The suggestion is that Leading Counsel's brief would be £15,000.00 plus VAT with refreshers
of £1,500.00 per day plus VAT. Junior Counsel would be one half of both brief and refresher
fees. This takes into account that quite a lot of the work has already been done in relation to
the abuse of process hearing. You appreciate of course that an enormous amount of time and
work is going to be required if this case goes to full trial and wc cxpcct that counsel then will
deal with the preparation on a time basis and then there will be agreement about a brief fee.

We k n o w th a t you are concerned a b o u t whether it is right th a t th e Authority   S h o u ld fu n d   this
“‘second bite at t h e cherry” in relation to the abuse of process application.

O ne could not unreasonably say that with such a high-profile and difficult case il would have
been a very brave S t i p e n d a r y Magistrate who would have stayed the proceedings hi the
Magistrates’ Court. Nonetheless tha authorities quite clearly point to the need for the defence
to make application at the earliest time available and that was before the Stipetulary
Magistrate. The High Court Judge is likely to be much more robust and of course is a person
with significant additional legal stature who is more familiar to taking brave decisions and to
dealing with this sort of application. We understand that you have had a copy of the written
advice from Mr William Clegg QC and that he believes that the application is evenly
balanced. If Leading Counsel says this and you know that a success at this stage could
perhnps save hundreds of thousands of pounds of costs, and with a Central Funds Order which
would overcome the problems mentioned above, and return substantial monies to the
Authority, and if the costs actually involved are relatively modest then surely die Authority
should take the view that they would be prepared to fund this application.

We have not mentioned our own fees in relation to the two hearings.

We told you dmt the cost of time spent and work done between the end of the committal and
the beginning of this month amounted to some £20,000.00 plus VAT and the majority of that
really relates to these forthcoming hearings, particularly the attendances on Mr Justice Collins
and Mr Bill Woodward QC arid some ongoing work with regard to abuse of process. If you
strip out that work which is with regard to the general part of the case we think that our costs
up to and including 20 December can be discreetly stated as to the admissibility and abuse at
an amount of £20,000.00 plus VAT. Our attendance at the hearing will be on the basis as
before of no more than two people that is myself and a trainee/paralegal at Court and one
person in the office to retrieve any papers or do any research as required. That should be able
to be accommodated within the £2,000.00 plus VAT in total per day with the expectation of
eight days in all.

Can you plense see if you enn obtain authorisation for these amounts.

I did tell you that wc had a meeting with our client on the afternoon of 11 November. He was
                               particularly at the news that had been conveyed about the tax
problems and the possible unwillingness to assist in the funding of the abuse of process
hearing. It would be nice to think that when we next write to him we can bring him some
more encouraging news.

Yours faithfully

             Dear David

              South Y orkshire Police Authority

             Thank you for your letter o f 17 November following the two telephone conversations of that day.
             As I told you I am seeing Michael Harrison in conference on 18 November and 1 will contact you
             immediately thereafter to let you know whether he is going to be available for the hearing on 20
             December. 1 spoke to Simon Myeraon on Monday and he is almost definitely not going to be
             available.

             If Michael Harrison o&nnot attend then T expect that his fees will be reduced by three refreshers at
             £1,500.00 plus VAT each and Simon Myerson’s by the £750,00 plus VAT each day. 1 do not seek
             any additional amount for my own attendance or for the attendance with me of e colleague at Court.
             1 have told you of the system used throughout the committal and which will be carried forward to the
             Crown Court namely, myself and one colleague at most at Court and one colleague back at the office
             to do any necessary research or location of papers as required at Court. 1 know that when we met I
             told you that my costs post committa! to now are approximately £20,000.00 plus VAT. I think that 1
             would estimate another £7,500.00 plus VAT up to the 20 December bearing.

             I note the meeting and that die members do not intend to invite any party concerned or legal
             representative to deiiver oral submissions.

             My own view is that with the help of the recent meeting, the quite voluminous correspondence and
             particularly the written opinion of Bill Clegg QC, that you art in a foil position to deal with any
             issue. You know bow passiotst&fy I believe that both of these hearings are fundamental to the
             defence and the possibility of actually stopping the proceedings now. i f there is any other
             information that you feel I could usefully provide, I would be heppy to do so.

           I noticed that you have copied the letter to Simon Eastwood (to whom I am copying this letter) and
           he will obviously need to cheek whether, if Michael Harrison is not going to be present, Bill Clegg
           (who we know is going to be present) will want an extra brief fee for effectively dealing with the
           admissibility hearing for both defendants.

       Dear David

       South Yorkshire Police Authority

       I hope that you have had a note of the telephone call made to your office on 18 November,
       following my conference with Counsel. I am pleased to say that my Counsel will be available
       for the hearing on 20 December. It is an absolutely intriguing situation because we have
       ccrtain evidence (of which HFSG are not yet aware) which we believe will persuade the Judge
       to rule as inadmissible the evidence given by both Defendants to the Taylor Bnquiiy. It also
       has consequences sofar as the admissibility of the enquiry itself is concerned. Finally, as you
       might anticipate, It strengthens our hand in relation to the application to stay for abuse of
       process.

       The practical consequences are:

       1.           The figures initially given to you for brief fees and refreshers for the two hearings wil]
                    stand with neither Counsel seeking extra fees for the work that will have to be done
                    between now and the conclusion of the two hearings,

       2.           Our prospects of success in the abuse hearing are improved. Certain statements are in
                    the course of preparation. I very much doubt whether they will be available to you
                    before the meeting on 26 November, but if I can make them available I will do so.

       I hope that this further information will add a little mere to the already very cogent reasons
       why furdlng should be provided to the two defendants from the committal through the
       admissibility and abuse hearings.

       Yours sincerely

         Dear David

         5outh Yorkshire Police Authority

         I refer to the e-mail timed at 20.22 on 18 November. You will earlier today have received a fax
         from me which was actually dictated at approximately the same sort of time last night as you were e-
         mailing me.

         Sofar as I can tell, as long as the bottom line is that my Client will not be placed in any worse
         position and will always be indemnified as to consequences, there vfouid be no objection to the
         instructions now becoming joint instructions.

         He will be encouraged by the advice that you have received from William Massey QC. What
         worries ma of course is the length of time that it will take the revenue to consider the matter and that
         is why some short term solution needs to be found which will indemnify my Client for his costs post
         committal up to and including the hearing on 3 January.

         1 hove to say that the information that I am going to give you with regard to the hearing on 20
         December must be absolutely confidential at this moment in time. The Police Authority meeting is,
         I think, a public meeting, but even if it is confidential what I set out below must be treated with the
         utmost confidence. The public enquiry in which Lord Justice Taylor said that the question of
         prosecution of the two Officers or Indeed any Officer was not within contemplation, and on that
         basis neither Mr Murray nor Mr Duekenfield w « cautioned before they gave evidence at the Taylor
         enquiry.

         It has been a "plank" of the prosecution case that they simply want to “admit the Taylor Enquiry”
         whereas they have diffieultfoa with both the inquest and the Stuart Smith Scrutiny. Leading Counsel
         believes that it will be possible to persuade Mr Justice Hooper that since no caution was given that
         the Officers’ testimony to the Taylor Enquiry can be excluded, it follows in the same way es any
         other criminal trial, but if their interview is excluded then much else can tlso be excluded unless it is
         capable of being directly led. Not only do we believe that this is a veiy important point, but the
         witnesses who speak to it are extremely eminent. I cannot say any more at the moment, but J am
         sure that you accept my word for it and I will bring you more information in that regard just as soon
         as Lc&t\.

            As [ 9aid in my previous letter, we also believe that this issue of admissibility and the way in which
            the Prosecution has been conducted are in themselves, additional matters for the Court to consider in
            relation to abuse of process.

Dear Mr Cockroft

South Yorkshire Police Authority

We are writing on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police Authority (PAYE reference 072/S3P) (the
"Authority") w hich is proposing to make a number of cash paym ents to retired police officers. We
are writing to seek confirmation of the PAYE and national insurance consequences of these
paym ents and in particular that:

1        the Authority is not required to operate and account for PAYE a n d /or national insurance
         contributions in respect of the proposed payments; and
2        the proposed paym ents are not benefits w hich m ust be returned on form PH D.

We set out below the background to the proposed payments and our analysis of the law relevant
to the confirmation sought.

Background

Proceedings

As you may be aware, follow ing the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 at w hich 96 Liverpool
supporters died, a solicitor representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group (an association
for the families of the victim s of the disaster) has been pursuing private prosecutions against two
of the police officers w ho they believe were legally responsible for the disaster. These officers are
former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield and former Superintendent Bernard Murray.
Both these officers have since retired from the police force on medical grounds. Mr Duckenfield
retired in Novem ber 1991 and Mr Murray retired in August 1992. Both are drawing police
pensions. The former officers have sought financial assistance from the Authority to meet, or
contribute towards, their legal costs of defending the prosecutions.

The prosecutions w ere com menced in July 1998 in the Leeds Magistrates Court. Each of the
officers faces two counts of manslaughter and one count of w ilful neglect to perform a public duty.

In la n d R ev en u e                                    - 2 -             27 S e p te m b er 1999




A further charge of attempting to pervert the course of justice w as brought against Mr Duckenfield
alone, but this has been discontinued.

In March 1999, the Divisional Court decided on a number of issues raised by w ay of judicial
review. It held in particular that the Authority had power under section 6 Police Act 1996 to meet
the legal costs of officers and former officers incurred in relation to private prosecutions brought
against them and judicial review proceedings in which they participate.

A committal hearing took place in July 1999 at which the former officers argued that:

a.      the private prosecutions should be struck out as an abuse of process; and

b.      there w as no prima facie case on the charges against them.

The former officers' arguments were rejected. On 20 July 1999, the former officers were committed
to stand trial in the Leeds Crown Court on the charges of manslaughter and w ilful neglect to
perform a public duty. The trial is due to take place in June 2000, although the former officers
propose to make a further application to have the charges struck out. This application w ill be
heard in January 2000.

The decision of the Authority to provide financial assistance

In May 1999, the Authority resolved, on the recommendation of the Chief Constable for South
Yorkshire Police, that pursuant to its power (as confirmed by the Divisional Court) it should meet
the costs incurred by the officers in the committal proceedings and part of the costs incurred by the
officers in the judicial review proceedings. In so resolving, the Authority confirmed a resolution
made in February 1998 (i.e. before the Divisional Court's confirmation of the power) to meet the
costs of the officers in the committal proceedings.

In reaching its decision, the Authority supported the Chief Constable's view that it w as necessary
to preserve the morale of the current police force for the Authority to be seen actively to be
supporting former officers w ho w ere facing prosecution arising out of the carrying out of their
duties at Hillsborough Stadium. Unless this support were given and seen to be given, existing
officers w ould clearly feel reluctant to act in situations where they, too, could become exposed to
prosecutions for acts carried out in the course of their duties. If the police force is to continue to
operate efficiently and effectively it is important for the officers concerned to know that their
actions (within obvious bounds of reasonableness) w ill be supported by the Authority. Clearly,
the implications of this issue extend beyond the boundaries of South Yorkshire.

The Authority's resolution to m eet the former officer's costs is restricted by certain prescribed
limits, including monetary limits on the maximum liability of the Authority. The Authority has
not engaged its ow n legal advisers to advise the officers. In addition the Authority has not agreed
directly w ith the former officers' lawyers to meet their costs. The legal costs remain the primary
liability of the former officers. The Authority has merely agreed to reimburse the former officers




j:\g arrett\so u th Yorkshire police\le-00044.doc\c
                                                   G arretts

Inland Revenue                                        -3-                  27 September 1999



those costs. In practice the m oney may be paid to the relevant lawyers direct to hold the money to
their client's order.

The resolutions envisage that costs incurred from 5 February 1999 should be em bodied in an
agreement prescribing the limits of the amount to be reimbursed. The former officers remain at
liberty to incur costs beyond those envisaged in the agreement but the Authority w ill not, of
course, be under an obligation to m eet the excess. The terms of the agreement have yet to be
finalised.

The resolutions do not deal w ith costs arising after the committal. The officers have indicated that
they w ill make a fresh application for financial assistance to help them to m eet these further costs.
N o date has been set for the m eeting of the Authority to consider the fresh application.

You should also be aware that if the Authority declined to exercise its power to contribute towards
the former officers costs, they w ould have to apply for legal aid. If legal aid w ere granted the
officers w ould becom e liable to make contributions to the Legal Aid Board. Furthermore, legal aid
may not be awarded retrospectively.

If the former officers successfully defend the charges against them, or if the charges are dropped,
an order is likely to be made for their costs to be met out cf central funds. It is unlikely that
paym ents received out of central funds w ill m eet the w hole of the costs incurred by the former
officers. It is expected that any costs recovered w ill be used to reduce or extinguish financial
assistance provided by the Authority.

Tax Liability

In our opinion the paym ents w hich the Authority are due to make to the officers under the terms
of the arrangements are not liable to Schedule E income tax. As such w e do not believe that the
Authority needs to operate PAYE in respect of the payments. In addition w e do not believe that
the payments are liable to national insurance contributions as they do not amount to earnings or
that they are returnable as benefits on form P11D. We have set out below the basis for our opinion.

Basis for O pinion

As a matter of law a police officer is a ministerial officer exercising statutory rights independent of
contract (A-G for N ew South W ales v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd [1955] AC 457). He falls in a class
of his ow n being neither a Crown servant nor an ordinary em ployee (Ridge v Baldwin [1963] 3
AER 66). He does, however, hold an office with emolum ents and is, therefore, w ithin the scope of
Schedule E. For convenience, in this letter w e have referred to the former officers as having held
employment.

To be taxable as incom e under Schedule E tw o conditions m ust be satisfied:

(a) the payments m ust be emoluments; and




j:\garreU \south yorkshire police\le*00044.doc\c

(b) the paym ents m ust derive "from the employment" (or office holding) (section 19 Taxes Act
    1988)

There is considerable case law on these issues although in many of the cases the condition is
treated as a single test focusing on the second limb.

The principles w hich have guided our thinking and which w e have discerned from the relevant
case law and statute are set out below. Where possible and to assist w e have also made reference
to the Inland Revenue Manuals:

1.          em olum ents are defined for Schedule E purposes in section 131 Taxes Act 1988 as including
             all "profits";

2.          the fact that an individual receives som ething which is a "profit" to him does not
             necessarily make him liable to tax under section 19 on it if it com es from a source other
             than his employment. The fact that it is paid by his employer or ex-employer is not
             conclusive that the payment derives from the employment. This is borne out, for example,
             by Lord Ratcliffe in Hochstrasser -v - Mayes 38 TC 707 (Schedule E Manual para 1002);

3.          a paym ent can still be chargeable as an emolum ent even if there is no legal obligation to
             pay it. However, the paym ent must still derive from the em ploym ent to be taxable under
            Schedule E. (Schedule E para 1005)

4.          an em olum ent for Schedule E purposes is defined in Pook -v - O wen 45 TC 571 by the
            H ouse of Lords as a sum paid by w ay of reward for the services of the employee. This
            view has been qualified to also include sums paid as an inducem ent to enter into
            employment. The leading case here is Shilton -v - Wilmshurst [1991] 1 AC 684 in which
            Lord Templeman said at page 689

             "The result is that an em olum ent 'from employment' means an em olum ent 'from being or
             becom ing an em ployee'.. .If an em olument is not paid as a reward for past services or as an
             inducem ent to enter into em ploym ent and provide future services but is paid for some
             other reason then the em olum ent is not received 'from the employment'."

             This passage has subsequently been endorsed by Lord W oolf in Mairs -v - Haughey 66TC
             273.

5.          The fact that an em ployee receives a sum which he w ould not have received but for his
            em ploym ent is not sufficient to make the paym ent an emolument taxable under section 19.
            For example in Mairs -v - Haughey Lord W oolf confirmed that a paym ent which w as in the
            nature of com pensation or to relieve distress did not fall w ithin the statutory definition of
            an em olum ent (Schedule E para 1045).

Inland Revenue                                          -5-                   27 September 1999



6.          If the proposed paym ents are not em olum ents w ithin section 131 Taxes Act 1988, they can
             not be brought w ithin the definition of emoluments by Chapter II of Part V of the Taxes Act
             (em ployees earning £8,500 or more and directors) since this chapter does not apply to
             pensioners and ex-em ployees but only where a person in any year 'is em ployed'.
             Consequently the paym ents cannot be brought w ithin the definition of emoluments (and so
             made taxable) either under the rules relating to expenses or as a benefit (section 153 Taxes
             Act 1988 et seq.) (Schedule E para 3004).

7.          The case of Rendell -v - Went 41 TC 641 appears relevant to the present facts. This case
            involved an employer funding the defence of an em ployee facing prosecution. However,
            the facts of the case are distinguishable since in that case the lawyers were retained by the
            employer and paid direct by the employer. In any event the case determines that such
            action could amount to an assessable benefit of the em ployee (within section 154 Taxes Act
            1988) rather than as an em olum ent under section 131. Since the provisions of section 154
            cannot apply in the present circumstances w e believe the case can be distinguished.

8.          The proposed payments do not amount to relevant benefits provided under a retirement
            benefit schem e and therefore are not taxable under section 595 Taxes Act 1988. The
            paym ents are not in the nature of a pension or like paym ent and cannot be said to be paid
            under a schem e for the provision of relevant benefits. We do not see how regard Statement
            of Practice 13/91 is relevant. In no sense do the proposed payments have anything to do
            w ith or are they consequent upon the retirement of the former officers.

9.          Payments which are not otherwise taxable under Schedule E (including section 595 Taxes
            Act 1988) can be taxed under section 148 if paid after em ploym ent has ceased. However
            this section only applies to paym ents made in connection w ith termination of employment
            or changes in the duties or em olum ents of an em ployee. .Neither of these is relevant in the
            present circumstances.

 After considering the balance of argument from the principles outlined above w e believe the tax
 treatment of the proposed payments can be summarised as follow s. The fact that the Authority is
 making paym ent is not conclusive of the sum s being taxable; the sum s m ust derive from the
 employment. The sum s are not paid as a reward for services rendered or to be rendered by the
 former officers; the sum s derived from the exercise of a power by the Authority after the
 em ploym ent had ceased. There w as no expectation or understanding w hen the officers retired
 that such funding w ould be made since the private prosecutions began betw een 6 and 7 years
 after the former officers retired. The Authority w as under no legal obligation to pay anything to
 the officers. The Authority chose to do this for its ow n sound operational and managerial reasons,
 nam ely to maintain morale and confidence w ithin the existing police force.

 If the sum s do not fall w ithin the basic definition of an em olum ent in section 131 Taxes Act 1988
 they cannot be taxed under the provisions relating to expenses or benefits as these cannot apply to
 ex-em ployees (with limited exceptions not relevant here). The paym ents cannot be taxed under
 section 148 since they do not relate to termination or a variation in duties/em olum ents.

Consequently w e do not believe that the payments are taxable as income under Schedule E and, as
a result, that the Authority has no obligation to operate PAYE or account for national insurance in
respect of the proposed payments.

Confirm ation

We w ould be grateful for your confirmation that the Authority has no liability to account for
PAYE/national insurance or filing obligations in respect of the proposed paym ents described
above.

The Authority is under pressure to make a payment shortly. The Authority has made an offer to
the officers of £205,000 plus VAT in respect of fees incurred to 5 February 1999. This has yet to be
agreed. The Authority has also received a request from the officers for an additional £331,000 plus
VAT for cost incurred since that date. The solicitors for the officers are currently w orking with no
assurance of past and future fees and may not continue to do so unless their legal bills for work
completed are met. Consequently w e w ould be grateful if you could consider this at your earliest
convenience.

Should you have any queries or require further in formation please do not hesitate to contact the
writer or his colleagues Nick Painter or David Harlock.

Yours sincerely

               Dear Mr Betts

               SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY

               Following your letter of 27 September 1999 and our subsequent telephone conversation I
               have now received my Head Office Specialist’s definitive opinion as to the tax treatment of
               the payments to be made to Mr Duckenfield and Mr Murry.

               The payments wifi be chargeable to income tax either under: -

                1)        S19 ICTA 1988 as emoluments from a former office,

                          or alternatively,

               2)         S596A ICTA 1988 as benefits provided under an unapproved retirement benefit
                          scheme.

                S19(1) & S19(1)4A

                To be chargeable under S19 an emolument must be must derive from employment.
                However, the scope of “from the employment” (per the Act "emoluments therefrom") is not
                restricted to rewards for services, or inducements to enter into employment An emolument
                is "from the employment” if it is referable to the employment and nothing else (see Neill LJ,
                Hamblett v Godfrey 59 TC 727).

    Inland Revenue South Yorkshire: An Executive Office of th e Inland Revenue                                           Oifector. Mary Hay

       In Bray v Best 61 TC 752 Lord Oliver stated;

       “In the light of these authorities, I cannot read the phrase “reward for services" as anything
       more than a convenient expression of the notion that a particular payment arises from the
       existence of the employer-employee relationship and not, to use Lord Reid’s words in
       Laidler v Perry, from “something else"."

       Considering the facts of this case:

       - the situation which gave rise to the payments being made arose from the performance of
       their duties,

    - the payments are being made under the Police Authority's powers to meet the legal costs
    of officers and former officers, and

    * they are being made to maintain morale and confidence within the existing police force.

   Therefore there is every reason to conclude that the payments are emoluments within
   S19(1).

   Section 19(1)4A deems that the payments are “for" the year in which the individuals ceased
   to hold office. However, the payments will be taxable in the year of receipt by reason of
   S202A ICTA 1988.

   National Insurance Contributions

   If the payments are emoluments chargeable under S19 then prima facie they are also
   earnings for NIC purposes (“earnings" are defined in S3(1) Social Security Contributions and
   Benefits Act 1992 as “any remuneration or profit derived from employment").

   Therefore Class 1 NIC will be payable at the time that the payments are made.

   Section 596A ICTA 1988

   Even if it could be demonstrated S19 did not apply, the payments would be chargeable
   under S596A as benefits provided under an unapproved retirement benefits scheme.

   The payments constitute “relevant benefits" as defined in S612(1) ICTA 1988:

   “   any pension, lump sum, gratuity or other like benefit given or to be given          in
   connection with past service, after retirement "

   As the payments will be lump sums, made in connection with past service and after
   retirement it seems they will be chargeable under S596A if not S19.

   Other potential charging provisions

   I am able to agree wrth you that S148, S153 and S154 will not be in point.

           Conclusion

           The payments will be assessable under S19 ICTA 1988. Even if they were not, tney would
           be chargeable under S596A.

           The Revenue does not normally give pre-transaction rulings in such cases. However, my
           Specialist has agreed to do in this case it is of “major public interest”. However, I do not now
           intend to enter into further debate “pre-transaction".

           If your clients are unable to agree the position as I have set it out we can enter into detailed
           discussion once the payments have been made and the full facts are available.

           I hope this letter clarifies matters for you.

                   1.   On 21al May 1999, in the wake of the judgment of the Divisional Court in ILK
                        np p. ev parte Duckenfield [1999] 2 All ER 873, the South Yorkshire Police
                        Authority ("the Authority”) resolved to meet certain of the legal costs and
                        disbursements of two former officers. Mr Duekenfield and Mr Murray, in
                        pending criminal proceedings against them arising out of the Hillsborough
                        Disaster. A total of 19 resolutions were passed but, in short, the Authority
                        resolved to meet the former officers’ costs and disbursements of (i) the
                        criminal proceedings up to the end o f the committal proceedings and o f (ii)
                        judicial review proceedings against ihe DPP. Consideration o f applications
                        for further funding were deferred.      Two aspects of these outstanding
                        applications come before the Authority on. 26th November 1999. They relate
                        to two pre-trial hearings in December 1999 and January 2000.


                   2.   In the meantime, a question arose as to whether the former officers would be
                        liable to pay income tax on sums received from the Authority by way of
                        financial assistance in litigation. I understand that the Inland Revenue has
                        now confirmed its view that tax would be payable on such sums, either as an
                        emolument from a former office or as a benefit provided under an unapproved
                        retirement scheme. The Authority hus, however, received advice from leading
                        counsel that no such tax is payable. This difference of view remains to be
                        resolved,




                                                                                                 £c:6Q IXQK)66.'A0N
                                                                         aavn&s ax so i

              3.       Against that background, I am asked to advice whether the Authority has
                       power to provide for and pay income tax (and national insurance
                       contributions), if applicable, on financial assistance it gives to the former
                       officers. In other words, does the Authority have power to pay financial
                       assistance gross, so that the net amoum received by the former officers w ill be
                       enough to discharge their defence costs and disbursements? In my view, the
                       Authority does have the power to make gross payments.                           In ex parte
                       DusksnfisM the Divisional Court held that the Authority is empowered to
                       fund the legal costs and disbursements of criminal and judicial review
                      proceedings under section 6(1) of the Police Act read with section 111(1) of
                      the Local Government Act 19T2: see especially pages 889-890 and 893-896,
                      The power is a power to fund the proceedings.                      It is the costs o f the
                      proceedings which are the target of the funding. This means that the Authority
                      is entitled to consider the amount of money that will be devoted to the
                      proceedings themselves. The power is not one to pay the officers a salary or a
                      retirement allowance on which they must then pay tax and from the remainder
                      o f which they may then pay their lawyers. The Authority has a power to fund
                      in full or in part - as it chooses. If it chooses to provide full funding1, it must
                      have the consequential power to ensure that the funds that actually reach the
                      former officers are sufficient to pay their costs and disbursements2.
                      Otherwise, the proceedings wouid not be fully funded. In other words, the
                      Authority is entitled to make available financial assistance which in the hands
                      o f t h e form er officers is sufficient Lo pay all or part of their costs and
                      disbursements,


             4,       Assuming that the payments will be subject to deductions in respect o f income
                      tax and national insurance contributions, I am also asked whether further
                      resolutions from the Authority are required to cater for this factor. In my
                      view, the Authority needs to consider the possible effect(s) of income tax
                      and national insurance contributions on the resolutions It passed on 21st
                      M ay 1999 and then pass further resolutions accordingly. There are two

             Authority has a duty as b former employer to pay the attendant tax and national insurance contributions.

                                 reasons fo r this.      Both stem       from the A uthority’s previous ("unspoken)
                                 assum ption th a t the paym ents would not b® subject to any deductions but
                                 w ould be paid gross to the form er officers.
                                 (1)      The A uthority -must properly consider the effect o f tax and national
                                          insurance on the m oney that reaches th e hands o f th e form er officers.
                                          The A uthority is empowered to mates paym ents o n ly because o f its
                                          view that they are conducive to the m aintenance o f an efficient and

                                          Act 1996. The prospects o f achieving this purpose are plain ly affected
                                          by the am ount o f funds that actually reach the hands o f the form er
                                          officers- M orale will be prejudiced i f only n et paym ents are received.
                                          T he A uthority m ust properly direct its e lf as to the extent to w hich its
                                        purpose is being achieved. Quite apart from that, the incidence o f tax
                                        and national insurance are. in general public law term s, relevant factors
                                        whiuh. th e A uthority needs to consider.          It ought to direct itse lf
                                        correctly o n the am ount o f m oney that will be available for the target
                                        o f the funding- that is, the legal proceedings.       The p ractical effect o f
                                        the existing resolutions will not m atch the A uthority’s intent.           For
                                        exam ple, th e essential them e o f resolutions 10 and 11 is that the form er
                                        officers should not be out. o f pocket.      The A uthority “approved the

                                       crim inal proceedings.       In the light o f the attitude o f th e Inland
                                       Revenue, the practical effect o f these resolutions needs to b e clarified
                               (2)     T he A uthority m ust also properly consider th e effect o f tax and
                                       n ational insurance on th e m oney that leaves the coffers o f th e
                                       A uthority. I f it is m inded to increase the gross am ount o f th e funding
                                       so as to m ake good th e shortfall, this w ill m ean a greater drain o n the

                                       paragraph 3 above), it m ust do it consciously. T he existing resolutions
                                       do not do it consciously.      It they are "grossed up*’ by th e C lerk and

           1 City Square

           LS1 2AL


           Dear Mr Harlock

           Re: H illsborough Funding

           Your letter of 17 November addressed to Ann Adiington has been forwarded to me
           for response. Please accept this letter as a formal submission to be placed before
           members at their meeting on 26 November 1999.

           Firstly, I would reiterate the submissions made to the Authority on 21 May last and
           in view of the considerable change in membership ask that fresh copies are given to
           all concerned.

           Since that meeting there has been two significant developments:

            1)         The Stipendiary Magistrate at Leeds heard legal arguments from 5th - 9th July
                       99 as to whether or not the prosecutions are an abuse of process. His
                       answer was a resounding “’NO'.

                       The Magistrate made it clear at the outset that the burden of establishing
                       abuse of process lay with the Defence.

                       This was further held to be the case by the Honourable Mr Justice Hooper on
                       3 September In Leeds Crown Court.
                       Despite this basic starting point, the Defence chose not to give any evidence
                       in the Magistrates Court. Mr Clegg QC on behalf of Mr Duckenfield, has
                       since Indicated that it is highly unlikely that any evidence will be called at the
                       hearing scheduled for 4 January 2000.

                       In contrast to this the prosecutor submitted a comprehensive statement and
                       was vigorously cross-examined at length by Mr Harrison DC and Mr Clegg
                       QC In his judgment, the Stipendiary Magistrate found her to be reliable,
                       credible and a responsible prosecutor, mindful of her duties.
    CHAIRMAN                                                      secretary                    TREASURER

                             At this juncture I would ask you to confirm that you have been provided with a
                             copy of the Stipendiary Magistrate’s lengthy ruling by the Defence?

                             This is the prime document which ought to be considered by members of the
                             Police Authority on 26 November as it sets out the law on abuse of process
                             and the Magistrates' findings on the prosecution evidence and legal
                             submissions.

                              It is our view that this is the closest you will get to a truly independent opinion
                              on the merits and regularity of the prosecutions. ( cannot stress too highly
                              how essential it is for the Police Authority members to receive truly
                              independent advice.

                             W e expect that the Defence Lawyers will make submissions stating yet again
                             how strong their case is. and we believe will over exaggerate their chances of
                             success. We would argue ' They would say that wouldn’t th e y r - especially
                             when they have a direct pecuniary advantage in this matter?


                              On the 20 July, the Stipendiary Magistrate ruled that the prosecutions had
                              established a prima-facie case against the Defendants and committed them
                              both to stand trial.

                              This is exactly what we have been saying to the Authority for almost a year
                              now and I would ask that we are given the credence w e deserve.


                   The Authority may wish to dampen the expenditure figures, but my reading of their
                   accounts is that to date, the Defendants substantial legal teams have received at
                   least £1.1 million of charge-payers money. This is considerably more than the
                   'many tens o f thousands” of pounds spoken of in the Judicial Review in March this
                   year and begs the question of how on earth can you justify this as value for money?

                   In our opinion you have gone beyond the threshold o f ' providing m oral support fo r
                   officers’ and to continue to fund further would adversely affect the morale of bobbies
                   on the beat who struggle to perform their difficult duties in the knowledge that extra
                   resources are being diverted to the lawyers pockets. This is aside from vulnerable
                   charge-payers who ultimately bear the brunt

                    We hope that these submissions do not fall on deaf ears end as is rumoured. It
                    transpires that the Authority has already set aside a further £ >£ million for
                    expenses.


                    We can surely be forgiven for suspecting that the real reason that consideration for
                    financial support is to be limited, at th is stage, “to consideration o f the costs if the
                    hearings on 20 Decom ber 1999 and 4 January 2 0 0 0 is that to consider ta d in g up
                    to the conclusion of the trial would involve members being provided with estimates
                    of costs which would prove unpalatable in the extreme.

                We suspect that funding is being staggered in this way to cushion the blow with the
                costs o f the trial itself being awarded from the budget for year 2000/2001. There
                may even be a hope that the HFSG will have ceased to exist by then I Believe me
                when I say that we still be here, and if you decide to fund in this staggered manner it
                will come back to haunt SYPA for years to come, especially in view of this
                Government’s commitment to “good value".

                We further submit that the previous membership of the Authority had muddled
                thinking on the availability of legal aid, and in funding, has effectively deprived many
                police officer in this country, when facing legal proceedings, from qualifying for legal
                aid. We believe that the rationale behind this aspect of the Authority's decision to
                fund is topsy turvy. We look forward with Interest to the time when the Authority's
                decision is revisited in subsequent judicial reviews when Police Authorities refuse to
                provide financial assistance.

                We would also draw your attention to the fact that the constraints Imposed by the
                Authority on 21 May 99, are more apparent than real. Members of the media were
                staggered at the numbers on the defence legal teams in Leeds Magistrates' Court.
                You can rest assured that once reporting restrictions 8re lifted, this is a matter that
                will be commented upon at length.

                 This, however, came as no shock to HFSG. Don't forget our solicitor has recently
                 been presented with a bill for £80,000 + from the defence for a Judicial review which
                 lasted barely more than a day - with one defence team claiming the costs of leading
                 counsel, junior counsel, senior litigation partner, police law consultant and senior
                 assistant solicitor!.

                 In closing, we would urge the Authority to refrain from throwing further funds into the
                 pockets of the Defence legal team.
                 The Authority has already funded:-

                             substantia! defence representations to the DPP
                  •          an unsuccessful judicial review of the DPP’s decision not to discontinue
                             a lengthy and expensive hearing on abuse of process in the Magistrates’
                             Court.

                  That the Authority Is even considering further funding fo r the defence to re-run what
                  is essentially the same argument in the Crown Court is frankly quite staggering. As
                  our counsel put it in the Magistrates’ Court - "same singer, same song". To th2 i we
                  would add can you continue to be the “same generous benefactor' or have you
                  reached the stage where your duty to others exceeds that to these former officers!!

                        the Authority will know, the basis for the manslaughter charges is gn=3n
                        and W believe it is central to an assessment of any criminal liability in that context,

                              crucial to the conduct and outcome of the criminal trial.

                              We have/been making considerable enquiries since the committal in regard to the
                              circumstances in which the defendants gave evidence at the Taylor Inquiry, and we
                              ech'o thevcpmmems made by Walker Morris in their letter o f 19 November that the
                              following comments must be treated in absolute confidence, until our evidence
                              (which is likely to comprise approximately 6 statements) on this application is
                              finalised^ We shall of course make available to you any final copies o f the evidence
                              for the Authority's information and assistance at a later date. It may help the
                              Authority to .know at this time that our enquiries suggest that die defendants gave
                              evidence at the Inquiry against the following background:

                              *      a letter raising potential criticisms o f South Yorkshire Police (the so-called
                                     "Salmon’* letter) was sent to the Police solicitors, Messrs Hammond Suddards,
                                    but neither defendant appears to have seen a copy o f that letter prior to giving
                                    .evidence;

                              * ISouth Yorkshire Police were represented at the Inquiry, through Messrs
                                 Hammond Suddards and counsel who at all times believed they were acting on
                                 behalf o f the force as a body, rather than individual officers;

                              ■      the lawyers involved with the Inquiry appear to have held the view in 1989 that
                                    :the legal representatives for SYP as a force were also acting to represent the
                                     interests of individual officers, and accordingly no separate representation was
                                     accorded to the officers, and no correspondence was conducted directly with
                                     them;

                              * ^atno time before or during the Inquiry did Lord Justice Taylor believe that there
                                Jwas any realistic risk of .a prosecution for manslaughter of an^ person arising out
                                ;of the Hillsborough disaster;

                              ■      accordingly, because of the belief that there was no possibility of there being a
                                     prosecution, at no time prior to or during the course of the Inquiry was any
                                    ■individual cautioned in regard to his evidence and the potential risk of any
                                     subsequent criminal prosecution arising out of that evidence;

                              ■        in reg&rd:to our client, M r Duckenfield, it would appear thai he was not afforded
                                     • the .benefit of any detailed legal advice, guidance or input in regard to his
                                       evidence at the Inquiry, and indeed was not actually represented at the Inquiry in
                                    ■’ the-context of his personal interests.

                         .. Authority members), but we do believe it to be of the utmost importance and are
                            proceeding vigorously to prepare the necessary material to put this argument with
                            the;greatest-' force on 20 December. Naturally counsel is being kept advised of our
                            preparations and has assisted with input both as to general strategy and specific
                            documentation,
                           Much of our recent activity has been directed to this aspect, and a rough estimate of
                           professional costs incurred since the committal on 20 July to the end of the week
                           commencing 25 November is £35*45,000.

                           To complete the evidence and other preparations required by the court timetable (see
                           the otdff 3 .September 1999, Mr Justice Hooper) we estimate to be a further £10-
                            15,G00.:. The hearing is set down for 2-3 days, 20-22 December, and the estimate for
                           attendances by 2 fee earners, with necessary hotel and like expenses in attending
                           Leeds is approximately £2,000-2,500 per day. To all the foregoing sums needs to b©
                           added VAT.
                            In .regard to counsel’s fees we propose dealing with these for sums generally in
                            accordance with Walker Morris* letter of 12 November 1999 (although we may
                            choose to calculate as hourly rates rather than brief and refreshers) subject to any
                            additional expenses incurred by leading counsel in travelling and staying in Leeds.
                            This of course is a factor relevant to the claims for refreshers for earlier attendances.

                            In conclusion, we cannot over-emphasise the importance of this application, nor our
                            belief having made considerable investigations, that the application is a very strong
                            one. The success of the defence of this case may well depend upon ihis application
                            alone.

                  2)        Abuse of process January 2000

                            We have already corresponded at length about this, and you have the benefit of
                            cotmseTs advice. We note from your previous correspondence that the Authority
                            members, may have concerns as a previous application has already been made before
                            the. magistrate.
                            We echo .ihe comments made in counsel's advice of 1 August 1999, and the
                            comments made by Walker Moms to you in their letter of 12 November regarding
                            the cost/benefit analysis in making tins application.
                            If we may paraphrase leading counsel’s advice further it is important to uote
                            counsel’s view that “a strong case exists that this prosecution amounts to an abuse of
                            process; of the court”. Counsel’s further comments about the likelihood of this
                            application 1succeeding before the judge reflect a natural, proper and fair
                            consideration of the vagaries of judicial pronouncements and the difficulty of
                            prediction. Notwithstanding that the matter is one of great “speculation”, leading
                            .counsel says that this “must be evenly balanced”.
                             Once          the importance of this application to the prosecution overall must be
                             bome jn mind by the Authority members. Those conducting the defence on behalf
                             of Mr DuckenfieM believe that in reality, the High Court judge is much moie likely
                             to b t attracted to the arguments of abuse, in this high profile and unique case, than
                             was the magistrate, for a variety of political and legal reasons.

                       The Authority will have seen leading counsel’s advice that the magistrate erred as a
                       matter of law in considering the abuse application, particularly in dealing with the
                       human rights legislation. You will be aware that The Human Rights Act comes into
                       force izi October 2000, and we believe come January of that year, Mr Justice Hooper
                       will have this aspect in the forefront of his mind when deciding on the application.
                        The application as put to the magistrate will of course be reviewed and refined for
                      : thepuipose of the January hearing and we believe that it can be put with even
                        greater force at thai time. The question of the Inland Revenue impact on potential
                        costs mdernzxity for the defendants does of course raise the question of potential
                        prejudice to the defendants which did sot exist in July whan the matter was argued
                        before die magistrate. We wish to be appraised of developments on this point so
                        that we can. raise this before the judge notwithstanding the likelihood that this issue
                        will remain.unresolved by January 2000.
                       Those defending Mr Duckenfreld are of die view that the arguments in relation to
                       admissibility may also assist in the abuse of process argument, and you will
                       appreciate that this aspect has been much advanced by our recent enquiries and
                       therefore will form part of the enhanced abuse application next year.

                       In short, we believe the abuse of process argument to be argued before the judge has
                       a realistic chance of success and for the reasons set out in counsel’s advice we
                       believe that the interests of justice for the defendants make it compelling for this
                       matter to be argued, and for die costs indemnity to be extended to that hearing.

                       In conclusion on this point we echo the comments of Walker Morris that the
                       potential success of this application could lead to a saving of hundreds of thousands
                       of pounds’ worth of costs, with the complementary Central Funds Order being made
                       in the normal course for costs incurred in the prosecution to date and that as the
                       discrete costs for this application are relatively modest it is both legally and
                       commercially justified for the Authority to indemnify the defendants in regard to the
                       application. It would also see our client's nightmare ended in January raiher than
                        June.

             In regard tp our costs, we think die abuse preparation to be in the order of £5-10,000, with
             Leeds attendance costs, ineluding hotel and like expenses, to be £2-2,500 per day for up to 4
             days. VAT nedds to be added to these figures. We have referred to counsel’s fees earlier
             on an overall basis.
             We stress that all the above figures are best possible estimates, on a reasonable basis, but as
             the conduct of this case has not so far proceeded on a predictable basis, we anticipate these
             estimates may subsequently prove inaccurate for reasons beyond our control We would ask
             the A uthority, jf thia proves to be the case, to consider any subsequent submissions as to
             work propdriyand reasonably carried out, subject to assessment by an independent costs
              draftsman in the normal way.
              We trust the above assists you and the Authority in the meeting. It may be helpful to the
              Authority to' confirm that we would strongly advise our client, regardless of funding issues,
              to mair* the above applications. May we respectfully remind you of the key words of the
              Chief Constable when he referred to damage to police morale if funding were not approved.

                  were not granted now? We ncrte that you do not require at this time an estimate of costs
                  generally in^ regard to the defence o f the prosecution, and you will know that we are
                  attending to .matters on an ongoing basis, particularly as a result of ongoing disclosure of
                  material front* HFSG, as a result of their perusal of the SYP archive.

                  There is one remaining maffer we would ask that the Authority reconsider. In your without
                  prejudice correspondence o f 17 September you advised that the Authority having met on 10
                  September had decided, amongst other tilings, to reject an application for Mr Duckenfield’s
                  travel in d incidental costs to be reimbursed. We respectfully ask for this matter to be
                  reconsidered at the forthcoming meeting, and make the following observations to assist in
                  that consideration.

                  The present prosecution has been brought in Leeds, after the aborted attempt to prosecute
                  the defendants ih Liverpool. Mr Duckenfield unfortunately now lives on the South Coast,
                  and is required to endure considerable personal hardship in attending the bearings both in
                  regard to travel and personal costs. At all times he has attempted to minimise his personal
                  expenditure in that regard, for common-sense reasons, and where available has taken up the
                  offers from friends and relatives of accommodation. He is nonetheless required to incur
                  considerable expenditure in travelling to and from Leeds. Pursuant to previous decisions of
                  the Authority, earlier expenditure has been reimbursed, and with respect, we do not see any
                  basis for thfc expenditure being denied. Previous figures have been submitted in regard to
                  the committal hearing, and Mr Duckenfield will be required to attend in December and
                  January for the two hearings.
                                      i

                   We can see no1ba<aa for differentiating between his personal costs, in attending court, from
                   those o f ourselves and other legal representatives who of course must travel and stay in
                   Leeds for this duration o f 1he hearing. The sums involved are relatively nominal in relation
                   to the large amounts of legal fees being necessarily incurred. In the interests o f fairness, we
                   therefore ask. this Authority to reconsider this decision, and to be mindful of the personal
                   impact fhw* refusal to pay these expenses has had and will continue to have on Mr
                   Duckenfield at a time when he has to endure the utmost stress and anxiety.

                   I am aware that you are still awaiting various reports and outlines from us regarding
                   costings to dace, and will deal with those in separate correspondence. If there is any other
                   matter we can assist the Authority with in regard to its meeting on Friday please do not
                   hesitate to contact me or Duncan McGill o f our office at your convenience.

           I should appreciate any further clarification you can give me on costs. A t the same time, would
           you let me have your thoughts on the possibility of your being jointly instructed by Mr
           Duckenfield and the Authority. The purpose of the joint instruction will be to further the
           Authority's interest in ensuring that Mr Duckenfield and the Authority's interests are protected by
           the Defence. There may be an ancillary benefit in that the Authority will be able to recover VAT
           on any costs paid. A joint retainer should also obviate the Millet problem were the Authority to be
           the sole client

           I look forward to hearing from you.

           Kind regards

           Yours sincerely

 Dear Sir

 Hillsborough Sjtadium d isaster 1989
 Arlington * v * Duckenfield
 Adlington - v * Murray
 Judgement on he application as to Abuse of Process
 f have been a seed to write to you on behalf of the Chief Constable to express concern at certain
 conclusions or ffndings set out in the above Judgement which was handed to the parties and others
 at the conclusion of the Hearing of this application.

 In particular pan es 22 and 23 of the Judgement contain the following observations: -

 1. “the South Yorkshire Police have made it difficuf tfor anyone considering a Private Prosecution to
    obtain the e 'idenoe to bring one".

 2. “South York? hire Police via the West Midlands Police were able to influence what evidence went
    before the Cbroner.

 3. T h e Prosec ititiO’l encountered further problems concerning disclosure from the South Yorkshire
    Police which was only resolved by them taking cut a Witness Summons".

 4. "..I take the >'iew that the South Yorkshire Police! must take some responsibility fcr [delay, by
    participating in an alleged cover up or by the concealment of evidence or in tne lack of
    disclosure].

 The Chief Const aliWe is greatly concerned that these, observations should effectively be recorded as
 “findings" in you Judgement when the Chief Constable was not given any opportunity to make
 submissions or cal! evidence.




                                                                The person dealing with this correspondence is:

         In my respectfi i submission this represents a breach of natural justice, if he had been given the
         opportunity the Chief Constable would have strenuously disputed each of those four observations,
         The following pjoints are relevant-

         1 . Observatioi i number 1 is followed, and by implication supported, by a quote from Lord Justice
             Stuart Smit Vs Scrutiny Report However, the quote very obviously refers to the days immediately
             following th s Disaster whereas it appears to be used to support an observation about events
             many yean later. In fact Lord Justice Stuart Smith's findings about the South Yorkshire Police’s
             attitude to c coimentatjon are contained in paragraphs 26-34 of Chapter 5 of his Scrutiny Report
             and do not n any way support the observation made. Indeed, the reverse is true.

             As to obser ration number 2 there does not appear to be any justification for suggesting that the
             South York hire Police were able to influence what evidence went before the Coroner. If this is a
             reference U the editing of Statements then again Lord Justice Stuart Smith's findings on the
             impact of ths editing are summarised in paragraphs 23 and 24 of his summary of conclusions at
             Chapter 7. Again they dc not in any way support the observation made.

             As to item 2 the Chief Constable sought and obtained guidance from the DPP on documentation
             issues reia:tng to the Private Prosecution and followed those guidelines. Further it would, with
             respect, have been only just to record at this point in your Judgement that a number of the
             documents which were sought pursuant to the Witness Summons were held by yourself to be
             irrelevant

         4. It may be th jt this observation is merely a summary of the others but if so it is subject to the same
            defects whii h are set out above.

         I should empha >ise that the Chief Constable does not in any way dispute the outcome of the
         Application. It not his position or wish to do so. He is however concerned that apparent findings
         h a ve te e n mad i and distributed which are adverse to the South Yorkshire Police but without that
         body having any opportunity to comment upon them.

         Reading the Jui lg<ement it does occur to me that the intention might have been to summarise the
         arguments put 5iwarti by Ann Adlington and perhaps to indicate that these were not challenged by
         tne individual D sfendants. If the Judgement were to make dear that that was what was being
         recorded then c early the Chief Constable could no longer have any objection to it.




                                                                     The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                                     Alan Walker *Force Solicitor

                                                                     0:^Rich£«taIicwcVLcgBi

 I therefore resfe ctfufly request that you reconsider jthe terms of the Judgement in the light of the
 observations rUa<Je above and consider issuing a revised version which makes clear (if I have
 correctly unde* sttood the position) that no finding ac verse to the South Yorkshire Police has been
 made but only indings
                   ir       as regards contentions mad e by the HFSG and counter submissions by the
 individual Defe icidarrfs who were before the Court, n justice I would request that this should make
 d e ar that the S outh Yorkshire Police were not represented on the application and had no opportunity
 of challenging iny of the contentions advanced b y .Ann Adlington.

 i should be grab:efui to hear from you in very early course on this matter which has caused the Chief
 Constable gra\ e concern.

 Yours faithfully

                  Your Re ■ LS/APW/BW/

                  Dear Mr Walker,

               Thank y< u for your letter dated 12 August. I apologise for the delay in
               replying to you bur I have been away on holiday. I am sorry that the Chief
               Constabl t is concerned about a number o f passages in my ruling, and I note
               the observations you have made in your letter about them.
               I am clea rly not in a position to reopen the hearing nor am I able to alter the
               wording af my ruling based on the observations you have made. All I am
               able to do is make a number o f observations m yself Firstly the Magistrates
               Court is i tot a court o f record and any findings made there are not binding on
               any othei court. Secondly, I made an order restricting publication o f the
               proceedii igs. I made an order permitting publication only of the kind of
               proceeds tgs and the result. Anyone who were to publish any details o f the
               proceedii tgs would potentially be in contempt o f court. Thirdly, the
               applicant in to stay proceedings as an abuse o f process is likely to be
               reargued in the Crown Court when any misunderstanding on the points you
               raise cou d be clarified then.
               I am sorr r that I cannot be o f any more assistance.
               Yours sie cerely,

               NR Cadb Jry.             j

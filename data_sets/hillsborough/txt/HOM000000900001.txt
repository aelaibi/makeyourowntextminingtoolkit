   Subject



          I am Constable 5043          ’M ’ Stephen Frank Fry of the
   Merseyside Police currently serving with the Mounte

   Department.


          01 Saturday,        15th April,    1989,   I *=   deployed with         1
    members o£ the Department to cover the F.A.Cup semiI                     n.
    between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest football
    Hillsborough      Park,    Sheffield.


             About   1030 hours I attended a briefing with the
    m e m b e r s , who were present were members fro. Nottingham a,
     south Yorkshire Mounted Department.              The brief.ng was
     conducted by Inspector Hands-Davies of the South Yor s i.

     Mounted Department.

             I was detailed to work with Inspectors Hands-Davies
     and Wilkinson and Constables 5855 RIMMER.               6878 LUNT and
     7081 RADFORD.          Our brief was to cover the arriva            o
     special train and escort of the passengers to the gates
     Leppings Lane, we were also briefed to oversee the
      approaches      to the ground via Halifax Road and Lepping

      Lane.

              The entire Mounted Deployment paraded at 1130 hour:
      We rode out         in troop onto Halifax Road then                     *
      to the club car park where we split              into the    e a
      sections for the pre match duties.


               The section I was detailed to continued through tt
       club car park to the Leppings Lane entrance.                 Inspect
       Hands-Davies pointed out the exit gates that we would
                                                                           Form I(HA

supervising at the end o£ the game.                We continued onto
Leppings Lane and o n t o ..Halifax Road to: the railway static
where we were further briefed as to the grouping and
movement of the train passengers to the ground.


          >t     12.10 hours we split    into half section                (twos) to
 patrol Halifax Road until            the arrival of the special train
 between         13.45 and   14.15 hours.


              With constable 708 1 Radford I made my way                  along
  Halifax Road away from the ground.               I saw        that there was           =
  steady flow of coaches and pedestrians making their way
  the ground.         However there were several groups moving awa.
  from the ground visiting the "GATEWAY" shopping
  off     licences on Halifax Road.          There were queues outside
  the off         licences and I noted that more of the
  heading towards the ground were carrying                  cans and bot                 -
   of beer.         They were    in good humour.           ■„


               I made along Halifax Road to the junction with Wilcc
   Avenue.         There I spoke to a South Yorkshire foot Sergeant
   he told me that a pub nearby was full of supporters who
   had been arriving from the direction of the ground on
    public transport and taxis.             This location was about

    miles from the ground.

               From Wilcox Avenue Constable Radford and I returned
    along halifax Road towards the ground.                 I saw that the p
        the    'White Horse'    appeared to be shut however                he tables
        chairs and walls around the pub car park were                          u
        shoulder to shoulder with supporters drinking beer from
        bottles and cans.        The off licence opposite still ha
        queue outside as I observed on my way up Halifax Road.
        Closer to the ground the grassed areas around t e
        ■Gateway'     shopping centre was being used            l i k e    a       'Picnic
        site with groups of supporters eating, and drinking
        alcoholic beverages from cans and bottles.
                                                                    Form IWA

          At    13.45 I returned to the railway station to aw a w
the arrival         of    the special train.     On arrival      the mounted
section along with the foot officers grouped the
passengers         together on 'bloc' escorted the supporters to

the Leppings Lane entrances.


           After arrival      at the ground Constable Radford ana I
 moved back al on g Leppings Lane to the chip shop,                 from
 there we moved slowly along covering the football and
 roadway e n couraging supporters to move on towards the
 ground.         Havi ng swept    large numbers of supporters to tne
 entrances         in this manner.       I took position about 50 yaras
  away from the entrances towards Halifax Road encouraging
  supporters to move off the roadway onto the footpath to
  allow the p assage of vehicular traffic.              Constable Radfor,
  was about 25 yards beyond me engaged in similar duties.


            There was now a steady flow of supporters towards -r.
                                                         f   I       *


   entrances.
        A short          time after taking this position Constable
   Radford and I were called by radio to return to the
   turnstile entrances as the situation was becoming

   difficult        to manage.

               On arrival    I saw large numbers of supporters           inside
    the wrought          iron perimeter gates, there was some crushiw
    but I could see Constable 1300 Grunnill and 1696
    Stanbridge       In the area close to the turnstiles
    endeavouring to control             the supporters entrance to the
     turnstiles.          The situation was being frustrated by more
     supporters flooding into the area.             I positioned myse
     across the left hand perimeter gateway of the terrace
     turnstile entrance to stop the flow.             A large crowd
     quickly g a t h e re d against the horse by those further out.
     All were demanding entry to the turnstiles and some wer<
     making d e t e rmined efforts to pass me. I constantly
         appealed for the supporters to WAIT and BACK OF .
         THOSE INSIDE A CHANCE TO CLEAR THEN YOU MAY GO.

 to beat him out of the way.

          A gap of 8 to 10 feet opened up between myself and
 the back of the crowd olose to the turnstiles.     I c

 to then, also to BACK OFF    rep                    ^     ^
 and even though no pressure was directly
  the back continued to push towards the turnstil                  .


           Similar efforts were made by other mounted officers
   at the other gateways some of the wrought                 iron gates were

On my return I saw a foot cordon had been made.            Close tc
the line I saw Constable Narey remonstrating with a man                i-
front of the foot cordon.            The man threw his hands up
disturbing the horse.       The horses reared slightly catchir.;
the man on his      leg kicking hin to the ground.       A passerby
assisted the man to his feet, he limped over to the brio?:
parapet and punched the stonework.            He made no complaint
or comment      to me.   I took a static position outside the

foot cordon.


         Inspector Hands-Davies and Inspector Wilkinson took
 several      mounted officers   including myself around onto
 Penistone Road to stand by in the event of disorder on tr.-

 p it c h .


         At   the announced abandonment of the game I went with
 Inspector Wilkinson back to Leppings Lane to oversee the
 departure of Liverpool      Supporters.      When the bulK of
 supporters had cleared the ground we commenced to'patroi
 the area.       There were radio calls of disorder but I did
 not see any.       I continued to patrol until      1830 hours when
  the mounted contingent were stood down.

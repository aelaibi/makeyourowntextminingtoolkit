    *M   1. Compensation Claims - Officers of

           The Working Party considered the implications of
           information relating to the announcement on 31st October,
           1996 of the success of the appeal made to the Court of
           Appeal by certain South Yorkshire Police Officers for
           damages for psychological injuries suffered as a result of
           their involvement in the Disaster.

            Resolved that the Working Party -

            (A) places on record its dissatisfaction with the judgement
                of the Court of Appeal in the light of the previous
                ruling by the House of Lords which prevented many
                bereaved families from receiving similar damages for
                psychiatric injury;

            (B) notes and supports the terms of the early day Motion
                made in the House of Commons by Liverpool Members of
                Parliament for an appropriate change in the law which
                would ensure that all members of families who are
                bereaved in Disasters such as Hillsborough are accorded
                equal treatment with members of the emergency services
                and are therefore able to claim appropriate damages for
                psychiatric injury ;

            (C) notes and supports the intention expressed by Eddie
                Loyden M.P. at this meeting, to make representations to
                the Speaker, on behalf of the Liverpool Members of
                Parliament and other supporters of the early day
                Motion, for an adjournment debate in the House of
                Commons on this matter and also his intention if
                possible to seek a ministerial meeting prior to such a
                debate;

i
(D) requests the Committee Clerk on behalf of the Working
    Party, to write to the Prime Minister, the Leader of
    H.M. Opposition and the Leader of the Liberal Democrat
    Party to request their support for the proposal to
    change the law following the decision of the Court of
    Appeal;

(E) requests that a note of the discussion at this   meeting
    be circulated to all Members of Parliament and   other
    interested parties to ensure that the concerns   of
    bereaved families and the City Council in this   matter
    are understood;

(F) requests that the feasibility of the following courses
    of action be further examined, viz:-

     (i) the seeking of the opinion of Counsel as to how
         the law may be amended in order to rectify the
         perceived injustice created by the judgement of
         the Court of Appeal; and

    (ii) the creation of a petition under the auspices of
         the City Council and possibly with the support of
         Liverpool and Everton Football Clubs, which would
         enhance and publicise a potential campaign for the
         amendment of the law; and

(G) requests that a further meeting of the Working Party be
    held as soon as is appropriate to assess the progress
    being made on this issue and also, having particular
    regard to the profile of Hillsborough matters which may
    arise following the screening of the Hillsborough TV
    Programme in December, to examine possible courses of
    action with regard to the other matters of concern
    which have been expressed at this meeting.

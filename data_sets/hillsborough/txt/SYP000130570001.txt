                     SEWELL,              an    Inspector           from Road T r a f f i c , a             representative              from       "D"

                     D i v i s i o n and a             number        of    others      who's         details         I can not         now    rec a l l .

                     The          initial         discussions             were    concerned with matters                       effecting           traffic

                     and          traffic         logistics,          then       those    officers              involved       left.

                     Thereafter                 the   discussions            were      led      by C / S u p t      DUCKENFIELD             who    dealt

                     with          the        overall     strategy and             invited           sector        commanders          to    comment          or

                     raise           any matters            relating         to t h e i r       areas       of     command.          For     my    own    part,

                                                                                                                                  825

I raised a           number         of     issues          effecting          my area        of    responsibility.                       The

Operational           Order         for       the     mat ch w h i c h was           p u b l i s h e d at        this       t im e      was

u s e d as a        basis        for     the       discussion.

During        the    course         of     the m e e t i n g       1 can       not     specifically               recall           any

discussion           taking         place          regarding        the m o v e m e n t        of L i v e r p o o l         fans        from

off    the     "Spion Kop"               to     other       areas       of    the    ground.            That      said,          this        was

not    part      of m y a r e a          of     responsibility and                   so    I would          not       necessarily

have     reason        to    remember              it.      I have       been       told     that       Supt      G R E E N W O O D may

have     raised        this       during           these     discussions             and     I have         no    reason           to d o u b t

that     he w o u l d       have       given         that    it w a s        his    particular             respo ns ib il it y and

knowing        the     problems            that       can a r i s e      in    implementing                the m o v e m e n t          of

fans,     at a n al l            ticket         match,       where       all       tickets        h av e    been       sold and

displacement             from       one       part        of the    ground          to a n o t h e r       can    bring about                 the

authorised           capacities               being        exceeded.




Rd,    Supt      GREENWOOD             was      an    Inspector          under       my     c o m m a n d at      the C u p S em i

Final      between Spurs                 and Wolves.               As    such       he w a s      on d u t y      inside           the

a r o u n d at      the L e p p i n g s         Lane       end when an             incident        involving               a number           of

fans     on the        terraces            took       place     and      the       perimeter         gates        h a d to         be

opened        by h i m      to    relieve            that    situation.              Consequently                he    is     perhaps

more     aware       than        mos t ,      of     the    problems          that     can o c c u r r w i t h             the     movement

of    f ans    causing           authorised               levels    of       capacity        to    be      exceeded.               Again       I

can    not     remember           Supt        GREENWOOD mentioning                     this       incident            at    the

meetings         although           I have           no    reason       to    doubt       that     he m a y       have.

On    14 A p r i l     1989       <140489)            I attended a Sub Sector                        Commanders              briefing

identified           the a r e a s         of      responsibility              to    the     various          commanders,                again

referring          to    the P o l i c e      Order.            At    the    end        of    his       address       he    then

passed       to S u b S e c t o r      Commanders               out    to    their           various       commanders               who

conducted          their       own    briefings            for       their       areas        of    command.

The    following          day    13 A p r i l       1989        <150489)          at     10 a m         <1000),       there         was            a

mass    briefing          in the N o r t h S t a n d             for al l         officers              engaged       on the

operation.              This    was    addressed            by C / S u p t        DUCKENFIELD              re o v e r a l l

c o mmand ,       Supt M U R R A Y     re     ground        control          and        communications                D/Supt           McKAY

re C I D     involvement             and D/Sgt           CHARLESWORTH,                  re    intelligence             as       I have

previously mentioned                   in m y       recollection.                     C/Supt        DUCKENFIELD worked

from a       prepared          briefing         n ote      stressing             t he    importance             of    the       occasion

and    the    need       f o r all     officers            to    behave          in a m a n n e r         which would               reflect

credit       on    the S o u t h      Yorkshire            Police.

Whilst       C/Supt       DUCKENFIELD            dealt          with    the       issues           of    public       order         within

a    crowd    context,          ie t he       use     of    banners,             f lag s ,        climbing       of    fencing,                    in

turn making             reference        to     the      ground        regulations                 and what          was    a n d was

not    permitted.              I do    not      reca l l        him maki ng             a specific           issue         of    crowd

safety       in a d i s t i n c t      and      separate             sense.           However,           the w h o l e      tone              of

the    briefing          was    geared        towards           preventing              disorder          to a l l o w      the

majority          of    the    supporters           to     enjoy a major                 sporting          event       and       I see

the    public          order/public           safety        elements             as     being       intrinsically                linked.

This    was       reinforced          by S u p t      MURRAY          addressing              the       crowd emerg enc y

evacuation             procedures.

As    I have       mentioned          in m y     previous             recollection,                 I have       been       dealing

with    football          matches        in the          South        Yorkshire              Police       area       since       1981

<000081)          and    I have       personally            b r i e f e d at          several           major    matches.                     I

    onsider       that    C/Supt       D U C K E N F I E L D ’S b r i e f i n g s            were       thorough       but

succinct,          dealt       with    the m a i n         principles             and        strategies          involved,                    quite

properly          leaving       the    f in e    detail          of    briefing              to    his    sector       and       sub

sector       commanders.              His     orchestration                 of    the        various       briefing             should

have    left       no    officer       in a n y       doubt          about       what        his/her       responsibilities

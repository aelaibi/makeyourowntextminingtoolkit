Dear Sirs

RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I write to inform you that the Crown Prosecution Service has not yet decided whether
to take over the criminal proceedings instituted against your client by Ann Adlington
on behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

I regret the delay but I can assure you that everything is being done to deal with the
matter as quickly as possible. I anticipate that the decision will be made and
communicated to the relevant parties on or before 18 December 1998.

The reason for the delay is the need to ensure that appropriate consultation takes
place.

Yours faithfully

             Dear Sir

             RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

             I write to inform you that the Crown Prosecution Service has not yet decided whether
             to take over the criminal proceedings instituted your client by Ann Adlington on
             behalf of the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

             I regret the delay but I can assure you that everything is being done to deal with the
             matter as quickly as possible. I anticipate that the decision will be made and
             communicated to the relevant parties on or before 18 December 1998.

             The reason for the delay is the need to ensure that appropriate consultation takes
             place.

             Yours faithfully

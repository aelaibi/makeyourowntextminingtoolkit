There     is no       i n f o r m a t ion as      to w h e n       the     road wa s      c l o s e d by Po l i c e         but

photograph view             shows        a section          to    be     orderly.         It w a s         estimated

3,000 - 4,000             had    built        up a n d    this        f i g u r e was    increasing,            despite

continuous          entry       int o    the    ground.           Around        this     tim e m ore          ho r s e s were

deployed from             the    S o u t h S t a n d area.



At    this     time C h i e f      Superintendent                Duc kenfield and Superintendent

Murray       recollect          that     t h e r e wa s a m p l e        space     on the        terracing           but the

An interesting              feature           is that a r o u n d         this       tim e     there         develops a

problem w i t h        the P o l i c e         Radio Communications                    which           persists        for a

n umber of m i n u t e s .              There       is no       evidence      on the           document           e x a m i n e d to

pinpoint an           exact       time        for    the       fault    in    its     duration              but    comments

made     by o f f i c e r s    at       the    briefings             indicate        it to        be a r o u n d     1430 hours.



T he    stew a r d    on G a t e        B,    on his        ow n     initiative,           opens        this       gate to

release the           pressure           of    the     crowd and a number                    of    fans       enter.        There

is a     conflict        of    the       number        of fans         admitted,           the     figures          p r o vided

are     b e t w e e n 5 0 a n d 500.



Once     into the        enclosure             fans       passed their            tickets          u nder         gates    etc.        to

the     crowd o u t s i d e .

Whilst       it      is     difficult          to    pinpoint          the    times        of this,         it   is    confirmed

           INTRCDOCTICIi

           During discussions with yourself and Chief Superintendent Mole on Monday
           17 April 1989, a means was sought of collating information that was
           available of events occurring at various locations at Hillsborough, so
           that a comparison could be drawn between the activity at the locations
           and an overall view perceived.

           Detective Sergeant Carr suggested, and it was agreed, that an Anacapa
           method known as a case analysis charting be used. This is a method,
           which, by adaptation, the reconstruction of events in a chart form can be
           visually displayed with the use of labels, showing a description of the
           activity, the time (if known) and the source of the information.
           Selected locations were chosen and the information about those locations
           set out cxi the chart reading in chronological order from left to right.
           The intention is that by reading the chart, activity at the various
           locations is provided and can be compared with what is happening
           elsewhere.

            The locations selected are as follows

            Outside Ground     This is the whole area frcm the turnstiles and gates
                               extending into Leppings Lane.

            Gates A - B        These are the gates marked as such, adjacent to the
                               turnstiles behind the West Stand.

            Gate C             This is the gate marked as such, adjacent to the
                               turnstiles behind the West Stand.

            Turnstiles         The turnstiles behind the West Stand;-

            West Stand         The concourse area between the turnstiles/gates
            Enclosure          and the West Stand itself.

            Tunnel             The central tunnel underneath the West Stand linking
                               the West Stand Enclosure and the Terracing.

            Terracing          The standing area within the ground at the Leppings
                               Lane, sometimes referred to as Pens.

            Track Gates        The track gates within the perimeter fence allowing
            1-7                access fran the terracing to the track.

            Track              The track area between the perimeter fencing and the
                               playing area.

to 1600 hours, Saturday 15 April 1989.

SUMMARY OF EVENTS

At 1400 hours, officers at the briefing of the 19.4.89, stated that
ccmmmication became inpossible due to loud interference. This appears
to be a problem that persisted.

Caiments made at the briefing of 19.4.89, indicate that the terracing of
Pens 3 and 4 were filled but not tightly packed. This must however be
considered against views of the same area at 1420 hours which indicate
otherwise.

Photographs taken outside the ground at Leppings Lane between 1407 - 1417
hours show a gradual build up of fans, they are under escort from
Penistone Road and appear orderly.

 xews towards Middlewood Road, at this time, show Leppings Lane thronged
with fans.

Ccrrments irade at the briefing 19.4.89, indicate that around 1415 hours
the searching of fans who came through the turnstile into the enclosure
became impossible because of crowd density. Other information which
shows an influx of fans when Gate B was opened tends to put this
circumstance at a later time and probably. 1430 hours.

At 1417 hours Superintendent Marshall requests the closure of Leppings
Lane. Chief Superintendent Duckenfield xtakes the comment that Leppings
Lane didn't look so bad, then the request was made, traffic was flowing, -
although a bus was having difficulty getting through.
The video sunmary shows at 1420 hours a continuous build up of fans at
turnstiles going through to the West Stand Enclosure. The terraced area
inside the ground is sparse.

At 1425 hours fans are on the pavement but are spilling on to the roadway
and a bus can be seen in Leppings Lane heading towards Penistone Road.
Within the next few minutes seme views shew the crowd occupying the road,
whereas other views show less concentration of fans. There does appear
to be sane restriction of movement to vehicles.

There is no information as to vAien the road was closed by Police but it
appears by 1426 hours vehicular movement vrould be impossible as the crowd
in Leppings Lane (towards Penistone Road) was filling the whole road.

By 1430 hours the pressure begins to increase around Gate B and reports
of a steward at this gate being concerned of the crush developing. There
is heavy, congestion at the iirmediate turnstile area and people are
tightly packed although at this stage one photograph view shows a section
to be orderly. It was estimated 3,000 - 4,000 had built up and this
figure was increasing, despite continuous entry into the ground. Around
this time more horses were deployed fran the South Stand area.

At this time Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent Murray
recollect that there was ample space on the terracing but the two centre
pens were filling up and the West Stand was quite full.

An interesting feature is that around this time there develops a problem
with the Police Radio Ccmnunications which persists for a number of
minutes. There is no evidence on the document examined to pinpoint an
exact time for the fault in its duration but ccnments made by officers at
the briefings indicate it to be around 1430 hours.

The steward on Gate B, on his cwn initiative, opens this gate to release
the pressure of the crowd and a number of fans enter. There is a
conflict of the number of fans admitted, the figures provided are between
50 and 500.

Once into the enclosure fans passed their tickets under gates etc to the
crcwd outside.

According to ccnrnents made at the briefing by Superintendent Marshall
problems also began to develop at Gate C around this time and he was
unable to notify ground control of this due to the problems of Police
Radio Ccrrmunications. Superintendent McKay speaks of "Gate C not being
under the pressure that     " (in the briefing of 16.4.89) and Gate C
opening and closing several times to admit injured persons through. This
is not expanded upon and at the moment indicates a possible area of
conflict. It is possible there is confusion over the identity of the
gates or Superintendent Marshall's comments relate to a later time.

At 1432 hours Gate B is seen to be closed, a fan is climbing the parapet
adjacent to that gate and there is a large number of fans densely packed
at the main gate at Leppings Lane.

Garment 11 made at the briefing of 19.4.89, that after the arrival of the
train contingent the orderly queues were lost and never re-formed. Fans
were entering the ground in an injured and distressed condition. It
appears by examination of the photographs and video that this situation
arose at about 1435 hours.
It appears frcm the video summary that at 1433 hours the scene is calm
but by 1435 hours photographs and the same video summary show fans
climbing the fencing and a densely packed crcwd of at least 3,000 seen
back frcm the turnstile areas in the main road. Officers including
mounted are having apparent difficulty in exercising control. There is
an overspill of 1,000 or more fans away frcm the turnstiles into the
South Stand access road so that there was no opportunity to relieve
pressure mounted at the turnstiles.

The video summary of the situation at 1433 hours to 1435 hours shows
differing accounts of events. This could either be as a result of
viewing different locations at the Leppings Lane area or an escalation of
activity there.

The video sunmary shows there was no opportunity to relieve pressure at
turnstiles at 1440 hours and thereafter fans climing over the parapet and
turnstile wall.

There are, reports emanating frcm the briefing of 19.4.89, that Gate A was
being bounced and looked as if it was going to care off the wall. This
situation subsisted for the next 10 to 15 minutes.



Inspector Delaney in the debrief speaks of disorder in the West Stand
Enclosure and being deployed therein. Hcwever, it is not clear whether
it is at this time he was deployed or later at about 1454 hours when the
situation has escalated further and action is taken by deploying serials
there.

At about 1445 hours Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent
Marshall, Inspector Delaney and Inspector Purdy all speak of the enormous
pressure of fans at Leppings Lane at the turnstiles although Detective
Superintendent McKay indicates Gate C not under pressure. This is
confirmed by Inspector Delaney who speaks of passing through Gate C to go
frcm the West Stand Enclosure to Leppings Lane and observes fans being
crushed. Superintendent Marshall makes carment at the briefing that he
was asked by Inspector Purdy to do sanething to relieve' the pressure at
Lsppings Lane. Whilst it is difficult to pinpoint the tirres of this, it
is confirmed by reference to the Carmand and Control Log that at 1444
hours Superintendent Marshall requests ground control to tannoy for
people not to push at the Leppings Lane entrance indicating disorder at
this time.

The briefing notes shew confirmation of this frcm officers present.
In the briefing notes Superintendent Marshall makes reference to going
into the crcw3 and asking people to stop pushing.

There is an indication that a request was made to open Gate C in order to
relieve the pressure not at Gate C but at the turnstile area. It is not
knewn if this message ws received by Ground Control. Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield makes catinent at the briefing that he was
aware Superintendent Marshall had requested the gate to be opened but it
is not known if it was at this time or later when a second request was
made.

           Whilst there were problems outside the ground it appears by reference to
           the briefing notes that there was space at either end of the terrace and
           there were no apparent problems inside the ground.

           Photographs taken at 1446 hours shew that Pens 3 and 4 of the terracing
           are packed with fans to the rear but the front of the terracing is
           reasonably loose. Fans are seen to be climbing above others around them
           at the rear. The situation is calm and Track Gate 4 is closed.

           At 1448 hours the video summary shows that Gate C is opened and fans are
           moving frcm the service area through this gate and into the West Stand
           Enclosure. It is not known whether it was opened as a result of pressure
           frcm fans or in response to Superintendent Marshall's 'earlier request, or
           otherwise.

           Mounted officers are seen to control the influx and force the crowd back
           towards the proper side of the turnstiles. There is a relaxation of
^          pressure in the service area and the gate is closed.

(Page 5)   Photographs at 1450 hours shew Gate C closed.

           At 1450 hours, according to the video summary, large numbers of
Whilst there were problems outside the ground it appears by reference to
the briefing notes that there was space at either end of the terrace and
there were no apparent problems inside the ground.

Photographs taken at 1446 hours show that Pens 3 and 4 of the terracing
are packed with fans to the rear but the front of the terracing is
reasonably loose. Fans are seen to be climbing above others around them
at the rear. The situation is calm and Track Gate 4 is closed.

At 1448 hours the video summary shews that Gate C is opened and fans are
moving frcm the service area through this gate and into the West Stand
Enclosure. It is not known whether it was opened as a result of pressure
frcm fans or in response to Superintendent Marshall's earlier request, or
otherwise.

Mounted officers are seen to control the influx and force the crowd back
towards the proper side of the turnstiles. There is a relaxation of
pressure in the service area and the gate is closed.

Photographs at 1450 hours show Gate C closed.

At 1450 hours, according to the video summary, large numbers of
spectators are converging at the turnstile area from Penistone Road and
Middlewood Road areas. Estimate of numbers amassed outside turnstiles
are put at 3/4 thousand and a fairly large section of the crowd are
spilling down the service road and up against Gate C. However,
photographs at the same time (MWL 15) show no pressure of fans against
Gate C but do show a very large crowd, severe congestion at turnstile
area with fans climbing the walls and barriers. Mounted officers are
within the crowd trying to exercise control.

In the briefing notes Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent
Marshall speak of an acute situation and opening gates to relieve
pressure fearing loss of life. Consideration was given to delaying the
kick-off because of the situation outside, but whilst such consideration
was being made the players came on to the pitch. Chief Inspector Creaser
also refers to consideration of the delay in the start of the game in
that he made such a request by use of the Police Land Rover radio. Gate
C is seen as closed at 1451 hours (photo MtfL15) with the pressure in
front of the turnstiles maintained. There are photographs to suggest no
movement of fans at the turnstiles in the section of the crowd being
viewed.

In addition, comments are made by officers in the briefing of 19.4.89,
that turnstile G is distorted and became inoperable and fans were stuck
in a turnstile for some time.   Ccnments made by officers at other
briefings also show severe problems at the turnstiles, including non
ticket holders present, unlawful entry and attempted corruption. Fans
were also resisting attempts by Police to rescue them from the crush at
the turnstiles for fear of losing their place in the 'queue'. Police
were also trying to reach the ones who were there bartering with the
turnstile operator. In an attempt to relieve the situation at the
turnstile the operators were asked by Police to allow fans through
quicker by retaining pressure an the release pedal.
At 1452 hoars Gate C is opened (unknown by vfricm) with spectators moving
through in large numbers. Inspector Sykes easements at the briefing that
at the second opening of Gate C, Gates A and B were opened. This may
well be the occasion referred to. Inspector Delaney also mentions Gate B
being opened, as does Police Sergeant Burns, although they cannot be
specific about the time, this could be the occasion referred to. Police
Sergeant Burns specifically mentions Gate B being opened by two uniformed
officers.

At this tine in excess of 20 fans can be seen on top of one section of
the fencing and at the outer boundary gates are mounted officers,
apparently attempting to control the crowd. Huge numbers of spectators
are seen in Leppings Lane and fans in very large numbers move downinto
the service road and through Gate C. Mention is made by Chief
Superintendent Duckenfield at the briefing of fans harassing a horse and
a rider having difficulty in Leppings Lane, and in fact carment is made
in the briefing of 19.4.89 that at sane time a horse was lifted bodily by
the crcwd. Fans were forcing their way between horses legs and ignoring
Police's directions. The video summary shews mounted officers attempting
to maintain control but soon overvAielmed by the numbers who walk through
Gate C. Movement of the crowd, then accelerates frcm walking towards and
through Gate C to running towards it. Once through, the crcwd (according
to the video sunmary) is quite orderly and leisurely in terms of movement
to spectator areas.

At 1454 hours the turnstile area is still severely congested and surging,
with fans climbing the wall and huge numbers before the perimeter gates.
A Police Inspector or Chief Inspector can be seen on the turnstile roof
using his radio. This may be Inspector Bennett as outlined by
Superintendent Marshall in the briefing, who was asking for additional
serials because he could see the problem. His view was that the crowd
was tightly packed, no one could move and people were being crushed.

Officers do make reference to occurrences at the tine Inspector Bennett
was on the turnstile roof. There is one occasion when Inspector Bennett
was seen on the roof (video summary) and this is timed at 1454. This
time has been taken as the only time he did so, therefore, the tine of
the occurrences connected by offices to this. If Inspector Bennett
climbed the roof on more than one occasion then adjustments will need to
be made.

At 1455 hours the situation does not change. Fans still stream through
Gate C, scaling the walls and entering through the turnstiles and gates
in their thousands, making their way towards the tunnel area. People can
be seen at a gap in the wall dividing the enclosure.

Mention is made at the briefing of 19.4.89 of hundreds entering through
Gate A releasing the pressure at the turnstiles. Officers at that gate
were faced with a severe situation. As described earlier the gate was
being bounced and looked as if it was going to ccme off the wall.
Sergeant Higgins reported that if the gate isn't opened there is going to
be serious injuries and possible "loss of life”. The reply he received
was "if that is the case cpen the gate". The gate was opened.
1456 hours shows a similar scene although the crowd in the service road
is much smaller with mounted officers across it. The boundary gates
appear closed holding possibly 1,000 fans in Leppings Lane (yet to
enter).

1457 hours again shews a similar scene with the West Stand Enclosure
densely packed and the crowd almost universally moving towards the tunnel
entrance. It would appear that Gates B and C are open.

At 1458 hours the area around the Police barriers (near the service road)
is reasonably clear with no pressure of fans. The gate there is open
(photo JWL 11), ie Gate C.

The video summary at 1459 hours shows both the northern and southern end
of Leppings lane terraces with space available there. At the same time
(1459 hours) fans are seen approaching Track Gate 1 from the north
direction and filing through Gate 1 into the terraces.

At 1500 hours outside the ground the Police barrier has been advanced
towards Leppings lane past Gate C and entrance through that gate has now
stopped. Although the crowd outside has greatly reduced, large numbers
are approaching and moving through the turnstiles and climbing the
surrounding wall.

It does appear that in the preceding few minutes large numbers of fans
(possibly 2,000 to 3,000) have been admitted to the ground. Detective
Superintendent McKay, who was positioned outside the ground adjacent to
Gate C speaks of a cheer inside the ground whilst fans were flowing
through the gates which added an urgency for the fans. It may be that
the occasion Detective Superintendent McKay is speaking of is this
occasion, although it could well have been another occasion such as the
players appearing on the pitch at about 1450 hours or sate other
incident. Detective Superintendent McKay also mentions that in a period
of 20 minutes Gate C was cpened on a number of occasions.

Inside the ground at 1500 hours there are a number of occurrences
including a crowd surge, track gates in the open position, climbing by
fans of fences between Pens 2 and 3 and the perimeter fencing, fans on
the track area and both Police and St John's Ambulance personnel in
attendance at what appear to be Track Gate 4. Fans are still being
admitted to Track Gate 1. Evidence of the surge is from two sources, ie
ocmments by Inspector Bullas at the briefing (CCB 16.4.89) who says "At
kick-off consolidated push to the front, people screaming at front".
Mr Bullas adds at the briefing of 19.4.89 that the surge, which did not
cane back, coincided with a roar from the crowd. It is assumed that
kick-off was at 1500 hours. The video surrmary shows that fans at the
barrier between Pens 2 and 3 appear to be surging at the rear, but it is
described as a minor situation. Photograph album DB17 shows Police
Officers and St John's Ambulance personnel at the track gates.

There was space in Pens 1 and 2 and at 1501 hours fans are still passing
from the track area into these pens.
At 1502 hours the pressure of fans at the turnstiles is new reduced but
once through appear to be running towards the tunnel entrance.
Photographs show fans in the tunnel at the terrace end looking towards
the pitch although Superintendent Greenwood at the subsequent briefing
made the cament that the tunnel at the back of the terracing did not
appear to be full at about this time.

On the terracing the crcwd is packed at the area of the tunnel with same
fans standing on the rear walls and fencing. The fans in Pen 3 are
pressed solidly against the perimeter fence and appear unable to move.
There is obvious severe pressure on them, seme fans are seen climbing
between Pens 2 and 3. Fans are continuing to climb the perimeter fence
oat of the pen. Track Gate 3 is open and fans are on the track area
behind the goal. Police Officers are hurrying to the scene and fans are
now seen to be climbing on the outside of the perimeter fence and
reaching over to the fans inside Pen 3.

There is no information of any activity (if any) outside the ground,
other than the pressure has been reduced at the turnstiles.

At 1503 hours fans appear to be panicking, and large numbers are scaling
the perimeter fence. Sane are climbing fran Pen 4 into Pen 5 and fans at
the front are solidly pressed against the perimeter fence in the same
position as in the previous minute.

Photographs shew there is space available on the north side of the
terracing. Track gates 1 to 5 are all open and fans are still entering
the terracing through Gates 1 and 2.

The track area shews an increasing number of fans and Police there, with
fans obviously injured and reoeiving attention. First Aid personnel are
also in attendance.

At the briefing Inspector Bullas mentions that upon witnessing the surge
he took officers to the tunnel and found it packed with fans. He tried
to drag the fans back and later assisted with passing dead people back.
It is not clear fran where the dead people were recovered fran. The
times of these events are not clear, but the earliest tine when Police
Officers are seen at the end of the tunnel at the terracing by photograph
is 1512 hours (PR3).

At 1504 hours photographs show Gate 6 open with fans being shepherded
into the north side of the terracing. There are increasing numbers of
fans on the track and grass area adjacent to the pitch, sate being
treated.

At 1505 hours fans are seen scaling the railings between Pens 2 and 3,
track Gate 2 is closed but there is a steward in attendance, numbers of
people on the track are increasing and encroaching on to the pitch and
advertising hoardings behind the goal laid face down.

Play is stopped by Superintendent Greenwood's approach to the referee.
Track Gate 2 is open at 1506 hours as are Gates 3 and 4. A view is shown
of a victim being carried by fans to St John's personnel at the track
side (north). On the track area the number of fans and Police are
increasing.
At 1507 hours it can be seen there is extreme pressure at the front of
Pens 3 and A, fans showing facial expression of distress. At the rear of
the terracing fans are being lifted into the West Stand. Hie track gate
towards the South Stand is cpen and Police are helping fans out.

There is increasing activity on the track area in that fans are stood and
laid in varying positions. At this time (1507 hours) Ground Control
requests Operation Support.

At 1508 hours fans continue to be pulled fran the terracing to the West
Stand and there is increasing activity on the track. Both fans and
Police are at the perimeter fencing.

At this time (1508 hours) Ground Control requests a fleet of ambulances.

At 1509 hours there is still extreme pressure at the front of Pens 3 and
4. Fans are tightly packed at the rear and there appears to be little
movement in the crowd.

At 1510 hours there is still tremendous pressure cn fans at the front of
the terraces and photographs indicate one or more may be dead. At the
rear of the terraces at the entrance to the tunnel it is tightly packed
with little movement to the tunnel. Fans are still being lifted into the
West Stand.

At 1512 hours Police Officers are new moving into the crcwd, sate are at
the end of the tunnel where it meets the terracing, others are in Pen 2
assisting fans fran Pen 3 into Pen 2. The number of fans and Police at
the track side increases and a stretcher with two ambulance personnel
arrives there and subsequently tends to a fan.

Fran 1514 hours Police are now inside Pen 2 and 3 directing their
attention to the fans in Pen 3. The pressure in Pen 3 appears to be
easing. Makeshift stretchers can be seen laid out on the playing area.

By 1515 hours pressure at the front of Pen 3 has now gone but the crowd
is still tightly packed. The front of Pen 4 is still tightly packed,
although pressure is easing at the centre and rear of this pen. More
Police can be seen in Pen 3.

With the time at 1516 hours an ambulance (believed St Johns) is seen
arriving at the track side and greater numbers of fans and Police are
seen at the track side and pitch.

At 1517 hours the Ccrrmand and Control log shows the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital being put cn standby for a large number of casualties and at
1518 hours Ground Control requests Casualty Bureau to be set up at both
hospitals.

Viewing the terracing at 1519 hours a line of Police can be seen frcm the
tunnel entrance down the terracing steps in Pen 3 where the congestion is
easing. Pen 4 is still tightly packed.

It may be that this is the time that gave opportunity to pass the dead
people back towards the tunnel entrance.
Police Sergeant Morgan in the briefing of 19.4.89 states that bodies vrere
not found in the tunnel but that casualties were evacuated via it. It
appears that Police and fans at the rear ware unaware of the situation at
the front.
A further stretcher arrives with two ambulance personnel and is seen
crossing the centre of the playing area.

Hie Command and Control Log indicates cutting equipment to scene and the
Northern General Hospital informed to expect casualties.

 At 1520 hours make-shift stretchers are used to carry victims. Police
 and fans are on the fencing assisting those inside. The Camand and
 Control log indicates the ambulance service forewarning Rotherham and
•Barnsley Hospitals of casualties.

Fran 1521 hours climbing of the fencing ceases and at 1523 hours the
pressure in Pens 3 and 4 has gone. The perimeter fencing of Pen 4 can be
seen to be cut and ripped open. The general scene fran this time
continues with victims being carried away on makeshift stretchers.

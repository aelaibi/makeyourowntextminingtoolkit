We had understood that the Health Authority was not going to make a charge for
supplying copies of notes, X-rays etc in cases involving victims of the Hillsborough
Disaster but it appears our understanding was incorrect.

Please reg&rd this letter as confirmation that we will pay your copying/
production charge upon receipt of an invoice and the copy documents.

We further confirm that no legal action is contemplated against Sheffield
Health Authority.

       Dear

       At the time of the Hillsborough disaster on the 15th April,
       and shortly thereafter, you were very helpful to my staff
       in providing names and details in connection with those who
       received serious injuries that required treatment at your
       hospital, and for that we were extremely grateful.

      I have now completed the first stage of the exercise in that
      a distribution has now been made from the Fund to the bereaved
      families and those who received serious injuries, and am now
      embarking upon the second phase of dealing with some 700____ -
      casualty claims.  As I discussed with your deputy,)
      earlier today, one of the major tasks facing me is to undertake
      a verification of the claims that I have received, in order to
      obtain categorical evidence that the claimant was in fact at
      Hillsborough during the disaster.  For that purpose I am
      including any person who received treatment in a hospital at
      Sheffield as a valid claimant.  I understand that you may have,
      in addition to the names of the serious injuries that you have
      already given to us, the names of short stay patients, and those
      who received out-patient treatment arising from the Hillsborough
      Disaster.

      It would greatly assist my verification process if you could
      make this list available to me.  Once again your kind
      co-operation would be very much appreciated.

      Yours    -grmrserelv.________ ___

        Dear Sir,

            In order to assist them in determining payments from the
        Fund, the Trustees have appointed a medical panel led by Dr.
        John Evans to assess the injuries of those who suffered in the
        Hillsborough disaster. In most,cases, we have been able to
        approach the General Practitioners who have been attending to
        their injured patients.  However, there are a small number who
        do not appear to have consulted them following hospital
        treatment and it is necessary for us, therefore, to make an
        approach to the Hospital for information.

            In the circumstances we are submitting a request for
       medical information for the undermentioned person who was
       injured at Hillsborough and recieved treatment at your hospital
       on the date indicated.

                                     (Northern General)                     Ref:
                                       15.4.89.
       Towerhill,
       Kirkby,
       Merseyside.

                 This patient has authorised me to approach you for
       the release of medical records to the Trustees' Medical
       Assessor and I enclose a copy of the Consent Form.

            Dr. Evans has asked if the appropriate consultant at your
       hospital would be willing to send him, in the first instance, a
       letter setting out, in addition to the details of name, date of
       birth and address, the injuries that were sustained and
       treatment that was given.  If it were possible also to indicate
       the effects of the experience both physically and
       psychologically and their likely duration and effect upon the
       patient's  working capacity and social life, and any other
       information relevant to the particular incident, this would
       clearly also be extremely helpful.

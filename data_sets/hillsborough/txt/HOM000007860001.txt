    ”                 HILLSBOROUGH s COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

                      1.   I have now been informed that, following the meeting on which
                      I reported in my submission of 18 May, the Clerk to the South
                      Yorkshire Police Authority has spoken to his Chairman, Sir Jack
                      Layden, and as a result the authority would like an early me&ing
                      with Ministers.   A letter formally conveying this request will
                      arrive shortly.

                      2.   I recommend that Lord Ferrers sees them and, if this is
                      agreed, would be grateful if Ms Adams would get in touch direct
                      with the clerk (telephone number 0226 285996) about dates.

                      3.   I mentioned in paragraph 8 of my note of      18 May my feeling
                      that we needed to make an early approach to        the Treasury.   I
                      understand that Finance and Manpower now have      this in hand.   I
                      suggest that the meeting with South Yorkshire      is arranged for a



                      to satisfy the West Midlands on 25 May but separate briefing for
                      that meeting is in hand).

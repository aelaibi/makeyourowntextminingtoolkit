      Dear Sirs,                             ,

      Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


      If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
      of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom y o u represent,
      on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
      due course.

      I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
      evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
      coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
      inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

      Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
      under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
      witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
      this and in determining who I wish to inv.ite to attend.

      Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
      to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
      appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
      consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

      May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
      attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

      I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
      names for consideration is nothing more than    that, and that   thedecision as
      to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

      I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
      heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

Dear          Sira,                                  /

Re:         CARL DAVID LEVIS (deceased) Ho.85.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

             I refer to              my letter of H003 and your letter of 11th August 1989.

             I enclose a letter reference SLP/JT/H/PM/001 which deals with the
             questions of the release of the post mortem report to you.  On that
             basis I enclose the post mortem report.  If you cannot accept it on
             these terms please return it unused.  The fee as well as the Payee
             is set out at the foot of that letter.

             Please let              me have the information requested in my letter reference H00 3.




             Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

You .will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
in fact put in as evidence.

However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem .
report of your client(s).

The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

        a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

        b.      They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
                legitimate purposes in conneccfcion with' any legal proceedings
                in which solicitors may be engaged.

        c.      Subject to tha"a]23!!£§f they are to be kept confidential until
                they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is ^5p    per sheet (total £ 1.lOp )
Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

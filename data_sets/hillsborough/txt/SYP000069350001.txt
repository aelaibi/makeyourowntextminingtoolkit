transmissions                  began     to      be     shouted          in a n      agitated            manner       and    on       several

occasions             o ve r     a five       minute          period       I heard           the        phrase    "Open          the

gate".              This    phrase       was       repeated          at    least        six      times      and       on    each

occasion             there       seemed       to      be     mo re u r g e n c y       in     the v o i c e      of    the       person

originated.                 At    this      stag e ,         however,          there       was         nothing    to       suggest             t hat

there          was    anything          other         than a        busy       sporting          event      taking          place.

Since          our    pre-match          duties            were     complete,           I ordered           the       driver          to       make

r e a s o n whi ch w a s           as    yet        unknown        to     us.

As    I went       to    the       rear        of    t h e X i e s t S t a n d , I p a s s e d a n a m b u l a n c e whi ch

was     parked        on the        riverside               roadway which               runs       round       towards             the    South

Stand.          Several         i nj u r e d        peo^Xe        we re      be i ng a t t e n d e d         to at       the       rear       of

the a m b u l a n c e        and    as     l\ a ^ r o d e      o ve r     one     pe r s o n ,     I noti ced            that       he w a s

receiving          oxygen and              t ha t      he w a s      blue       in the        face.

Inspector          MILLETT          said,           "It     looks       as     though        h e 's a g o n n e r . “

This     person was             receiving             a t t e n t i o n at        the       time    and       our    assistance                was

not     required         there.            With        hindsight             I now      realised             that    that          person

was     already         dead.

As w e       a r r i v e d at      the     rear        of    the W e s t        Stand        near       to    the    entrance             to

the     tunnel,         it    became           c 1 ear      to me       that      it w a s        impossible             to    clear          the

area     be c a u s e    there          we re       too m a n y      injured           people       on       the    g round.

We w o u 1d h a v e          been       driving           uninjured            people        over       the    top       of    people          who

were     apparently             seriously              injured.

The     s i t u a t i o n at       this        stage        was    confused.                For    some       reason as             yet

unknown         to me        the    fans w ere              approaching              Police        Officers          and       saying

situation when                I turned              round and           sa w    that        the    head       of    one       of    the

injured         had     been       covered           over      and      he     had     been       left       u na tt en de d and

quite        apparently             dead.            This     was       the     first        time       that       I knew      that

someone         had     been        killed and from                  that        point       on    it    became          apparent             t hat

    faced         by m a n y O f f i c e r s      at    that       location.

    The      area was           eventually            littered with              probably         about        f ifteen ibodies,

            Further to the two recollections which I have previously made regarding

            the 1988 and 1989 FA Cup Semi-final football matches played at the

            Hillsborough Stadium - I do not recall the gates to the tunnel at the

            Stadium being closed, nor was I informed at any time that the gates had

            been closed by any person.

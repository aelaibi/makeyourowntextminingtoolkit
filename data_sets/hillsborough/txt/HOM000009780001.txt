HILLSBOROUGH

All other considerations aside, this is just a private note of
appreciation to you and Sgt Booth for your unstinting efforts to
provide me and colleagues here with timely and helpful information
over the last few days. Just to assure you, I was able to pass the
information on stewards and gatekeepers to the Home Secretary
moments before he rose to make his statement on Monday. Thank you.

Quite separately from profound sympathy for the bereaved and
injured in this dreadful tragedy, might I express what few
sentiments I readily can      for the anguish South Yorkshire
Police officers must themselves be experiencing.  Few words, but
with deep respect - I am sure that goes for all my colleagues too.

I should be grateful if you could pass my regards also to
Mr Jackson.  He can rest assured our Greek delegation had a
worthwhile visit despite many last minute alterations to their
agenda. May I also convey their very sincere sympathies to all
concerned.

   Dear Sir,

             Interim Report of the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster


       The County Council's Safety of Sports Grounds Sub-Committee have considered
   the Interim Report by The Rt Hon Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough
   Stadium Disaster with a view to considering the findings in relation to Norwich
   City Football Ground. They were concerned to note that there was no mention in
   the interim report of crush barriers and they have asked me to write to request
   that the design of crush barriers be fully investigated during the course of the
   inquiry so that recommendations can be made to Authorities responsible for
   safety at sports grounds.   Can you please draw the Sub-Committees comments to
   the attention of The Rt. Hon Lord Justice Taylor.

                                          Yours faithfully,


                                                          cc.-bk

        Dear Mr.. Jones::
              13y way of introduction,     I ain                      lvL D. ,
        Assistant     Professor of Surgery at                              in
                     and am Clinical Director of the Emergency Department
        at ______________________ Hospital.      I am p resen 11y visiting
        Birmingham for one month to study automobile crashes at the
        University of Birmingham’s Accident Research Unit.
              I arrived Tuesday and heard of the unfortunate incident that
        occured at the football match.      After noting that both you and
        Lord    Taylor are investigating the incident,  I decided to write
        this letter to offer any help that I can while I am here.

        ________________________________ | In the course of doing so,        we
         developed a template that   evaluates the structure,    process, and
         outcome of stadium safety   and spectator care.    I realize that
          much of the world of American football may not apply here,      but I
         thought you might find such a template useful,          as well as
         reflecting current thinking Stateside.
              I will be here untilMay 1.1 or 1.2.    I hope that you or your
         designee may find some time to chat at length before 1 gg„___1
         look forward to hearing from you.       The number here is

              Thank you for my copy of your letter to John Morris of 9 February. I have not, of course,
        seen Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report; the following remarks are based on the comprehensive
        summary in your letter.

                The questions in respect o f the publication of the DPP’s advice in 1990 and 1997, and the
        lack of justification for fresh criminal investigations, are o f course for John, but if he is content, I
        would be too.

                More generally, I agree with your conclusions on Lord Justice Stuart-Stnith’s work.
        Though it will undoubtedly be disappointing for the family support group, I support the proposition
        that the Government response should make clear that there are no grounds for a further public
        inquiry, nor for farther investigations into ’the police conduct in respect of the amendment of
        statements. I also agree with your comments about the later evidence on the state of the ground,
        though that is not primarily a matter for me.

               The final point concerns the relationship between judicial enquiries into major disasters and
       coroners’ inquests into the resultant deaths. The recommendations o f the Home Office working
       group are in my view entirely sound. Where it is possible to certify that a properly-constituted
       judicial inquiry would examine all the necessary issues, it merely prolongs and exacerbates the
   • f distress o f bereaved relatives to have to contemplate the prospect of a coroner’s inquest as well. I
y. 11 therefore agree with the proposal to accept the working group’s recommendations in principle,
   ‘ recognising that the necessary primary legislation may have to wait for a suitable opportunity.




                                                                   1

           It follows that I am content with your proposals for handling the issues before Parliament
    next week.

          I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, the Attorney General, the President of the
   Council, the Director o f Public Prosecutions, and to Sir Richard Wilson.


                                                 Yours

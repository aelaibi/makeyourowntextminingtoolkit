                   I am a single            person    residing at the above address.

                  The        ticket was      for   the j/eppings Lane              standing a r e a and           cost me six

We trave              to Shef t x e j.d m              car.      We    left R un co rn at about

eleven o'clock          (1100)     and tr av el le d straight           to S h e f f i e l d without

m aking any stops            I can't     remember w hi ch way we went,                but there w e r e n ’t

any delays.

We   parked the        car    in a side     street which was            only about a hundred

yards a way from the ground.                 I can't      remember       the name of the street.

Ha vi ng     left the     car,    we had a walk ar ou nd for about                  fifteen minutes

looking at shops a n d getting               s o me th in g    to eat.       We then wa lk ed Jdfp a

hill and found a pyb that was open.                      The     pub was       call       t h § / H o r s e and

Jo c ke y a nd we / t o p p e d    in there for about            fifteen minutes and had a

drink.        It >5as quite       busy    in the    pub w ith both         locals and other

Li verpogl      fans.

A fV & r leaving the pub we w alked back to the car where we had                                     a packed

lunch.       After     eating     our    packed    lunch we started walking                 towards        the

ground,      at about        two o'clock      (1400).

There were a lot of other fans ma ki ng                       their way towards           the      ground.

They all      s eemed     in good spirits.            I didn't        see any fighting or a ny

other      sort of disorder.             I saw a few P o l i c e m e n onjjfae way to the

g ro un d but not as m any as there were                  las W e a r      at the      same match.           I

turnstiles,          there was     h ardly a n y b o d y going        into the ground at             that

    courtyard a rea behind.             There w e r e n ’t an y moun te d P o l i c e m e n there at

    that    time.     We    were able        to walk    straight         to    ^ ^ u r n s t i 1e and enter

    the ground.        I    saw about five or          s ^k    stewards         outside     the g r o u n d .      I

    could see that          they were stewards            beaaithey             were wearing            bright

    c oloured bibs.         The     stewards were         standing aro un d m i n g 1 ing with the

    Police.     I d i d n ’t see any u na ut h o r i s e d entry              into the ground,            I handed

    my ticket       in to the turnstile             operator as         I entered the ground                  an d I

    was    given the stub          portion back.

    Having    e ntered the         ground we       saw the      cental        t u n n e 1 that    runs

    u nd e r n e a t h the West Stand.         As you         lo'Bk. down the tunnel             you    can see

    the goals       so we decided to go davpft the                   tunnel a nd get a place              behind

    the goals.        I used that       tunnel       las^year          and watc he d the match from
/
    behind the g o a l s .         I don't    ren^ffiber seeing any signs giving                       d i r e c t i o ns

    to the t e r r a c i n g , so\we asha m e d that            the tunnel        was    the best way to

    the    terraces.        There            a number         of other    people        inside the ground

    and    it seemed to be filling up slowly.                         I did     not see an y fighting              or

    any disorder       inside       the ground and            I did not see any           people       drinking

    or a ny drunkeness.

    We w a l k e d along     the    tunnel    quite     freely there were only a few other

    people    using    the tunnel.           I d i d n ’t see any P o l i c e m e n or stewards at

    the entrance       to the       tunnel    or    inside      it.     At the end of the tunnel                   we

    went    to the    right hand side and entered what                        I now know as            pen number

    three.     We entered the          pen at some            time    between giu ifif i" ’
                                                                                          T'SHTt and

    twenty    past two       (        1420).

    T he re were     quite a few       people       in pen three.             There were a lot standing

    towards    the    rear of the       pen and both sides               near the the fences.                   The

    m id dl e of the       pen was    quite empty.             We walked down the terraces                    quite

    easily.     We went          down the    left hand side            of the     pen and took up a
                                                                                                        P AlaE     1
                                                                                                        S3512

p osition behind the              crush barrier at the                front of the       pen,     the one

nearest        the g o a l .     We took up this             position at about t wenty - p a s t             two

(1420)       and we      intended to watch the m at ch from there.                        I have marked

this     position on the separate                    grid    plan using       the figure       one.

After about            ten minutes       in that       position the          pen seemed to be filling

up very q uickly and there was a push forwards                                from behind.         It wasn't

a big      push,       just    the normal       thing       that you get       in football        crowds.

The    push forwards            put us    right up agai ns t           the    barrier.        We d i d n ’t want

to be pinned up against                  that barrier,          so            and    I decided to slide

under the barrier an d get a position                          nearer    the front.                   said that

he was going            to move    back up the          pen and he       left us.        I think      he went

towards        the     centre    of the       pen,    but    I *m not sure      because       I lost sight



         and myself           slid unde rn ea th the barrier and went                   down another

three or four            steps,    towards       the front       of the       pen.     We were about

seven or eight            feet awa y from the front                  fence and we decided to try

and stay there            to w a tc h the match.              I have marked          this second

p osition on the grid              plan using          the figure       1A.     It was    fairly       packed

in the second            position,       but no worse          than any       crowd    I ’ve stood      in

before.         We were a ble       to    look at our          programmes and talk^&bout                the

m at c h . W h i l e   still    in the second          position,       I remernbej/look i ng at          the

digital        clock by the Police              box.        It was    quarte&no        three    (1445).

Ver y s hortly after             this,    there was a strong j^ish j^-forn b e h i n d .                The

push     car r ied me f orwards           in a straight          1 infs a/ra the next          I knew    I was

pinned up against               the mesh       in thar fron             imeter       fence.     I w a s n ’t

concerned at that               point,    1                      push was       caused by fans

a rr iv in g     late and that       the'rrowd w o ul d          push back shortly after.                    I

d o n ’t know what happe ne d to                        after    that    push.        As the minutes went

by,    there was         no    push backwards          just    severe    pressure       from behind,

trapping me            right against          the wire mesh.           I had rny face against            the

                    mes h and was         looking    straight     out onto     the      pitch.     I was able       to    put
                *
                    my m o ut h through the mesh and draw breath from outside                             the    pen.     I

                    c o u l d n ’t move at all.        I saw the         players   come onto the          pitch and

                    w a t c h e d them war m up.       I saw the game         kick      off*    but after       that all       I

                    could see we re legs            running a ro u n d the     pitch.

                    By now there were             screams and groans.          8 0 ms    people were       crying.

                    People were          shouting    to the Police         to “open the gate" and               “ let us out,

                    let us o u t . ”       It was    shor tly after        the game started that            people

                    started     climbing      out of the       pen over      the front         perimeter    fence.        They

                    were    climbing       over    other   people to get out.             As soon as they dropped

                    onto the track outside             the    pen,    they were moving           onto the       pitchy

                    s houting    for the                       stopped.

                    a nd   I couldn't see if it was open or not.          In a short space of time,

                    there were a lot of             people on the         pitch by the goal.             I was still

                    pinned up against             the mesh and       could see     people       collapsed on the

                    pitch.      Some      had blue    faces.      I c a n ’t describe any,          there were          just so

                    Apart    from not being able             to move,      it would have been            impossible       to

                    get over     the top      part of the fence            from where      I was.        It must have

                    been about       fifteen or twenty minutes               before Jthere was an ease              in the

minu te s       earlier and        told her to get her rnoiuth through the mesh to get

some air.           This    she had done and she was now back with me.                            We had to

step over          dead bodies      on the terracing           to get back to the             tunnel.

T here was         so m any that you        couldn't a void them.              I c a n ’t describe any

of the bodies,             all   I can really      remember      was    the blue faces

and    1 went       back thro ug h the tunnel          and     into the       courtyard area behind

where     there were a lot of              injured    people     laid out.           There were

a m b ul an ce s    outside and St Johns a m b u la nc e           people.          1 1-hi nk we    left    the

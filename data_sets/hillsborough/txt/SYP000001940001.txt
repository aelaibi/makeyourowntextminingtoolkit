Once     I        got into          this           p o s ition           near          to    the       back         1 mana g e d              to stay

there?        but        1 coula              still           see      the            people       over         to my          right          steadily

movi ng forward;,                   like a slow                      flowing                river        but wit h a strong                         current,,

By     this       time        the     ^ame             had       started               and    1    could            see       peo p 1e        trying        to

climb        up       over      the       fence             at     the       front.               It    was         bedlam          in    the          and

people        were           shouting.                  At       first           I     thought           it     was       trouble             and     it

wasn't        for       a      couple             of    minutes              I        realised           it     was       something             serious

because           I    saw     a    p o 1 i c e ina n            a <>J ix X B — p i t c h         ta 1k i ng         to       the      referee         arid      1    saw

another           talking           to        N   i q e l^gtTOUG H               an d       they       were         pointing             back       toward

the     crowd.               I was        still             stood        in the              same        place and              there were                 so

m any    things              going        on o y            then       it was               difficult               to    recall          everything,,

1 just        remember              seeing              p o licemen                   helping          people            over       the       fence ana

people        being            carried             out       on boards.                      1 saw          people            on the          pitch with

covers        over           their        faces,              but the                 one    that        sticks           in my mind was                    see a

When     I nad got                 to my           position              in the              pen       I managed               to stay          there           all

the     time          throughout                  the disaster,                         I wa l k e d          forward after                    a while

this     time all               the       bodies              had      been            cleared away,,                     1 s tayed in the                      pen

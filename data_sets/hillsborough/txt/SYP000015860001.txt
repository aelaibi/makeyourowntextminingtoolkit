Dear M r . Robinson,

     I was at Hillsborough on Saturday with ________________and
was present outside the Lepping Road gate when all the trouble
started.   I was probably also the first medical attendant on the
pitch.   I have written a letter to the South Yorkshire Coroner
with my comments, in particular my concern that the turnstile at
the Leppings Lane end appeared to be closed for the 15 minutes
leading up to the gate opening at around 3 pm.     This does not
seem to have come out in the media, and it was consequent on this
that the pressure built up at the turnstiles resulting in the
necessity of opening the gate with the resulting surge into the


     I would be happy to give evidence at any enquiry that is
made, both as a fan and a medical attendant. I also enclose a
cheque for your disaster f u n d . ^            — -— :"V. ■—

                              Dear Sir,

                                   I was present at the F.A. Cup Semi-final on Saturday as a
                              Liverpool supporter, and I may have information of relevance to
                              your enquiries from two points of view.

                                    Firstly, I was present at the gate at the Leppings Road end
                              of the ground from shortly before 2.45pm and was very close to
                              the main gate that opened at about one minute to 3 o'clock. When -
                              we arrived at the turnstile the crowd was about 15 yards deep.
                              There was only one mounted policeman controlling this crowd and
                              soon an intense pressure built up at that point.       The reason
                              appeared to be, and this does not seem, to have been brought
                              in the Press or other media, that there were no people passing
                              through the turnstiles at this time.     The crush became so bad
                              that a policeman from inside the ground was helping fans climb
                              in.   In my view it was absolutely necessary that the gates were
                              opened, as serious injury was imminent especially to the less
                              -l~”sically robust people.      I feel the question has to be

                    Shortly after getting into my seat in the stand it became
              very apparent that there were problems in the crowd behind the
              goal, and I went down on to the pitch almost immediately and was
              almost certainly the first medically trained person there.      I,
              therefore, can give you information on the state of the people
              coming out of the terraces. I managed to resuscitate some of the
              iriitialj|vifetiins, but as time went on it was obvious that the
              bodies being brought out of the crowd had been dead for some
              time.     I would like to confirm that there was no emergency
              procedure being enacted by the police.    There appeared to be no
              organisation or triage and finally it was only volunteers from
              the crowd who set this up. In two cases that I dealt with I feel
              the lack of airway devices probably contributed to their deaths.
              It seems to me inconceivable that a large football ground should
              not have an emergency procedure and some basic medical equipment,
              which is indeed quite cheap, to deal with an accident such as
              this.

                   I would be prepared to attend an enquiry.

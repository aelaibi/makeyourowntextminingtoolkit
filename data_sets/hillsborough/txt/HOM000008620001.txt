to Chief Superintendent Clark about the costs of the Hillsborough
Investigation. I noted what he had to say and subsequently
                                        I also saw the facsimile
                                      dated 9 August, 1989 which
you will not yet have read. This appeared to pick up all the
issues that Mr Anderson was worrying about, I therefore advised
him that you were in receipt of further correspondence from his
Chief Constable which dealt with the issues of discipline and the
DPP Inquiry.
In view of your note to Mr Addison I contacted him at 5.15pm.
Mr Addison told me that he had just sent his letter off to
South Yorkshire and that a copy was in the post for you. I
indicated to him in general terms that there was now a
disciplinary aspect to the Inquiry and as he is going on leave
this week he asked whether you would agree a copy of the letter
from Mr Wright to Mr Dear, being sent to Miss Ransford for her
information and that of Mr Chilcot.
I explained that you were out of the office but that I would
leave an appropriate note for you to confirm your view in due
course.

I can see nothing in the letter (provided that it is treated
confidentially) which you would I imagine feel should be kept
from Mr Addison and Mr Chilcot. However, you may deem otherwise
and I saw no point in any further action until such time as you
had seen it for yourself.

As this appears to be the season for annual leave and as I shall
also be absent myself on annual leave I thought it best to
dictate this note and to leave it with ,Mr Jones who has been
specifically asked to draw this to your attention on your return
to the office. It was not of sufficient importance to merit


           .

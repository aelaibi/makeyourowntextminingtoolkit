             HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION - DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS REPORT

             I have forwarded, under separate cover, the full file of evidence to you
             in respect of the investigation.  I have also sent copies of this full
             file to Mr G Williams QC, Mr P Birts and Captain E N Taylor at the
             Police Complaints Authority.

             You will see in the Report, Part VII, that we have raised certain
             recommendations which are based on our Interim Conclusions.   It must be
             stressed that these are provisional conclusions, given that we have not
             yet interviewed any of the 'principles'. We have also listed the people
             we would like to interview, starting with ____________________________
             |           | In order that we can start these interviews in good time,
             hopefully on the week commencing Monday 23 April t We would appreciate
             an early advice from you so that we can make arrangements with the
             solicitors for these interviews to go ahead.  It would be very much
             appreciated if we could have that early advice before we meet on
             Thursday 12 April 1990 in London.  I understand that the time of the
             meeting has yet to be fixed subject to the availability of Mr G Williams
             QC. I await your advice on the time.

             By now you will have gathered that we have had a new Investigating
             Officer appointed. You will also have noted that the new Chief Constable
             of the West Midlands Police, Mr Ron Hadfield, cannot assume the
             appointment because he was a material witness at the match.  It would
             seem appropriate when we have our meeting in London on 12 April 1990, for
             the new Investigating Officer, who I believe will be Mr Les Sharp of the
             Cumbria Constabulary, to join us.

THE PRIME MINISTER
                                                                    30 August 1994




      Thank you for your letter of 28 July. I have the utmost sympathy for




_____________________ and I have great admiration for the bravery and
dedication they have shown.


      There was enormous public sympathy following the Hillsborough
disaster, in consequence of which such a very substantial and impressive sum of
money was donated. As you appreciate, in such a situation those responsible
for administering the money have some discretion over the terms under which a
trust or trusts are established. Guidance has been published which can be of
assistance in these circumstances, and this may have been taken into account by
the trustees of the Hillsborough funds.


      One option is to establish a charitable fund, which would bring the
monies within the remit of the law on charities, and would place the
organisation concerned (which would be a charity) under the supervision of the
Charity Commission. However, as the trustees explained to you (as recorded in
your letter of 28 July to                     , that can have significant
limitations in the way the money can be applied. A considered decision is
necessary, taking the advantages and disadvantages of both into account. The
Government considers that both types of trust have their place in providing for
the allocation of resources.

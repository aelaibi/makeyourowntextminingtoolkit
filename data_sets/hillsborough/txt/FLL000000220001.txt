Dear

                                Hillsborough Inquiry


       Thank you for your letter cf the 31st May.

     Your comments and suggestions are most helpful and are being
considered in detail.  I will come back, if necessary, in due
course.




                                   Yours sincerely,




                                        Secretary.
31st May 1989




Dear David,

Hillsborough Inquiry.

Thank you for your letter of the 26th May and its enclosures.

I have, of course, seen you since your letter was written.  You told me
the composition of the F.A. Sub committee and of the possibility of there
being joint rather than separate submissions to the Inquiry, is still
being considered.

With regard to the recommendations of the Anti-Hooliganism Committee,
I would comment -

a)   that the proposal to appoint structural engineers to advise about
     the relationship between seating and standing at grounds did not
     necessarily envisage an inspection of each ground.  It would almost
     certainly be impossible to inspect each ground and prepare a Report
     in time to incorporate it in the submissions to the Taylor Inquiry.
     There is a danger, too, that such a Report could be confusing in its
     detail and would be hedged round with exceptions and qualifications.
     What I, personally, had in mind, was a Report from structural
     engineers based no doubt upon visits to a select number of grounds
     (to support the League's contention that standing in paddock areas
     is perfectly safe.  That Report would no doubt make recommendations
     about the depth from the pitch perimeter of paddock areas, the
     possibility of lateral barriers to limit the number of spectators
     in any particular area, and questions of access and egress.

     Any proposal for separate paddock areas in parts of the ground
     which are now wholly standing areas, poses a problem about the
     terracing behind the paddock area.  One possibility is that this
     should be 'all seater' accommodation.  An alternative which I think
     structural engineers might consider is that standing should be
     permitted providing that the area is 'penned' as is, or used to
     be the case at Wembley with separate access to and a numbers limit
     on each pen.  It may be that structural engineers will advise that
     'penning' in this way would be impractical and expensive and we
     could forget about it as an alternative to seating.
                                                                contd..
                                      -   2-                    31.5.89


contd


b)      Medical Facilities:

        (i)    I think that the Club returns (whether on the local plan or
               otherwise) should show the distance from the ground of the
               nearest hospital/hospitals with a full-time casualty depart­
               ment and the nearest ambulance station.
        (ii)    I am sure that our own Club Doctor, Dr. Keith Beveridge,
               would be happy to co-operate in any discussions or
               recommendations.

        Video Screens:

        You may be interested to learn that we wanted to instal a video
        screen at St. James' Park on the day we played Middlesbrough away
        to reduce the problem of visiting supporters.   The local authority
        refused to allow it as it wasn't incorporated in our Safety
        Certificate.

        Is this an area that Trevor Phillips has looked at?

Your own topics for discussion seem to cover most of the ground.     I note
that at clause 5 you include a recommendation that we institute discussions
for Central Government re funding and planning permission.    Despite the
fact   that we are unlikely to get any tax concessions or other financial
help from Government, I think that this is a door on which we ought to
beat as persistently and publicly as we can.    The comparison between the
treatment of horse-racing and football should be continually stressed,
in case you do not have it} I enclose a copy of an article from the New
Law   Journal of 21st April 1989 by Edward Grayson.  I think that Taylor L.J.
might be reminded of words of Neill L.J. in 1987 -

        "One can feel considerable sympathy for the Club authorities who
        are faced with falling gates and a grave escalation of costs to
        meet violence which they deplore and do their best to prevent.
        One can only hope that some accommodation can be reached, perhaps
        on a national scale to meet a threat to the finances o f 'the Club
        and other Clubs in a similar situation."

I wonder whether our Accountants might be asked to examine the balance
sheet and accounts of all 92 Clubs and produce a Report to show how far
League Clubs are financially able to meet substantial increased costs.
Perhaps the F.A. might be persuaded to meet the costs of commissioning
such a Report.

These are difficult times indeed.

Kind resards.

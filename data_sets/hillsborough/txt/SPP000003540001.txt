 FILE NOTE DATED 14.11.90. MERVYN JONES RE DISCLOSURE OF
 STATEMENTS .___________________________

 We discussed the letters which he was exchanging with South

 Yorkshire Police   (Mervyn had pointed out that the letter to

 Miss Steele had the wrong date on it.       It was typed the

 18th and should have been the 13 t h ) .   I have arranged for

 this to be corrected and the correction to be faxed to

 Miss.   Steele.

 He was in a difficulty because he was waiting for South

 Yorkshire to make up their mind.     It seemed to me that if

 the people were merely asking for their own statements so

to speak or statements of people who had authorised their

release the simplest way would have been for South       '

Yorkshire to agree to this unless a particular statement

fell within public interest immunity and/or was

non-releaseable because of say disciplinary proceedings.            I

thought that this would enable people to get what they

wanted and yet preserve South Yorkshire's position.          This

was incidentally my personal opinion as to Mervyn but of

course it is a matter for South Yorkshire to decide what

they want to do.    As far as I was concerned there was no

reason why the statement shouldn't released and I had said

that in my letter to M i s s . Steele and indeed had already

intimated this at a considerably earlier date.

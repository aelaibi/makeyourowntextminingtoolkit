were walk i n g         from the        d i re ct io n of the        s upermarket         towards         the ground

peaceful       ifAioisy.             Most were      under      the       influence      of drink;         several

location.         It was        now well       passed        1400 hours and fans were arriving

by coaches,           several       of w hi ch were          d ro pping      off    in P e n i s t on e Road.        My

officers        p r e ve nt ed at      least     six    coaches        from dropping          passengers          off

the    coaches,        in P en i st o n e Roa d near W a d s l e y Bridge an d d ir ec te d them

to the drop           off    points      in H a li fa x Road.           The moo d of the            fans at this

time     was    excited,        jovial,      but the         vast m a j o r i t y were      s t i 11 drinking

canned beer           etc.      T here were          large    numbers        of fans w al k in g       toward the

ground,        when    I h eard over         the      personal      radio a request               for a gate       to

be opened.            At    this    point     I decided        that     I toget he r with my two

officers/should              try a nd join up w it h the                rest of the         serial,        who

mat cl

TJie/time w ou l d          be a p p r o ac h in g    1450 hours        en    route to the          ground we

were,asked        to a ss i st       other     officers who            had been       called to a pub near

C l a y w h e e l s Lane a ft er       fans had s ta r te d fighting                 inside.       Several        fans

were     injured but were              us he re d a wa y by friends.                 The ^nc^UjUmt was

calmed an d we             c o nt in ue d towards C l ay w h e e l s Lane.             A g a in    I was

monitoring        requests          for a gate,         L e p p in g s Lane        end to be opened.

Several        such    requests        were made        before      I heard the          in st ru ct io n for

the gate        to be opened.             By this       time     three       of my serial         that was

m ys e l f and two          constables       were      now at C la yw h ee l s Lane.              My   idea was

to have        our meal       as d ir e c t ed on the o perational                   briefing       notes,       then

At    this     point        no one       u n d er s to o d    or    could see what was               happening.

            an d showed          their anger          towards me and other Police                      present.            I was

            unable        to    clear     the    tunnel       of fans.          The area A /G a part             from the

            tunnel        a re a was almost           cleared.         T he n    I d ir ected       five    constables            up

            the stairs           to the       seati ng are a of the West                stand,       where       in the

            At this        time     I was       not aware       of w h et he r      the m at ch had been a b an do ne d

            but    decided         under      the    c ir cumstances         that     it would       be.      I therefore

            i ns tr uc te d the         constables          to quie tl y ask who was                present       to get         their

            families,           friends,        etc.,    and to       leave      the stand.          S u rp r i s i n g    the    fans

            not answer.             The      m a tc h had not been o f fi c i a l l y          called off,            but fans

            accepted           that     it w o ul d     be,    and    left.      The odd one or            two    passing

            shocked,           left     the    stand with        little       fuss.     It was at          this     point        I was

            c o m mo ti on on the field.                  The    bodies        of the     dead having        been alre ad y

            cleared from            the     pitch.        I helped to           clear     the seating are a fully and

     ;      a f t e r w hi c h    I d e ci d ed      to make my way back                to C l a yw h ee l s Lane,     where          I

            was able        to    r e - g ro u p m y serial.

            M y thought          on the       incident,         prof es si on al ly ,      are     that m an y officers,

            constables an d a bo ve               had no        idea of what          to do!        M an y were     unable       to

           work       without       being t ol d e x ac tl y where                to go and what          to do,     without

            personal        radios         direc ti on s were         limited.          M an y    constables were          too

            c o n c e r ne d about         finding       their    serials,         than trying         to help the

            situation.            On t ra ve l li n g       towards      L e p p in g s Lane       from C l a yw h ee l s Lane,

           we    passed several              serials        of Police          officer.          One asks what, were         they

            doing?        It became          a pp ar en t      that once        serials     split      up for whatever

            reason,        c om m un i ca t io n s      fell    down.      No     loud hailers were a va ilable

           w hi c h    could have           h el pe d    in crowd       control       outside       the ground.        I had

           no fears         other         than the officers             feeling       let dow n by higher            ranking

           officers.

           One     o b se r v a t i o n    I make       is whilst       the t r ag ed y was         being    reported via

           the media,          TV,        etc.,   no mess ag e was             passed out to Sub D i v i s i o n           to state

           that       there were           no Police        fatal it ie s       or serious         injuries.        Many

           Police       f a milies        were    shocked,        a f r a id    but   no a ss ur a nc e s    were    given out

           to them.          T he y m ight        not    be f am ilies          of football        fans     but   they are

           human and they do                 care.

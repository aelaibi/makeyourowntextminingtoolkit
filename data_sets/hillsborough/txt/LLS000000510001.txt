 i;U. at home with my parents.

C ‚Äù Saturday            th e   15th April last I a tte n d e d th e Semi-final betw een Liverpool F;C;

_nd N ottingham F orrest a t Hillsborough Football Club.                         I had driven to th e        gr'oUlVd

in my firm 's van with my friend                                      ind his F ath e r and we arrived a t the

ground a t about 2.25pm.                 We all had tic k e ts for the Leppings Lane end of th e ground.

There was a considerable crush of people getting into the ground and I had difficulty

working my way towards th e turnstile.                      I eventually got into th e ground a t 2.^5pm.

 There w ere            only th ree      tu rn s tile s for approxim ately te n thousand people and four

Policemen, th r e e of whorn w h ere on horseback and one on foot for th a t number of

people.          Whilst outside the ground I saw a young boy                    next to m e having an a s th m a

a tta c k .    We lifte d him and his B rother over our heads to the back.                 People w ere screaming

a t th e Police to do something.                 There w ere just shrugging th e ir shoulders and shouting

to us to g e t back.                 It was impossible to move and you w ere carried forward by the

crush of the crowd.                  Once inside the ground th e r e w ere no stew ards or o th er officials

directing us as to which way to go.                        We th e re fo re headed for th e nearest tunnel.

When we arrived a t th e te r r a c e s they w ere extrem ely full a t the back.                It is my experience

th a t so m etim es th e te r ra c e s a r e full         a t the back but th e re is m ore room neare r the

pitch.         We th e r e f o r e    slowly worked     our way forward and had reached a position               two

to th r e e f e e t from th e back slightly to the le ft of th e tunnel but nearer to th e tunnel

than the railings.              It took us approxim ately tw enty minutes to move te n fe e t.               It was

impossible to move in any direction and the crush of people against me increased.

The crush was such th a t people had hold of my hair and digging and jostling m e because

they were, in d ifficulty.              A lace from one of my shoes b ecam e undone and I was fu rth e r

ham pered by people standing on it.                   I was getting very hot and my glasses w ere steamingup.

I couldn't even lift my arm s up to take my glasses off.                       At ths stage I w asn't in te re s te d

in seeing th e m a tc h but just staying on my fe e t.                 I was so involved in trying to survive

in the crush t h a t I did not see the te am s com e out or any of the play.                            I got split

up from my friends.                   Before    the big crush it       was so bad th a t a lad next to me broke

his arm .          I h e a rd it      snap. He was       next to m e and was white with shock.             He    was
holding his arm in fron t of him saying "help m e lad, help me".              We lifted him up over

into th e stands.      This was when I decided I should g e t out of their.             I co u ld n 't even

turn my head to look over never mind move.               I continued to struggle to stand on my

fe e t.   I then h3d a sensation of being lifted off my f e e t and hurled forward approxim ately

te n f e e t as th e whole crowd moved forw ard.          I was pushed le f t against a bar and I

was holding myself away from it.           People w ere scream ing.       I was not knocked to the

ground but it was necessary for m e to cling on to other people.                   I saw one lad run

on to th e pitch to Bruce Grobbelaar and saw him pushed back into the crowd. The

Police actu ally opened one of the g ates and people surged forward again thinking th a t

they could g e t out.     However, the Police just pushed the lad back in and th en closed

the g ates. I also saw people going over the spikes on top of the railings and five or

six got over onto the pitch.          There was pandemonium and I saw a Policem an come

onto th e pitch.      The players then cam e off and more people w ere on the pitch.                   Some

of th e crowd w ere then s ta r te d to be lifted back onto th e stands. I could not move

and we w ere so tightly packed th a t I could not even tu rn my head to look over my

shoulder.     I was stuck in this position fo r f ifte e n to tw e n ty m inutes a f t e r th e players

c a m e o ff th e field before it becam e easier. I saw one lad apparently dead on the floor

a few f e e t away.     He was blue and th e r e was blood coming out of his m outh.               I think

his neck was broken.       He was lifted over and away.        I saw a mouth to mouth respiration

and m assage being given to fans on th e pitch.        I saw one man about th irty being massaged

and th e y stopped and covered him up as he was obviously dead.                I photographer walked

up and uncovered the body and began to ta k e photographs.                   Four lads dragged him

off and this was th e only violence of any sort I saw th a t aftern oon .               I th e n saw my

m a te and his Dad over to my le ft and I w ent over towards them. I could see fans

lying on the co n c re te blue faced and obviously dead.           At this stage th e re seem ed to

be about th re e thousand fans on th e pitch.          The   bodies w ere lined up on boards.           AT

first we thought they w ere just injured but it              b ecam e obvious t h a t   th e y w ere    not

moving.       At about 3.30 to 3.40pm we w ere able to slowly m ake our way back out

of th e same tunnel.       As we made our way back I saw a yound lad who was obviously

dead being held by a Police Woman.               We w ere anxious to g e t aw ay as my friend's

wife is expecting a child this week.           We w ere fo rtu n a te enough to be allowed to           use

a telephone in a Sports Shop and my friend m anaged to g e t through to his w ife.                       We
then sprinted to our van and le ft the City.        I did not see any ambulances.         I was very

stiff and bruised all over my body and my chest and ribs w ere p articularly painful.

I did not sleep on Saturday night.           On th e Monday I w ent to th e Royal Liverpool

Hospital where I was exam ined as the pains in my c h e s t had becom e w orst.                  I did

not require any tr e a tm e n t.   I slept a little on Sunday and Monday night and retu rn ed

to work on Monday th e 17th April.          I am having g re a t difficulty in c o n c e n tra tin g on

every day tasks a t work and also in driving my firm 's van and sleeping.                  I am now

sleeping b e t t e r and I think I am gettin g over this dreadful experience of la st Saturday.

 I am now g ettin g over th e shock and starting to get angry with papers, th e Police,

the F.A. and even myself.          I do feel guilty th a t I just w ent home and didn't g e t on

the pitch and tr y to help someone.         All I am le ft with is a feeling of such te rrib le

w aste as a day th a t could have been so good becam e a nightm are.                 The gentlem an

I saw die on th e pitch, I will never forget his face.      Alan McGlone age 28).        I recognised
his p ic tu re in the paper.

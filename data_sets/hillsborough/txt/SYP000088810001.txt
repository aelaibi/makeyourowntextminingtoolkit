knew about         the Iiiddlewood vehicle as he had been briefed the day-

before.          It was CLARKfc! who had told me about                  the M i d d l ewood vehicle

and    I b e 1 ieve that CLA R K E had been briefed                   by D avid JONES.

4.     I went      home at about            1425.     1 had a coffee and a nap.                  About       1523

I got a phone            call    saying      there was a major         incident and w o u l d           I go to

tne N o r t h e r n General        to act as         liaison officer.          The message         came

f FO ITi                        I i m m e d iately set off to N o r t h e r n General            after

putting my uniform on.                   I d i d n ’t know what       type of     incident        it was.

3.     I a r r i v e d at N o r t h e r n General       at about      1350.     Everything appeared

to be busy with a m b u l a n c e s           coming as     I was ap p r o a c h i n g    the Hospital.

I tried to find a vacant                    telephone    to notify Control           that       I had

arrived.          I phoned       in at about         1605 ,-and spoke     to Nr S MITH the

A ss i s t a n t Chief Am b u l a n c e Of fi cep-'responsible for Control,                     Liaison

a n d Planning.           He told me to t?’*ind out            the   number    of casualties at

N o r t h e r n General and the number of deceased.

6.     1 then went         to the       casualty a rea and told them that                  I was an

ambulanceman.             I liaised with the            police who were         setting up an

incident         room.     I tjien went        outside    so    I could speak        to the       crews who

were arriving            to say that         I was    on site and available              to help.        I

spoke      to about # our         c r ews    i n 43 miRules,

7.     At about J 7 0 Q         I was    trying      to e s tablish the number            of    patients who

had been         received at       the N o r t h e r n General       and the    number         of deceased

but    everyone was         too busy for this            information to be collated.                     1

w o u l d s?»y that the          incident was         nowjpeaking      off.

8.     M y contact at Control was                                        He telep h o n e d me at             1700

and s u ggested that             I contact      him every 20 to 30 minutes.                      I was

telling      him about          patient movement,         passing      information         between

Control      and the Hospital.                The senior       doctor was      concerned w ith tne

number      of    casualties and            in particular how many w ould be arriving

later      on as the Hal lams hi re closes at 210 0 on a Saturday.                               It was

                                                                                                        S3307

su ggest ed that          the R o t h er ha m District           General    might     be able      to assist

after 2 "100 when the Hal lams hi re closed,                         I passed this         i n f o rrnat i o n

back    to    c o n t r o l .9.                         told me that     he was     sending up four

a m b u l an ce s around          1815 to       1845.     They were     to be used to transfer                   the

dead from the Hospital                     to the temporary m o r t u a r y at Hillsborough.

10.     I went       to the        police at N o r t h e r n General         to see    if they were

aware    that      bodies         were     to be transf e r r e d to Hillsborough.                They were

not aware        of this and a sked on whose a u t h o r i t y the transfers                         were        to

be made.         I said      it was         on the Coroners a u t h o r i t y and         I was    then

given    the qo ahead.                  The ambu l a n c e s a r r i v e d and   I went    down    in one         of

them to the m o r t u a r y at the Hospital                     to supervise       loading.        On arriva

a t uh e m o r t ua ry            rang                        We were     loading     the first

a m bulance when                                rang me and said that we should stop furthe

loading as         the    police         inspector at H i l l s b o r o u g h had said that            they

couldn't       cope with any more                 bodies arriving.          By the time        that     I got

back    to the hospital                 m o r t ua ry to tell    them the first amb u l a n c e         had se

off.     I used the          radio set           in an empty a m b ulance        to try to        contact

control       to tell       them to faring the first a m bulance                   back.      Control       were

unable       to contact           the    first ambulance.          At   this     uime the Police          then

a r ri ve d with an escort                 for each dead body.            They said that the

previous       instructions              had now been       cancelled and that all             bodies were

to be m oved down to Hills borough.                         I rang                 to let him know               thi

we    loaded the a m bulances                with three       bodies and a police           officer       for

each    body.       The a m b u l a nc e m en      set off.

11.     I went      back to         casualty and told                       that    I was     now back and

that    the    bodies were              being    transferred.

12.     I then waited at the Hospital                       and f i n ished at 2310.

At   one    stage      some    police      officers         tried     to move      the      crowd near          to us

turn s t i l e s    to get    in.     The r g f were a lot more               people        behind       us.

ye w a l k e d     forward    towW-eHf gate C,          w hi c h was about             40-"50 feet away.

There was a great             deal    of    pushing and         shoving.           The whole ar e a was

very    crowded w i t h       p eo p 1e pac ked      in t i g ht a g a i n st eac h o t he r .

W i t h i n a minute        or so,    sonyrone,      I jiont know who              opened t h e gate C .

This    is a sliding          gate /X was          opened at a bout H.iro pm,

I saw the          gate had bejfn opened and d e c i d e d                to go f o llowing              through

into    the       ground,

There was a mass i/e surge                  of    people     f o r w a r d , all     trying      to get         in

through       the gate and          into    the   ground.           E v e r y b o d y was    pushing       and

shoving       each other          to get    in through         the     gate,

I got      carried        in by the     sway of the          c r oiyti in through the gates and

into    the area beyond             them.

We all went          forw a r d and     in through ti/e tunnel                  that     leads      to the

st a nding area           in the West       stand.

We got      to the end of the              tunnel    and found           that    it really was             packed.

        At    the       end    of    the       tunnel             there      was        a b s o l u t e l y no         room       at    all       to    move

        it    was       really       packed.

        I am       a Sheffield              Wednesday                 supporter           and      I know          the       ground          well.           I

        know       that       if    I went        back           out    of    the       tunnel          I    could          go    to    the       sides.

        The      problem           was     that        t her e wa s          no    s i q ns       in s 1d e Ga t e €              t e 1 1 inq      pe o p 1e

        to    go    to    the       sides       through               the    tunnel          you       could       see       the       pitch       and

        everybody             just       headed         for       that.

        When       I was       outside          the         ground          there       d i d n ’t      seem       to       be    much       police

        control          of    the       crowd         by    the       turnstiles.                There          was    a    policeman             on

        horseback             who    was       asking             people       to       move       back, be c a us e               peopel were

        g e 1 1 i ng     hur t .         The     c r owd.         di d n t   move         bac.k , pr o b a b 1 y            they        coul dnt

        because          of    the       amount         of        p e o p 1e there.

        There       was       one    time       when         it       seemed       like       a    police          horse          was       lifted        up

        off      the     ground,          because            of       the    pressure             of    the       crowd          against          the     hor

        When       I went          and    stood         at       the    corner          of    the       West       stand          and       North       Stan

        I was       in    1 i.ne     w ith      t he        g o a 1 1 i ne.         I. c o u l d        see       pe o p 3.e      c 1 i m b i ng       ove r

        the      fences        onto       the     pitch           while       the       match          was       going       on.        I    could        s ee

        People          were       jammed       in      against             each    other.

        After       a    while       the       match         stopped          and       the       players          left          the    pitch.

        People          were       seen      climbing             over       the    fences.                 Mo    one       opened          the    gate          o

        the      fence        for    a while,,               Eventually             they          did    and       people          spilled             out

        onto       the    pitch.

        I    could       see       people       being            on    the    pitch,          and       some       of       them       were

        obviously             dead       because            they       had    jumpers             or    coats          thrown          over       them       to

        c o v e r t h em       up.

        People          were       administering                  First       aid       to    other          people          on    the       pitch.

        I saw       people          being       put         on    to    stretchers                and    advertising                   boards          that

        had      been     pu 11 e d       down         frorn a r o u n d          the     grounci.

             I saw a         p re s s     photographer                 taking       photos          of    dead      bodies.          He       had    to       be

             protected            by    the     Police        because             the     Liverpool             fans    started          to    have       a

             go at       him.

             I stayed          at      the    ground         u n til     j u st     about          everyone         ha d     gone?       I was

             This       caused         a big       surge          in    pens       3 a n o 4.          All the p e o p l e        started

             After       the      match       ha d     been a b a n doned               and     people          were    leaving          the     ground

             some       were      shouting           abuse        at,    and       hitting          the     police.           The    people         were

             aggressive             and      abusive         to    the       pol ic e.          Th e     police        didnt       react,        they

             were       to   upset        themselves.                This         happened          at    the     back       of    the    West       stand

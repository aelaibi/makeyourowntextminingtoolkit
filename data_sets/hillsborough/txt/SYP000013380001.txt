                Dear

                Thank you for your le tte r of 19 April about the disastrous event a t Hills­
                borough. There are as you rightly point out very many fa c e ts to th a t terrible
                incident and many words have been w ritten and spoken about it which may turn
                out to have been quite unfounded and mistaken. To know the tru th , we must I
                think aw ait the outcom e of Lord Ju stice Taylor's enquiry.

                You are e n title d under th e Police and Criminal Evidence A ct, 1984 to lodge a
                formal com plaint alleging misconduct by a police officer or officers in the
                course of the incident a t Hillsborough, if you are so minded. To do so you
                must first record your com plaint with the Chief O fficer of the South Yorkshire
                police, whose address is:-

                                                     Snig Hill
                                                     SHEFFIELD
                                                     S3 8LY

                However, you may like to consider w hether justice and the public in te re st
                might not be equally or b e tte r served by your offering yourself as a witness to
                Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry, since you seem to have had a good view of the
                whole incident. I hope you may feel th a t on balance this would be a more
                constructive course.

                                                 Yours sincerely

               THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

               Thank you for your le tte r of 19 April about the disastrous event a t Hills­
               borough.

               This Authority has no statu to ry power to in itiate investigations.                             The com­
               plaints procedure begins with th e recording of a complaint pursuant to the
               Police and Criminal Evidence A ct                      1984 with the chief officer of th e force of
               which an officer or officers a re                     alleged to have been guilty of misconduct.
               T h ereafter if the com plaint falls into one or other of certain statutory
               c a t e g o r i e s , i t m u st be f o r t h w i t h r e f e r r e d to th is A u th o rity fo r p o ssib le
               supervision of the investigation. Whether an investigation is supervised by this
               Authority or not, the report of it will in due course be sent to this Authority
               for scrutiny and for the consideration of possible disciplinary action.                                 The
               arrangem ents for senior officers are som ew hat differen t.

               I am not sure w hether you are making a form al com plaint as a member of the
               public a ffe c te d by the happenings a t Hillsborough or as a Member of Parliam ent
               representing constituents involved in those happenings.         If the la tte r, then it
               seems to me th a t Parliam ent is         the proper place for raising your concerns.

               Conclusions as to the accuracy or otherw ise of the many words which have
               been spoken and w ritten about the incident a t Hillsborough will have to aw ait
               the outcom e of Lord Ju stic e Taylor's enquiry.   I suggest th a t until th a t is
               known, it is p rem atu re to make judgments about the police or anyone else.

               I take the last paragraph of your le tte r as being addressed to the Home
               Secretary, to whom I send a copy of this one.

            C e c il,
I am writing to request that you institute an immediate enquiry
into the propriety of the remarks passed yesterday by Police
Officers of the South Yorkshire Police Force about the conduct of
fans at the FA Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on Saturday last.

Given that the Home Secretary had announced the*judicial enquiry
into the disaster the day before, and the solicitor for 30 of the
victims' families had begun proceedings against the Chief
Constable and his Force these remarks should never have been
made.

By what right did Police Officers make statements calculated to
be prejudicial to the reputation of Liverpool football club and
its supporters, and which seem to be part of a smokescreen of
propaganda aimed at diverting attention from the truth.

Lord Denning once said that "be they ever so mighty they are not
mightier than the la w " . I trust that you will use your good
offices to examine how such statements came to be, and on whose
authority they were issued. Perhaps you would let me know what
guidlines exist.

What guidelines exist for the publication of statements once a
judicial enquiry has been announced.  I am copying this letter to
the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd MP .

                Dear

                Thank you for your le tte r of 19 April about the disastrous event a t Hills­
                borough. There are as you rightly point out very many fa c ets to th a t terrible
                incident and many words have been w ritten and spoken about it which may turn
                out to have been quite unfounded and mistaken. To know the tru th , we m ust I
                think aw ait the outcom e of Lord Ju stice Taylor's enquiry.

                You are entitled under the Police and Crim inal Evidence Act, 1984 to lodge a
                form al com plaint alleging misconduct by a police officer or officers in the
                course of the incident a t Hillsborough, if you are so minded. To do so you
                must first record your com plaint with the C hief O fficer of the South Yorkshire
                police, whose address is;-

                                                     Snig Hill
                                                     SHEFFIELD
                                                     S3 8LY

                However, you may like to consider w hether justice and the public in te re st
                might not be equally or b e tte r served by your offering yourself as a witness to
                Lord Justice Taylor's enquiry, since you seem to have had a good view of the
                whole incident. I hope you may feel th a t on balance this would be a more
                constructive course.

                                                 Yours sincerely

               THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

               Thank you for your le tte r of 19 April about the disastrous event a t Hills­
               borough.

               This Authority has no statu to ry power to in itiate investigations.                        The com ­
               plaints procedure begins with the recording of a complaint pursuant to the
               Police and Criminal Evidence A ct 1984 with th e chief officer of th e force of
               which an officer or officers are alleged to have been guilty of misconduct.
               T hereafter if the com plaint falls into one or other of certain statutory
               c a te g o r ie s , i t m u st be f o r th w ith r e f e r r e d to th is A u th o rity fo r p o ssib le
               supervision of the investigation. Whether an investigation is supervised by this
               Authority or not, the rep o rt of it will in due course be sent to this Authority
               for scrutiny and for the consideration of possible disciplinary action.                            The
               arrangem ents for senior officers are somewhat different.

               I am not sure w hether you are making a formal com plaint as a member of the
               public affe c ted by the happenings a t Hillsborough or as a Member of Parliam ent
               representing constituents involved in those happenings. If the la tte r, then it
               seems to me th a t P arliam ent is the proper place for raising your concerns.

               Conclusions as to the accuracy or otherwise of th e many words which have
               been spoken and w ritten about the incident a t Hillsborough will have to aw ait
               the outcome of Lord Ju stic e Taylor's enquiry. I suggest th a t until th a t is
               known, it is prem ature to make judgments about the police or anyone else.

               I take the last paragraph of your le tte r as being addressed to the Home
               Secretary, to whom I send a copy of this one.

^Sir Cecil Clothier,
 10 Great George Street,
 London SW1




I am writing to request that you institute an immediate enquiry
into the propriety of the remarks passed yesterday by Police
Officers of the South Yorkshire Police Force about the conduct of
fans at the FA Cup Semi-Final at Hillsborough on Saturday last.

Given that the Home Secretary had announced the judicial enquiry
into the disaster the day before, and the solicitor for 30 of the
victims' families had begun proceedings against the Chief
Constable and his Force these remarks should never have been
made.

By what right did Police Officers make statements calculated to
be prejudicial to the reputation of Liverpool football club and
its supporters, and which seem to be part of a smokescreen of
propaganda aimed at diverting attention from the truth.

Lord Denning once said that "be they ever so mighty they are not
mightier than the law". I trust that you will use your good
offices to examine how such statements came to be, and on whose
authority they were issued. Perhaps you would let me know what
guidlines exist.

What guidelines exist for the publication of statements once a
judicial enquiry has been announced.  I am copying this letter to
the Rt Hon Douglas Hurd MP .

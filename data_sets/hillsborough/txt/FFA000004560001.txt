 continue to do it in that way.    If the judge said that they
 ought to commit more staff to it and be continually going up
 to the staging clubs for meetings they may have to change
 their practices but until then he wanted us to go in quite
 heavy on that angle.

 He thought also there should be a full paper on the FA's
 role in staging the Cup Final and internationals at Wembley
 as it contrasted with the FA Cup semi-final. A short

more relevant for Phase 2 but we would have to be confident

JGW thought statements from Clark and perhaps Titcomb to
back up what Kelly was saying might be used as a back-up.
He agreed with me that Kelly would give all the main
evidence but thought it might be sensible to have those
statements ready if necessary.  Mackrell's statement may be
swapped on a friendly basis leader to leader.  It was
helpful they were in the same Chambers.  He was very keen to
come to Old Trafford on Sunday and suggested I ask Dyson as
it would be useful.

              TAYLOR REPORT: HOME SECRETARY'S STATEMENT



It seems to me that what brought Lord Justice Taylor down against
the national membership scheme were the risks involved:


    "The fact that it has not been done before does not, of course,
    show that it cannot be done.    But it requires greater caution
    and more extensive testing procedure than if there were a
    successful precedent."


    "The system can only be tested by putting through people.
    Soothe very testing of whether the system may cause danger,
    danger may be caused."


The DOE draft suggests that if we can only resolve the technical
difficulties we would be in a position to come back to the House
with a new scheme, assuming that football hooliganism remained
a problem unresolved by the various Taylor recommendations.


In practice we will never be able to eliminate the risk which
worried Taylor - unless some other country successfully introduces
a national membership scheme first.      It will always be a question
of trading off the risks of a scheme against the prevailing
problems of football hooliganism.      A run of ghastly incidents
could shift public and parliamentary perceptions of the trade
of f .

I attach a variant on the DOE redraft which attempts to capture
this.    On the three "difficult" Taylor recommendations - new
criminal offences, attendance centres and tagging - I think
something like "I am sympathetic to these proposals and will

agrees).

     I now come to the proposed Football Membership Scheme. Lord
Justice Taylor examined the Invitation to Tender for a scheme
which was issued by the consultants employed by the football
authorities. He came to the conqlusion that he could not sunnort

wcmid ;worR well enough bo a w dbd tho danger of congestion and
disorder.    Instead he proposes the measures to which I have
referred.



      The Government have decided in the light of his advice not
to proceed with the establishment of a Football Membership
Authority.     Instead we propose to follow his strategy of
combining certain measures aimed directly at hooligans together
with progress towards all-seating, improved accommodation, better
facilities, improved arrangements for crowd control and better
training of police and stewards, which Lord Justice Taylor
believes give the best chance of eliminating or minimising
football hooliganism.



     In the meantime Part I of the Football. Spectators Act will
remain on the statute book and the practical concerns expressed
by Lord Justice Taylor about the type of scheme envisaged in the
Invitation to Tender will be jjnll-y explored in the light of the
available advice, including that from the specialist companies
who responded to the Invitation to Tender.




                                            CONFIDENTIAL
     If hooliganism is not defeated by the alternative strategy
proposed in the Report and if at some future time ah-weSIeabi-e
membership scheme can be produced, we will then be in a position
to come back to the House and seek the approval.of the House for
 A
    scheme.



     The right course now is to implement Part II of the Act and
to give effect to Lord Justice Taylor's proposals in the way I
have indicated. Mr. Speaker, we are giving the industry and the
clubs a final opportunity to put themselves in order. The public
will not forgive them if they do not now act.

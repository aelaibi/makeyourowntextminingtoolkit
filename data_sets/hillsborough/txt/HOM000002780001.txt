Dear Mr Butorac

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER : FILM VIDEO COVERAGE

Sue Mitchell of the Home Office spoke with you earlier today
about television coverage of the Hillsborough disaster, and asked
if any footage which you have could be retained in view of its
potential value to the public inquiry.

I understand that the BBC in fact had exclusive rights to filming
the match and will have all the film shot inside the ground. Any
footage taken outside the ground and any footage subsequently
obtained of events inside the ground may also be of value and it
would be appreciated if this too could be retained until the
inquiry has reported and the subsequent issues resolved. This
would include footage which may not have been transmitted.

As you know, the Home Secretary made a statement to the House of
Commons on 17 April about the disaster, during which the question
of the film footage and of any photographs taken being made
available to the public inquiry was raised.  I enclose a copy of
the relevant extract from Hansard which you may be interested to
see.

        I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently attached

        to the Drug Squad at Police Headquarters, Snig Hill, Sheffield.

        On Saturday            9 April          1988,         I was on uniform duty                 at the FA Cup Semi-Final

        football match between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool football clubs.                                                             The

        match was held at Hillsborough football ground.

        My duty at the match consisted of crowd control on Leppings Lane prior to

        the start of the g a m e , and once started I was put on reserve in the Corner

        Stand between Leppings Lane end and the North Stand.

        At    the      conclusion           of       the       game      I   remained           inside    the     ground        assisting

        dispersal of the crowd.

        Throughout my duty on that day, although there were a very large number of

        people attending the game, I saw no crowd problems or disorder.

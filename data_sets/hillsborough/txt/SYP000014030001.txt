              Control   Hello Barnsley,    Is there two on Station
                        yet
              Barns     Urn its (...... ).           its         whos
                        speaking to you
              Control   Yes
Barns     Ive been here a while actually in fact.
          I was told to standby here by myself
Control   Urn
Barns     But its a bit pointless so ive just rung
          round to LA’s who just live near Station
          they haven't answered (............. )
          paramedics who I can ring up I dont know
          whether you want them or not.     I dont
          the procedure but I thought I 'd ring
          just in case
Control   I think they've already rung round
Barns     Have they
Control   Urn
Barns     So I rang in myself you see I heard it
          on Radio Sheffield about they wanted
          Doctors on scene. So I'm stood here by
          myself if you want to use me I'll take
          an amb to Hoyland
Barns     and Standby there. There's more chance
          somebody coming in at Hoyland than there
          is at Barnsley isn't there
Control   Well just
Barns     (                 )
Control   Well just standby there a bit
Barns     Yes
Control   Because there might be somebody else
          report for duty
Barns     Um
Control   An then, well if there's nobody turned
          up in the next 10 mins give us a ring
          back
Barns     Yes, what I'm thinking.  There's more
          lads live round Hoyland than in town
          centre
Control   Um
Barns     Er, if I stood by there er you called me
                         up and 1 could be (.......... ) quicker
                         if you wanted
               Control   Urn as I say give it another 10 mins
               Barns     Okey Doke
               Control   And I'll ring Hoyland Station and see if
                         there's anyone there
               Barns     OK then
               Control   Righto

           is, who is that calling

           (                  )

           Yes basically what were trying to do I
           will try the line just in case its free
           at this very second, just hang on a
           moment sir
Its still engaged at the moment sir

Do you know how (------------ )

Pardon

(                                         )


At this stage all we can say is into the
hundreds. I've only just come, you know
we've obviously fetched extra staff in
and i've only just got on the situation
myself, but it is obviously into the
hundreds and there must be some of them
rather seriously cos we've got Doctors
on the pitch and ambulances actually
queuing up to take them away and of
course this has been going on since
about 10 past 3 so its turned out into a
very major incident

(                                     )

I haven't    heard of    any, youcouldn,t
quote me on that because I 've only been
in the building about 10 minutes myself.
I do know     that  we   are usingall our
county plus W.Yorks backing us up and N
Yorks backing us up

(                     )


Well today your      talking about30 ambs
throughout S Yorks   and plus extra crews
that have come in     plus the crews from
outer, so we must     be talking well in
excess of 50-60 ambs . I mean if there
only earring two or three you know the
non serious type its obviously going
into quite high numbers, but thats as
much as I can say as I say

(                                   )


Oh yes there back and forth on fact the
Northern general have just asked us to
divert   all the other patients to the
Hallamshire because they're absolutely
saturated now. So were having to

(                       )


In Sheffield yes

(                   )

Not to my knowledge at this stage i
believe the two major hospitals are
coping at the moment, but thats always a
possibility of course you know start
calling Chesterfield and places like
that

(                               )


Well as I say unfortunately I've only
been in about 10 mins myself one of my
friends rushed me in because I got a
telephone call asking for assistance so
I'm not in the full picture yet

(                           )

           Caller     Hello it's
                      Oh just a minute        do you know
                      who is was who rung you
                      I don't know it's just daughter said
                      someone rung from work
                      You know we've got a major incident
                      on it's probably that. Hang on let
                      me see who it was because it's
                      crackers in here. I can't find out
                      who rang you p e r s o n a l l y o n l y
                      thing I can think of is that's it to
                      do with this
                      They probably just went down the
                      numbers wanting somebody.   Anyway
                      if they get stuck either ring home
                           knows where I am down street

                       involved. The Local Hosp is now at

          WYMAS   We know you've got your problem
                  Yeah
          WYMAS   (                  )
                  Yeah
          WYMAS   (................ ) keep this line open
            will it help you at all because we know
            our vehicles are cutting in across
            your's we've kept there, were keeping
            the calls to a minimum, they're coming
            down to lend assistance
            Yes, but if they, are they on ERC
    WYMAS   They are on our ERC yes
            Right, well if they are on ERC were,
            were dealing with it on ERC so they
            should be OK
    WYMAS   Yeah, there cutting across your calls I
            understand
            Oh are they
•   I__I
    WYMAS   Well I understand your getting problems
            with vehicle, we've got em on ERC, we're
            answering them on ERC at this end
            Yes I see
    WYMAS   You've got your vehicles calling ERC as
            well
            Just give me a second
            Um
    WYMAS   What I'm suggesting is if you would like
            it to be so we'll keep we'll keep this
            line open
             Yeah, No I think at the moment that
            would be a bit of a problem cos until we
            get anybody else here there's only about
            4 of us here and its tying me, tying a
            position up you know I can't deal with
            me normal work. Er see how it goes
    WYMAS   Leave it as it is, if you require us
            come back to us
            I'll do that straightaway, but we think,
            you know, I mean obviously, we ended up
            with a load of vehicles calling on ERC
            at the same time
    WYMAS   Thats right
            I think the problem itself will die out


                 9
                  itself within a few minutes I hope
          WYMAS   but we've heard that people have been
                  carried out on to the street
                  Oh I
          WYMAS   On billboards
                  Yep, thats right I mean er I haven't got
                  a clue what's happening but we've just
                  been informed from a drive who'd
                  actually gone down to watch the match
                  that he's counted at least 40 DOA's

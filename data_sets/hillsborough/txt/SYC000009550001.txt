  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                          Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.
4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                                Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.                                                                                        (
     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.
     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                          Cause of death
     care/self-neglect').

   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:
     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

      C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
      induced abortion.                                                         Verdict
      C.D. died as the result of an accidenl/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.
   c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
     it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.                                           /f
   d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not

        De ar Sirs,                          ,

        Re:   RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOV EMBE R 1990.



        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m y ou represent,
        on the 19th of Nov emb er 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue w i l l be n o t i f i e d in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not adv ersarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
        under m y control, and in particular, it is my r esp onsibility to select the


o       ■witnesses w h o w i s h to give evidence.      I am at present engaged in con sid e r i n g
        this and in det erm i n i n g wh o I w i s h to invite to attend.

        W i t hou t pr ejudice in any w a y to m y rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
        to give you an oppor tun ity to draw to m y a tte ntion the names and other
        ap propriate details of any w itness or wi tne sses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
        consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        M a y I p lease ask you in conside rin g w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names to my
        attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also w a n t to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
        names for con sid erat ion is n o t h ing more than that, and that the d e c isio n as
        to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

        I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        h ea rd from y ou by the end of SeptenjJaer I will assume you have no names to
         submit.

           Sirs,

He:        JOH mm* G-ILHOQLSY (deceased) S6«85.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

 Dear Sirs,

Re:          JonPatagilhoole^
 Thank you for your letter of the 8th of August.

 I enclose a letter Reference SLP/JT/H/EM/Q01 which deals
 with the question of the release of the post mortem
 reports to you. On that basis, I enclose the post
 mortem report. If you cannot accept it on these terms,
 please return it unused.

 I am not clear whether you represent your clients in
 connection with the Inquest proceedings.

 As I am anxious to sort out the legal representation
 in order that I may know who to communicate with, I
 would be grateful if you could please let me know as
 soon as possible whether or not you are instructed
 in connection with the Inquest.

  If you are so instructed, I would be grateful if you
  could please let me know who precisely you represent.

 Finally, I would be grateful if you could please let
 me know whether you intend to associate yourself with
 the Hillsborough Steering Committee group of solicitors.
 This is of course a matter entirely for you, The purpose
 of my inquiry is to try and sort out which firms are
 within the group and which will need separate communications.

  I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

  Please quote our reference.

  Yours faithfully,

       Dear Sirs,

       You .will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
       reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
       in fact put in as evidence.

       However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
       and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
       I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
       I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
       report of your client(s).

       The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

               a.       They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                        subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                        they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

               b.       They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                        conselling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
                        legitimate purposes in connection with any legal proceedings
                        in which solicitors may be engaged.

               c.       Subject to tha-cafe§, they axe to be kept confidential until
                        they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

      I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
      of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
      assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
      each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
      above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
      I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
      reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
      the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

      The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) Is ^5p    per sheet (total £ i g§
      Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.                *

      lours faithfully,

     Edward Murphy reported that he had discussed at length with David Mason,
     the Director of Social Services Liverpool, the future of HillsborougTi
     related work and appropriate means of co-ordinating the voluntary sector's
     input.

     It appeared that three specific groups of tasks were to emerge shortly:

     a)   co-ordination of holidays for affected families
     b)   co-ordination of counselling support on the helpline and the drop-in
     c)   voluntary sector support to the Regional Support Unit, which it was
          hoped would be established by the City Council on the 5th July.



                                                                   Continued.
                             -   2   -




Those present agreed that the Voluntary Sector Co-ordinating Committee
as at present constituted, had done the job it had been set up to do
on April 17th and that it was now appropriate to move to smaller task
oriented groups related to each of these three tasks.  These groups would
be convened as appropriate by Liverpool CVS.

The Chairman thanked those present and all the other members of the
Co-ordinating Committee for their hard work and support over the eleven
weeks since Hillsborough.

      but    they d i d n ’t give            directions.              People       seemed to know where

      to go.

      Borne fans were           having a drink mos tl y from                        cans we bought a couple                   of

      cans o urselves           but        there was       no problems at all,                it was a very good

      atraosphere.

      We a r r i ve d at the e ntrance                   to the ground Lejypinqs L n end at a b o ut 2.50

      pm    (1450).       It was           just    o ne big mass            of j/aoole at the entrance,                  no

      organisation.             There were              some    police ^officers            o n horses         positioned

      At first         I went    to the           left    it was          the wrong      turnstile       entrance.            Once

      I realised         I went        over       to the       right       hand block.        I was held up at

      first      by the       policeman on horseback at the                           perimeter        gates,     it

      w a s n ’t too     bad there           crushwise.              Once    he    let us past the             perimeter

      gates      I made my way to the                    turnstile and             past through without muc h

      problem       I handed my ticket'in.

      I d i d n ’t see any gates                  open    I saw some            pec^le     sitting      on the        perimeter

      walls      but    I d i d n ’t see any go                in.

^     Once      inside    I made my way to the t u n n / 1 .                        It was   busy but          1 had     room

      I saw      people       climbing        over       to the front             on the    pitch.       I realised

      someone must            have     been getting                crushed but        I d i d n ’t realise        how bad          it

      was    until      some    police officers                    came    into    the   terrace       from tne tunnel

and then went            back out and began g i f i r s t                     aid.         The    numbers       of

injuries were m u l t i p ly in g all               the time.          We were       helping a n yb od y we

could but there was                 one    in particular          in a bad way4            someb od y said his

name was                     he i/as having         great    di f f i cul t>y^breathi ng »              I a sk ed a

ambulance          came we wa nt ed a stretcher               for him.          We    had to       carry the          lad

out    in the       Finish we        c o u l d n ’t get a stretcher.             Whe n we got            to the

a m b u l an c e   it drove awa y          it must    have    been full we had to find another.

While we had been              inside       the doctor,,                             had    come to us and

d i d n ’t get much help from the                   police    t her^/were many              standing about

but    only the        policewoman offered help.

After most         the      casualties       had been taken to hospital                     there were many

bodies that           had been brought             out some were         not even covered over

a sk ed a police            officer       to use his       coat   to    cover    some over          but he

•flatly refused.              The    police       seemed to be just           bringing           bodies    out and

leaving       them without           offering       first aid to try and bring them back.

I e v e nt u al l y    left the ground at a b o u t / 4 . 50             pm   (1630).

The whole a f t e r n o o n was            badly policed, espe ci al ly after                    the e no rmity

of the s i t u a ti on became              obvious    police were         just       standing       about       there

was    no    c om mun ic at io n most        police were          just spectating.                The    doctor,

                      was    dashing       about    from one to another              we were        helping          but

we    could have         done with         more    help.

It w a s n ’t until          1 got home       I realised/how            bad   it was        inside       the ground,

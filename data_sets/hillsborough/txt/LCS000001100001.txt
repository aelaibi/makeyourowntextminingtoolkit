A Personal Account

  of the Tragedy
This personal account o f my experience at H illsborough is intended to

sup p lem en t the statem en t that I have already subm itted to the Judicial Inquiry
into the disaster. Consequently, this report serves to reflect the em otion al im pact

o f what happ en ed to m e, as well as recording the facts. My principal objective

here is to reproduce my feelings at the tim e, rather than to retrospectively

exam ine what w ent wrong, although inevitably I do have my ow n opinions on the
seq u e n c e o f tragic events, based u p on my ow n experience. I have had to express

so m e o f those opinions in this account, but they are confined to the end so as not
to interfere with my m ain intention.



W hilst the m em ory o f that day will always b e with m e, I thank everyon e w h o is
helping m e to c o m e to terms with it, particularly my loving family and Linda. I
am also grateful to Dr. Creer, w h o se invaluable counselling and encouragem ent

has enab led m e to produce this report.


In G o d ’s nam e, I pray that nobody shall ever have to describe a similar .
exp erien ce to this o n e again.
                                      Introduction


I have prepared this account as so m e o n e who has b e e n a regular football

supporter for many years. I have a season ticket for the Spion K op at A nfield
and, during my three years as a student at N ottin gh am University, I travelled to
many away m atches, particularly in the M idlands and L ondon, to w atch L iverpool
F.C. play. I therefore have ex p erien ce o f visiting a num ber o f different football

grounds and, on m any of these occasions, they w ere filled to capacity.



In particular, this year’s F.A. Cup Sem i-Final was my third visit to H illsborough
in tw elve m onths. T h e other two visits w ere for the Sheffield W ed n esd ay v.
Liverpool leagu e m atch in January 1989 and, perhaps m ore importantly, the 1988
F.A. Cup Sem i-Final b etw een th e sam e two team s as the ill-fated m atch on 15th

April 1989;


A t the previous semi-final-1 had sto o d in the centre section o f the. L eppings L ane
terrace, apd for the league: m atch I had sat in the W est Stand, which is also

reached via the turnstiles at the Leppings L an e End. . O n 15th April this year,, my

ticket w as-again for the standing area o f the Leppings Lane terrace.
I had intended to arrive at the ground this year at about 2.00 p.m., as I did at last

year’s semi-final, but a series o f traffic hold-ups alo n g the M 62 m otorway had
m eant that the journey from Liverpool had taken longer than anticipated. I was
travelling with a colleague from work, and he su g g ested a num ber o f diversions

along the way which enabled us to avoid so m e o f the congestion.


W hen w e eventually reached Sheffield, there w e r e still m any other p e o p le parking
their cars and many coaches just arriving at the sa m e tim e as us, so I was not too

concerned that w e had arrived later than I had h o p e d . I b eliev e that the tim e

that w e parked was about 2.00 p.m.


For som e reason, the recom m ended' route to H illsb orou gh this year, as detailed

by South Yorkshire. P olice before the m atch, w as different to the route
recom m en ded by the R A C last year. This may h ave b e e n due to the fact that
after last year’s match the direct route from S h e ffie ld to M anchester (alon g the
A 616 and the A 6 2 8 ) had b een so c on gested that traffic was m oving literally at

walking p ace for rhlies and miles. I therefore th ou gh t that I would follow the

different route that had b e e n reco m m en d e d to. fam iliarise m yself with it,

particularly for the purpose o f avoiding a r ep ea t o f the con gestion I had

experienced the previous year on the return journey. I had not anticipated such

delays on the way .to Sheffield, though.



Furtherm ore, the different route m ean t that I had to park in an unfam iliar area

com pared with previous visits, so I was not sure h ow far away the ground was

w h en I got out o f the car. I didn’t think that it co u ld b e far, though, b eca u se

there w ere a num ber o f traffic p o lic e m e n around sh ow in g p e o p le w h ere to park.



My colleagu e stopped o ff for a cou p le o f m in u tes to buy him self so m e lunch, but

ev en so w e thought that w e still had plenty o f tim e. A fter all, the ticket itself

recom m en d ed taking up a position 15 m inutes b e fo r e kick-off, and I thought that

w e w ould certainly arrive before then. E ven w ith this b rief stop, I su p p o se w e
reached the ground b e tw e e n about 2.20 p.m. and 2 .3 0 p.m., which should have
b e e n am ple tim e, albeit later than w e had h o p e d .
 H ow ever, we had not anticipated the confusion that g reeted us as w e approached

the turnstiles. I searched in my pocket for my ticket to see which o f the two
entrances (that led from the street to the actual turnstiles) w e n e e d e d to use, and
realised that even though w e w ere several yards from the outer b lu e gates which

lead up to the turnstiles, w e in fact n e e d e d to m ove over to our right slightly in
order to approach our allocated turnstiles through Entrance B. T h er e w ere so

 many p e o p le approaching the ground that it w as difficult to m ak e e v e n this slight

change o f direction. O ther p e o p le to our right had, likew ise, realised that they
 too w ere approaching the wrong entrance to the turnstiles, and th e result w as that

 many p e o p le w ere colliding with each other in the road as they tried to g et to the
 correct place.



 I’m sure that at last year’s sem i-final there w ere p o lice and stew ards directing

 p e o p le in the road on the approach to the turnstiles, and so this problem, did not
 arise then.



 Furtherm ore, this marshalling last year m ean t that orderly q u eu es had b e e n

■ form ed up at the turnstiles and, as is the case at m ost grounds I have-visited,

 these q u eu es w ere kept apart last year by p o licem en , som e o f th e m m ounted,

 m oving b etw e e n th em and so avoiding the p rob lem o f the q u eu es m erging into a
solid m ass o f p e o p le outside the ground.



I had read in the press before the gam e this year that the p o lic e w ere issuing a

warning about pickpockets operating in the q u eu es at the turnstiles, which had
apparently b e e n a problem at last year’s sem i-final. .1 had told my co llea g u e to be

aware o f this, and I therefore exp ected to s e e an e v e n greater p o lic e p resen ce at
the turnstiles this year to com bat the problem .



I was, therefore, particularly surprised to s e e s o few p o lic e m e n actually near the

turnstiles, considering the warning that had b e e n issued, and th e fact that there

did not s e e m to b e any attem pt being m ad e to form orderly q u eu es. T his lo o k ed

to m e as though any pickpockets around w ou ld find th e situation e v e n m o re to
their liking than the previous year. I again w arned m y c o lle a g u e to be

particularly careful with his ticket, b ecau se the article that I had read m en tio n ed
 that last year so m e p eop le had their tickets stolen w hile they w ere actually
 queuing. If this was indeed the case, it certainly se e m e d odd that the efficient
 marshalling that existed last year was not extend ed further. In fact, this year it
 did not seem to exist at all.



 T h ere was a m ounted policem an by the blue entrance gates that w e w ere
 approaching and he was allow ing a few p e o p le at a tim e to pass through.

 H ow ever, there w ere no queues in e v id en ce at the turnstiles. T h er e was just a

 single mass of p eo p le. T h e only other p o lic e m en that I could s e e w ere up by the
 turnstiles. As far as I could se e, there was o n e m ounted p o lic e m a n further

 forward and only a few on foot. T h ere w ere none b e tw e e n the m ou n ted

 policem an at the blue entrance gates and the rear o f the m ass o f p e o p le who had
 passed through those gates.



 T h e area was certainly very c on gested w h en I was allow ed past by the m ounted
 policem an, but I did not think that it w as dangerously so, at that tim e. I was, of

'c o u r s e , at the back o f those w aiting to go through the turnstiles, though, so it was
; difficult for. m e to tell what the situation was like further forward. T h e
■atm osphere, at this tim e was on&.of excited an ticip ation o f seeing, what we. all :

, hoped, w ould b e a great match.'; T h ere was the usual pre-m atch singing as p e o p le

. w aited to get into the ground, w ith the added sen se o f expectation associated with
 the prospect o f another W em b ley Cup Final, should the team win. T h e

 underlying m ood was certainly g o o d -h u m o u red and w ell-behaved. A t the sam e
 time, inevitably, p e o p le were e a g e r to g e t inside the ground.



 A s on e w ould norm ally expect, I had s e e n p e o p le drinking from cans on the way

 to the ground, but I distinctly rem em b er thinking to m yself that I had not

 personally seen any drunkenness. I rem em b er that b e c a u se it w as conspicuous by

 its absence. I’m sure that so m e p e o p le probably w ere drunk, but I did not se e

 any evid en ce o f it. M any o f th e sid e streets near to the ground w ere blocked o ff

 by policem en , and they did not s e e m to b e having any trouble w ith drunken
 supporters, as far as I could se e.



 I’m sure that, like m e, those resp onsible for crowd control had exp ected p e o p le to

 have b e e n drinking. T h e large dustbins that are habitually p laced at turnstiles to
accept em pty cans, and to serve as a rem inder that no alcoh ol is allow ed inside
football grounds, certainly suggests that there is an exp ectation that so m e people

will be drinking up to that point, otherw ise they w ou ld not be put there. Having
said that, personally I prefer not to drink b efore I go to a m atch. In any case, if I

am driving to an away match, I w ou ld not even consid er it.


Just after I went through the entran ce gates, the m ou n ted p olicem an m oved so as
to hold up the crowd in the street and I could se e that, gradually, the num ber o f

p e o p le waiting to get past him w as building up. T h ere did not appear to b e any

other assistance being given to control the num ber o f p e o p le still in the street
outside. Again, I thought how much better the situation had b e e n with last year’s
marshalling. After a short pause, m ore p e o p le w ere let in behind m e, but I had
not m oved at all because the crowd still in front o f m e s e e m e d to b e in exactly
the sam e position as it had b een w h en I was allow ed through the entrance gates

myself. This meant that I began to feel uneasy as the w h o le area w as becom ing
very crowded indeed. B efore long, a crush began to d e v e lo p and p e o p le were

then slowly being carried, along in the general direction o f the turnstiles.


I had earlier put m y.hand.in my p o c k e t.to m ake sure that my tic k e tw a s safe, but.
within a few m inutes, the crush had b e c o m e so in ten se that I was unable to m ove

my arm sufficiently to take rny hand out o f my p o c k e t again. I could not m ove in
any direction, other than that in w hich the crowd w as slow ly m oving - towards the

turnstiles. W e seem ed to be forced to take a cou p le o f short steps forwards by

the w eight o f p eop le behind us, and then the crowd w o u ld stop for a while.



B ecau se o f my height, I was actually able to s e e w h er e I was going, although I

had no control w hatsoever over th e w ay that I w as being'carried forward.
H ow ever, there w ere many shorter w o m e n and children all around m e w h o w ere

not e v e n able to se e w here they w ere, or w h ere they w ere going. W hat is m ore,

b ecau se o f their size they w ere in e v e n m ore d iscom fort that I was, and I was

b ecom in g very anxious myself. T h e increasing n um ber o f scream s, and the frantic

shouting that was going on near m e, indicated that I w as not alone. H ow ever,

further back many p e o p le s e e m e d unaw are o f this and they continued their

singing. I was able to se e over m o st p e o p le ’s h ead s in front o f m e, and it did not

appear as though there was a free-flo w o f p e o p le through th e turnstiles at all.
 Instead, the build-up o f p eop le at the front of the w orsening crush was ham pering
 those p eop le w ho were nearest to the turnstiles, as they tried to get through them.
 T h e reason that the crowd was m oving forward did not s e e m to be because
 p eop le w ere passing through the turnstiles, but rather that the pressure of p e o p le

 behind us was increasing. Certainly, the further forward I m oved, the m ore
 painful the crush becam e. H ow ever, there was nothing that I, or anyone around

 m e, could do about that becau se w e sim ply could n ot m o v e against the crowd.
 T h e only way to get out o f the crush s e e m e d to be to wait until w e had reached

 the front and then had a chance to g et through the turnstiles. Clearly, that was
 going to take quite so m e tim e, but w e had no choice.


 T h e m ounted policem an near to the turnstiles was shoutin g very angrily at p e o p le

 near him to m ove back, but. it w as sim ply im possible for them to m ove at a l l . .
 T h ose o f us further back, towards the m iddle o f the crush, could not m ove either.

 A ction was required at the very back o f the crush. P e o p le n e e d e d to be m oved
 at the back so that the pressure in the m iddle, Mid then at the front, could .be

 alleviated. T h ere was nothing to b e gained from directing instructions to those

 who w ere unable to m ove th em selves. Only by sending p e o p le backwards,

; starting with those already at the back,' w ould there have been" any hope o f vfeasing
 the pressure further forward. H o w ev er, once w e had passed through the outer

 blue entrance gates, it was not p o ssib le to move, back into the street due to the

 vast num ber o f p e o p le still trying to g et through th o se gates.



 T here was a brick w all a few fe e t to my left and m any p e o p le w ere being forced

 up against it. T h ey w ere calling out for the crowd to e a s e back away from them ,
 but none o f us w ere able to m o v e in order to help them . My colleagu e had b e e n

 standing slightly nearer to the w a ll than I had, and initially he had b e e n alm ost

 next to m e. H ow ever, as the crow d ed g ed forwards, it s e e m e d as though the

 p e o p le n earest to the w all w ere, in fact, m oving at a slightly slow er p ace than

 those nearer to the centre o f the crush. This m ean t that, as I finally n eared the

 front, I had lost sight o f my c o lle a g u e as he was slightly behind m e, as w ell as to
 the side.



 A s I reached the front, I had a clearer view o f the actu al turnstiles and I could

 s e e that many p e o p le w ere b ein g forced up against the w alls in b e tw e e n the
individual turnstiles, as well as into each other. Furtherm ore, a large blue
concertina gate to my left was causing a lot of pain for those w h o were being

pushed up against it. Many p e o p le in the crowd w ere calling out for the
concertina gate to b e opened in order to provide p e o p le with an escap e route

from the crush, and also to prevent anyone from b eing seriously hurt. T hese calls

had continued for several minutes as I had w aited for my own chance to reach

the turnstiles. E ven w hen p eop le w ere level with a turnstile, it w as still extrem ely
difficult to actually pass through b ecau se so many other p e o p le w ere also trying at

the sam e tim e. A t the front, the crowd was swaying from side to side so that on e
m inute I was facing a turnstile and the next m inute, a brick w all next to it.



I look ed across to the far turnstile over to my right, and I n oticed that a young
boy was b eing carried out, on his back, above p e o p le ’s heads. H e was wearing a '
L iverpool F.C. tracksuit top. H e was passed to a p o lic e m a n w ho, I suppose, may

have b e e n on horseback because he was clearly visible ab ove everyon e else,
although he was not in the crush him self. H e was, in fact, leaning around the end

of the turnstile wall in an attem pt to get hold o f the boy.



I have sin ce se en television’coverage which shows this'boy' being helped to safety ;

so that film w ould help to indicate the approxim ate tim e that I m anaged to get

into the ground, b ecau se it took m e a further 2 or 3 m inutes to get in. I would
guess that it was about 2.40-2.45, though.



It was a huge relief to get through the turnstile b e c a u se the situation outside had.

been deteriorating all the time. I had to wait another several m inutes before my

co llea g u e m anaged to get through the turnstile him self. I stood in the area

b e tw e e n the turnstiles and the tunnel entran ce to the centre terrace waiting for
him.



T h e calls that I had heard, w hen I was ou tsid e the ground, for the large

concertina gate to b e op en ed b eca u se o f the danger o f p e o p le b ein g hurt, were

still audible as I stood waiting inside. A num ber o f fans had actually clim bed up

on top o f a wall at the side o f the crush outside, and had w alked along to a led g e

directly ab ove th e turnstiles. A num ber o f p o lic e m e n inside the ground, b e tw e e n

the turnstiles and the entrance to the tunnel, lo o k e d con cern ed at this, so they
w ent over to stand just below the ledge. I could not hear what was said, but the
fans held up their still intact tickets and w ere then allow ed to jum p down to the

safety of the area w here I was waiting. I do not b e lie v e that, under norm al

circum stances, this type of action w ould have b e e n perm itted. I therefore
presum e that the p olic e m en who allow ed it to happ en w ere sufficiently satisfied
that the situation outside the turnstiles w as such that it warranted their use of
discretion as to h ow b est to allow p e o p le into the ground. Sending those p e o p le

w ho had clim bed over the wall back outside the ground w ould only have added to

the confusion outside. I b elieve that this fact was recognised by the police

officers inside the ground.


T h en I noticed my colleagu e com e through on e o f the turnstiles, and w e then ;

p roceed ed towards the tunnel directly op p osite the turnstiles which, I knew from
previous visits, led to the terface.


I only recall se ein g on e steward at the start o f the tunnel and h e w as m erely

observing those p e o p le who w ere passing through the tu n n e ls H ow ever, there
w ere two stewards at the fo o t'o f the steps to my right, which led to the se a tin g in

the W est Stand, and they w ere checking' tickets'as p e o p le w ent'past them and. up
the steps. N o check was m ade o f my ticket, or to m y know ledge, o f anyone e ls e ’s

ticket am ongst those entering, the tunnel.



O n each o f my previous visits, to H illsborough, I have stood in the area b e tw e e n

the turnstiles and the tunnel for several m inutes. D e s p ite having lo o k ed around

this area as I have w aited each time, I have no reco llec tio n o f .any signs, or

stewards, directing p e o p le to the terracing at the sid es. This equally applies to

my last visit on 15th April o f this year. I have to say that I did not know that
there was another way to gain access to the terracing, other than the way that I

could actually s e e directly in front o f m e - nam ely through the tunnel that led to
the centre sectio n o f terracing.



I did not recall there b ein g fencing at the sides actually on the terrace and, e v e n

if I had recalled that from my previous visits, as I cou ld not s e e an alternative

way onto the terrace, I’m sure I w ould still have w alk ed through the tunnel. I

rem em b er that w h en I have visited other football grounds, such as W atford and
L eicester City, which also have fences across the terraces, gates in them have
b e e n op en ed to allow p eople to pass through from on e section to another.

Indeed, I recall stewards at other m atches using such a system to system atically
fill sections o f the terrace as they w anted, before closing certain side gates and
then filling up another section. This prevented any o n e section from b ecom in g

too over-crowded. Such a system did n ot exist at H illsborough. T h ere w ere no

gates in the side fences, as far as I could see.


The point that I am m aking is that, d esp ite having se e n the ground before, its lay­
out was certainly not clear to me and, in the ab sen ce o f instructions or directions,

I entered the terrace section by what a m ou n ted to the only way I thought was

possible. I had tim e to survey the area, so I fe e l sure that so m e o n e w h o is in a
hurry to enter the terracing, unless they w ere already aware o f a route to the

quter edges o f the terrace, or w ere to b e directed by so m e o n e , w ould also follow

the route that' I took. O f course, this route led to the m ost crow ded part o f the
terrace, although from anywhere other than inside the ground it w ou ld not b e

possible to actually see this. N everth eless, it is w ell know n by anyone w h o has
ever b e e n to a football match, that the area directly behind a goal is a

particularly popular place to stand, if. that drea is, o f course, a terrace rather than
a seating area. Consequently, such areas are always m ore crow ded than the

edges o f a terrace.



A s I started walking through the tunnel, I could se e daylight above p e o p le ’s heads

but I could see that the far end o f the tunnel was .obstructed by the sheer num ber

o f p e o p le congregated around it. A lth ou gh I thought, at that m om ent, that this

was only to be exp ected for such a big m atch just b e fo re kick-off, I rem em b er

thinking w h en I actually reached the far end o f the tunnel, that I was com p letely
surprised by just how full the area already was.



I found it difficult ev en getting through this w all o f p e o p le on to the start o f the

terrace, but as I did, I soon realised that it w ould be b e st not to try and m ove
directly towards the goal, because that area was already far to o packed. It was

also difficult to m o v e to either side, so the only direction in w h ich I could se e any
h ope o f finding a place to stand, in any d eg ree o f com fort, w as to m ove

diagonally forwards. This is what I did. In fact, I m o v ed diagonally to my right



                                              10
and my colleagu e follow ed behind me. A s I e d g e d my way fonvard, I could see
that there appeared to be slightly m ore room nearer the front. In any case, I

w an ted to try and get a clearer view as m uch as anything at this tim e.



I was already aware that the area that I was standing in w as alm ost certainly
m ore densely populated than it had b e e n at any stage o f last year’s sem i-final. I

was particularly worried about this, in view o f th e fact that I knew how many
p eop le w ere still trying to get into the ground. I thought that it w ould just not be
possib le to accom m od ate any m ore p eop le in the centre section o f the terrace. I
reassured myself, how ever, that there did appear to b e far m ore spaces on the

side sections o f the terracing and that, therefore, p e o p le still trying to get in
w ould b e directed to those areas, surely. It w o u ld b e clear, at a glance, for

anyone inside the ground that this cen tre-section w as dangerously overcrowded,

w h ereas there was still plenty o f room on the sid e section beyond the side fence.

This had not b e e n visible b efore I had gone through the tunnel, th ou gh t I began
to wish that I had b e e n able to stand in the side se ctio n m yself, but I cou.ld not

se e any way o f getting to it.


W ith .the m atch ;due to b egin within a m atter o f minutes,' I found m yself standing

with a barrier directly in front o f m e . ' I'-know, from past experience o f capacity

m atches, that it is usually far m ore com fortab le to stand with a barrier just behind

rather than just in front o f you. T h e only direction in w hich I could m ove was

forward, so I d ecid ed to duck underneath the barrier. A num ber o f other people'
did the sam e thing, and so although I stood up just the oth er side of the barrier,

the additional p eop le w ho follow ed m e caused m e to b e p u sh ed further forward,

and nearer to the perim eter fence. A t this stage, how ever, there still appeared to

b e m ore ro o m w h ere I was standing than w h ere I had previously b een standing,

and I w as relieved that the barrier w as no lo n g er im m e d ia te ly in front o f me.

T h ere w e r e n o m ore barriers b e tw e e n m e and the p erim eter fen ce - only people.
T h er e is always som e crowd m ovem en t during a m atch, and I feared that I would

continually b e pushed up against the barrier u n le ss I m oved . My colleagu e had

not ducked under the barrier, though. Instead, h e had m an aged to m ove

backw ards slightly and he w as standing about 10 fe e t b eh in d m e.
Gradually, I was feeling the pressure o f the crowd increasing all around and it
was b ecom in g veiy uncom fortable. I was now standing about 3 feet away from

the perim eter fen ce in the centre section o f the terrace slightly to the right o f the
goal. A s I stood there, I was acutely aware that the situation was becom in g

rather desperate, and that it was in danger of b ecom in g extrem ely serious. I had

never exp erienced anything like it before. T here se e m e d to b e no control,
w hatsoever, o n the num ber o f p e o p le b eing allow ed in.


E ven b efore the team s w ere on the pitch, p eop le all around m e, but mainly in
front o f m e, w ere calling out for s o m e o n e to help them . S o m e w ere scream ing

and so m e w h o w ere able to m ove th em selves w ere trying to clim b out. ‘ Their
attem pts to escap e were seem ingly interpreted by the p o lic e m e n on the other side
o f the fen ce as an attempt to invade the pitch. I could hear fans protesting as

they w ere being restrained on top o f the fences by p o lic e m e n . . 'Som eone actually

called out that he thought that so m e p e o p le at the front, by the fen ce, w ere dying,'
but he w as pushed back off the top o f the fence and o n to the terrace again.

Clearly, those early warnings w ere not b ein g h eed ed , d esp ite the increasingly
w idespread pleas for assistance and scream s.            .              •



At this-stage, although I could not m o v e from the s p o t w h ere I was standing, I

had b e e n able to raise my arms from by my sides to steady m yself and so avoid
falling over if the crowd b egan to sway. A t the tim e, that s e e m e d a natural

reaction, although there w ere alm ost certainly too m any p e o p le already packed in ­

to en a b le such a sway to take place. Gradually, h ow ever, the situation se em e d to ...

be getting w orse and w orse, and I could feel that m ore and m ore p e o p le w ere

being allow ed on to the centre terrace, despite the already dangerous

overcrow ding. T h e crush was getting tighter all the tim e.



T h ere w ere now m ore p o lic e m e n and so m e St. J o h n ’s A m b u la n c e m en gathering
on th e other side o f the fen ce obscuring my view o f th e pitch, so I did not se e

w h en the team s actually cam e o u t o n the pitch, but I h eard a roar from th e crowd

which sign alled the m om en t that this did take place.



I rem em b er thinking "God, no. P le a se d o n ’t bring th e m o u t now . Things will

only g e t w o r se ”.
Regrettably, that roar from the crowd coincided with an increase in pressure on

the terrace as p eop le w ho had not, at that tim e, taken up their positions, would
have b e e n alerted to the fact that the match w as about to start, and they would

be rushing so as not to miss anything. U nfortunately, my fears had b e e n realised.


From that m om ent on, I found m yself pressed up against the person in front o f

m e and both my arms w ere pinned b e tw e e n other p e o p le ’s bodies. T hat then

m eant that the only part o f my ow n body that I was cap ab le o f m oving was my
head.



A lthough my w h ole body was in severe discom fort, m y left arm, left leg and back

w ere in the m ost pain. In particular, a teen a g e girl w h o had been, standing next
to m e had her head twisted round facing m e, and the sid e o f her face was being

forced u p against the upper part o f my left arm. T h e excruciating pain in my arm

was alm ost unbearable, and I feared that my arm w as sim ply going to snap under

the pressure. A ll I could s e e o f the girl was her face, ..as the rest o f her body was
being sm oth ered by other p eo p le. Sh e was clearly in a great deal o f pain. H er

h ead was'ift a vice betw een 'my arm and the body o f a n o th e t m an behind her. It

was im possible for any o f us to m ove at all.


I could tell .that the poor girl w as having difficulty breath in g and she was

incapable o f speaking, becau se her face was b ein g s q u e e z e d so tightly that it was

being contorted. H er expression did not se em to c h a n g e and her tear-filled eyes

w ere just staring straight at m e, p lead in g with m e to h elp her. A lthough her eyes

w ere full o f tears, it was alm ost as though the pressu re b e in g exerted on her head
was preventing those tears from flow ing dow n her face.



A s I found m yself captivated by this d esperate sight n ex t to m e, I could fe e l a

foot tapping o n m ine, gently at first, but soon it b e c a m e m o re agitated, and I felt

sure that it must have b elon ged to th e girl b e c a u se it had only started w h en I first

lo o k ed at her. I knew that signal m ea n t that sh e n e e d e d h elp urgently.



I turned m y head and saw a p o lic e w o m a n directly in fron t o f m e, so I called out

to her. S h e looked at m e as I started shouting, so I k n o w that she heard m e. I
pleaded with her to do som ething for the girl next to m e, either herself, or to call
for assistance. She simply look ed away.


I asked m yself why there w ere so m any p e o p le on      th e other sid e o f the fen ce

looking at the situation, but just standing still and       not actually m oving? W e were
the ones not able to m ove. W e n e e d e d to be h e lp e d by those w h o could m ove.

T h en I noticed s o m e o n e running towards the fen ce. A t last, I thought, s o m e o n e

was going to help us. A s the m an reached the fen ce , he lifted up a cam era to his

face and then just w alked away in search o f another picture!


T h e pressure o f the crowd had b e e n building up gradually to the point w here I
could no longer m ove at all, and I did think that it could not p o ssib le increase
any m ore. H ow ever, I do recall a sudden instance w h en the pain b e c a m e evert

m ore intense, and the prejssure on my body ev en greater. I rem em b er yelling out
at this m om en t and m any other p eo p le, particularly behind m e, also called out at

the sariie tim e. I b elieve that the m atch was still in p rogress-b ecau se I could still

hear m uch o f the crowd reacting to the play o n the pitch w ith ch eers and
applause, unaw are o f what w as happening all around m e. I could n ot actually see

the players, though, becau se my view :was still obstru cted by the m otionless

p e o p le on the other side o f the fence.



I thought b ecau se so many other p e o p le had called out at the sa m e tim e as me,

particularly in th e area behind m e, indicating a w id esp read increase in the level

o f pain b ein g endured, that there m ust have b e e n a surge at the back and that

ev en m ore p e o p le w ere trying to get in. It was the sud d en n ess o f that pain and

the sim ultan eou s shouts and scream s that I r e m e m b e r vividly.



This did s e e m to prom pt so m e action o n the pitch in front o f m e. T h e p o lice

w ere beginning to look m ore anxiously towards the back o f the terrace, w h ereas
b efore their gaze s e em e d to have b e e n fixed u p on th o se w h o w e r e suffering at

the front. S o m e o f them actually clim bed onto the fen ce th e m se lv e s to try and
get a clear view o f the rear o f the terrace. This th e n created a gap in m y line of

vision, w hich enab led m e to s e e the pitch and s o m e o f the players. T h ey w ere
standing still. T h e m atch ap p eared to have b e e n halted.
  T here w ere quite a few p eop le now standing on the touchline and so m e w ere also

  on the pitch. S om e w ere p o licem en , so m e St. John’s A m b u lan ce m en and som e
  spectators who had b e e n able to climb out. They appeared to be arguing with
  each other and th en they pointed at us.



  T h e players then turned and w alked o ff the pitch and, as this was happening, I

  saw a m an lying on his back in front o f m e, just on the e d g e o f the pitch. S o m e
  p olic e m en were kneeling dow n next to him. S o m e o n e had taken o ff the m an i

  shirt and pulled dow n his trousers, and the p o lic e m en w ere giving h im the kiss-of-
  life. I am sure that was the first tim e that I saw s o m e o n e b eing atten d ed to on

 . the pitch, because I rem em ber it having such an im pression u p on m e. It only
  served to .confirm my fears that p e o p le w ere in real trouble. T h e m a n on his
  back did not appear to be m oving at all. H e was a large man, and that show ed                      .
  me that even size and strength ccrnld not save som e p e o p le from b ein g crushed. I

  knew that I had to try and keep my rib-cage above the crush and k e e p breathing.
  In that respect, .my h e ig h t o f 6’ 2Vi'- was absolutely invaluable.



 •As attem pts to -revive the m an on his back continued, th e num ber o f p e o p le

. m oving onto the pitch steadily increased:.- Fans, p o lic e m e n and am b u la n cem en

' ;alike w ere carrying limp bodies onto the playing area. S o m e w ere p um m elling                     .

  hearts with their hands, others w ere giving m outh -to-m outh resuscitation.



... I could s e e that a very narrow gate in the perim eter fen ce several yards to the left

  o f w h ere I was standing had b e e n o p e n e d , and p o lic e m e n w ere trying to extricate

  those nearest to it from the tangle o f bodies. T h eir efforts proved largely
  fruitless, because e v en w h en they se e m e d to have hold o f p e o p le , th e sheer

  com p ression that existed at the front of the terrace served only to thwart attem pts
  to r elea se them.



  This was the only gate in the fen ce that I could se e. T h er e w ere n o n e near to

  w h ere I was standing. O nly the p e o p le nearest to that gate had any chance o f

  getting through it. Still the only thing that I could m o v e w as m y h ead , so I knew

  that there was n o prospect o f b e in g able to reach th e gate m yself. A num ber o f
  p e o p le behind m e had b e e n able to raise th em selv es ab ove the crush and they

  literally clim bed over the heads and shoulders o f th o se still trapped around m e
until they reached the perim eter fence, and then ju m p ed dow n on the oth er side
to safety.



E ven at this stage, m any p o licem en w ere still lin ed up along the tou ch lin e and

w ere restraining som e o f those w ho had b e e n a b le to free th em selves from
encroaching onto the pitch. T h o se fans w ould have b e e n aware o f w hat w as

happening on the terraces w here they had just b e e n standing, and so th e y s e em e d
anxious to get onto the pitch to help those w h o w e r e lying injured.


Gradually, however, m any o f those p o lic e m e n b e g a n to realise that their h elp was

n e e d e d in trying to evacuate the terrace area, rather than preventing th o se w ho
had escap ed from walking on the pitch. W h en this realisation did sink in, the

trickle o f p e o p le being carried onto, the pitch to re ce iv e attention soon b e c a m e a
flood.   Unfortunately, though, judging by-the n um ber o f heads which w e r e being

covered with discarded item s o f clothing, it was already far too late.


T h en I'n oticed that an-, am bulance w as slow ly m ovin g in front o f the p erim eter
fen ce until it reached an area just behind the goal, slightly to my left. It w as then

force'cf'to stop because, there w ere a num ber o f p e o p le lying on the ground in its

path. -T hese p eop le w ere com pletely still.



I lo o k ed back at the girl standing next to m e. H e r fo o t w as no longer tapping on

m ine, and the grim ace on her face had b e e n rep la ced by a ghastly vacant
expression; I realised that she had died. N o t only w e r e p e o p le dying u p against

the fen ce, but they w ere dying next to w h ere I w as standing as well. A lth o u g h the

girl was dead, the pressure being exerted o n my arm by her jaw -bone w as still

causing m e to wince with pain. She was still in exactly the sam e p osition that she

had b e e n w h en she was alive.



T h e continuing pain in my arm, com b in ed with having to withstand the force

being exerted o n the rem ainder o f m y body, w as n e c e ssita tin g m uch h ea v ier than
norm al breathing and I was beginning to fe e l q u ite exhausted . I did not think

that I w ou ld b e able to c o p e for m uch longer w ith m y frightful pred icam en t and I
could s e e n o sign o f any forthcom ing assistance to e a s e m y plight.
I then thought that I too would suffer the sam e fate as the girl on my arm and

that, before long, I w ould also b e dead.


Knowing that I was totally unab le to help m yself or, indeed, anyone e ls e around

me, and having se e n no signs o f en cou ragem en t in front o f m e, I had accep ted
the fact that soon my pain and suffering w ould stop and that I w ou ld not feel

anything at all.


A t that tim e, my sen se o f panic s e e m e d to disappear as it m erely s e e m e d futile.
Instead, my thoughts turned to my fam ily and m y girlfriend. I could se e their

faces in my mind, but the im ages w ere blurred. I felt desperately sad as I thought
of how distraught they w ould b e. I just w an ted to b e with th e m again, so that I

could say goodbye "properly". I tried to bring their im ages into focus so that I

could be with them in spirit, but they m erely faded.


Som eh ow I was b ecom in g oblivious o f the situ ation I w as in, and strangely I was          .

distancing m yself from it as if I had played m y part in it, but that it was about to

co m e to an end.


I began to feel that I was m erely a bystander w atching a rather shocking film that

I could turn o ff anytim e I w anted. H ow ever, I lo o k e d up at the top o f the stand
to my right and saw a row o f television cam eras w hich w ere p o in ted towards us.

I then came- out o f the trance that I had a llow ed m yself to fall into, and realised

that I w as very m uch part o f the horror that w as goin g on all around. I had

kidded m yself that I was lookin g through a c a m era at the terrible sc e n e s in front

o f m e, but in fact they w ere trained o n m e as w ell.



T h ere w ere, by now, large num bers o f p e o p le o n th e pitch clu stered in small

groups attending to an ever-increasing num ber o f casualties. M any advertisem ent

hoardings had b e e n ripped dow n and w ere b e in g used as m akesh ift stretchers to

carry th ose w h o w ere injured. M ost o f th ese "stretchers" that I saw w ere being

carried by spectators rather than am b u lan cem en , and their faces sh o w e d clear

signs o f strain as they ran towards th e area b e lo w th e telev isio n gantry o n the
right-hand side o f the pitch as I look ed , b efo re returning to carry oth er injured

fans.
 T h ere w ere many bodies lying covered all over the place, but still som e of the

 injured w ere receiving m outh-to-m outh resuscitation and still p e o p le w ere using

 their bare hands to try and force hearts to beat again.


 Eventually, I noticed that the crush se e m e d to be easing slightly behind me, and I

 was able to m ove my arms for the first tim e sin ce th e initial surge had rendered

 them useless. T h en w hoever had b e e n forced up against my back m oved away

 from m e slightly, and I was able to stand upright. G a p s started appearing in the
 terrace and I was able to take a step backwards. A t that m om ent, I looked down

 at my feet and I noticed two bodies face down, o n e lying across the other, at
 alm ost the exact spot w here I had b e e n standing all that tim e.


 A m an cam e over towards m e and he helped m e to lift up a young boy. W e

 turned him over and then. I felt ill. T h e boy’s face was blue and his m outh was a
 dark shade o f purple. H e m ust have b e e n dea.d for s o m e tim e. H e had probably

 b e e n lying on the ground ever sin ce-th e crush began, unknow n to everyone, not
 that anybody w ould have b e e n able to pick him up e v e n if they had known he

 was lying there. Hd was probably iij his m id-teens with dark hair and, I think,
. w earing a dark blue.anqrak. This is the body that was lying bn top o f the other

 on e. I had to just help the m an lift his body onto the p erim eter fen ce and two

 other m en took him from us.       •



. D uring the tim e that I was in a trance, my re co llec tio n o f events is som ew hat

 vague and by the tim e that I had c o m e out o f that trance, and was able to m o ve

 slightly, I do not recall seeing the girl that h ad died on my arm.



 T h ere was now space to m ove alm ost right up to the fen ce, although there w ere

 m any bodies lined up against it, and p e o p le w ere b egin n in g to lift them too. I
 m anaged to lift on e m ore child’s body over the fen ce, although I am unable to

 describe this ch ild because, although I did lift the body, I have absolutely no

 r eco llectio n o f any physical features w h atsoever. I s e e m to recall alm ost se ein g a

 m ere outline o f this person in my m ind, and no m ore. I had b e e n so shocked by

 the sight o f the young boy, that it w as alm ost as though my m ind refused to
 a ccep t any m ore punishm ent for the tim e being.
II
«              The effects of the crush on my arm m ade the grim task physically very difficult.

               The other m en that were helping in the lifting operation could see that I had

I              b een hurt, and there was no w ay that I w ould have b e e n able to lift heavier

               bodies than those that I had already struggled with, so they insisted that I was
               h elp ed out o f the centre terrace section myself. H ow ever, I could not get over
               the p erim eter fen ce at the front, b ecau se its height m ea n t that, ev en with

               assistance, I would have needed to pull m yself up and over in order to get onto
P
jL             the pitch, which I w ould not have b e e n able to do with my injury. So instead,
               s o m e o n e helped m e over the low er fen ce at the side w hich led to the sparsely

T              pop u lated side terrace section. E v e n though this fen ce w as low er than the on e at


lb             the front, I had difficulty negotiating it b eca u se o f my arm and also because the
               sheer exhaustion caused by the crush had m ad e m e fe e l giddy.


I              B ecau se I felt unsteady on the top o f the fen ce, I did not w ant to jum p over until
P jj           I felt that I could land safely o n my feet, b eca u se the terrace was obviously solid

 |'            concrete. T h e m an who still had hold o f m e called to two m en o n the side
       .       terrace for help, and they cam e over to try and catch m e. T h ey told m e to jum p

           V   but, 'unfortunately, they only s u c c ee d e d in breaking my*'fall, and I actually' landed'
               on m y'left knee.



               T hey ch eck ed that I was not too badly injured and h e lp e d m e to stand up. T he

               red stain on my trouser leg' betrayed the fact that my k n e e was bleeding. I was

               able to stand, though, and although it certainly hurt, at least I thought that m eant

               that I had not broken anything.                    •
                                                        i

               T h e two m en then w ent off to s e e w h o e ls e they could h e lp as I lea n ed against a

               barrier and just tried to catch my breath and c o m p o se m yself as best I could. My

               nose w as also bleeding, but I w as just so relieved to h ave got out alive. I really
               had not thought that I was going to.



               I lo o k ed around at the stunned faces on the terrace. M any w ere crying

               unasham edly. A fter a few m inutes, I m anaged to g e t m y n o se -b le e d under

               control, and I lim ped back to the side fen ce that I had e sc a p e d over. By this

               tim e, the front o f the area w here I had b e e n trapped had b e e n virtually cleared.



                                                             19
H ow ever, a few yards further back there w ere still many p e o p le congregated in

the centre section of the terrace, but they w ere able to m ove freely by now. I
could not see any rem aining injured fans in this area and the danger appeared to

have passed. As I began to reflect u pon w h at had happ en ed , I stared at the
nearly-empty front section o f the terrace and found that I could no longer hold

back my own tears. Y es - it really had happened.


T h en I looked towards the back o f the right-hand side section o f terrace that I
was standing in, and noticed that the p e o p le at the front o f the stand above w ere
ripping dow n the advertisem ent hoardings just in front o f their seats, and w ere
passing them dow n on to the terrace. I had earlier se e n the use to w hich similar

hoardings had b e e n put while I was still trapped m yself, so I thought that m ore
"stretchers" w ere n e e d e d on the pitch.


T h ere w ere not m any p eop le standing near the side fen ce (that I had escap ed

over)'-.but this is w h ere the hoardings w ere b ein g passed to. I, and three others,
got hold o f o n e o f the hoardings' and carried it above our heads, a short way up

to the perimeter, fence. I was careful to take the w eight m ainly with my right

arm,, being m indful o f the injury, that I had sustained to my oth er arm. - A s we
w ere passing the hoarding over the fence, so m e p e o p le just- behind w e r e waiting

to pass another on e to us. A t the sa m e tim e, som e oth er hoardings w e r e being

passed over the side fen ce into the centre section of th e terrace.



Since the events at H illsborough, I have s e e n a photograph in th e L iverpool E ch o

which show ed w'hat, I am certain, is this very m om ent. A lth o u g h the cam era is

too far away for it to b e possib le to positively identify m yself, th e num ber and

position o f the hoardings is just h ow I rem em b er them . T h e official ground clock,

clearly visible in the photograph, shows th e tim e as 15.37. F ro m this, I am able

to d ed u ce that I was probably trapped on th e centre terrace until about 15.30, or

thereabouts.


H aving passed th e hoardings over th e fen ce, my thoughts turned to my colleagu e

w h o I had b e c o m e separated from e v e n b efo re the tea m s had c o m e o n to the

pitch. T h e last tim e that I had s e e n him, h e w as ab ou t 10 fe e t b eh in d m e and I
felt sure that he w ould not have b e e n in the sam e danger that I had b e e n in,

b ecau se the worst part of the crush s e em e d to have b e e n concentrated along the

length o f the perim eter fence, and back just as far as the first set o f barriers
which w ere nearest to it. This had at least se e m e d the case w h en I had b een

trapped, because so m e people behind m e had b e e n able to climb out over the top

o f those o f us at the front.


N everth eless, I was naturally concern ed to find him, in view o f what I had seen
happening to other people. I sto o d and scanned the cen tre terrace sectio n to se e
if he was still am ongst those w h o had rem ained in that part o f the ground, and

then likew ise around the side section o f the terrace w h er e I was standing myself,

but to no avail.


I then hobb led dow n towards.a gate in the p erim eter fe n c e and a p olicem an o n

the other side helped .to lift m e through it .and onto th e pitch. H e asked if I
n e e d e d my leg seein g to, but as that was n ot o f im m e d ia te concern to m e, I

replied that I w ould be all right.


I started'looking round at p e o p le on the pitch in an attem p t to reunite'm yself
with m y colleague. By this time, m ost p e o p le w ere standing around and it            ■

appeared that m ost o f the injured fans had already b e e n taken care of. T h ere
w ere still a few injured p eop le receiving attention, b u t for m ost p e o p le o n the

pitch th ere did not s e em to be any further assistance that they could give. A s I
w alked across the pitch, grown m en w h o had b e e n reu n ited with their friends

w ere standing with their arms round each other, crying o n each oth er’s shoulders.

E veryone around knew just how they felt and shared in their sense o f r elief at

finding e a ch other, but at the sam e tim e th ere w as an atm osp h ere o f num bness at

the sh ock o f s e e in g so many w h o had suffered so m uch.



D e sp ite having earlier convinced m yself that my c o lle a g u e w ould have b e e n safe

w h ere h e w as standing, I began to fe e l anxious that m a y b e som eth in g had
h ap p en ed to him. I looked back at th e terraces b e h in d th e goal and w alked

along th e touchline to try and catch sight o f him, but th e re was no sign o f him

anyw here.
 I w alked around the perim eter o f the pitch in front o f the stands and then
 backwards and forwards across the pitch, but still nothing.



T h en I also rem em bered that the m edia w ere covering the m atch, and feared that

 my family and my girlfriend w ould b e sitting at h om e aware o f the tragedy that
 had just occurred, and w ould be fearing for my safety.          I thought that I would

 have to let them know that I was all right as so o n as I possibly could, to stop

 them worrying about me. I thought about trying to g e t to a tele p h o n e outside,
 but nobody appeared to be leaving the ground and, in d eed , there had b e e n an
 annou ncem ent over the public address system requesting that p e o p le did not
 leave the ground in order to avoid causing con gestion in the streets around the
 stadium, which n e e d e d to be kept clear to allow am bulances to gain access. So I

. thought that I w ould have to stay w here I was. I k n ew that I had to g et in touch
 with th ose at h om e soon - but how could I?                .


 I w andered around not knowing what to do, and I w as getting increasingly

 w orried about not being able to allay the fears o f my lo v ed ones. T h en I noticed
 that the N ottingham F orest manager, had co m e onto th e pitch, and w as being
 interview ed by a television crew. T h ere was a cordon o f p olice across the'w idth

.' o f the pitch b etw een m e and the im prom ptu gathering o f n ew sm en by the players’

 tunnel entrance, but I thought that here w as m y ch an ce to pass m y m essage

 h om e, so I casually w alked through the p olice line, exp ectin g to b e questioned,

 but I was allow ed to pass through unchallen ged . I w a s confused as to why it had
 b e e n d e e m e d necessary for there to b e such a line th e re anyway at this tim e. I

 then w ent over towards the group o f p e o p le w h o had converged around Brian

 C lough and n oticed that there w as another hand-held television cam era on the

 pitch nearer to m e, filming two fans w h o had e sca p ed the crush. O ut o f

 desperation, I w alked up behind them and put my h e a d b e tw e e n theirs in an

 attem pt to get m yself se e n on television and sh ow e veryon e at h o m e that I was
 alive. I just m ou th ed the w ords "I’m all right. I’m all right" as if I w as talking

 directly to my family and the cam eram an was providing a link-up service. T h en I

 realised, how ever, that any pictures w ere probably b e in g recorded and edited, so

 the chances w ere, that idea w ou ld not have had the d esired effect, so I frantically
 tried to think o f som ething else.
T h en I noticed a ground official nearby with a portable telephone. I thought that

my prayers had b een answered, so I w alked over to w h ere he was standing and
gave him my ’p h on e num ber and plead ed with him to ring it for m e. H e dialled
the first half o f the num ber and then the screen just w e n t blank. T h e battery had
g o n e becau se he had ’phoned for so m any other p e o p le b efore I had reached

him. I was becom in g increasingly perturbed over the fact that the nightmare that
I thought had en d ed w hen I m anaged to escap e from the crush, was continuing
for different reasons.



I then w alked back to the Leppings L ane end o f th e ground, w here I had
originally b e e n trapped. The centre section o f the terracing was now occupied by
a num ber o f p olic e m en w h o w ere sitting dow n w ith their helm ets in their hands,
looking just as dazed and shocked as everyon e else . S o m e o f them w ere crying as-

they reflected up on the awfulness o f w hat they had w itnessed.



I could not decid e what to do next. Should I stay in th e ground and try and find
my colleague,, or should I try and leave and lo o k for a public tele p h o n e to ’p h on e

.home? I again reassured m yself that-my c o lle a g u e -w o u ld have b e e n in a-far
better position than m e, and, as I had survived, so I felt sure that no harm would

have com e to him. In any case, w hen w e had first arrived we. had agreed to meet-

back at the car if w e w ere separated for any reason, although obviously at that

tim e w e did not envisage the circum stances w hich w e r e to lead to that becom ing

a reality. T hat’s it, I thought. H e ’ll b e back at the car w on dering w here I am.



I w ent over to the c o m e r o f the pitch, w h ere I saw s o m e o n e going through a gate

back onto the terrace. I asked a p o lic e m a n w h o w as standing by the gate

w hether it w as possib le to get out o f the ground, e v e n th ou gh the vast majority o f

p e o p le w ere still in their places. H e directed m e d ow n a sid e passage which led

away from the sid e section o f the terrace, having told m e that it led to the exit.

T his w as the first tim e that I had realised that th ere w as another e n tra n ce /e x it

lead ing to the terrace, other than the tunnel by w h ich I had gained access to the
terrace myself.
H alf-w ay along the passage, I cam e across a supporter w h o was walking in the
opposite direction, back towards the terrace. H e actually asked m e if I knew
w hether the m atch was still going to b e played or not!        I just hop e that he had
not b een aware o f the scale o f what had happ en ed if h e was able to ask such a

question. H e could not possibly have se en the sort o f scen es that I had
w itnessed, surely. I half looked at him and m uttered "I sincerely h o p e not",

before continuing along the passage to the exit.



T h e gam e was over as far as I w as concern ed . H ow could they possibly play a
m atch now? I thought o f the young victims that I had s e e n crushed to death. It
w asn’t just their ages and the num ber o f b odies that I had s e e n that distressed
m e, it was the way they had died which was so terrible. T h ey had know n what
was happening to them , just as I had know n what w as h app en ing to m e. T h e only
differen ce was that I still knew, and always w ould - but they knew n o m ore.


M atch. W hat m atch?



I w alked out into the street and saw that other p e o p le had already left the
g r o u n d .. A m an was banging, his. h a n d ,o n the- side .of avpolice car which had
parked on the other side o f the road, directly o p p o site /th e Leppings Lane

turnstiles. H e w as shouting at the driver. N o attem pt w as m ad e by other p olice

officers around to restrain the man. H e was not b ein g aggressive or threatening,

he was rather expressing his anger and frustration. W hilst I w ould n ot wish to

con d on e his actions in any way, I could understand that an exp erien ce such as

that endured by so many p e o p le that day, and m aybe also by the m an I saw in

front o f m e, could quite easily provoke such an u n b alan ced response. A lthough I.

could understand his em otion, I did n ot agree with w h at h e w as d oin g and I could

not se e it achieving anything. H ow ever, I do think that his state o f despair was

resp onsible for his behaviour.



I b e lie v e that this w as also recognised by th ose p e o p le around the m an w h o w ere
calm ly trying to diffuse the situation, and so prevent it from b ecom in g

confrontational. A lthough I did not w ait to s e e if th ere w e r e any further

d evelop m en ts, I w ould not consider w hat I saw to b e interpretable as a criminal
offence.

        I w ould stress, m ost strongly, that the incident that I have just described was the
        only tim e during the w h ole afternoon that I had personally seen any action which

        I w ould describe as "disagreeable". Prior to that, every action o f the fans that I
        had se en had b e e n totally adm irable, beyond reproach and, at tim es, quite heroic.
        From the tim e that I was trapped on the terrace, until I actually left the ground,
        the im pression that I had was that m ost o f the initiative was being show n by fans
        them selves w h o had b e e n aware o f the scale o f the p ro b le m far soon er than those

        p eop le w h o had b e e n on the other side o f the fen ce from the beginning.



        A s I w alked away from the ground, my im m ed iate p r o b le m was to find a
        telep h on e. H aving turned left and w alked up a hill, th e first public tele p h o n e
        that I ca m e to had a queue o f about a d o zen or m ore p e o p le waiting to use it. I
        realised that I n e ed ed to ’phone as quickly as possible, so I w ent in search o f

        another o n e. Regrettably, I found a similar situation at the next o n e also. M any
        o f the shops nearby w ere closed, but I cam e across o n e which was o p e n and I

        asked the assistant if there was a ’p h o n e that I could use. She sh ow ed m e to the .

        back room and I joined a short q u eu e o f fans w aiting to use. it. R ecogn isin g

        everyon e’s sen se of.urgency,■all;calls w ere kept as b rief a s.p ossib le and,, for the..:*.,
        benefit o f those behind me in the queue, I asked my father .to ring my girlfriend

        for m e w h en .I eventually reached the front o f the q u eu e. E veryone e lse s e e m e d '
        to be m aking just o n e call and listing other p e o p le that should b e contacted on

        their behalf. It was only fair.


    4   H aving left the shop, I still felt that I w anted to speak to my girlfriend myself, so

        that. I w o u ld know w hether or not the m essa g e had b e e n passed on, in order to

        ea se my m ind. I carried o n walking, but each q u eu e in the little shops se e m e d to

        b e getting longer and longer. E veryone s e e m e d to h ave had the sam e idea.



        I n oticed so m e residents had c o m e out into their front gardens and w ere chatting

        to each other over their fences. T h ey s e e m e d to b e aw are that som eth in g was
        going on, so I asked a lady w h ether I could use her ’p h o n e. She kindly allow ed

        m e to, and I was able to speak to my girlfriend. A fter expressing my gratitude to

        the lady, I th en realised that m y p lea for help had p rom p ted others to follow , and

        a q u eu e had already form ed in her hallway. I h o p e that sh e did not m ind. Sh e

n o doubt on those who ’phoned after m e. I had just m ad e the two m ost precious

’p h o n e calls o f my life.


T h a t was o n e great weight off my mind, but now I had to try and get back to the
car and ch eck that my colleague was there. I did not know exactly w here I was,

b e c a u se I had approached the ground from a totally different direction to the way

that I had w alked in search o f a te le p h o n e . I decid ed that the b est thing to do
w as to walk back to the ground and then I knew that I w ould b e able to find my
way back from there.


A fter about five minutes, I arrived back at the ground and by this tim e p e o p le

had clearly b e e n asked to leave the stad ium and many p e o p le w ere filing out into

the streets.


It took m e about another 20 m inutes to w alk back to the car, and w h en I finally
reached it there was no sign of anyone w aiting there. A family w ere standing in

 their driveway nearby, so I gave th em a brief description o f m y c o lle a g u e and

 asked if they had se en anybody w aiting by the car, and they confirm ed that
 som eb od y had b een, but that'-he had w alk ed back in the-.direction that he had

 co m e from after a few minutes. T h e fam ily could se e that I w as very upset and

 that I had b e e n injured, so they took m e into their house. Fortunately, o n e of
 them was a nurse and she looked at m y injured arm for m e, S h e thought that the

 injury was not too serious, although sin ce the full extent o f crush injuries are not

 visible, she could not give a full diagnosis. She did, how ever, put so m e cream on

 it for m e, which she said w ould help until I was able to have a proper

 exam ination.


 T h e tim e m ust have b e e n about 4.40-4.45, b eca u se the tele v isio n w as on in the

 h ou se and th e football scores w ere b ein g show n o n B B C 1. I co u ld not b elieve
 that th e se w e r e d e e m e d to have b e e n o f any significance w h atsoever, considering

 w hat had just happened, but then I did not know what coverage, if any, had

 already b e e n given to the scen es at H illsb orou gh that I had w itn essed . I did not

 have to w ait long, as the program m e sw itched to a s c e n e w h ich w as already

 indelibly etch ed in my mind. T h e talk w as o f at least 5 0 fatalities and over 100

 injured. A t the very least, I thought.

m    T h o se o f us who enjoy watching the sport deplore the behaviour o f those who do

     se ek to spoil spectators’ enjoym ent as m uch as anybody else does but, on this

     In this account, I have tried to describe s o m e o f the e m o tio n s that I w ent through
     that day. N o words, w hether w ritten or spoken, can possibly fully convey the
     sh eer horror o f the experience that I or, indeed, anyone e lse w ent through.
     .Whilst I have produced this report to the best o f m y ability, inevitably I feel that

     it is in com p lete insofar as it d oes not portray a full picture o f w hat it was really

     like. For instance, obviously I have not b e e n able to incorporate all the'.different
     sounds that, w h en com bined with the visual im ages as w e ll as the desperate

     sensation' o f being crushed myself, and the feeling o f utter h elplessness with

     regard to my ow n safety and the safety o f those others around m e, served to

     accen tuate the awfulness o f the situation.


     H ow ever, I do accept that only I will really ever know w hat h ap p en ed to me, but
     by recording these details, and by talking about them, I shall gradually co m e to

     term s with them.

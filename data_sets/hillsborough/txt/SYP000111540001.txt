            about           t hi s          time       1 noticed                 that        several             youths            were       climbing              the         wall

Stand,        so       I forced          myself         through            the       crowds         away       from       the     turnstiles

and      located PS            468 Whitlam                outside           the       entrance            to    the       sta nd .          I

pointed           out    the       youths         on    the w a l l         and       he      passed a          radio       message

through           to P o l i c e        Control.             At    t hi s       I returned            to my          turnstile

N o . 9,      It t o ok m e             a good         10 m i n u t e s         to    force         my w a y     b a ck      to      the

turnstile,              a distance               of a p p r o x i m a t e l y         30      feet,       as    by t h i s        time          huge

numbers           of    fans       had      gathered           outside           the       turnstiles            and were                shoving

and      pushing         in an a t t e m p t            to     gain        entry        to     the    ground          before             kick-off.

At     the    turnstile             I stood            by th e w a ll            to     the      left      of    the       No.       9    gate

helping           the    old       fo l k    and       the     children who                   were    being          pushed          against

th e     w al l    to m o v e       across          and      pass       through            the      turnstiles,.                By       this

t i me      it w a s     absolutely                impossible              to    search anybody                  as       I could           hardly

move        myself.           1 noticed             that       several           of     th e     fans,         mainly        aged         18-30

years        were       very       drunk         and    were       shouting,               swearing            and    shoving             all      the

%ime.         1 remember                three) or         f ou r      of    these          were      so    drunk          they       could

hardly        stand          but    were         leaning          o / er    people            in a s t u p o r ,          their          e y es

extremely              glased       and      I wa s       very angry                 th a t    I could          do    nothing             to

prevent           their       entry         to    the     ground           as    by t h i s         time       I w as      literally

pinned        to       the    w a ll     and       could       not      move         at all.           1 can a l s o            remember

several           people       on a r r i v i n g         at      the      turnstiles               discovering              that         they

had      the w r o n g        coloured            ticket          and      others          with      no    ticket          but       offering

cash.         These          people         were       turned away               from         the    turnstiles              and         ha d     to

fight        their       way       back      through           th e     crowds          intensifying                 the     crush.

I    ha d    lost       all    contact            with       my    partner            PC      Jenkinson who                was       on

turnstile              No.    10 a n d       could        not      see      him       through          the      cr o wd s.           I

remained           by    the       wall      for       a further            ten m in u t e s           until         approximately

I was         doing       no     good           being           pinned          to       the? w al l      I let m y s e l f          be       forced

through            turnstile                 9 by       the w e i g h t             of    the      crowd.        Having          passed

through            the    turnstile                   I looked arou n d                     for     a way       out      of    the       ground

intending            to     get          to     the        rear       of       the       queues       outside         and      try       to     prevent

the      shoving          and        pushing.                   As    I looked around                     I s aw      the      youths

climbing            ov er       t he         wa l l     and      down          the       r o ofs    of    the    turnstiles               and        into

t he     ground.            They             were       being         helped             down      from    the       roof      by a       couple           of

Police         Officers.                     I remember               seeing             Inspector         Bennett            climb       up onto

t he     roof       I believe                  in an        effort             to    prevent          more      f an s     from      entering.

I remember               that        several               of    the       f an s        jumping         off    the      roof       had       tickets

and around 300                   f a ns         rushing              in.        I would            estimate          the      gats       w as    open

Out      of    it a n d W e n t               b a ck       round          to    the       front       gates      where         located PS

Throughout             the       whole        incident            I did         not       see    any      ground          stewards,

          I am a Detective Inspector in the South Yorkshire -^olice, stationed at

          Police headquarters where I have command of the Scenes of Crime Department.



          Part of my duties involves the maintenance of adequate facilities for

          the purpose of taking photographs for police purposes.



          From the records kept by myself, I am able to say that a Nikon F.301

          camera, serial number B27337^6 is supplied for the exclusive use of

          members of the Force underwater search unit.                                                                        That camera is not

          equipped with a data back, consequently there is no mechanical means

          whereby a time and date can be recorded on any of the photographic

          material used in that camera.

               I am a Detective Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police, stationed at

               Police Headquarters where I have command of the Scenes of Crime Department.



            On Monday 17 April 8 9 , I took possession of a Nikon                                                                         F.3             camera,

               serial number                    1786102                  from              Constable 683 Dennis William Bond.

            Attached to the camera was a Nikon                                                                     data back, serial number 365031*

            The data back is designed to imprint a time and date on any negatives

            which are exposed in the camera.                                                            The time is shown as a series of numbers

            which indicate hours and minutes.



            At         10 hrs 38 mins 20 seconds                                           British Summertime, I checked the accuracy

            of the data back against the time indicated by the 'Speaking Clock*.                                                                                               The

            that the data back was showing a time which .was                                                                    one oinute and twenty

 I am a Detective Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police, stationed at

 Police Headquarters where I have command of the Scenes of Crime Department.



 On Monday 17 April 8 9 , I took possession of a Nikon                                                                F.301              camera,

 serial number                    2588^89                 from           Mr

 Attached to the camera was a Nikon MF-1 9                                                    data         back, serial number                         22160^.

 The data back is designed to imprint a time and date on any negatives

 which are exposed in the camera.                                              The time is                shown as a series of numbers

 which indicate hours and minutes.



 At      10 hrs 37 mins 30 seconds                                   British Summertime, I checked the accuracy

 of the data back against the time indicated by the ’Speaking Clock*.                                                                                         The

 time shown on the data back was                                            10.38             exactly.                  This indicated to me

 that the data back was showing a time which was                                                             thirty seconds ahead of

  the time prescribed by the 'Speaking Clock'.

  I am a Detective Inspector in the SouthYorkshire Police,                                                                                                                                                 stationed at

  Police Headquarters where I have command of the Scenes xif Crime Department.



 On Monday 17 April 8 9 , I took possession of a Nikon                                                                                                                                    FE 2                      camera,

 Attached to the camera was a Nikon MF-16                                                                                                         data back, serial number 115827.

 The data back is designed to imprint a time and date on any negatives

 At          10hrs 13 mins 30 seconds                                                                      British Summertime, I checked the accuracy

 of the data back against the time indicated by the'Speaking Clock*.                                                                                                                                                                         The

 time shown on the data back was                                                                                     10.15                           exactly.                              This indicated to me

 that the data back was showing a time which .was                                                                                                                         one minute and thirty

 I am a Detective Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police, stationed at

 Police Headquarters where I have command of the Scenes of Crime Department.



 On Monday 17 'April 89, I took possession of                                                         Nikon      FE 2             camera,

I am a Detective Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police, stationed at

Police Headquarters where I have command of the Scenes of Grime Department.



On Monday 17 April 89, I took possession of a Nikon                                                                         F.301            camera,

serial number                    2^>SSk6k                 from                 Mr Philip Harvey Rich.

Attached to the camera was a Nikon                                                           MF-19 data back, serial number 2227^*

The data back is designed to imprint a time and date on any negatives

which are exposed in the camera.                                                         The time is shown as a series of numbers

which indicate hours and minutes.



At      10 hrs 52 mins 30 seconds                                           British Summertime, I checked the accuracy

of the data back against the time indicated by the 'Speaking Clock*.                                                                                               The

time shown on the data back was                                                   10.5^              exactly.               This indicated to me

that the data back was showing a time which .was                                                                  one minute and thirty

 seconds ahead of the time prescribed by the 'Speaking Clock'.

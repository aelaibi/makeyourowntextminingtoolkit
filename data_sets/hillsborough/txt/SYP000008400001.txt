decided         to walk       to the        football            ground.

O n my way         to the       ground,          I saw         large a m o u n t s       of fans mak i n g         their way

At    this       stage      the game was a b a n d o n e d and the                             players wa l k e d        off

The    next man          I saw was a w hite man.                      He was        about        thirty         to forty.

He was       lying       on his       back w i t h        his arms         out.         This man had no shirt

on,    just      trousers.            I d o n ’t think           he had his             shoes       on.        I cannotc

de s c r i b e   him further.                This    man had his             eyes       shut        and his skin            had

gone a black             colour       due     to the        lack      of oxygen.

T h e r e was a fan a t t e n d i n g              to him,       trying       to do       external             comp ressions

Eventually          I formed          the     o p i n i o n that       the m a n was           dead and           I left      him

Dear Sir,
    Re - F.A. Cup Semi-Final at Sheffield Wednesday 15th April 1989

         In response to your correspondence of 21st April 1989 I would
make the following report.
         My colleague and I arrived at the Penistone Road end of the
ground at approximately 1.30.p.m. having been directed to a car park
close to the ground by the Police along with the Nottingham Forest
Supporters.
         Access to the ground was comfortable and it was noted Police
were carrying out spot checks on Nottingham Forest Supporters for beer.
We took up our seating position in the South Stand at just after
2.00.p.m. While the Spion Kop end of the ground appeared to be
comparatively full at 2.30.p.m. the North Stand and the Leppings
Lane of the ground were far from full and these two sections of the
ground didn't appear to fill up until shortly before Kick-Off time.
          Shortly after Kick-Off there appeared to be an encroachment
on the playing area by Liverpool Supporters which initially was thought
to be some ho ligan element.

                                                                                                              Cont/d...2.
       At this point the Referee halted play and withdrew the players
to the "tunnel" area. A number of spectators were receiving first aid
treatment but the seriousness of the situation wasn't appreciated. The
press section who were adjacent to us, advised two people were reported
to be dead. Makeshift stretchers were being made from advertising boards
but from our view point it was never apparent that a large number of
the people being stretchered away were unfortunately beyond first aid
care. The magnitude of the tragedy was not appreciated by us until we
were making the journey home and listening to the car radio.




Yours faithfully,




SECRETARY

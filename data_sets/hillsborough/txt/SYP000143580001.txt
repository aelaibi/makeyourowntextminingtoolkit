I a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m at a p p r o x i m a t e l y one forty five   pm

(1343)      to start my duty.             After about       one hour     1 was then told to

proceed to the L e p p i n g s Ln stand where                I was    to be situated         in the

l ef t - h a n d    corner wit h seven other S>t John members.                  Just    before       the

m a t c h began,       another St Joh n member and myself               noticed,       as we       passed

the Leppings Ln middle                 stand,    that    people nearest      to the     pitch seemed

to be in d i fficulty and were                  being   squashed up to the metal            fence.

Some     of them were          screaming    to us to let them out.              When we got back

to our base,           the St J o h n member that had been with me and w i t n e s s e d

the    scene,        then told another adult member and he proceeded to alert

someone        taking the two of us with him.



The    next        thing    I remember was       that suddenly       people were spilling              on to

the    pitch.         Sy this time a policeman had run on to the                     pitch and had

alerted        the    referee who then stopped the match.                   I then proceeded            in

helping        the    injured    people.        Most    of the first     to get on the         pitch

were     badly winded and          in shock.           1 dealt with as many as          I could but

then started to notice that                 some       people being    carried on to the             pitch

by fellow Liverpool              fans were       seriously    injured and that a m b u l a n c e s

a n d firemen with oxygen had started to arrive.



I went over           to one man who       had o b viously stopped breathing.                  A

po l i c e m a n was       trying to    resuscitate him and give            cardiac: massage.              He

a s k e d me       if I could help and I then             proceeded    in giving the man mouth
                                                                                                   PAGE      6
                                                                                                   D709

to m outh      resuscitation.          U n f o r t u n a t e l y the man had vomited and so           it

was    difficult       to   revive     him.     While    doing   this another St John member

came over and offered to help.                     She then took over from me and gave

the man the        kiss of      life while        I gave him cardiac massage.               We carried

on doing       this for about          five minutes       until a       policeman    checked him and

t old us that we had done all we could and that                           he was    dead.     He

covered him up w ith his               coat and then,        wit h the help of some other

people,     we    carried him to the gym on a mak e s h i f t               stretcher.        After

doing    this     I then helped         carry an      injured man to an ambulance.                  I then

went    back on to the          pitch where         I came across a woman who           had    been

s e v e r e l y wi n d e d and was     deeply stressed.          With the help of my friend,

we    s u pported her and took              her to an amb u l a n c e    behind the L e p pings Ln

stand.



After    doing     this      I went    back to the first aid             room where    I assisted          in

helping and        comforting         the    injured.     This   lasted for about           half an

hour,    after w hich         I went    back onto the football             field but,       by this

time,    all     the   injured      people      had been dealt with.          At about       five

o ’clock    ( 1 7 0 0 ),    myself and three         other St J ohn members were             told that

we    could go home.           We   left the H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground at about         five

fifteen     (1715).

I am a Police C o n s t a b l e w i t h South Y o r k s h i r e Police at present

occ a s i o n s as a s p e c t a t o r   s t a nding on the terrace at the Spion Kop
end of the gro u n d and the Leppings Lane terrace.                            I have also
w o r k e d in all parts of the ground as a police officer during my

 past 8 years        service.                                                            • ■
 In S e ptember      1987    I took over duties r e l a t i n g to the video system
 w o r k i n g from the Police Control B o x and since that time I have
 a t t ended a 3 day course              in r e l a t i o n to the use of video syst e m s for
• C o m m a n d and Control     and as a m e t h o d of evide n c e gathering.                 The
 original      s y s t e m i n s t a l l e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h was laid out as a Command
 and Control S y s t e m gi v i n g a basic all round vie w both inside and
 outside the ground.               Whilst     I have been involved w ith the duties
 that e m p hasis has s h i f t e d from Comm a n d and Control to evidence
 gat h e r i n g and w i t h that end in m ind several                improvements have been
 made the most recent              being a survey of the Leppings Lane end
 camera,      the in t e n t i o n being to mov e the camera from its present
  p o s i t i o n a t t a c h e d to the roof of the West Stand bringing it down to

  a position          just above the turnstiles.                  The survey was c a r r i e d out

  u s i n g a hand held v i d e o camera m o u n t e d on the p l a t f o r m of a

  hydraulic          lift.     Two p o sitions were considered,               the first m o u n t e d

  on a p o l e         at the      far m ost corner of the Leppings Lane t urnstiles

  the second p o s i t i o n        just above gate           'B'.     It was decided that the

  best p o s i t i o n w o u l d be above           'B' gate.        This p o s ition giving good

  all ar o u n d views a long Leppings Lane,                    to the t u rnstiles       b elow and

  the c o u r t y a r d at the rear of the Leppings Lane terrace.                            The system

  in s t a l l e r   Roger H o l d s w o r t h agreed to complete a costing for the

  i m p r o v e m e n t s and if the          cash was a v ailable from the football trust,

 he w o u l d atte m p t to install               the camera in i t 1s new p o s i t i o n in time

  for the Semi Final.

 U n f o r t u n a t e l y the cleri c a l       side of this operation could not be

 c o m p l e t e d quick e n o u g h and the plan n e d m o v e           for the camera was

  su s p e n d e d until     the summ er b r e a k .                     •■                      '

 On S a t u r d a y    15 April       1989,      I co m m e n c e d duty at 10 am attending at

 the police r oom at Hillsborough,                       c o llecting the hand held VHS radio

~ w h i c h I use d to m o n i t o r t r a n s m i s s i o n s via- Opera t i o n s Room;      Oh this

 p a r t i c u l a r day channel 1             had been d e s i g n a t e d for all VHF

 t r a n s m i s s i o n r e l a t i n g to    the Semi Final.

 A fter c o l l e c t i n g the r adio I made my way to the Leppings Lane

 terrace w h e r e       I saw that Roger H o l d s w o r t h was work i n g on camera

 number 5 w h i c h o v erlooks                the Leppings Lane terrace p e n s . The

 picture q u a l i t y had been                s u b s t a n d a r d for a number of weeks    and Mr

  H o l d s w o r t h was carry i n g out some last minute alterations to upgrade

  the picture.           After he had com p l e t e d the w ork the picture was
indeed better than it had been a l t h o u g h not up to the correct

standard.         I then m a d e m y w a y to the Control Box w here                      I met w ith

S e r geant G o d d a r d and PC Ryan.              A f t e r a brief c o n v e r s a t i o n   I began

to c h e c k the v i d e o s y s t e m o p e r a t i n g eac h of the five cameras                 in

turn.      We wer e later         joined by Su p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y and it was

ag r e e d b e t w e e n us that S e r geant G o d d a r d w o u l d operate the personal

radio,     PC Ryan the         tannoy and tel e p h o n e and I in a d d i t i o n to my

d uties as ca m e r a o p e r a t o r w o u l d m o n i t o r the V H F set u s i n g it if

necessary.         These duties were no d i f f e r e n t to what w o u l d be carried

out on a normal m a t c h day.

A r o u n d 10.55 am that date,             Superintendent           Chapman contact control

r e g a r d i n g a g r o u p of Li v e r p o o l   s upporters wh o were w a i t i n g outside

the    5 Ar c h e s public house.             There was at this time no trouble but

the i n f o r m a t i o n was pa s s e d     just so that officer could be aware that

groups of s u p p o r t e r s had a r r i v e d and were intent on getting a d rink

before the match.              Seve ral other p e r sonal radio messa g e s were then

r e c e i v e d r e g a r d i n g the same topic.

About     11.20 am Se-rgeant G o d d a r d carried out radio checks some

personal       radi os d i d not r eply and the sector                    Inspectors were asked

to make      checks w here appropriate.                    Throu g h o u t this time various

m e s s a g e s wer e com i n g in re g a r d i n g traffic problems the city side of

the ground,         Ml motorway,         Parkway,        etc,    d iversions were         in force.

This     ind i c a t e d that the N o t t i n g h a m supporters were en r oute in

 numbers and could be e x p e c t e d at the ground for the turnstile

 o p e n i n g time of 12 noon.




                                                    16
Just after        noon     I i n s e r t e d the    2 VHS v ideo tapes    in the two v ideo

recorders.          The time        and date       s y s t e m was checked and set possibly

u sing the gro u n d lock m o u n t e d above            the N orth Stand or by a time

c h e c k w i t h other o f f i c e r s   in the cont r o l box.       The tapes were set

to run at normal             speed,     my i n tention being that ar o u n d 2.30 pm the

same date       I would         inset   2 n e w tapes w h i c h w o u l d then include the

b uild up to the m a t c h t h r o u g h o u t the game and the supporters

leaving the ground.                A r o u n d this time it was noti c e d that persons

had e n t e r e d the ground.

A short      time       later    it was d i s c o v e r e d that some of the Penistone

Road t u r n s t i l e s were not m a n n e d due to an a d m i n i s t r a t i v e error this

was c o r r e c t e d by d e p l o y i n g one of the spare serials.            Some time

betw e e n 1.00 pm and            2.30 p m there was concern e x p r e s s e d r e garding

the L i v e r p o o l    fans p u r c h a s i n g Kop tickets   from touts at Leppi ngs

Lane turnstiles.                This w o u l d m e a n of course that a m i x t u r e of fans

w o u l d have to be s u p e r v i s e d wi t h i n the Kop terrace.

Du r i n g this     same pe r i o d p r o blems       began aris i n g in various public

houses near to the ground ones that spring to m i n d * w e r e the Horse

and Jo c k e y and the Royal.              The c omplaints were that fans were

d r i n k i n g heav i l y out on the street,            u r i n a t i n g in gardens and being

a general nuisance.                Some time between 1.30 pm and 2.00 p m I began

to notice that on the K o p several L i v erpool                   fans had been placed

in the t r i angle area near to the N orth S tand end super v i s e d by

several police officers.                  I set camera 4 to m o n i t o r the situation

no t i c i n g that several arrests wer e m ade and that m a n p o w e r was

gett i n g low.          I r e m e m b e r e d that there had been some trouble at last

years m a t c h in the same location and I.questioned S u p erintend ent

Murray re the number of officers a v ailable for deployment on the

Kop.
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y then c o n t a c t e d Inspector Sewell regardi ng the

manpower      s i t u a t i o n and he c o n f i r m e d that   2 coaches each containing

40 me n w o u l d be on s t a n d b y in Pen i s t o n e Road.

Around    2.00 p m S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y and Chief Superin t e n d e n t

D u c k e n f i e l d went to speak to the m a t c h referee.              Thro u g h the

a f t e r n o o n c o m p l a i n t s had been e x p r e s s e d reg a r d i n g the quality of

p e r sonal   r adio t r a n s m i s s i o n s    to the control   staff;

A r o u n d 2.00 p m I o v e r h e a d on V H F that Liverpool         supporters had been

spoken to on a c o a c h w h i c h had d i s p l a y e d a N o t t i n g h a m Forest

s upporters p a r k i n g ticket.                The coach and supporters were spoken to

by traf f i c o f f icers       and a d v i s e d .

About the same time there was a report of t r o u b lesome Liverpool

fans on a c oach r e g i s t e r e d number            9995 RU.    This number was

c i r c u l a t e d and the c o a c h was checked by one of the mobile serials.

Around    2.20 p m the ACC J a c k s o n was              in the control    box when he

noti c e d a man on the L e p pings Lane terrace South pen.                       He dro pped

his trousers and began fool i n g about.                      His behaviour was such that

it was b e l i e v e d that' he was drunk and the ACC asked for something

to be d o n e ; * b o u t ‘him.: ;I set the camera to moni t o r his behaviour.

About    2.15 p m all the control room staff d i s c u s s e d that it was

apparent the Li v e p r o o l        fans had not begun to arrive as yet.                   The

N o r t h S tand had vast         spaces although the Leppings Lane terrace was

filling up at a norm al rate.                     Just after this the personal radio

transmissions         became worse and the civilian radio repair man came

into the control box to attempt a repair.




                                                      n
About     2.30 p m my a t t e n t i o n was drawn to the large crowd outside the

Leppings       Lane turnstiles.             I w o u l d e s t imate around 3,000 people and

it was a p p arent that the number was                   i n c r e a s i n g by the volume of

foot p a s s e n g e r s   in L e p pings Lane       itself.

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   D u c k e n f i e l d a sked about the large crowd and it

was said that a l t h o u g h it was m o r e than normal,                   it was no more than

was e x p e c t e d for such a football match.

About     2.35 pm the c i v i l i a n radio repair ma n stated that he could

not fix the personal radio s y s t e m and it was n e cessary to resort to

using the radios on a back to back system.

A bout the same time Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t           D u c k e n f i e l d came   to the

back of the control                 box and asked me if the crowd scenes at the

L e p pings Lane were being r e c o r d e d and I replied                    'Yes'.

A p e r sonal radio on Leppings Lane r e q u e s t e d m ore m a n p o w e r to

Leppings Lane turnstiles.                   Sergeant S o r s b y d e s p a t c h e d 2 horses       from

the South Stand car park.                                               .

A personal radio m e s s a g e then came                in stat i n g that the gates were

 b eing forced, t h e y were bending and buckling.                          In my min d       I

 believed        that, t h e gates r e f e r r e d to were            'C' gate and I kept         the

 L e p pings Lane camera set to that sort of area.

 About     2.40 pm Chief Su p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d and Superintendent

 M u r r a y re q u e s t e d that    I contact O p e r a t i o n s    Roo m so that a traffic

 car wit h a PA sy s t e m could attend in Leppings Lane and advised the

 crowd w h i c h were by this time b e c o m i n g appa r e n t l y more hostile.                       I

 also r e m e m b e r ar o u n d this time that Sergeant Goddard picked up the

 personal radio tel e p h o n e style handset and after trying to use it,

  threw it down onto the d e s k because it was not working and the
personal       r adio t r a n s m i s s i o n s w ere very poor.     I can r e m e m b e r seeing

about    5 or 6 o f f i c e r s    stood on barr i e r d uty       just past the gate       'C'

towa r d s    the S outh Stand.

About    2.40 p m I r e m e m b e r    seeing     'C' gate open and a number of

supporters       enter the ground.             I then said words like         'They've

broken dow n the gate'.               At the same time         I indicated to the staff

in the control box to watch the Leppings Lane monitor.                            After about

20 seconds       I noti c e d that the gate was              closed and it seemed that a

m o u n t e d o f f i c e r alone had p r e v e n t e d a big rush of people through

the open gate.           I remember       seeing m o u n t e d officers trying to clear

space    in the crowd.

The requ e s t     for a d d i t i o n a l o f f icers to be sent to Leppings Lane was

m ade to I n spector Sewell and I r e m ember hi m o f f ering two Serials,

one of w h i c h was the          'F' D i v ision C rime and Vandal,        they were

d i r e c t e d to the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.

I saw L i v e r p o o l fans c l i m b i n g the walls of the ground onto the

t u rnstile roofs and I in p a r t i c u l a r r e m e m b e r several being sat

astride gate        'B' w i t h police officers             stood below.    I think at this

time a p e r sonal r adio mess a g e was sent reg a r d i n g the climbers and

an o f f i c e r r e p l i e d that he c ould not r each them.

Around       2.45 p m I r e m e m b e r a personal radio mess a g e from

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M a r s h a l l to the effect   'We must open the gates or

someone       is g oing to be killed,           please open the gates.'

At this time Chief           Insp ector M c R o b b i e is in the control        box w ear i n g

c i v i l i a n clothing.

I remember        seeing an officer on the top of the turnstiles at

L e p pings Lane end and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D uckenfield made
e n q u i r i e s as to the o f f i c e r ' s        identity.            A n o t h e r personal radio

m e s s a g e was    received        f rom S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   Marshall,     his voice was

very d i s t r essed,         'You mus t       open the gates,              open the gates'.        Chief

Superintendent            D u c k e n f i e l d se e m e d to p ause for thought and then

said     'Right      if lives        are at risk,           then open the gates'.               Sergeant

G o d d a r d then t r a n s m i t t e d    'Open the gates,               open the gates'.        Just

p r i o r to this       I remember          se e i n g o f f icers        behind    'A' gate,    they were

set out       in two lines           f o r m i n g a funnel.             Sergeant Higgins of       'F' C&V

t r a n s m i t t e d on p e r s o n a l   radio     'There are people being crus h e d

outside       'A'    gate we m ust open              'A'    gate'.

I r e m e m b e r that a b o u t the time the gates were orde r e d to be opened

mounted officers              outside Leppings              Lane t u r n s t i l e s had m a n a g e d to

cr e a t e a void b e t w e e n       the t u r n s t i l e s    and the outer p e rimeter

railings,        in fact,        I b e l i e v e d that at one time the o f f icers mana g e d

to close        the o uter       gates,      however,        the c rowd outside          forced its w a y

t h r o u g h the outer        gates       and ran into the               ground via    '€' gate at

least.        I remember         s e e i n g crowds at the rear of Leppings Lane

terr a c e    just b e h i n d the turnstiles,                  t hey were      just stood about not

doing anything            in p a r t i c u l a r .

About      2.55 pm C hief          Superintendent             D u c k e n f i e l d told control room

staff      to get some m a n p o w e r to the N o r t h Stand to s top any possible

rush o n t o the pitch.                It was at this time that we began to notice

Liverpool         fans c l i m b i n g up into the Wes t S tand fro m the terrace

area.      The y were a s s i s t e d by people               in the stand and the same

p r o b l e m had o c c u r r e d the p r e v i o u s year.               A short time later fans

were     seen to climb            the p e r i m e t e r t rack fence.              Officers on the

 track se e m e d to be t e l l i n g the              fans to get down from the fence.                     At




                                                           £0
this point      the staff      in the control           box and I thought that the

s i t u a t i o n was p u r e l y public order.         No inform a t i o n was coming in to

the ef f e c t that people were g e t t i n g hurt.

A c rowd g a t h e r e d on the p e r i m e t e r track and Chief S u p erintendent

D u c k e n f i e l d o r d e r e d that they should be m o v e d as quic k l y as

p o s s i b l e to the w i n g sections of L e p p i n g s Lane terrace where it

could be seen that there was               space.        Chief   S u p e rintendent

D u c k e n f i e l d was a n g r y about o f f icers    stood around the track near to

the Kop and the N o r t h Stand.            A personal       radio m e s s a g e was sent to

the o f f i c e r s and they were d i r e c t e d to the         front of the North

Stand.    A r o u n d this time Chief       Inspector M c R obbie was sent to the

p i t c h to get things      sorted out.         One p r o b l e m was a WP C stood on the

p er i m e t e r track   just b elow the control box.              She did not appe ar to

be m o v i n g people off the track and in fact at one stage opened the

per i m e t e r gate to the track then w a l k e d off leaving the gate open.

Chief    I n s pector M c R o b b i e took charge of the po l i c e w o m a n and began

us h e r i n g people    fro m the track.        By this time there were people on

the p itch and the p e r imeter track gates were open allowing people

out of the centre pens.              Still at this stage no one in the control

box was aware that the p r o b l e m was mor e than a pitch invasion

situation.

Just after the m a t c h was stopped ACC Jack s o n was in the control box

and he ordered me to contact O p e r a t i o n s Roo m and call operation

support.       It was at this point that I deci d e d to concentrate on

ope r a t i n g the V H F radio rather than the camera system.                    Very

suddenly it beca me apparent             that there were injuries and at that

time I c o n tacted Opera t i o n s R o o m for ambulances to be sent to the

Le p p i n g s Lane end of the ground.            There were people all over the
pitch    in front of the goal mouth,                 p e r s o n s were laid across   the

floor wit h pers o n s gi v i n g m o u t h to mouth.              It was only then that we

began to feel         that there might be deaths.                 A personal r adio m e s s a g e

was   sent to control          asking for bolt cutters and Sergeant Godd a r d

co n t a c t e d C l a y w h e e l s Lane asking    if they had cutters on the bri-mac

transporter.          The r eply was negative.              He turned to me and I told

hi m that     I w o u l d contact     the fire service w h i c h I did via

O p e r a t i o n s Room.    I made    it clear that we r e q u i r e d cutting

e q uipment     for the m e t a l     fences.       I remem b e r someone     i nstructing PC

Ryan to use the t a n n o y t e l l i n g people to stay calm.                  I can remember

seeing bodi es        being m o v e d towards        the tunnel on the Leppings Lane

t err a c e   from the centre pens.             I believe that it was police

o f f icers w h o were m o v i n g the bodies            fro m the area.      Liverpool fans

who were on the p i t c h started to run towards                     the Kop.     Officers

m a n a g e d to stop the char ge and split up several groups of fans who

were     fighting.          A line of officers were then formed across the

p itch    just the Ko p side of the centre line.                     I recall: the fire

service a r r i v i n g at L e p p i n g s Lane and their men running onto the                      :

pitch.        I then sent a m e s s a g e to O p e r a t i o n s    that we did have

 f atalities at the g r o u n d a l t hough whe n I sent this mess a g e no

 details had bee n passed by pers onal                   radio.     It was all done from

 o bservation.         Further contact          from O p e r a t i o n s R o o m regarding the

 number of amb u l a n c e required and they said w ould it be mor e than 20

 and I said som e t h i n g to the effect that we need as man y as

 possible.

 T r a f f i c m o t o r cycles were ordered to cover the routes to both

 h o s pitals and I made a request                 for the senior ambulance officer to

 attend the cont rol           box.     He did not arrive.           The senior fire




                                                    52
o f f i c e r a t t e n d e d at the c o n t r o l box and liaised wit h senior

officers      and he too asked to s peak to the senior ambulance officer.

Another     request was m a d e          for that offi c e r         to attend the control box

v i a O p e r a t i o n s Room.

A bout   3.35 pm I c h e c k e d the v i d e o tapes and d i s c o v e r e d that one had

s t o p p e d and the second had been s w i t c h e d to operate                      in the 18 hour

m ode w h i c h in ef f e c t     speeds up the action of the scene being

recorded.        This     I can only t hink was caught by me whilst standing

at the rear of the v i d e o control area.                        The videos are set at knee

h eight and I beli e v e that as I leant                      forward this is how I altered

the time mod e setting.

I i n s t a l l e d two ne w tapes and set t h e m runn i n g at normal speed.

Mr Cl o u g h and Mr D a l g l e i s h e n t e r e d the control box and offered

their     services once the y had e s t a b l i s h e d that the m a t c h was off..

Mr D a l g l e i s h w a n t e d to speak to the fans and he was asked to use

 the ta n n o y sy s t e m in the DJs control                 box below the po l i c e control..

 S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M u r r a y then later asked         for details of transport so

 that preparations' -could be made                    for e m p t y i n g the g r o u n d .      I

 'remember some time after this S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray saying to PC

 Ryan that he w a n t e d a m e s s a g e pass i n g over the tannoy telling the

 Liverpool       fans to stay c alm and remain where they were until the

 a m b u l a n c e s had left the Stadium.

  So metime later the ground was emptied and around 5.30 p m I removed

  the v i d e o tapes and made my wa y to the g y m to offer assistance.                               I

  was later       sent to HQ wit h the video tapes and I there saw Chief

  S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenfield,      Sergeant Booth,            ACC Jack s o n and Chief

  Sup e r i n t e n d e n t Denton.

            was    to a t t e n d so that copies of the v ideo tapes could be

About    11.30 p m __________________ [arrived at Ham m e r t o n Road Police

Stat i o n and I e x p l a i n e d the faults on the v i d e o tapes.               He asked if

I c o u l d get hold of the video recorder used with the 18 hour mode

s e t t i n g so that he could transfer                the tape action at the correct

speed.       I then went back to the ground and removed one of the video

recorders       from the police control box taking it to E c c l e s f i e l d

Training      School w h e r e      I ha n d e d it to                             My immediate

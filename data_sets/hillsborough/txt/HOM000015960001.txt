                             We   refer    to our telephone conversation last week wherein you
                             explained to us the intricacies surrounding the publication of
                             Lord Justice Taylor's Report.                             You also explained that you
                             anticipated that upon the date of the Report's publication the
                             Report would be available for collection by represented parties
                             from 9.00 a.m. with an embargo of perhaps 3 hours before any
                             public anouncement.


                             We have reported this to our clients who have asked us to
                             contact you in circumstances where most of their media
                             commitments immediately upon publication of the Report are based
                             in the Merseyside area.                       Our clients have asked, therefore,
                             whether it would be possible for you to courier our copies of
                             the Report to us in time for them to arrive at 9.00a.m. on the
                             day of publication.                   We would, of course, undertake not to open
                             the Reports until 9.00 a.m. and reimburse the Home Office or
                             whoever,      in respect of the courier charges.                                      We would obviously,
                             of course, comply strictly with any embargo regulations.


                             Perhaps you could consider the abo-e and let us have your views.

                             Regards.
                                                                            PETER JACKSON

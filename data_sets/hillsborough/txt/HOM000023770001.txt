                       OBSERVATIONS ON ISSUES CENTRAL TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY
                   AND ADDITIONAL COMMENT UPON CERTAIN OF THE INTERIM RECOMMENDATIONS


              1.    INTRODUCTION

                     In addressing some of th e issues upon which t h e r e has been
                    considerable debate during th e Hillsborough Inquir y, I have d i r e c t e d
                    my a t t e n t i o n t o those aspects I be lie v e to be c e n t r a l t o s a f e t y and
                     'good o r d e r 1 a t f o o t b a l l matches.    However, i t i s of course th e case
                    t h a t any o b s er v atio n s, and Indeed recommendations, must be made 1n
                    the l i g h t of p o t e n t i a l f o r f u t u r e change.           In p a r t i c u l a r , th e
                    Football Membership Scheme must n e c e s s a r i l y In flu ence d e l i b e r a t i o n s
                    on th e fu t u r e of f o o t b a l l and th e i l l s which c u r r e n t l y a f f l i c t i t .

                   Whilst in theory th e Scheme may bring a b e t t e r 'shape' t o t h e
                   conducting of th e s p o r t , opinions upon th e degree of success i t will
                   enjoy vary enormously, from committed optimism t o forebodings of
                   doom. Whilst one would hope t h a t th e p o s i t i o n s adopted by th e va rious
                   i n t e r e s t e d p a r t i e s were derived from p ro f e s s i o n a l Judgement as
                   opposed t o s e l f i n t e r e s t , i t i s c l e a r l y th e case t h a t a number of
                   genuine r e s e r v a t i o n s remain.       These include p o t e n t i a l d i f f i c u l t i e s
                   ass o c iated with m ultiple a p p l i c a t i o n s ( i . e . from t h e same person)
                   and,         perhaps more          im porta ntly , th e     e x is t e n c e of    ap p ro p ria te
                   technology with p a r t i c u l a r regard to ro bustn ess                      and adequate
                   processing speed.

                   However, from a p o lic in g p e r s p e c tiv e , even i f one a n t i c i p a t e s t h a t
                   the Scheme will be successful in meeting i t s o b j e c t i v e s , i t must be

               would be c o n s i s t e n t with a p r i o r i t i s a t i o n of s a f e t y above a l l other
               i s s u e s , w h ils t not completely lo s in g s ig h t of th e need to prevent
               p itc h inva sio ns, which 1n themselves not only d i s r u p t th e sport but
               undermine public s a f e t y through th e p o t e n t i a l fo r d i s o r d e r .

               N e verthele ss, i t should be recognised t h a t a compromise of t h i s
               natu re in p u r s u i t of g r e a t e r s a f e t y would introduce an Increased r i s k
               of p i t c h in v a sio n s, at l e a s t in th e s h o rt to medium term. This would
               tend to lend weight to arguments put forward by a number of bodies,
               Including th e Poli ce S upe rintende nts ' A sso c ia tion, th e National
               Fede ra tion of Football Supporters Clubs and the F ir e Brigades Union,
               in support of a s p e c i f i c offence or p r o h i b i t i o n from e n te rin g the
               playing area in normal circumstances.                      However, dependent upon the
               successful implementation of th e Football Membership Scheme, th e
               s an c tio n s a v a i la b l e under t h a t Scheme should make th e c re a tio n of
               such an offence unnecessary.

               Returning to th e issue of perimeter fe nc ing i t s e l f , th e re i s of
               course a need t o recognise th e conditions imposed by EUFA and FIFA.
               In t h i s re g a rd , they have issued th e follow ing binding i n s t r u c t i o n s
               t o org a n is e r s of f i n a l t i e s and high r i s k matches:

                   "The playing f i e l d must be p ro te c te d by means of:

                   a)     a fence of at l e a s t 2.2m height or a moat, or e lse

                   b)     a b a r r i e r with adequate p o lic in g as to make 1t impossible
                          f o r s p e c t a t o r s t o reach th e f i e l d of p l a y . "

               Whilst t h i s need not g r e a t l y in fluenc e our normal domestic s i t u a t i o n s
               and would not t h e r e f o r e cause me to d e t r a c t from my previous
               pro posal, t h e EUFA/FIFA requirements would have t o be complied with
               fo r European and World Cup games.              What i t does argue f o r , however,

               even purpose b u i l t , s t a d i a . In t h i s way, t h e i r conditions could be

               However, I do f e e l t h a t a l l s e a t e r s t a d i a would be e f f e c t i v e as one
               p a r t of a package of measures, and see no merit 1n r e t a i n i n g standing
               areas as a matter of p o l i c y .            On balance, a l l s e a t e r s t a d i a would

               danger of 'swaying' and crowd c rus hes .                   In p a r t i c u l a r , they would
               prevent th e congregation of la rg e numbers of s p e c t a t o r s , well in
               excess of t h a t which could be considered s a f e , in small, favoured
               areas of th e ground, w h ils t a l l around t r a c t s of unoccupied t e r r a c i n g
               remain, a problem which even t h e best of i n t e r v e n t i o n s t r a t e g i e s fo r
               crowd d i s t r i b u t i o n will not p re ve nt.

               I t i s my view t h a t t h e r e should be a move towards a l l s ea te r s t a d i a .
               Whilst f u l l y accepting th e requirement f o r such a policy to be
               phased, a l l clubs should be s e t t h i s go a l.                         A d ditio na lly, young
               s p e c t a t o r s should be encouraged to purchase season t i c k e t s in an

               promoting a g r e a t e r degree of r e s p o n s i b i l i t y . This could be achieved
               through t h e use of concessionary season t i c k e t r a t e s for the young
               and th e re d uc tion of d i f f e r e n t i a l s between standing and s ea tin g
               t i c k e t s t o a minimum.

         4.    SAFETY CERTIFICATES

               This aspect i s c l e a r l y c e n t r a l t o t h e s a f e t y of persons attendin g
               football         matches.       Though many local                  a u t h o r i t i e s undoubtedly
               undertake t h e i r r e s p o n s i b i l i t i e s in t h i s area in               a d i l i g e n t and
               e n e r g e ti c manner, p a r t i c u l a r l y post 'H i l l s b o r o u g h ', i t would seem
               a p p ro p ria te to take t h i s o pportu nity to e r a d i c a t e some of th e
               vagar ies which are present w ithin e x i s t i n g p r a c t i c e s and procedures.
               In general terms, I would consider t h e r e t o be need to address the
               fo llowing a re as .

               Accuracy

               The requirement fo r Safety C e r t i f i c a t e s t o be accura te in terms of
               content and relevance i s paramount. Recommendation 15 of the Interim
               Report, c a l l i n g f o r annual renewal of c e r t i f i c a t e s , 1s the best way
               of achieving t h i s . The requirement within t h a t Recommendation fo r at
               l e a s t one annual review of a l l c e r t i f i c a t e s must of course include a
               physical      in s p ec tio n element a d d itio n a l t o any          t h a t may prove
               necessary during th e remainder of th e y e a r .

               Frequency

               The adoption of an annual c e r t i f i c a t i o n process would seem l o g i c a l l y
               t o argue f o r t h e r e t e n t i o n of local a u t h o r i t i e s as the c e r t i f y i n g
               authorities.              However, even g r e a t e r weight i s le n t to the argument

                    I n t e r f e r e n c e could be caused by r a d i a t i n g power sources such as

               Recommendation 7, r e l a t i n g to th e d i f f e r e n t colo uring of gates 1n
               fe ncin g, is both sound and uncontentious.                 However, I f e e l i t would
               be advantageous to s t i p u l a t e one colour n a t i o n a l l y , thus removing any
               p o t e n t i a l fo r confusion by v1s1t 1ng s u p p o rte rs . The u t i l i s a t i o n of a
               luminous p a in t would als o be h e lp f u l.

               With regard to Recommendations 8, 9 and 10, r e l a t i n g t o th e opening
               and manning of gates (by p o lic e o f f i c e r s ) 1n perimeter fencing and
               th e presence of c u t t i n g equipment s u i t a b l e to f a c i l i t a t e the

               t h a t th e t r a d i t i o n a l type of fencin g which made th e s e recommendations
               necessary should be p ro g r e s s i v e ly re pla ced by more of a psychological
               b a r r i e r which would not hinder evacua tion onto th e pla ying area at
               times of emergency.                  Once achieved, th e se recommendations would be
               rendered l a r g e l y redundant in t h e i r p resent form.

               Cowmunications

               I t was recommended t h a t th e PA system should be capable of being able
              t o communicate with individ ual areas both in s id e and o utside the
              grounds. Concern has been expressed in some q u a r t e r s t h a t th e use of
               loud PA equipment o u ts id e th e ground would ' i n f r i n g e environmental
               h e a l t h 1. As I see i t th e s i t u a t i o n is t h a t under Section 58 of the
              Control of P o ll u tio n Act 1974 a local a u t h o r i t y can serve a notic e
              r e q u i r i n g abatement of any nuisance caused by noise on any person so
              re s p o n s i b l e .    I t 1s i r r e l e v a n t whether such noise is Ins ide or
              o u ts id e th e premises.         In th e fo o t b a l l s i t u a t i o n i t 1s not envisaged
              t h a t th e speakers o u ts id e s t a d i a would need to be used many times and
              would, t h e r e f o r e , be u n lik e ly to cause a r e g u la r nuisance.             Section
              62 of the Act p r o h i b i t s th e use of loudspeakers                          in the s t r e e t s
              between 9 pm and 8 am and at any oth er time f o r c e r t a i n purposes e . g .
              a d v e r t i s i n g . However th e s e c tio n does not apply t o a loudspeaker used
              fo r p o lic e purposes or in any case of emergency.                           I do not consider
              t h a t th e use of PA equipment o u ts id e grounds would i n f r in g e any
              current le g is la t io n .

              With Regard to t h a t p a r t of Recommendation 34 which r e l a t e s to the
              use of hand s ig n a l s by p o lic e o f f i c e r s , I am now of                 th e opinion t h i s
              i s , in th e main, I n e f f e c t i v e and po s sibly mis le ading. The a b i l i t y to

                            PERIMETER FENCIN6 IN SUBMISSIONS TO THE INQUIRY


                ACPO - Impression 1s t h a t those with fencin g wish to r e t a i n i t .
                There are arguments fo r both r e t a i n i n g i t and f o r removing i t .       A
                compromise would be t o r e t a i n j u s t enough fencin g t o act as a
                psychological d e t e r r e n t . This would do away with th e Colditz type
                b a r r i e r s and leave a means of escape onto th e p i t c h . P it c h invasions
                were not now a p r i o r i t y (1n p o lic e terms) although they could be a
                t a c t i c t o abort a game.

                before any fe ncin g is removed. There is a need f o r a quick re le a s e
                mechanism.

                openings should be provided.        In f a c t 1t 1s c o r r e c t t o regard access
                t o th e p i t c h as a method of evac uation. Three minutes was th e period
                of escape the y aimed at in a n o n - f i r e r i s k s i t u a t i o n but i t would be

               means.

 RECOLLECTION OF iSTCTIS AT HlLLSBOiiOUGE
 SATUESAT 15 APRIL 1989




 I aa a Polios Officer of the Nottinghamshire Constabulary presently attacked
 to the Momrfced Section and stationed at Police HQ Sherwood Lodge, A m o Id,
 Kottingham.


 On Saturday 15 April 1 989 I along with other Police Officers of the
Mounted Section was on duty ifl Sheffield for the Bo ttinghaoi Forest v
 Liverpool match at Hillsborough, football ground*


My detail that day was to work with Police Sergeant Barry Scrsby of the
South Yorkshire Mounted Section at the Penistone Road turnstiles, Penistone
Hoad, also to escort the Players Coachss through the main gate to the back
of the South Stand5 we commenced this duty at 11 30 am that day.


At approximately 2 50 pa whilst on duty outside the Penistone Road turnstiles
which the Forest supporters were entering! and Ps Watson received a call
o-rer the radio to go to the Lappings Lane turnstiles to assist'the Liverpool
Mounted Section and South Yorkshire Mounted Section who were detailed
to Police those turnstiles.    Ife approaohed these turnstiles from the rear
of the South Stand.


On arrival at the gate fCT of the TTest Stand at Leppings Tati*? i saw a scene of
utter chaos t the area between tie-turnstiles and the metal perimeter gates
was jataaed with supporters from Liverpool,    X oould see people at the front
keiziS crushed against the wall of tfcte turnstiles f also on the side wall* as
the crowd at the back kept pushing forward,the supporters at the front could
not movie sideways as there was an iron barrier on the river aide of the
turnstiles which was helping to keep the crowd confined to one area*      Also
I saw supporters climbing up the aide wall to gain entrance to the ground.


I tried to use my horse to push the crowd back towards the road to release
the pressure at the front Taat X stopped doing so as the presence of my horse
in such a tightly packed crowd was having such little effect.      I then went to
the metal gates to asist foot officers who where trying to close the gates
to stop fans outside pushing their way in.    tfe succeeded in closing the gates
                  I-Cl " O X *   TO   lice   nl_:   iwCf;'   i   r.lTi

                                                                                             £M ^

 but the other section of the gates at the river side where suddenly pushed
 open and the fans outside the gate I was, rushed through these.


 As I looked around to see where the crowd was goijag I saw gate »Cf suddenly
 open and all the crowd outside surging- through them*


 The behaviour of the fans in some areas “as of utter disregard for others
 no matter how many times requests were made to stop pushing forward; thsse
requests were completely ignored, and as the area around my horse cleared
of supporters I moved to the side of the gates where other Mounted Polios
were stood.   I had to mo-re with great care as there                    were broken glass bottles
of Newcastle Brown on the floor along with disgsrded beer cans*


At approximately 3 40 pm I and other Mounted Officer                      were told ay the
Inspector of the South Yorkshire Mounted Section to go round onto Penistone
Hoad to wait outside the ground at Gate «0» just in case we had to go inside
the ground. Later we were detailed for crowd control on Penis ton© Hoad
which we did until stood down at h 20 pm7


In all jay years service at foot Ball matches, in my opinion, it is the same
old story of people coming to the match in the last 20 minutes before kick off
and wanting to push in straight away.

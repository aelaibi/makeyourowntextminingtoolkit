Dear Sirs

                              Re: Hillsborough

D. J. Lock

Enclosed herewith is a report from Detective Inspector Cleverley concerning
the result of enquiries made in respect of Mr D. J. Lock, the Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club Security Officer.      No doubt if there are further
matters arising, you will notify us in due course.

Superintendent Stuart

In reply to the query in your letter 20 August 1990, Superintendent Stuart
played no part whatsoever in the preparation for, or policing of any of the
semi-finals in 1987, 1988 or 1989.     All planning and operation policing was
carried out at the division concerned.

Yours faithfully




Chief Superintendent
"C" Division

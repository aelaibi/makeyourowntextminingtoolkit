                   introduces two further ways o f life: egalitarian­

Inside the
pens, and
beyond them
        E DIDN’T set out to “apportion blame”: but, by

H       golly, he seems to have managed it. Only hours
        after the Taylor report on the Hillsborough trag­
edy, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire was offer­
ing his resignation. It should |be promptly accepted:'
Lord Justice Taylor was clearly appalled not just by the
slop of police organisation at the ground but by the ini­
tial blustering mendacity of senior officers in his wit­
ness box. We pay our police, well, to maintain high stan­
dards of truth, organisation and efficiency. There is no
oenefit whatsoever in shrugging benignly when they
fall so far below those standards. Of course the British
way is that good chaps with a distinguished record
should be given the benefit of the doubt. But if the point
of the inquiry, and indeed of its 43 action points, is to
prevent a tragic repetition, there is an imperative to
demonstrate that the South Yorkshire police perfor­
mance, at the highest levels, was abysmal.
      That does not, though, mean that police must carry
me entire can of blame, whilst all other parties walk
away smiling. On the contrary, in a notably thoughtful
set of interim findings, Lord Justice Taylor contrives to
paint a rounded picture full of reality. Sheffield Wednes­
day Football Club, for all their pride in Hillsborough,
had not kept a constant eye on safety. Poor signposting;
poor regard for access to the ground and the terraces.
Sheffield City Council was dozy, too, in monitoring
these things. And there were some drunken hooligans of
fans who contributed the melee which contributed to
:iie tragedy. On a day filled with horror most things that
snould have worked didn’t.
      The level of the incompetence, in fact, is well dem­
onstrated by some of the 43 remedies. Football matches
with more than 5,000 spectators should have at least one
ambulance in attendance; and a doctor. There is a kin­
dergarten air to such prescriptions. And yet, damningly,
Taylor finds them necessary, solemn words on solemn
paper. The more controversial, or expensive, recom­
mendations are, of course, the ones that will catch the
Headlines. Mandatory lower limits on the numbers who
can be packed into terraces; stewards or police dedi­
cated to crowd safety; ample escape routes through
wider gates from behind perimeter fences; enough turn­
stiles to cope; an absolute ban on entry to grounds, or
areas of grounds, once a strictly delineated and elec­
tronically monitored capacity has been reached.
      Every suggestion (high praise) is both practical and
swiftly implementable. The broader debate about all­
seat grounds and new stadia will have to wait until next
year, and the full report. But the instant business of
making football as safe as possible for a season only a
fortnight away has been punctiliously fulfilled.
      And yet, at the end, you are still nagged by at least
one wider question. Why should the British police, as a
matter of weary routine, week in and week out, have to
deploy themselves inside and outside football grounds
to a military schedule? Why did they, when there was
tumult on the terraces, gather to forestall a pitch inva­
sion rather than save lives? One knows why. Only days
after Hillsborough, before the shock at 94 lives lost had
abated, youths at other grounds were fighting and in­
vading again as though Sheffield had never existed. The
vast majority of Liverpool fans, like the vast majority of
fans everywhere, emerge without blame from Taylor.
But we live in a society where our national game (com­
pare and contrast the United States) is a battle ground.
Safety — whatever the precautions — is only a part of
that story. There is a discommoding tendency in succes­
sive reports to see a problem — drink inside, drink out­
side — shuttled back and forth like a bit of sticking plas­
ter. There is also a relentless weighting of costs on to
clubs — for extra police, stewards, electronic devices,
emptier terraces, identity cards — which will inevitably
hasten its decline. That ought to be faced squarely too.
Football, meshed in the woes of society, may be commit­
ting suicide one disaster at a time.

in    charge         and,       having           checked         each         patient,           I tried           to        assess       how       many

more     patients              we    would          be    able    to        take,,        There        are       two         sides       wards        to

the    General            I .I .U » a n a           each    has        two       gas     points,            I decided               therefore

tnat    we      could          take       2    patients          in        each     of     tnese       two       side         wards.           I

heard     that        4    patients              needed         ventilating                in W a r d       60     w h i ch        is    oeiow

the    General            I«T«U«              I found       2. of          the    patients            ana    asked            that       they        be

brought         up    to       I „T „U „         1 then         went        round        the     Cardiac           I ,,7 „U „ to          assess

their     situation,,                    1 gave          some    advice           and      noted       that        they         had

sufficient            ventilators                   for    all    the         patients           and       that      an       anaesthetist

was    wit h     ea ch         p at ierit.

I therefore               returned             to    General           I „T . U .        Dr    Clark        had      in       the       meanj/'i.me

decided         that       some          patients          may    need           C .7.    scans.            I believe               thj

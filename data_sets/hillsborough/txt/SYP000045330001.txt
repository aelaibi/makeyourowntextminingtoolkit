TO:      Secretariesof_Football_League_Clubs


Dear Sir,

Following lengthy discussions between The Football Association
and The Football League, we are now able t ^ s 4 n d you, over our
joint signatures, a revised Memorandum on Crowd Management.

This document sets out to amplify and clarify the ’responsibilities
of Clubs in relation to this most difficult problem- Both our
bodies are fully aware of the enormous amount of time, money and 1
energy expended'by our Clubs in ensuring that the public can
attend matches in safety-   With the eyes of the world on us,
however, we cannot afford to relax for one moment.

We ask you to study the Memorandum in great detail- Failure to
act on any of the recommendations may be taken into account should
a Club subsequently be charged with misconduct under Football
Association Rules 23 and 24.

                                                     Yours faithfully.

 9. All efforts should be made to provide spectators with
    pre-match or half-time entertainment.

10. Adequate rooms and facilities should be provided in the Stadium

   are aware of the provisions of this Memorandum.
 5. Clubs must ensure that players are aware of their responsibility
  ’ to refrain from actions, words or gestures likely to produce
    a violent, aggressive or antagonistic reaction among spectators.

 6. Clubs should take all possible steps to ensure the best possible
    conduct at all times by members, directors, staff and players.
    In particular, criticism should not be voiced publicly either
    of referees or of players, managers or other persons or bodies

 7. Clubs should seriously consider concerted campaigns involving
    leading players or other individuals likely to command respect

 8. Clubs must designate a liaison officer to co-ordinate security
    measures between Clubs and with the public authorities and
    to survey the observations of these measures.

 9. Clubs should take active steps to co-operate with Supporters'
    Clubs and similar organisations.

    times on match days.

11. The Security Liaison Officers of The Football Association
    are available to help Clubs on request.

7. Clubs should liaise with Police over visits to motorway service
   areas by supporters travelling to away matches.

8.    It is the responsibility of the away Club to advise the home Club
     ofthe recent behaviour of their supporters at away matches,
     irrespective of whether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary
     action by The Football Association or not.

S.    The visiting club with experience of their supporters travelling
     to away matches should co-operate in every way with the home club
     in matters of security, even physically checking segregation areas,
     vehicle parking areas, etc. Such assistance would not affect the
  shared responsibility of the home club.


CLUBS TRAVELLING ABROAD


1. Clubs may not for the time being play matches in Europe or against
   foreign teams in England. This includes professional sides from
   Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, other than Canon League,
   F.A. Cup or Milk Cup matches.

2. Clubs should not take tickets for matches abroad unless they and
   the competent authorities are absolutely satisfied that problems
   will not arise.

3. Clubs should liaise with the home club to ensure that tickets
   are not sold to English Nationals.

   to ensure that the movements of such supporters is organised and

   of The Football Association and the authorities referred to in
  •B1 and to Ferry Operators and Air Lines to ensure that the maximum
   information is obtained concerning the number travelling, their
 • method of transport and accommodation. Whenever feasible, a Club

   the match is to be played and discuss arrangements. Unless the Club
   is satisfied with the response from the host Club, the fixture should
   not be fulfilled.

5. Clubs should appoint properly trained Stewards to supervise
   travelling supporters. The local Police should be advised of their
   presence.

6. Clubs should request information concerning Police arrangement
   for visiting supporters. If the Club concerned is not totally
   satisfied with the response, the match should not be played.

7. Clubs should check   the credentials of any travel operator
   proposing to carry   supporters and ensure that thay are aware
   of the contents of   this Memorandum. Clubs in the First and Second
   Divisions must use   accredited UEFA Agents.

8. Clubs must ensure that all officials, players and supporters are
   made fully aware of the need for conduct of the highest standard.

9. The Football Asssociation will approve matches only if it   is
   satisfied that the above procedures have been carried out   and that
   the National Association of the Country to be visited has   received
   assurances from the Club to be-visited that all necessary   precautions
   have been taken.


POWERS OF THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION


1. Failure to implement any of the precautions outlined in this
   Memorandum may be taken into account in the consideration of any
   charge brought against a Club or may, in itself, lead to such a
   charge.

2. The Football Association will take whatever steps are necessary
   in pursuit of the duty imposed on it by its Memorandum of
   Association to "promote the game of Association Football in every
way the Association or the Council of The Association shall think
proper, and to take such steps as shall be deemed necessary, or •

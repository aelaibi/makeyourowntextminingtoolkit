IMPLICATIONS OF TAYLOR REPORT FOR RUGBY UNION



Line to Take
The provisions of the Football Spectators Act to require all
seated accommodation and the powers of the Football Licensing
Authority to review safety certificates do not extend to sports
other than football. Home Office will be considering what action
is appropriate, including any additional statutory powers after
consultation with the relevant representative organisations,
including the Rugby Football Union.




Background Note

Lord Justice Taylor recommended:

     (a )  the powers of the Football Licensing Authority to
     review the discharge by local authorities of their functions
     under the Safety of Sports Grounds legislation should be
     extended to sports other than football;
     (b)   that the move to all-seater stadia should apply to all
     sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds
     Act 1975.
Primary legislation would be required to implement both (a) and
(b).   On (a) the Home Office intend first to consult with
representative   sporting   bodies   and  the   local   authority
associations before consideration is given to the introduction of
legislation on extending the FLA role on a voluntary basis.    On
(b) the Home Office intend to consult the RFU in respect of
Twickenham and other designated rugby grounds before deciding
what action is appropriate.

           I am a single man living at the above address with my parents.

           On Saturday the 15th April       1989 (150489),      I went to the Semi Final

           Match at HILLSBOROUGH to watch Liverpool against Nottingham Forest

           I travelled to the with four           (s, we all went up in my private        car

           I am a Liverpool Su p porte tj/and purchased my t i cket from Andfeil.d

           Ticket Office for whi c \ y l   paid six pounds .     The ticket was for the

           Leppings Lane Terrac/s.

           On our way to HILLSBOROUGH we stopped near Wood Head pass for

           refreshments a n / Toilets we only stopped for 10 minutes as we had been

           delayed in traffic on the M62 just into Stockport for an hour so we

           were worried about time, We arrived in Sheffield at about 2.10pm where

           we saw quite a few supporters drinking and also cans left lying

           around on the sides of the road,        the police d i d n ’t seem to be
                                                                         PAGE       2
                                                                         S17&3

checking vans or coaches     like   they did last year and thats -must have

been why so many were able to       keep drinking,    however we were able     to

park a short distance from the ground in CARLTON Road literally only a

three to four minutes walk, we together with a number of other

supporters made our way to the ground, we were not escorted by Police

but we w e r e n ’t last year and therefor didn't except      it, although we

had seen people drinking we didn't have anything.           Whilst walking

down to the ground supporters       were in good humour and generally

enjoying the atmosphere but I did feel the Police lacked quite

considerably in patience they worked hard moving people as quickly as

possible to the turnstiles once a y the turnstiles which must have been

about 2.20 pm - 2.30 pm it was /ust a mass of people absolutely no

organisation nobody was     in any/sort of queue and as you merged into

the crowd the crush began we smarted about           10 feet further from the

entrance gates and the pushing      continued which caused the crush, we

moved to almost six to seven feet from the turnstiles we were by that

railing which runs from the turnstiles adjacent to the river.            There

were some policemen in the crowded area but they didn't           really do

anything for ages one policeman on horseback moved into the crowd in

an attempt to ease the problem but in effect he just made           it worse        j
causing a panic as peoc/le struggle to move away from the horse.

Whilst backed onto thrf railing a policeman pulled me under and told

me to go through the/open gate which was situated to the right of the

open gate which was Situated to the right of the turnstiles opposite

the river.

It was difficult to find our way to which entry point and at no time

on entering the ground or once inside the ground did we see a steward

to ask directions, we did have problems entering the ground due to

the sheer numbers of people outside I went through the gate shown to

rne by the police officer    I mentioned previously,       but didn't see that
                   gate open      or any other, I saw some' fans        climbing the turnstile wall

                   but I am unsure as to whether they wer^/trying to escape the                 crush or

                   just jumping the q u e u e .                   /

                   As I went through the gate       I d i d n ’tf hand my ticket   in and nobody

                   requested      it from m e , I still possess       it and wish to keep it    but the

                   ticket No      is LL1 59 33.   Once through the gate you vertually           had

                   little    chance as to your direction the/crowd carried you although,                   you

                   were still able to stand.        I d i d n ’y'see any signs directing       people but

                   as previously stated you couldn’t change direction if you wanted to.

                   I would normally stand to the sides of the terraces or (wings) and

                   w o u l d n ’t normally go behind the goal so there was some difficulty
                                               /
                   finding our viewing poln t.

                   The crowd took us through the tunnel and the re w a s n ’t any police              in

                   sight but the turunel w a s n ’t too bad and we were able to move quite

                   freely.     By this time I had lost my mates and decided to continue

                   without them on leaving the tunnel        I went to the right which I no to

                   be Pen 3 now.      The pushing from behind continued and I kept moving

                   forward until     I was up agaipst a barrier some twelve to fifteen feet

                   from the pe r ime t e r fen cj/K I stayed the re untj^J^fcwr'c rush was over and

                   have   ident if ied t h a ^ po i nt on the grid as be ing F5.        I reached this

                   point at about E/55 pm although it was uncomfortable at that t ime and

                   pe o pi e we r e st^fll coming in the crush was n ’t that bad where         I was but

                   people were generally terrified I suppose they had been in there

                   longer than me and had felt the increase              in pressure,    it seemed to get

                   to a stage where there was a constant unbearable              pressure,    there was a

                   lad in front o f me who had obviously gone uder the barrier to stop it

                   caus ing ti^^pressure once down he couldn ’t get up and was face down

       C\1 ' he c o ul dn’t he seemed after a while toJ 0                 talking more slowly and

                   then we nt quiet,     he was about f ifXjrftn years old and had blond h a i r and

              wore a track suit top.     Also there was a girl to the right of me she

              was   purple in colour and kept saying that she was going to die.           When

              I saw the perimeter gate open I said you will be alright now but she

      ''"2^9- said that it was too late.      She was about 22-23 y r s , short greyish

^3            highl ighted hair,   I can *t remember ajjy4rhi ng else about her and d i d n ’t

              see her again,

     *     f*y  I didn't see the barr i^f^ break    in pen 3 but I saw a fall forward of

hxjsS-Sl/     quite a few peopla^and people shouted the barrier had g o n e .

              Throughout t t y r crush I couldn't move from where    I was   I can only

              recall seeing a policeman indicating to people to push back but no-one

              could.   It was suddenly that the pressure       ceased and room appeared

              behind me for me to come away from the barrier        it was then that a

              fellow supporter told me to get out to allow room for emergency

              service to help the injured.         I made my way out via the tunnel which

              was empty I sat in the area between the tunnel and turnstile for about

              five minutes   I then left the ground with a friend at about 3 . 3 0 p m .

              I didn't attend Hospital     in Sheffield




              I feel that the organisation at HILLSBOROUGH in comparison to last

              year was pathetic and the problems started because of this,

              HILLSBOROUGH ground is quite a good one and although the pens provided

              no real escape route organisation could have prevented the problem

              i nt ially I feel that if those gates hadn't have been opened outside

              the ground death would have surely occurred.

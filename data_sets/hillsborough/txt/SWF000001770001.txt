    Dear Mr Chester

    SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS TO LEPPINGS LANE END OF THE GROUND

    With reference to our conversation of last week regarding improvements
    required to the West End of the ground, I forward herewith our thoughts.

    You will see that we favour the erection of a stone wall on the ground side
    of the current terraces, with such wall housing a bank of turnstiles. Our
    belief is that once a spectator goes through the turnstiles he should then
    be segregated from the other fans, and this can be achieved by the erection
    of permanent high metal railings on that concrete area at present behind
    the Stand. Similarly, there should be a high metal railing down the centre
    of the West Stand. What is then created is total segregation of all three
    portions of the Terrace and the two areas of the West Stand, with each of
    these segregated areas having its own refreshment and toilet facilities.

    If you have any query on these recommendations, no doubt you will come back
    to me.

    Yours sincerely




    Chief Superintende:

Dear Dick,
                                     Entrance Routes at Leppings Lane End
                I have pleasure in enclosing three copies of our
sketch 6705/2 showing a possible layout which segregates visitors
from home supporters reasonably well.                                               It also allows flexibility
in allocating varying amounts of accommodation to visitors.
                Suggestions are also made for new refreshment and toilet
areas utilising vacant volume under the West stand.
                We have not attempted to cost the scheme until you have
had time to comment and suggest improvements.


                                                                         Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr D Vaughan

Dear Mr Vaughan,
                       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
       Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane End

         The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
their exit at the end of a game.
         We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks of
turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing
and new gates.
    It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                   Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                                                  Turnstiles at Leppinqs Lane
              After speaking to                                              last Wednesday about the number of
turnstiles required to serve spectators using the Leppings Lane
end of the ground we have altered our proposed layout accordingly.
Three prints of our drawing 6705/3 are enclosed.
              The eighteen existing turnstiles will remain.                                              Ten will serve
 the North stand and eight the terraces for the home supporters.
In addition to four turnstiles from (A - E ) , which can be re-used,
 twelve new turnstiles will be required.                                                Four each of these will be
for home and away spectators using the West stand, four for visiting
 supporters using the terrace under the score board and four more,
primarily for away supporters to the centre terrace, but they could
be used for home supporters if the need arises.                                                        We understand the
police have suggested a central fence to divide the middle section
 rather than provide a 2 m wide sterile area to one side.                                                          This may
 work providing you are happy having home and away supporters in the
 same area outside.
              Would you and                                         be kind enough to have a look at the
 drawing because I would like to hear your comments before proceeding

further, though in the meantime we are pressing on with the toilet
facilities.
     We have spoken to Mayor Turnstiles Ltd who supplied the
turnstiles on Penistone Road and they have told us that if the
new turnstiles are wanted during the close season they will want a
letter of intent within the next few days.   Other clubs are busy
installing new turnstiles and their order book is getting full.     We
can deal with this on your behalf but an indication that the numbers
shown are correct would be useful.

Dear Dick,

                                                         Turnstiles at Leppings Lane

                Thank you for returning the marked copies of our drawings
6705/2 and 3.               After our telephone conversation yesterday we
have altered the layout accordingly.                                            Two prints of our drawing
6705/4 are enclosed for your comments.
                We have equalised each combination of turnstiles and gate
as requested but each gate needs to be at least 2.75 m for exit
purposes.
                If this arrangement is satisfactory, or even if you wish us
to make more alterations, we would be available to have a meeting
with you and South Yorkshire Police sometime next week to discuss
the proposals in detail.

                                                                        Yours sincerely.

 Dear Dick,
                                               Re-organisation of Turnstiles
                            and New Toilet Facilities at Leppings Lane
                     As requested we have now prepared an estimate for the
 cost of works envisaged at the back of the West stand for the
 segregation of visiting spectators.
                     The scope of the work falls into two categories, firstly
 the turnstiles, fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the
toilets and refreshment facilities.
                     The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the back
of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is
enclosed.                 Including the radial fence on the West terrace, we
estimate that the cost of this work, including professional
 fees, is likely to be in the order of £66,600.                                            This
 assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used
 and seven new turnstiles are purchased.
                     Also enclosed is a print of our drawing 6705/7 showing
 the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath
 the West stand.                      We estimate that the cost of the toilets,
 again including professional fees, will probably be around
 £60,700.                This includes stainless steel fittings which are fairly
 resistant to abuse but are expensive.                                    The saving if vitreous                     ^

             sinks would be about £2,200.     If the items of maintenance
             work, listed by S.Y.C.C. Working Party on their last visit,
             and agreed to be done i.e. investigate the condition of the
             concrete frame at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
             of stanchions at the back of the West stand, repointing the
             boundary wall on Penistone Road and providing the mesh infill
             on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the same contract
             we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be made for this.
                     The total expenditure for the whole scheme plus
             the mainteannce work is therefore likely to be about £130 300
             including professional fees and Building Regulations fees.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                        However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                       If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                             a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                It is our view that in the event of
emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish

                                                                    Yours sincerely

Dear Dick,

                I understand, following John Strange's telephone conversation
with you yesterday, that South Yorkshire County Council did not send
youa copy of their letter to us dated 2 May.                                           A copy is now
enclosed.
                A number of things that they request have already been
incorporated since we wrote to them on 9 April.                                              However I do
not think that it is realistic to ask for the gates in the radial
fences and have written to David Vaughan accordingly.


                                                                   Yours sincerely

Dear Sirs,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1985
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April
to consider the proposals which you outlined, the County Fire
Service requested additional time to consider the means of escape
aspects.

I am now able to say that, subject to the incorporation of the
following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and
Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
generally acceptable

(a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile
      numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

(b)   the central area of the Terrace (indicated as the neutral
      area or visiting supporters' terrace) being divided in
      half by a new central radial fence running from the tunnel
      entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
      so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
      appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
      adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
      abandoned);

(c)   the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
      terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial
      fence running from back to front with two gates (the existing
      radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
      area and home supporters - to have a second gate installed);




                                                 /Contd_.   .

                               -   2   -




(d)   the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit
      gates installed — one in the neutral area and one in the
      home supporters area;

(e)   certain gates to have the minimum widths (in metres) indicated
      on the attached plan and to them being fully supervised.




                                           Yours faithfully,

 Dear Dick,
                                      Alterations at Leppings Lane End
                       I enclose a copy of a letter from David Vaughan from
 which you will see that my protest about the gates in the
 radial fences has had some effect.                                                 But we will need to
 discuss this with the Working Party.                                                If they still want two
 gates I would see more sense in one gate per radial fence
 rather than two in one fence and none in the other.


                                                                           Yours sincerely

    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

    In reply to your letter of 8 th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph
    (c) of my earlier letter of 2nd May were included primarily at the request
    of the South Yorkshire Police.

    Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
    are incorporated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
    the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radial fence
    in the right hand area of the Leppings Lane End Terrace (indicated as home
    supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                                        Yours faithfully




                                                        Chief Executive.

Dear Dick,
                                       Alterations at Leppings Lane End
                   We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
                   Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
                        Turnstile Nos                           1-8              -   North stand
                                                                9 - 13 -             North west terrace, home supporters
                                                             14 - 16 -               West stand, home supporters
                                                             17 - 19 -               West stand, away supporters
                                                             20 - 23 -               South west terrace, away supporters
                   The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing.                                             You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar.                          The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters.                                                   The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.
                   Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstile                                             housings (17 & 18)
remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters.                                                    However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch point at

                                    An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144
EASTWOOD £r PARTNERS




the two external gates on the left hand side of the row of six.
It could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side.
We, therefore, show on drawing 6705/8, an improvement to that
arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles (17 & 18) and
constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
gates on the left hand side instead of two.
     We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
be about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
£59,500, both including professional fees.    To these figures add
say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
of 2 May.
     If a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
substantially complete by the start of next season.   This is not
certain but we would have a go.


                             Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                                         Ground Safety Work, 1985
                          Meeting with Chief Superintendent Moseley
                                          and Councillor Mike Smith
               As requested I met the police representatives on Thursday,
 13 June.                   I had some difficulty in persuading Mr. Moseley
 that it was not appropriate to have a high segregating barrier
 down the middle of the seating area in the West stand.                                                     I think
 he finally accepted that it was not necessary to do any more
 than have a relatively low level rail which would be sufficient
 to make the two lots of spectators go to the appropriate
 refreshment bars and toilets and also make their way out through
 the correct route.
               Superintendent Moseley was very concerned about the
 segregation of the two lots of spectators on the West terrace
 on those occasions when the centre of the terrace will be filled
 by visitors.                       He said that on the occasion of the Liverpool
 match he had had to station policemen in pairs down the full
  length of the dividing fence and this had been a very uncomfortable
  situation for the officers.                                            Not least of his difficulties was
  that it was not easy for the officers to get in and out of that

particular area if the ground was packed with spectators.
 He felt that a higher fence than the present one or a double
 fence was necessary.     I suggested that we should have a double
 fence with a gap between so as to keep the spectators apart
 and to provide a space in which his officers could stand.
Fewer policemen would be needed if the spectators had a
gap between them.       It so happens that right alongside the
existing fence there is a gate on to the pitch and if the
 second fence were placed on the other side of the gate, it
will provide an easy access gangway for the police and they
will be able to move in and out of the gap depending on the
situation.    Mr. Moseley was clearly very pleased by this
suggestion and subject to your approval, we are including
the work in the contract for segregating the spectators at
Leppings Lane end.
     I should point out that it will mean losing about a metre
of advertising space because the hoardings carry straight on
past that particular gate at present.       There will have to be
a gap in the hoardingsto enable the police to get in and out and
of course, to evacuate the crowd in emergency.


                         Yours sincerely,

Dear Glvnis,

Ref.:   Alterations - Lepplngs Lane End

Following an inspection by representatives of South Yorkshire County
Council and South Yorkshire Police Authorities, there is a
requirement for us to provide additional segregation arrange­
ments and facilities at the end of the ground mainly
designated for visiting supporters.

Under the existing certificate there Is provision for 4,465
seated and 10,000 standing spectators. During Season 1984/85
there was no occasion when thir area was fully utilised by
visiting supporters. However, during that campaign by close
liaison with, and control by the Police Authorities, culmi­
nating in the use of temporary barriers, the area was made
available for home supporters also.

To eliminate the use of any such temporary facilities and to
ensure satisfactory segregation, design graving* have been
completed by our Consultant Engineers, Eastwood & partners,
approved by the various authorities and a budget price of
£62,500*00 established.

Tenders are currently being obtained and of course would be
made available for the Trust in accordance with their
requirements. In the Beantime approval.for grant «id is sought
and an early decision of the trust would be Appreciated.
lours sincerely, \

Dear Dick,

                                            Alterations at Leppings Lane End

                We have pleasure in enclosing a set of prints of our drawings
showing details of the work at the Leppings Lane End.
                Drawing 6 705/8A is worth a look at because it shows the proposed
 layout of the turnstiles and fences.                                            South Yorkshire Police have
given their approval to the scheme though we have not received
 anything from them in writing.
                Tenders are due back on 11th July, 1985.

                                                                        Yours sincerely




                                                                                                                     <   1 ^

 Dear Dick,
                                            Alterations at Leppings Lane End
                        As mentioned in your telephone conversation with John
 Strange yesterday we have now received tenders for the work
  at the back of the West stand and including other general
 maintenance items.
                        Four completed documents were received together with a
 completed Form of Tender from J. Lee and Sons.                                                   The tender
  return envelopes were opened by Richard Eastwood, witnessed by
  John Strange on 11 July 1985.
                        The total tender sums are as follows

                         Gleeson (Sheffield) Ltd.                                 £73,735.00
                         J.   Lee and Sons                                          74,150.00
                         J.   Finnegan Ltd.                                         79,432.00
                         J.   Glossop Ltd.                                          99,634.15
                        A.J. Loveland                                             106,49 4.08

                         Each of the tenders includes a contingency sum of 10%
  which may or may not need to be expended.                                            The arithmetic
  in Gleesons document has been checked and a minor error increases
  their tender sum by £0.20, to £73,735.20.

                                           An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144
EASTWOOD ft PARTNERS




       You will recall that on 4 June we wrote to you saying
 that we expected the cost of the work to be around £62,500.
 Since then we have added the extra fence on the Leppings
 Lane terrace (£2087), the barrier down the West stand seated
 area £612) and repairs to and replacement of some crush
 barrier posts which did not pass the load tests which we
 recently carried out on Spion Kop (£1606).    The only surprise,
 as John mentioned to you, is the figure of £3000 entered
 against the item for removing and resiting the infra-red
 counters and control gear on turnstiles Nos. 17 and 18.    We
 had to ask the tenderers to go to Phillips Alarms for a quote for
 this work because it is their equipment and they are still in
 the process of installing it.   They have, we suspect, taken
 advantage of the situation and given a high price for the work,
 though it may be that the exercise of moving the control box
 is more involved than we imagine.
       So, after deducting the 10% contingency in the tender
 offered by Gleesons and deducting the above extras we arrive
 at a figure just over our estimate, though we do have to add
 planning and building regulations fees and professional fees
 which will probably amount to about £6000.
       We recommend that the tender submitted by Gleeson
 (Sheffield) Ltd. is accepted but we will wait until you have
 had the opportunity to discuss the tenders with your board
 before sending Gleesons a letter of intent.   Gleesons have
 told us that they can start work almost immediately.


                            Yours sincerely,




                       Signed in Dr. Eastwood's absence

Dear Dick,
                                  Alterations at Leppings Lane End
                We enclose                 marked up printsof our drawings 1610/9 , 6705/18
indicating proposed locations of barriers and gates within
the West stand, showing two barriers in the seated area
rows 77/78 and 102/103, and opening gates to the access floor
area in front of the refreshment bar.
                The proposal for two barriers in the seated area would give
flexibility to the areas allocated to visiting supporters.                                                      The
gates in the access floor would maintain the division of
supporters.                However we would have to consider placing a steward
in attendance at these gates to allow opening in emergency for
unrestricted access to both stair towers.
                It is anticipated that the cost of the additional barrier
and gates should be within the contingency sum allowed in the
present contract with Gleesons.
                We await your comments before proceeding further.


                                                                      Yours sincerely.

 Dear Dick,
                    During the course of the excavations at Leppings Lane,
 Gleesons uncovered a gas main which runs across to the West
 stand and goes up the wall inside the gents toilets to feed
the gas cookers on the first floor.                                                It is quite a large
pipe about 2" diameter.                                          Where the pipe was uncovered there
were signs that it was leaking because bubbles were rising
in the water which was standing in the base of a foundation
excavation.
                    We have called Emgas to do an inspection and they
wish to block off the pipe and carry out a pressure test.
They were unwilling to do this however without an instruction
from the Club so they could give the work an order number.
I tried to ring your office a few minutes ago before leaving
for London and was unable to get through.                                                    I have therefore
placed an instruction with Emgas on your behalf for the test
to be carried out and trust that this is acceptable.

                                                                           Yours sincer

Dear Dick,
                          Planning Consent for Safety Work at Leppings Lar°
                                                                End of Grotind
                 We have today received the formal planning consent for the
works.                  The original is enclosed.                          We have kept a photo-copy
 for our records.
                 You will notice that there are two reserved items.                                    The
 first has been complied with because we have already started
work.                 The second relates to the proposed external materials.
 We shall be conducting the planners round the work in the next
 few days and I do not foresee any difficulties.
                 I mentioned to you a few days ago that in connection with the
 work on Leppings Lane, we had received a Building Regulations
 rejection for the brick walls forming the toilet cubicles and also
 for the brick wall forming the front of the new refreshment
 facilities under the South West corner.                                         In each case this is
 because we have built the wallsoff the existing concrete slab
 instead of breaking through and forming a separate foundation.
                 In my view it is perfectly absurd to request that the walls
 be taken down to new foundations bearing in mind that they are
 on good concrete slabs and only single storey high, and do not

    carry any load.   I expressed my views very firmly during
    the inspection by the Working Party at which the representatives
    of the Building Control department implied that they were
    dissatisfied and could not approve what we are doing.       In
    theory the Town Council could issue a summons in which case
    I take full responsibility.    However we can take comfort
    from the fact that under the new Building Regulations which
    come into operation on 1 November, matters of this kind are
    excluded.   In the circumstances I am sure that the City Council
    will take no further action.

    and within the building or premises etc., shall make provision for disabled persons''
    (Section 4) and "where any provision required by this Act is made on a building in
    compliance, a notice or sign indicating that provision is made for the disabled shall be
    displayed outside the building or so as to be visible from outside it'* (Section 7).

          1. I f th e applicant is aggrieved by th e decision o f th e Council to refuse perm ission or approval for th e proposed
    developm ent, o r to g ran t perm ission or approval subject to conditions, he m ay appeal to th e Secretary o f S tate for
    th e E nvironm ent in accordance w ith section 36 of th e Tow n an d C ountry P lanning A ct 1971, w ithin six m onths of
    receipt of this notice. (Appeals m ust be m ade on a form w hich is obtainable from th e D epartm ent of th e E nviron­
    m ent, Tollgate House, H oulton S treet, B ristol BS2 9 D J). T he Secretary of S ta te had pow er to allow a longer
    period for th e giving of a notice o f appeal b u t he will n o t norm ally be prepared to exercise th is powor unless there
    are special circum stances which excuse th e delay in giving notice of appeal. T he Secretary of S tate is n o t required to
    en tertain an appeal if it appears to him th a t perm ission for th e proposed developm ent could not have been granted
    by th e Council, or could n o t have been so granted otherw ise th a n subject to the conditions imposed by them , having
    regard to th e statu to ry requirem ents, to th e provisions of th e developm ent order, and to any directions given under
    th e order. H e does no t in practice refuse to e n tertain appeals solely because th e decision of th e Council was based
    on a direction given by him

         2. I f permission to develop land is refused or g ran ted subject to conditions, w hether by th e Council or by th e
    Secretary o f St&to for th e E n vironm ent and th e ow ner of th e land claim s th a t th e land has become incapable of
    reasonably beneficial use in its existing sta te and cannot bo rendered capable of reasonably beneficial use by th e carry­
    ing out of any developm ent w hich has been or would be perm itted, he m ay serve on th e Council a purchase notice
    requiring th e Council to purchase his in terest in th e land in accordance w ith th e provisions o f P a rt IX of th e Town
    and C ountry Planning Act 1971.

         3. In oertain circum stances, a claim m ay be m ode against th e Council for com pensation, where perm ission is
    refused or granted subject to conditions by th e Secretary o f S ta te on appeal or on a reference of the application to
    him . T he circum stances in w hich such com pensation is payable are set o u t in section 169 of th e Town and C ountry
    Planning A ct 1971.

          4. This planning perm ission does n o t co nstitu te a perm ission, approval or consent by th e Council for any
    o th er purpose w hatsoever. A pplication m u st therefore be m ade to th e appropriate D epartm ent of th e Council
    for any o ther perm ission, approval or consent (including approval under th e Building Regulations) which m ay be
    necessary in connection w ith th e proposed developm ent or any thin g incidental thereto, or th e use to be m ade of
    th e prem ises which form th e subject of such developm ent.

         5. I f a t a la ter d ate an extension of th e period of th is perm ission is desired, an application for th e purpose
    should be m ade to th e Council before th e expiration of th e period, an d an ap plican t being aggrieved by th e refusal
    of the Council to g ra n t perm ission for such extension, m ay appeal to th e S ecretary of S ta te for th e E nvironm ent
    in accordance w ith Section 36 o f th e Town and C ountry P lanning A ct, 1971.

 Dear Dick,
                               Modifications at Leppings Lane End
                     Please find attached a financial statement relating
to the work which is now almost complete at the Leppings Lane
end.
                     Without the additional items requested by S.Y.C.C. at
the meeting held on 7 August we could have expected a final
contract sum of about £70,357 leaving approximately £3,348
change from the tender sum.
                     However, after adding the likely cost of the extra items
requested by S.Y.C.C. it looks as though we can expect an
overspend of around £375.                                                     The figures used in the statement
have been built up from our own estimates.                                                    We still have to
agree various costs with Gleesons and this may take a
while to resolve, for we already detect some resistance from
them, but we will see.


                                                                         Yours sincerely

                Modifications and Toilets at Leppings Lane End


    Gleesons Contract Sum                                    £73,735
    (which included a contingency sum of £6,703)


    1.   Additional items instructed by us or were found
    to be necessary as work proceeded, the cost of which
    can be legitimately taken out of contingencies.     The
    cost of these items has been estimated by us but the
    final cost has yet to be agreed with Gleesons           £4,510


    2.   Items instructed by us as work proceeded     which
    results in a likely saving.   Again the cost of these
%
    items has been estimated by us but the final
    savings that may be made have yet to be agreed with
    Gleesons.                                                 £1,185


    Likely final contract sum that could have been
    expected before the meeting with S.Y.C.C. on 7 August
                                                            £70,357


    Additional items requested by S.Y.C.C. during     the
    meeting on 7 August or with Superintendent J.     Freeman on 31 July.
    a)   Three gates in perimeter fences                     £1,350
    b)   Fence and gate at first floor level in the
%   c)
         West stand
         Sign board fixings in the West stand
                                                             £2,100
                                                               £300

                                                             £3,750


    The cost of these items has been estimated by us but the final
    costs that may be incurred have yet to be agreed with Gleesons
    and their sub-contractors.


    If the cost of the last three items is taken from the
    remainder of the contingency then there is an overspend of
    approximately £375.

Dear M r . Robins,

                                   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                         Segregation work at Leppinqs Lane

                 The segregation of supporters at the Leppings Lane
end of the ground was first proposed some time before
September 1981.                         We do not know the exact date but the
original request that schemes be looked at was made by
South Yorkshire Police in the days when Mr. England was
the Club Secretary.                                  Some rough outline schemes were
prepared at that time but the work did not proceed.

                In February this year the matter was raised again
and more schemes devised.                                              Approval of a scheme was
given by SYCC in May.                                     Shortly after that;another, much
less expensive scheme was put forward.                                              After agreeing
several matters of detail with SYCC and the Club,
construction work eventually started on 22 July, 1985.
The work is now almost complete.

     Enclosed are copies of the following documents

Dear Mr. Chester,

     The Trustees have considered your application for grant aid in respect
of expenditure arising out of the provisions of the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 incurred during the period 1st March to 30th September
1985 (Claim No. 18).

     The Trustees decided they would make a grant to your club of 75%of
approved expenditure subject to the grant limit in force at the time.

     After receiving a report from the Surveyors employed by the Trust,
Messrs. G. Corderoy & Co., it was decided to accept a claim for the
amount of £104,470.96 and, therefore, payment is due to your club of                               '
75%of £104,470.96 * £78,353.
     Payment is conditional on your satisfying Messrs. Corderoy & Co. that
your club has met the bills covered in the sum of £134,830.20 and the
standard Auditors Certificate would be sufficient. In the event that this
has not already been completed I enclose a copy for your use.

     As soon as Messrs. G. Corderoy & Co. can notify me that this condition
has been met I will be able to forward a cheque for the amount due.


           CV                        Yours sincerely,




                                         Secretary.

Dear Dick,
                                     Leppings Lane - Safety Works
                                     Messrs. Gleesons Account
                      Please excuse the delay in replying to your letter of 26
February.                     I think it will be some time before we have
 agreement on Gleesons final account.                                                 In our view they have
overclaimed on a number of items and it will take many months
before they accept our figures.
                      Our present assessment is that the final account we shall
 agree will be about £7 4,417.                                               At the moment Gleesons are
 asking for £78/064.00.
                      We informed Corderoys some weeks ago informally that the
 final cost is likely to be around £74,417.                                                    They have asked
 for a split of the work which is associated with toilets and
 that which is exclusively safety (repairs to barriers, investigation
 of south stand concrete etc.).                                                 If you would like us to have a
 further word with Corderoys or to write to them formally we will
 be very pleased to do so.
                      With regard to our own accounts, the £123 was planning fees
 which we paid to the City Council on your behalf and which you
 have already reimbursed us.                                                 Our account for £7,158.00 covers
 97$% of fees based on an estimate of £74,000 for the final account.
 Assuming that we eventually certify £74,417.00 as being due to

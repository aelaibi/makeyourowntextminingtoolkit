PRIME MINISTER


                                                                                                           FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


The Home Secretary had a meeting yesterday with Lord Justice
Taylor - see Flag A.                                                                                         Lord Justice Taylor was distinctly
unhelpful.                                                               His interim report would be largely devoted to an
account of what happened (he claims this will be more
difficult to establish than with the Bradford fire but ignores
the fact that Mr.                                                                                        Justice Popplewell also had to look into the

incident at Birmingham) plus some recommendations on physical
security and matters of police p r o c e d u r e .                                                                                                             He thought it
unlikely that he would reach the membership card issue until
                          —                ---

later.


The Lord President held a meeting with the Home Secretary, the
Secretary of State for the Environment, the Lord Privy Seal
and Mr. Moynihan to discuss the implications of Lord Justice
Taylor's views.                                                                                         The rather comic position was reached whereby
Mr. Ridley~was arguing that the business managers would not be
able to get the Bill through but the business managers were
arguing that, while difficult, this was still possible given
careful management.                                                                                        At this point the Lord President
adjourned the meeting.


The Lord President's reading of the situation is that
Mr. Ridley believes he has given an undertaking to
backbenchers that the Bill would not be proceeded with until
Lord Justice Taylor has produced an interim report.                                                                                                                        And since
an interim report on the issue in question will come too late,
the Bill is doomed.


Mr. Ridley has gone, or believes himself to have gone, further
than you did in your response to Mr. Kinnock.                                                                                                                        You said


                       "A Bill completed in this session would still be able to
                      take account of any interim recommendations by Lord
                      Justice Taylor".
                              ___                                                                            ^
                                      2




        "The Bill will not pre-empt any decisions that m ay be
        made by Lord Justice Taylor".


Your argument is that the enabling/framework nature of the
Bill allows changes to be made to the scheme even after the
B ill has achieved Royal Assent and that the House,            in
endorsing the Secretary of State's approval of the scheme, has
an opportunity to consider whether adequate changes have been
made.     You also argue that keeping the Bill going provides a
VetrTcle for acting on any recommendations that are in the
interim report.                                       ---------- -— =—


The note which was circulated to backbenchers - Flag                B   -

stated that "the design of the scheme" will be able to take
account of the final report of Lord Justice Taylor's current
inquiry.     I n s t a t e d that "the Bill will provide the
legislative vehicle to enable the Government to implement any
relevant recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report".     It did not promise that the interim report would
cover the membership scheme.                          -—                    ——


The Lord President believes that, whatever Mr. Ridley may
have said, it should still be possible to provide backbenchers
with the assurance that proceeding with the Bill does not take
the Government past the point of no return.


At some stage, Lord Justice T a y l o r 's position is likely to
become known.     You will need to convince Mr. Ridley that this
does not preclude further progress with the Bill.


Agree a meeting early next week?

            supporter all my life.

           On Saturday       15 April     1989 (150489),       I went to Hillsborough to watch

            the F.A. Cup Semi          final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                    I

            obtained my ticket from Anfield,             I paid £6.00,           it was for Leppings Ln

                   and some of my son's friends,          their first names were

           and another one who           I ca n ’t remember his name.             We travelled to

           Sheffield by hired car,           leaving     Liverpool about           10.00am (1000).     We

            did not go via the suggested route because myj                          knew how to get

            there.     We stopped in Barnsley at a pub,               I   i      one tyrlLnk, some of the

            others had a game of pool,            then we continue                     Sheffield.

                 with people so much that            it tooL/us h W f    an hour to get a drink.           Most

                 of the people were sitting outside having a drink because                        it was

                 such a nice day.           Everyone was happy and in a good mood and looking

                 forward to the match.           About 2.00pm (1400) a number of police officers

                 approached and told us to start making our way towards the ground.

                 We arrived at the ground just before 2.30pm                 (1430).    When I went
o . o . £_
                 through the outer gates heading towards the turnstiles                    I saw a mass of

                 people waiting.           Towards my right    I saw a mounted Police Officer,               a

                  ergeant, and a group of Policemen on foot.                  I could not see any

                 queues          in front of the turnstiles,    people were going through

                 extremely slowly,          and I wondered why the Police Officers present were

                 not      encouraging      people to form an orderly queue to          ease the congestion,

                 The      crowd continued to build up behind us,          people began       to complain to

                 one      another to      stop pushing, they also began urging the          Police to try

                 and      control the     crowd to get into some sort of order.            All the while

                 the pressure around me intensified until                it became extremely

                 uncomfortable.           This   continued for at   least    15 minutes until        I managed

                 to gain admission through a turnstile,             with extreme difficulty.               I

                 threw down my ticket at the steward in disgust and did not even wait

                 for the stub.

                 Having entered in the area behind the turnstiles                 I looked round and

                 all      I could see     was a tunnel direct>5?^ahead.        I assumed    that that was

                  the way towards the terracing /fid headed towards it.  I did not see

                 I could see the top of the crossbar.             I was able to        walk at my own pace

                 along the tunnel          because there was hardly anyone else about.                As I

                 approached the exit I realised that there were already numerous

          people on the terraces and I had to begin forcing my way through them.

          I remember my son telling me to go to the right of the goal and

          therefore       I emerged from the tunnel               into, what         I am now told to be pen

          3.

          I began heading towards my right,                    between the people, with some

          difficulty until          I realised that I could go no further because of

          the lateral         fencing.      The pressure around me began to intensify,                             I

          found that          I had lost    control     of where        I wanted to go, and I was

          pushed down and towards the middle of the pen.                                 I ended up between

          two barriers very near to the front.

          People all around me were shouting and screaming out                                 in pain from the

          severe       crushing of bodies together and also against the barriers.                                      We

          began to shout to the Police Officers,                        who were directly in front but

          on the other side of the perimeter fence,                         to open the safety gate

          so that those at the very front could get out on the pitch.                                          The crowd

          was shouting          "open the gate,        open the g a t e ” , and the policeman kept

          saying       "push back,    push back".          This was obviously impossible to do

-    .    because we were all             tightly wedged and ye             could only move our heads.
O/vT
          I    could    not    understand    why   those     pfbl^cemen       kept       telling     us   to    push

         ) tack   when    they    could    see   the   d ^ngjpyo u V s i t u a t i o n   we   were    in.

          I am 6 feet tall and weigh 14 and a half stones and I consider myself

          to be fit for my age.              The severe crushing on my body was so intense

          that    I could only move my left hand which was held head high.                                      My left

          leg was not touching the floor and most of my weight was being

          supported by the bodies around me.                      The    pressure on my chest was
                                                                  ✓
          intense and I had difficulty i n breathing.

          Someone behind my right shoulder was shouting,                             " t h e r e ’s two girls

          under your feet",          I co uld n ’t look down to see if anyone was being

          trampled on and I co ul dn ’t make contact with any bodies with my feet.

          Another      chap who was directly on my right was crushed against the end

              of a barrier.     He appeared to be side on to the barrier with his legs

              on either side and the end of the barrier          in between,   pressing   into

              his groin.     He was continually screaming out       in agony and for help.         I

              haveyrtever heard anyone screaming like that but nobody could do

              anything.

                 eri the people were shouting at the policemen to open the gate,            they

              opened it and about        10 people managed to get out however the policemen

              sh ut/the gate preventing anyone else getting out.____

 F/W5            ould see the people        in front of the fence scaling      it and dropping

                      onto the pitch.      Others   perched on top and tried to pull others
 ^e.iH
              out of the crush and over the fencing.         Everyone was fighting for

              survival and this seemed to go on for ages.           At one point    I also felt

              myself going under and realised that          I was also going to die.

              After what seemed like eternity the pressure from the back began to

              ease off and I was able to breathe freely and I found spaces appearing

              around me. Police Officers appeared on the terraces,             I think they came

              from behind me.      As more gaps appeared I was able to look around

              me and saw bodies scattered about.

              I saw 4 bodies in front of me,         piled on top of each other in a tangled

              mass of arms and legs.         I think they were mostly men.       It was

              obvious that they were dead because          I could not see any movement at

              all.     I could see a couple of faces which were chalk white.

 fad          j also Saw,   to the left of this pile of bodies,       the body of a

A/<o(^0       girl whose    legs were tangled -amongst the other bodies           I moved her to

more    room.

I also saw a big chap lying on the floor.          He appeared to have no

shirt on.        I would say that he was in his twenties.         He looked dead

to me but a policeman knelt by him looking for any signs of life.                      He

said that he thought the big chap was still         breathing and pushed his

hand onto the chaps's heart but there was no response.                   I. then helped

4 other    chaps to pick him up and hand him through the safety gate to

other    policemen and fans who were on the pitch.           .

Throughout the time that       I spent on the terra^/ng,         I was helping other

people to move the bodies of the dead even/out of the pen.                   I was

walking    round partly in shock at what      i/had been through and at what                I

was seeing all around me.         I coiinted/at least 20 bodies          lying dead

around me.        I recollected assisfti/fg in the removal       of at    least 2 dead

females.        A number of Poli cemen also   came up to me and seeing how

distressed 1 was asked me if I wanted to go to an ambulance.                  I

declined because,       apart from being short of breath,         I felt all      right.

I remained on the terraces until the last body was removed.                   All

around were items of personal        property such as coats,        shoes,    monies,       a

wrist watch etc.        I saw a policewoman walking along the terraces

checking for property.

I eventually left the ground still        in a daze and began asking

policemen for directions but they said that they were not local.

Eventually a woman pointed me in the right direction and I walked to

where my son had parked the car.         The others were already there

waiting for me.

I must mention the behaviour of the Liverpool          fans who were the first

to realise the extent of the tragedy unfolding on the terraces.                      They

got stuck       in helping the injured and carrying the dead from the

terraces onto the pitch.        The people who lived by the ground were also

great    by the way they helped the fans when they came outside.

         I was not impressed by the actions of the Poli ce^during the time that

Ca t     I was    involved in the crush outside the tur ns>   I d s ^ t felt that they

         ought to have done more than just s t a n d i n g around until   it was too

         late for them to do anything.      I feejXthat   if the fans had

         been directed by the stewards andVpolice away from the tunnel the

         t ragedy would have been averted.

              deceased whom         I dealt with.



              I refer     in my original          statement to moving the body of a female and

              feeling for a pulse but not being able to find ana,                                I later described

              moving this girls body,               assisted by other football               supporters.     The

              body was      pased over       peoples heads from Pen 3 into the neighbouring Pen

              which I understand            is Pen 2.        The body was            passed to other supporters

              whose identity I do not know.

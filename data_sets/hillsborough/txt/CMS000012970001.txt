From the Private Secretary
                                                              3 August 1989

                                  CONFIDENTIAL                                -O   /




                              HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY {M- .
         The Prime Minister was        grateful    for   your     Secretary   of
S t a t e 's minute of 2 August.

     I would be grateful if you could ensure that the following
is seen only by those with a clear need to know.

     This is to confirm our earlier telephone conversation.   The
Prime Minister is content for the report to be published on
Friday and for the Home Secretary to issue a statement and
circular along the lines proposed.    However, she considers that
the statement should welcome the thoroughness of the report and
its  recommendations  rather   "than the broad thrust of the
report," given the criticisms it makes of the police.

     I am copying this to the private secretaries of members of H
Committee, Roger Bright (Environment) and Trevor Woolley (Cabinet
Office).

                                                          /

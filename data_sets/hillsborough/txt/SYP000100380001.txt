POLICE CONSTABLE 928




'El' HACKENTHORPE




On 15 April 1989 > I was on weekly leave, but had previously been warned to

commence       duty at Hackenthorpe Police Station at 8.15 am that                                     day.        This I

did with other officers from Hackenthorpe.                              I was assigned duties as part of

serial number 13 which was lead by Police Sergeant 2001 Burman of 'El' sub­

division.           We     travelled to the ground as a serial arriving                       at approximately

8.45    am.         We   then went straight          to the North Stand where                 we occupied our

specified          seats    in    serials,     as    previously          directed.     We    remained              seated

until briefing took place at 10.00 am.                           Immediately after briefing, we had a

packed lunch, again in the North Stand,                          to be on our points at 11.15 am for

the gates opening at 12 noon.

My   specific        duties       related     to    the    Leppings       Lane    Stand,     in    company           with

Police       Constable           1423   Newbould,         were    before     the     match    to        patrol        the

concourse area at the rear of the upstairs stand.                                This is an area where the

toilets       and refreshments are.                This duty was until             the match started,                when

we were to be relieved by another serial.

Liverpool          supporters       started        arriving       and    entering     the    stand            at    about

12.15    pm,        but very       few had   entered       up to approximately          1.30       pm.         Between

1.30    pm    -     2.15    pm more supporters            entered the ground but              it was apparent

that there were still a great many still outside                              the ground.

It was apparent that a number of the supporters                              had been drinking, but none

caused       any    problem       inside     the    ground.        Whilst     continuing          to    patrol        the
concourse,         a view was available onto the perimeter wall, gates and road.                                        I

could       see    that    there       was    a    large    number       of     supporters          gathering    on   the

opposite      side of the road               to the ground,          on the grass banking and none of

these       supporters      were       making any attempt            to enter          the    ground,    even though

the kick off was not far off.

Supporters         that    were       entering      the     ground   were        making       specific     complaints

about pushing at the turnstiles.                          At this time a message was broadcast over

the tannoy system to fans outside the ground to stop pushing.                                           This appeared

to have no effect and fans had started to scale the walls to gain access to

the ground and/or escape the crush outside.

It    was    now    becoming       apparent         that    people       were    being       injured     outside      the

ground.       A number of supporters were entering the concourse area with minor

facial injuries and breathing difficulties after being caught in the pushing

outside.          Both myself and Police Constable                       1423 Newbould          gave what aid we

could in the circumstances.                       At this time, I was made aware that a gate was

open and a large number of fans directed their anger in abuse and threats at

Police Constable Newbould and myself as they entered the concourse area.

I    remained      in     the   concourse          area    as    supporters       continued          to enter and I

attempted to help as many                    of the supporters as I could that were injured.

Several      became       unsteady      and       collapsed as       they entered             the    concourse    area.

With    other      officers       I    helped       these       people    in     the    recovery        position      and

ensured that they were breathing.                          After a short time it was apparent that

these people         would have         to be       taken to the ambulance                   services    outside      the

ground      for treatment.             Together with Police Constable 2167 Frost,                           I picked

up a young male person and carried him out to the rear of the Leppings Lane

stand where he was left vomiting in the care of the ambulance service and a

friend.        I returned         to    the stand and concourse where I saw for                            the    first
                                                -   3    -




time    the   injuries      that   had   occurred            on   the    pitch.      I   returned    to    the

concourse     where   the fans were very hostile towards                     the Police,         and at this

time I feared for the safety of officers working in that area.

I stayed in        this area with supporters             trying to talk/advise/assist them in

what ever way possible.

As the disaster became more clear, and it was obvious that the game was not

going   to continue,        I,   together with other officers,                    tried as   tactfully as

possible      to   advise    the   supporters       to       leave      slowly.     A    small    number   of

families did so.         Large numbers of supporters appeared very angry and upset

and directed their anger at the officers present.

In the course of time, a large number of supporters left the ground quietly

and slowly as requested and were consoled and advised as they left.

When the Leppings Lane stand had been cleared, together with other officers,

I made my way to the North Stand for the de-brief.

I returned to Hackenthorpe Police Station with other officers finishing duty

at 6.00 p m .

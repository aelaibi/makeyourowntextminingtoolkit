HILLSBOROUGH: Q & A BRIEFING FROM THE ATTORNEY
GENERAL’S OFFICE: LETTER FROM THE HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY
SUPPORT GROUP

Further to Paul Pugh’s submission of 26 June covering the draft announcement and Q
& A briefing, I attach the Q & A material from the Attorney General’s office received
today.


2.     I also attach a copy of a letter from the Hillsborough Family Support Group
covering a summary of the matters which the families feel ought to be considered in
any new inquiry, which I undertook to bring to your attention. The reference to an
inquiry is speculation on their part as we have not given them any details of what will
be contained in the announcement on Monday.

3.      There is nothing new in the concerns set out in the attached summary from the
families. Although they will be disappointed that you are not, at this stage,
establishing a new public enquiry, they should at least be reassured that there will be
anindej ’            '' ’          r judicial figure.

      Dear                           '

      Firstly may I thank you for taking the trouble to contact me
      yesterday regarding the Home Secretary's announcement on Monday.
      Your courtesy meant that all members of the Hillsborough Family
      Support Group were notified prior to today's media speculation.

      Please find enclosed a brief paper which sets out a summary of
      matters which families feel ought to be considered in any new
      enquiry. The paper also spells out the conditions under which
      such enquiry should be set up. I hope that the Home Secretary's
      decision can encompass such matters. I should be grateful if you
      could let the Home Secretary have sight of the same.

      I thank you for your assistance.

      Yours sincerely

                 HILLSBOROUGH FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP

Any new enquiry into the Hillsborough disaster of 15th April 1989
must consider the impact of the new evidence upon the findings of
the Taylor Enquiry and of the inquests held in 1989-90 when formal
verdicts of accidental death were returned. This evidence was
recently submitted to the Home Office and Crown Prosecution
Service.

A summary of this evidence is as follows:

1*    Video evidence and the evidence of Roger Houldsworth show
      that crucial evidence available on the day of the disaster
      was suppressed. This evidence reveals that the police were
      aware in their control box that the terraces were
      overcrowded, and that subsequent police assertions that
      cameras were faulty were untrue.

2.    New evidence from/ for example. Dr. Ed Walker shows that the
      very simple explanation presented to the jury at the inquests
      that death followed very soon upon unconsciousness to all or
      almost all victims was wrong. Contrary indications to this
      simplistic analysis were improperly withheld from the jury.

3.    Further evidence shows failures on the part of the police in
      that they refused access to the injured and dying by
      paramedics.

4.    Cumulatively, these failings raise deeply disturbing
      questions about the way in which evidence was selected by the
      West Midlands Police for presentation to the jury.

5.    The Hillsborough Family Support Group continues to argue that
      perjury was committed, and the course of justice at the
      inquest and Taylor Enquiry was perverted.

Inorder that the truth be established finally, a     new enquiry
should be set up under the following conditions:
                                                                   \/
(A)   It should be chaired by a Lord Justice of Appeal, or other
      senior judge.
(B)   Lay assessors of genuine and obvious independence should sit
      with the judge.
(C)   Witnesses ought to give evidence under oath.

(D)   The Support Group must, in the overwhelming interests of
      justice, be allowed legal representation.

(E)   Full disclosure of relevant documents ought to be made in
      advance to interested parties, in contrast to the inadequate
      provision for disclosure that prevailed at the inquests.

 (F)    The Enquiry must have the power to recommend the quashing of
        the verdicts at the inquests.

 (G)    It is accepted that the Enquiry cannot be as detailed or time
        consuming as the original Enquiry and Inquests. Nonetheless
        it is imperative that the new evidence be comprehensively
        examined.

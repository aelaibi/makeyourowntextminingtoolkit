1.   I was born on 10.2.60.                  I am a qualified ambulance man.

     This involves a two week induction course followed by six

     weeks basic training and two weeks driving course.                         You then

     spend 12 months on the road and go back for assessment.                          If

     you pass you are then a qualified ambulance man.                            I have

     been in the service for about 6 and a half years.                             After

     every    five    y ea r s    you   have    to go back         to the regional

     training     school         at   Leicester.         T here     is     a two   week

     residential      course and a local course for one week.                        You

     have to go every five years to maintain your qualification.

     Before the ambulance service I was in the Navy for four and

     a half years.          I was       an    able   s ea m e n   wi t h   no   medical

     training.       I also worked with the Red Cross before joining

     SYMAS.    I learned basic first aid with the Red Cross.



2.   On the Thursday and Friday I was on a shift of 1400 to

     2200.    On Saturday I was supposed to be off for the day.                        I

     was asked by Station Officer Eason if I would cover the

     football match and I agreed.                I had never done a football

     shift before.        It was explained that this was a big match

     and that we wanted to put cover on for it.                       Eason asked me

     on Friday.      We were told to meet at the station for 1345 on

     the Saturday.       I arrived a bit earlier so that I could get

     something to eat.            I saw Eason and qualified ambulance man

                  I was the driver down to the ground.
Eason,    Station Officer Higgins and myself all went down in

one ambulance.



Higgins directed the way.          We received no direct briefing as

to what     to expect.       I was not aware of any   "Hillsborough

plan".       I did know about the        major incident plan which

applies     to   any     major    incident   and   deals   with   the

relationship between the police and other authorities.              I

knew that the first thing for a crew to do was to set up

first aid        posts    and sort    out where vehicles were coming

from.       We were      to assess the   situation with regard     to

numbers     and types of injuries and inform           control what

vehicles were required.          We should advise on the best access

routes and set up a" casualty clearing point .        We should then

liaise with senior fire officers and police officers until

someone of a higher rank arrived to take charge.            The first

vehicle should always stay and that is initially regarded as

the command vehicle.



We set off to the ground at about 1400.             It took 10 to 15

minutes to get there.            Herries Road was busy with fans in

cars.     We parked in the north stand Spion Kop area.        Station

Officer Higgins told me to park there on the way down.             We

did not try to get the vehicle any further towards the pitch

than that.       It was about 1410 to 1415 when we arrived.        We

then chatted while the station officers were checking their

portable hand sets to see if they worked.           Apparently there
was static on them.         At 1430   we all walked to the front of

the pitch     and   stood    in   the corner next to the police,

St.John's ambulance men and the press.           The view was good.

The Spion Kop was already full and the north stand was

already    full.    The west stand was half to three quarters

full and the south stand about half full.            The west stand

was   filling in the middle but not towards the sides.             We

stood and chatted and just observed the crowd.             I returned

to the vehicle every five to ten minutes to check that it

was OK.     Nothing happened prior to kick off and kick off

took place at 1459,         this was the time shown on electronic

scoreboard.



At about 1503 I saw: people spilling on-the pitch behind th«

Liverpool goal out of the west stand.           All four of us were

standing    at the time.          I said to Eason that there was

something going on up at the top end and we could already

see some people lying on the pitch.          Mr Eason and I decided

to go an investigate.             I was thinking it was the usual

idiots invading the         pitch.    Eason and I went   up the pitch

side line in front          of the north stand and       a few police

officers    followed us.          The game was still continuing.    I

think it was about 1504.          We saw a lot more people spilling

on to the pitch as          we walked up and when we got to the

corner of the north         stand you could see lots     of people on

the   floor rolling about and climbing over the fence.             The

police were initially trying to stop them going on to the
pitch.      There were now probably 50 to 70 people on the

pitch.      We went further round and got to just before the

goal posts when a fan lashed out and hit Eason and then hit

me and ran off.      The time was 1505 and the game was still

continuing.     We then moved to the 18 yard box to avoid being

hit again.     Eason used his portable radio to call control to

ask control to call Higgins and             who were back at the

ambulance and tell them to bring the basic equipment down

and a stretcher and fracture straps as it looked like a few

people had broken legs and other injuries.       At this stage I

still did not think that we were dealing with fatalities.        I

looked at the west stand and could see police standing up to

the fence.       Fans were running out on the pitch and the

Forestv-fanSr -were; chanting. .--.People were-.still climbing over

the   top    of the fence   and the police and     fans were now

helping to drag people over the fence.



I do not know whether Eason got through with his message but

the next thing was that                came up to where we were

standing and he was not carrying anything.        Eason then told

            and myself to go back and fetch stretchers and frac

packs.      This was now about 1507.     By this stage the match

had stopped and the players were going into the tunnel.

             and I jogged back to the ambulance and got one

stretcher, one frac pack, a bag mask resuscitator, portable

oxygen and first aid bags containing, dressings, airways and

general first aid equipment.       Station officer Higgins said
he would get the other stretcher ready and the frac packs

and bring them down.     We did not radio control and I do not

know if Higgins or Eason called.           We all went back up the

pitch this time diagonally across it.          It was now chaos in

the west stand.     People were all over the pitch and climbing

over the fencing.     I still did not know why they were trying

to get out though it did cross my mind that there might have

been a surge in the crowd.       It was now about 1510.     I could

see people lying on the pitch and I did not think in terms

of fatalities.



I went up to the goal mouth were Eason was waiting for us.

A person was on the floor against the post.          Eason said he

had’1suspected broken* 'leg.    I trfeate’d hint with the frac pack

which took about one minute.          I then looked up and saw

people giving mouth to mouth resuscitation on the floor.

The people were mainly police and St.John's ambulance.            I

got up and went to my first aid bag to get some airways out.

A policeman came up to me and asked for some airways for

mouth to mouth resuscitation and gave him one.             This was

when   I realised    that there     were    casualties,   possibly

fatalities, but a serious incident.



I set off to see what I could do and put in about six or

seven airways on various people within a very short space

of time.   All these people were being tended by the police

or St.John's ambulance.        It was now about 1512.     I then saw
a young boy on the floor with the policeman so I went over

to help.     I put an airway into the boys mouth and told the

policeman to do a cardiac massage while I did mouth to

mouth resuscitation.             Then a crowd of fans surrounded us and

kicked me a few times.              They were definitely kicks and not

accidentally bumping into me.                    I then saw fans carrying

advertising boards as stretchers.                   They fell over onto us

and we shoved them off and continued to treat the young boy.

There was no response from him.                   I went back to my bag to

see   if there were             anymore   airways       and   found    that     the

stretcher      had      go n e    together       with   the    bag    and masks.

Apparently                 had taken it.          I left the young boy with

the policeman - I believe that the boy was now dead - and

went to see           there was anyone I-could help.



By    this   ti m e    I realised         t here    was   a m ajor     incident

happening.      I saw Eason and he told me that there were ten

vehicles      on      t h eir    way.     This     was now about        1520.     I

presumed that Eason must have managed to get through to

control.     I went back to the ambulance to see if there were

any more airways.           As I got back to the vehicle I saw that

the doors were open and two people were in the back working

on a casualty.                      was also there.           Another ambulance

(a dual purpose Ford) had now arrived and was parked by the

side of ours.          I went back into our vehicle and gave mouth

to mouth resuscitation.                          then went into the drivers

seat and was about to set off when someone said that there
      was an asthmatic in a distressed state.       We put him in the

      front seat and then left with the police escort up to the

      Northern General which is the nearest hospital.        This was

      now about 1530 to 1535.     It is about two or three miles away

      and is straight up Herries Road.



10 . We had no problems getting out with the police outside
      directing us and stopping other traffic.      We arrived at the

      hospital    about   five minutes later and went straight into

      casualty.     They were already expecting us.        There were

      already four or five ambulances there and fans in casualty.

      I took the patient to the plaster room and gave him to the

      casualty staff and then went back to my vehicle.        I put a

      spare   stretcher, back on the vehicle ,in order to get back to

      the ground.    We had a police escort back to the ground.



11.   It took us five minutes to get back to the ground and again

      there was no problem in access.       When we were back in the

      yard by the gym               went into the gym which was the

      casualty clearing point.      He returned later with a trolley

      and a man with chest injuries on it.        We loaded him on to

      the ambulance.      There was already a young male casualty with

      pelvic injuries on board and then left for the Hallamshire.

      We had heard from someone that the Northern General was

      full.    It took about five minutes for us to arrive at the

      gym, get loaded and set off again.      Hallamshire hospital is

      about five miles away.      Again we had a police escort and I
think       it    took   us     a b out   10    minutes.    We   arrived   at

approximately 1605.             We had no problems en route.          We were

met    by   someone       at    casualty       and were then directed to

orthopaedic and unloaded the patients to the casualty staff.




                     the Standards and Efficiency Officer told us

not to go back to the ground but to stand by on Netherthorpe

Road dual carriageway.              This is about one and a half to two

miles away.         She did not say why we were to wait there.             We

made our way there without a police escort and it only took

us a few minutes.              I then radioed to control and said that

we were standing by as instructed.                      They acknowledged my

message-.        Another-vehicle parked up -behind u s .         Control then *

told us to proceed to Herries Road bus depot and stand by

there but not to. go anywhere near the ground.                       I do not

really know what time it was but it may have been around

16.30.       It took us another five to ten minutes to get to

Herries bus depot.               I backed the vehicle up.          There were

already about 20 vehicles there and Eason was directing

things.          He told us to stand by.             We kept seeing vehicles

coming in and out.             About 20 minutes later we were told that

the first three in the line were to go to the gym.                    We were

one of them.          It took us about five minutes to get to the

gym.     There was easy access.                Mr.               was there and

appeared to be in charge.                 There were about six vehicles

parked around.           We parked and then went to get a drink from
      the police.               then told us to return to the station.

      This was about 1805 to 1810.        We arrived at the station at

      about 1825 and I signed off at about 1840.



13.   My vehicle call number is Sierra 405.        The ambulance carries

      standard equipment of two trolleys,          scoop stretcher,      two

      frac packs,        bag and masks,   resuscitators, suction unit,

      oxygen   cylinder,      pain killing   gas   and   first   aid    kit,

      including airways.

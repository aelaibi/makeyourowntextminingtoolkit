      Dear Richard,

      I would like to take this opportunity of thanking you for
      the time and trouble which you took on Friday in going over
      some of the t>roblems and difficulties arising out of a
      Major Incident such as the one that you have had at Zebrugge
      and the one that I am nor dealing -,1th at Hillsborough.
      I am also most grateiH -i. for you for Turing arrangements
      for Bill Haddocks to come along and participate in the
      discussion, and for indicating that if need be he would be
      i-filling to come up and give us fcha ^eR-sfit of his experience.

      I found Johnnyâ€™s comments very helpful and I am sure
      I have gained a lot from the time which I suent with
      all of you.

      I really would like to say I very much appreciated the
      excellent lunch which you gave me. I am most grateful
      and hope that if you are ever up in Sheffield, you will
      not hesitate to call in and see me,

      I am also grateful that you have indicated that if I
      have any further problems, I may get in touch with you. I
      will try and avoid taking up toe much of your time, but I
      fear that I may well want to discuss certain aspects with
      you as we get nearer to the actual Incuesta.

      Yours sincerely.

       H.M. Coroner.

PAUL   KOGER JOMES. HEIECIPIE CONSTABU! 1600, F2 (Ecolesfiela) Criminal Investigation Departf


At 9.45am on si*torday 15 April 1989 I attended at the Worth Stand of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Clul, Hillsborough, Sheffield in company with other officers from the
Criminal Investigation Department at EcclesfiM.
A large number of both uniformed and plain clothed officers were briefed at this time
by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield F Division, with regard to the football match taking
place there that afternoon between Nottingham Forest and Liverpool!.
After a general briefing a seperate C3D briefing took place in the stand given by
Detective Superintendent McKay and my duty on this date in company with DC Tuk® F2
was to pattol in an unmarked police vehicle concentrating oa Herries Road and Halifax
Road!#
Our bfief was to be on the lookout «5oa? persons breaking into parked unattended motor
vehicles on the above roads and surrounding areas in particular after the match had
kicked off at 3pm and we were under the immediate responsibility of Detective Inspector
Scaife F2f.
In company with DC Take and Detective Inspector Scaife I left the ground and began
mobile patrol in surrounding areas of Wisewood, Herries Road, Halifax Road and Grenoside.
Even at this earlystage I was aware of large numbers of football supporters gathering in
these areas in particular outside public house;? and saw large numbers walking carrying
beer cans etc*.
At 12 noon we liased with Detective Superintendent Me Kay at Foxhill section station
with regard to specific areas to concentrate our vehicle surveillance and we then
continued patrol* Two officers on motor cycles were to act as 'spotters* during the tour
in order to locate problem areas for thefts from cars*

1,30pm in company with Detective Inspector Scaife and DC Tuke attend at SWPC in the gynasii
ium for meal* 2pm resume petrol outside the ground again concentrating on the aforementione
areas and groups of supporters were congregating in large numbers outside public houses
consuming alcohol*

At just after 3pm ’garbled*messages were heard on the radio which to be truthful had not
been excellent reception in a number of areas on our patrol throughout our tour.
Iii order to clarify the situation we attended at Foxhill section station in order
to ascertain what if anything we were required for and by this time traffic in the area
was becoming extremely congested and it was difficult to move anywhere quickly in the
area* On our arrival at the section we ascertained that there appeared to be a serious
situation developing at the ground and we decided to attend at that location*
It was virtually impossible to make any headway down Halifax Road to the ground using the
police vehicle and we decided to gtetoi abandon it off the road somewhere along Halifax
Road.
On our arrival at the ground via the main Police access on Penistone Road it was
immediately obvious that a serious situation had developed in that there were a number
of ambulances positioned at the rear of the North stand and large numbers of ambulance
personell and police officers running around here there and everywhere.1
On approaching the rests of the North stand and the entrance to the gymnasium in company
with DC Tuke and Detective Inspector Scaife I saw a number of what appeared to be
supporters, some injured some obviously dead, being carried from the side of the North
stand from the direction of the pitch and into the gynasium*
I asked some officer what was happening but got no reply and began to assist one officer
with an injured person into the gynasium.
I went into the gynasium and remember my first reaction was one of disbelief as there
must have been about 30 °r so bodies laid out in rows oil the floor. Officers were
stood by the bodies all obviously dead as they were covered in sheets, blankets, coats
etc..*
Detective Inspector Scaife then called me over and I joined him and DC Tuke with
Detective Superintendent Me Kay. We were told to go and obtain details from all
morturies in the area with regard to how many bodies they could accomodate at short
noticed.

Detective Inspector Scaife decided that this would take some time and due to the situation
at the ground and in the gynasium at that timeit would be more beneficial to go eleswhere*
We therefore teft the ground and attended back at Foxhill section station using the
previously abandoned police vehicle as by ythis time officers had made one side of
Halifax dual carriageway clear#
At Foxhill section statiomaarturies were contacted in the area and other than Sheffield
this information could not be given immediately due to staff not being present?.
Each mortuary was asked to forward the information when received to Ecclesfield Control
room and the^ were informed to pass this information onto the ground for the attention
of Mr Me Kay.
I remember by this time we had difficulty in leaving the sectionstatiori as there were
increasing numbers of supporters wanting to use the telephone to phone home. T is was
allowed for a short while but we eventually had to direct some to a public kiosk further
tig the road.
We returned to the ground with the information we had collated and were instructed
to go to Hammerton Hoacl Police station to assist with relatives and friends of the
deceased and missing persons reported as a result of the incident. It took ]£>/hO minutes
to get to the ground due to the heavy traffic in the area.

 Between approx 5pm and '10.15pm I was obtaining details from relatives and friends with
 regard to missing persons. This done in the CID office at Hajmmerton Road Police station-.
 In company with DS Smith F2 and other officers from the above location instructed to
 attend back at the gynasium at SWFC in order to assist with tie identification of
 the deceased to relatives and frineds.
 On arrival large numbers of officers present in the gynasium, those officers who had
 brought a deceased person into the gynasium from the pitch and those others who
 were taking statements from the relatives and friends with regard to identification.
 Relatives and friends were waiting outside the gym area and were brought into a
 seperate room to initially view a photograph already taken of the deceased person and i£
 an identification had been made via photo then the deceased person was brought into
 a make shift viewing area wher*a formal identification was made. A statement was then
 obtained.
 I in company with other officers attended to this until approximately 2am when I
 xtfent off duty^.

 I personally was not presaaht at the Leppings Lane end at any time and on ray amval
 at the ground shortly after 3 P I did not go onto the pitch.
 I did not see the gates open at Leppings lane and I may have handled more bodies going
 into the gym area from the back of the North stand but it was only to assist other officer
 carrying such. I must admit on my arrival into the rear of the ground I was shocked by
 the enormity of the situation and just from what I can remember running about from
 place to place until I entered the gym and saw Detective Inspector ScaifeW

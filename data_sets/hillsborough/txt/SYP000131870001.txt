TICKETLESS SUPPORTERS

You will recall on the evening of Thursday, 22 June 1989 we discussed the
above subject in the light of the "conspiracy" theory proffered by the
South Yorkshire Police.

Over this last weekend I diverted ray staff at Nechells from processing work
to reading 1,961 statements in order to obtain information about ticketless
supporters, and in particular to see whether there was a conspiracy to
force entry by any means at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. This letter
records our findings.

We have found a total of thirteen persons who describe some kind of
pre-determined intention to enter the ground without tickets (their statements
are attached). In addition we found that many other statements identify
significant numbers of supporters without tickets. I refer you back to my
letter of 12 June 1989 in which I highlighted our survey of 1,699
Liverpool supporters' questionnaires which discovered at least 136
supporters without tickets.

It is our view that many Liverpool supporters arrived in Sheffield without
tickets. It is our contention that the number could be in excess of
2,000. However, we do not believe that there was a major "conspiracy" as
such, rather a continuation of a well established practice by many
supporters to visit the ground for this particular match and purchase a
ticket. Amongst these there will be a sizeable hard-core who will attempt
to enter the ground by fair means or foul, obviously looking for any
weakness in the system or the architecture which they can exploit to their
advantage. No doubt the Liverpool supporters' experiences at the
Hillsborough Ground last year would be fed back to their "intelligence"

system and the word would quickly go around that "opportunities" were
likely to exist this year. This would more than likely lead to plans by
some to thwart the system but by how many is difficult to determine. In
sum, it is our contention that there was probably a number of small-scale
conspiracies. However, overall it is unlikely to be one large-scale
conspiracy rather opportunism which collectively could be significant.
Experiences at other grounds recently would tend to support this
viewpoint, albeit the number involved at a semi-final will be greater than
at most league matches.

overall conspiracy theory.

          SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE THEME - LIVERPOOL
SUBJECT                                                  DATE                 26 June 1989
          SUPPORTERS CONSPIRACY


          I refer to the above theme which has been actively pursued by South Yorkshire
          Police and which is the subject of a further submission by them. In addition,
          I refer to High Priority Actions 1591, 1592, 1593 and 1595.

          On your instructions further enquiries have been made and statements, where
          necessary, are attached hereto. A brief summary is as follows:-

          FERGUSON and         are work mates and MARJORAM a director of the company which
          employs them   and

                   FERGUSON was originally seen by South Yorkshire Police and a statement
                   obtained. FERGUSON had visited the White Hart Licensed House prior to
                   entering the Pheasant Licensed House. In the Pheasant he drank with
                         and was later joined by MARJORAM. FERGUSON states he and
                   spoke with two Liverpool Supporters but attaches nothing untoward in
                   anything which they said.

                         ras originally seen by West Midlands Police and has been
                   re-interviewed by Inspector DAVENPORT and DS          A short
                   confirmatory statement was obtained.

                   It was suggested that South Yorkshire Police may have taken another
                   statement but ignored its contents on the basis that it did not
                   support their theory. This is not the case, South Yorkshire Police
                   called o n b u t , on the witness indicating he had already been
                   seen, the matter rested there and no conversation about his
                   statements’ contents took place.

                   MARJORAM was first seen by South Yorkshire and the essence of his
                   statement is that he thought the comments made by the two supporters
                   in FERGUSON a n d b o m p a n y strange

                   "Dont worry about that .......... (the time being 2.45pm)
                   we know either a gate will be open or opened."

                   He does not however know anything which led him to believe that either
                   these two supporters did not have tickets or were part of any so
                   called ’conspiracy’.
      ffas dropped off by MARJORAM at the Sicey Hotel prior to MARJORAM
 meeting FERGUSON and               is not material to this theme.

 The witnesses TAYLOR ancj      ire social friends and fellow golfers.
 Prior to keeping a golfing appointment TAYLOR called into the Sicey
 Hotel for a drink and listened to Liverpool Supporters talking.

 TAYLOR was first seen by West Midlands Police when he volunteered
 himself at Hammerton Road Police Station and was seen by DS McCOMBIE
 and a statement obtained. He was seen 4 days later by South Yorkshire
 Police and a further statement obtained which does not materially
 differ from the first one.

 He has been spoken to on the telephone and can add nothing to either
 version.

        had not previously been interviewed. TAYLOR confided in
  the contents of what he later told police and a short statement is
  included from

  Copies of the relevant licensee/staff questionnaires are attached.

Today Friday 23rd June 1989 I was shown by Detective Sergeant          if

the West Midlands Police Force a copy of a statement I made to the South

Yorkshire Police on 7th June 1989.                      I have read this statement and it is

correct, I do not wish to add or amend anything in this statement.

However I would like to point out that on page 4 of my copy statement,

that the conversation with the 2 Liverpool men, the words used are what I

recall and not the actual words spoken.

At no time when I spoke to those two men did I get the impression that

these men intended to enter the ground by any other means than by lawful

entry into the ground.                These two men were mature persons and not football

hooligans.

I have signed and dated the copy statement I have read today.

             I am employed as a



             During the morning of Saturday                 15 April    1989 (150489)   I was working

             at the above development until approximately 12.30pm (1230) when I

             left and visited the White Hart public house which is situate at the

             junction of Orchard Street and the main road leading to

             St o ck s b r i d g e .   I had arranged to meet a friend called                         at

             the public house.                   is a                and he is sometimes employed by

             my company on a sub-contract basis as and when work of that nature is

             required.
I            When 1 arrived at the public house I saw the landlord,

                              standing at the entrance and he was obviously vetting
I
             people before he allowed them access to th^ premises.                                         f

I            I was aware that a semi-final football match was being played later

that day at the Hillsborough Stadium and the White Hart           public house

is positioned on the main road leading from Sheffield,           over the

Pennines,       to Manchester and the North West of the country.      This

public house is regularly frequented,         on match days,   by football

supporters.

T went outside the public house and I would estimate that about 80

persons were within the bar area, a mixture of football supporters

and local       people.

I easily ascertained that the football supporters were from Liverpool

as   I could tell by their accents.

These       people were behaving in an orderly manner and there was no

trouble.

The premises were very full and I was subsequently joined by my

friend                       We had a couple of drinks and due to the

premises being busy we decided to visit the Pheasant public house

which is situated on Station Road at Oughtibridge and is a short

distance away from the White Hart public house.          The reason we chose

that       public house is due to it being located on a quiet side road off

the main highway and we assumed that football supporters may not have

found it.
       *



                  and myself arrived at the Pheasant public house at about

1.15pm (1315) and we discovered that these premises were also being

used by Liverpool football supporters.          The premises   consist of 2

rooms,      the loung bar which is comfortably furnished and the public

bar which is used for games etc.          Outside the premises there is a

terraced/paved area where benches and seats are used by customers

wishing to remain outside.          The terraced area was busy and I quickly

ascertained that a large number of the people outside were Liverpool

football       supporters.                                                         I

We entered the premises via the front door and turned right into the

lounge bar which was very busy and contained a large number of people

which included the regular customers and Liverpool         football

supporters.        The supporters were in the main well behaved although

several were       rather noisey but nothing unpleasant.    1 believe that I

overheard the landlord                 say that several of the supporters had

booked a table at the premises for a meal and that this was a regular

occurrence whenever Liverpool were playing at Sheffield.

         and myself were enjoying a drink and we struck up a

conversation with 2 Liverpool supporters who were standing at the bar

next to us.              and myself were wearing our working clothes and it

would be obvious that we had been working on a building site as we

were    covered in cement dust and other debris.       They asked us what our

occupations were and it soon became apparent that they were also

employed in the building industry.          The men are described as follows:

1.     Male, white about 30-35 years, medium build, 5 ’7 tall,        light

       brown hair,    collar length.

2.     As above.

I cannot describe them further other than they both spoke with

Liverpool accents.

One of them stated that he was a joiner and the other being a



At about 2.00pm (1400) my employer, Peter Marjoram, arrived at the

premises and he joined us in the lounge bar.

We   continued to talk to the 2 Liverpool supporters about the building

industry and I believe the conversation related to payments of

craftsmen as it is part of any duty to work our payments for sub­

contractors.

At about 2.30pm (1430)       I asked the men if it was about time they

were    leaving as it was a considerable distance between Oughtibridge

and the football ground and I would estimate the distance at about

                    We told the men that they would have to park their car in the

                    vicinity of the Texaco F i 11ing Station,        near to Middlewood Hospital,

                    and walk to the ground from there.           One of the men said words to the

                    effect that they were confident of getting into the ground because

                    the gate would be open or opened,        I am not sure which word was used.

                     (Open or opened) The 2 men did not appear to me to be potential

                     trouble makers and they appeared to be decent people.          I didn't hear

                     them say that they had tickets for the match, nor did I see any

                     tickets.

                    The manner in which one       of them said    that the gate would be open or

                     opened did not imply to      me that they    were going to attempt to force

                     entry into the ground.
I                    The 2 men with whom we had been speaking left the public house at

                     about 2.40pm (1440) and      at that time    the public house was almost
I
                     vacated by all the Liverpool supporters leaving only the locals inside.

I                    As far as I can recall there was no trouble at the premises.

Today Friday 23rd June 1989 I was shown by Detective S e r g e a n t I of

the West Midlands Police Force a copy of my statement that I made to the

West Midlands Police on 3rd May 1989.                         I have read over this statement and

it is correct there is nothing I wish to add or amend in the statement.

In my opinion I am quite satisfied that both the men I have referred to in

my original statement did have tickets for the semi-final at Hillsborough

Football Ground on Saturday 15th April 1989. As they were both mature

person’s and not what I would consider to be football hooligans.

I have signed and dated the copy of the original statement I read over

 today.      Early in June 1989 two plain clothes police officers from South

Yorkshire Police Force visited my home.                          I informed them that I had

 already made a statement to the West Midlands Police Force.                                    As such the

 officers said that they would not need to take a statement from me and I

 did not discuss anything about the incident in the Pheasant Pub on

 Saturday 15th April 1989, with either of the officers.

           I am a married man and I live at the above address together with my

           wife               At about   1pm on Saturday,   15th of April   1989 I was in the

           Pheasant public house, Oughterbridge Lane, Sheffield,             together with a

           friend John FergusonT          We were standing together at the bar having a

           drink.     I would say that there were about fifty Liverpool supporters

           in the bar and John and I were stood talking to two in particular.                   I

           would describe these two          as follows:



           1)    A white male, about 6ft tall, medium build with dark coloured

                  hair.         He also had a moustache.      I would estimate him to be

                  about 30 years of age.        He spoke with a Liverpool accent.        I

                  cannot remember what       he said his name was but he did say that      he

                  was a                               by trade and he came from the Magull

                  area of Liverpool.        The only detail   I remember of his clothing was



                     ‘Z .'S    t -f t
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          S6S0

     that he was wearing a red jumper.



2)   A white male about 5* 6 tall with blonde hair,        he had a slight

     build and he also had a moustache.         I would say that he was about

     30 years old.    Again,   he spoke with    a Liverpool accent, I can't

     remember what his name was but remember that he said he was a

     joiner by trade.    I cannot remember any details as to his clothing

     other than he was wearing a yellow jumper.



They were pleasant lads and they told us that they had got their

tickets from their boss who had been invited to watch the game from a

box and had given them stand tickets,       that he no longer needed.

Whilst we were standing talking at the bar we were joined by Peter

MARJARAM and whilst we were all talking someone,         I c a n ’t remember who,

passed comment to the two lads at about 20 minutes to three p.m.

as they left,   that they would be late for the match,       however they

replied,   “I t ’s OK we'll be able to walk in the gate cos w e ’ve got

stand tickets".      I have no doubt that this was a totally innocent

comment and took it to mean that they would have no problem entering

the ground because they        both had stand tickets and therefore    had their

seats already allocated to them.

Whilst they were     in the Pheasant pub the two lads had about four or

five pints
     *     and a meal.     As for the other Liverpool
                                              <►      supporters they

were all drinking however there was no rowdiness and they were all

well behaved non of them appeared drunk.

I would also add that I        have no affiliation or particular liking    for

any football    club and do not follow the sport.

Today Saturday 24th June 1989 I have been shown by Detective Sergeant

           of the Vest Midlands Police Force, a copy of a statement I made to

South Yorkshire Police Force on 7th June 1989.

I do not wish to add or amend my statement.                            However I would like to point

out that in my copy statement on page 3 where I mention the two Liverpool

Supporters speaking to me this is shown in direct speech as "Don’t worry

about that we know either a gate will be open or opened."                                   This is not

correct, the two Liverpool supporters said words to that effect, and they

were not the words spoken.

I did not get the impression that these two men intended to enter the

ground without a ticket, although I did not see their tickets and they did

not mention tickets to me.                  The inference I got from the comment they

passed was that they had knowledge of the ground and they knew a quick way

into the ground.

Continuationofstatementof Peter Kevin Marjoram


These two men were not what I would call football hooligans, they were

respectable, mature men.

I have signed and dated the copy statement I was shown by Detective

Sergeant

However, I still feel that the comments made by the 2 Liverpool Supporters

which indicated that at 2.50pm they would be able to gain a quick access

into the ground despite the large crowd was a puzzling remark since I have

attended football matches at Hillsborough.

I saw and heard nothing which indicated to me that these Liverpool

supporters were part of a conspiracy to enter the ground without tickets.

                  I am the Director of my own company,
i                                                                          Sheffield.

                 At 1.30pm (1330) Saturday,        15th April,   1989 (150489)   I finished work
i                        %
                 at the above site and together with an employee

    i             drove to                          Oughtifaridge, to pick up some furniture

                  for a neighbour.        After collecting this, myself and               travel led

                 along Halifax Road towards an address at                        Longley, where

                 we were to drop the furniture off.

                 At this time we were in a Nissan Pick-up truck belonging to the

                  c orr.pa ny .

                  As we approached the junction of Doe Royd Lane,          on our left,    I saw

                  that the pelican crossing at that junction has turned to "red" as

                  tnere were people at the crossing waiting to cross.            I puiT^ed up at

                  the crossing in the nearside lane, and the two elderly fe*
pedestrians began to cross from left to right in front of us.

Halifax Road at this point,     t"Fie road is a dual    carriageway road with

two lanes on either side.      As the two pedestrians passed in front of

the van I became aware of a car approaching the crossing from behind

in the offside    lane.   1 could see the vehicle clearly in the wing

mirror and it was travelling at high speed with the driver apparently

unaware that the lights had changed to red against him.          The vehicle

was within 50 yds of the crossing when it began to brake suddenly.

There was no screaching of tyres but the vehicle dipped considerably

onto the front suspension and came to an abrupt halt at the side of

my van in the offise lane.      At one point I was extremely worried

that it would not be able to stop in time and put out my hand to try

and attract the attention of the two pedestrians shouting to them to

stop where they were.

After the vehicle had stopped they managed to cross the carriageway

and I looked down from the cab into the vehicle.           It was a dark grey

coloured family saloon either an Escort or Montego and contained 5

mates, 2 in the front and three in the rear.           They all appeared to be

dressed smartly in casual     clothing with no apparent football favours

or clothing on them.      However   I did see what appeared to be red

scarves    in the vehicle.   All the occupants except for the driver were

drinking what appeared to be Heineken lager from green Heineken

cans.     The driver was slightly obscurred from my view by the roof of

the vehicle.

As soon as I looked down the front seat passenger seemed to take

offence and began shouting numerous swear words at me.           I could not

hear what he was saying due to the window being closed but it was

easy to lip read words such as "Fuck off".        I began to wind my window

down to say something to him but the lights changed to green and the

vehicle set off at speed pulling away from us quite quickly.           I >»as
                                                                         PAGE
                                                                         S48

very annoyed with the occupants of the vehicle and it was obvious to

me that they had been drinking heavily and displayed an aggressive

attitude towards myself and

I continued our journey,     dropping              at the Sicey Hotel Public

House, Sicey Avenue, Shiregreen.        I then returned to Oughtibridge

where I then called into the Pheasant Public House on Jaw Bone Hill.

On my arrival    there I saw numerous people both inside and outside of

the pub.    These people were clearly not regulars at the pub and due

to their accents I took it that they were Liverpool supporters on

route to the Semi Final at Hillsborough.           It was S.35pm (1435) when I

arrived at the Pheasant public house and I would estimate that there

were 25 Liverpool supporters       present.

I entered the bar of the pub and saw two colleagues drinking at the

bar, John Ferguson and                        1 joined them and John bought me

a pint.    I then became aware of two men behind me who were drinking

shorts.    From their accents     it was obvious they were Liverpudlians

and I began to talk and joke with them.          The time was now S.45pm

(1445) and I said to them something to the effect that they were

leaving late to get to the ground for the 3pm (1500) kick off.

One of the two men then said to me " Do n ’t worry about that, we know

either a gate will    be open or opened".       At this, both men laughed to

each other.     This statement struck me as being very strange:         I was

puzzled as to how they could be so sure that they would find a gate

or gates open at such a late time.        Neither men made any mention of a

ticket or showed me a ticket.       I have attended numerous football

matches at Hillsborough and other grounds and the statement from the

man made me wonder how he could be so sure that they would find a

gate open at that    late time.    After my initial thoughts on the matter

I dismissed it from my mind and continued drinking with my

colleagues.     The two men then left the pub at S.45pm ( 1fr^i-5^) .   As they

i           that John and               had also been sneaking to the two men prior to my

            ar r iv a l .
I           Following the news reports of the disaster and circumstances of it,

I           the statement made by the Liverpudlians                             in the Pheasant Public House

            the day before came to mind again.                             It again strurk me as being a

I           very strange statement from a supporter attending a match at such a

            late time.          It became apparent from the news that a gate at the
I           ground had been opened to allow late comers into the ground and I

I           conjectured that the statement made by the man and the opening of the

            gate was connected.          It was for this reason I contacted the Police

I           and reported what this man had said to me prior to attending the match.

At 12.45am the same date I left work with Peter MARJORAM in a Nissan

Cabstar pick-up motor vehicle, we went into Sheffield, and together with

 Peter I moved some furniture.                   After we had done this Peter dropped me off

 at the Sicey Hotel, Sheffield at about 1.30pm, Peter did not come in the

 Sicey Hotel for a drink he just gave me a lift there.

 In the Sicey Hotel there were a number of Liverpool Supporters but I did

 not speak to them or hear what they were saying other than one who said he

 had taken the wrong turn off the motorway.

 The Liverpool supporters left the Sicey Hotel at about 2.30pm.                                      I left

 there at about 3pm.              I did not go to the semi-final at Hillsborough.                                I

 went up with some friends and went to a snooker hall for a game of

I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife. I am born

and bred in Sheffield but had moved about the country with my employment.

I have been a keen football supporter for many years and used to be a

season ticket holder at Hillsborough along with my wife.                                   I ceased going

to live football matches because of the increased use of foul language and

violence.

On Saturday the 15th of April 1989 it was my intention to meet a friend of

mine                       I don't know his address, for a game of golf at Concord

Municipal Golf Course in Sheffield.                       Our intention was to meet at the

course at 1pm.

Having knowledge that the F A Cup semi-final was being played at

Hillsborough I decided to leave my house early to avoid any traffic

congestion and delays.

Continuation of statement of   G a r ry T a y lo r




I left my home at about 11.45am and drove in my car towards the golf

course.       I was surprised how little traffic there was.                           I saw one or two

supporters about but certainly no crowds at this time.

As I was early I decided to go for a quick drink before meeting

             I stopped at the Sicey, at the top of Sicey Ave, Firth Park.                                      I

parked my car on the car park.                       There were one or two cars parked but

nothing out of the ordinary.

I went into the pub and ordered half a pint of lager.                                The pub is

basically one big room and I chose a seat not far from where three men

were sitting.             There were perhaps 15 people in the pub at this time.

From where I sat I could inadvertently overhear the conversation that the

3 men were having.               It became apparent to me that 2 of the men were

Liverpudlians and 1 had a Midlands accent, more Nottingham than

Birmingham.          I listened to their conversation for about 7 or 8 minutes and

during this time I heard them discuss how they were going to get into the

ground without tickets.                  They appeared to know Sheffield well as they said

that the place to cause trouble would be outside Leppings Lane because of

its confined entrance.                 They said something along the lines of "We*11 meet

the boys in Leppings Lane, if enough start pushing then the police will

open the gates.*               They mentioned that they had managed to do this before.

 I also heard them say we’ll create havoc.                           I also heard mention of them

wanting to get behind the goal.                       They each had a full pint in front of

 them, although I am unable to say what they drank before I got there.

At some stage I got the impression that they realised that I was

 listening. I felt rather uncomfortable so drank up and left.

I then went and played golf.

I finished playing golf at about 4.30pm and then heard on the car radio

the news of the tragedy at Hillsborough.                       I mentioned to                           my

earlier encounter in the pub and he said that really I should go to the

police.

I thought everything over and thought that my evidence seemed

insignificant until I heard about the trauma that Superintendent MARSHALL

had suffered as a result of the gates being opened.

It is my opinion that the creating of the crush outside the turnstiles and

the subsequent opening of the gates was orchestrated by the Liverpool

supporters or I should say the minority.

The 3 men in the pub were all white.                     The 2 Liverpudlians were in their

early 20’s and the other man was aged about 35.                             I would not recognise

them again.        G Taylor

|           off the side roads to protect residents*         parking, and I saw,     I think,

            about 50 policemen in that area.

I           Having time in hand before meeting my friends,            I stopped at the

            "Sicey" on Sicey Avenue to pass time until          I met them.     I went into
I           the pub and ordered a half pint of lager, and sat down in the bar

|           loung.

            1 sat just to the right of the main entrance.             There were

I           approximately fifteen people in the pub.          The    room has   'bays* around

            its circumference and I sat at the end of one            of the ’bays* nearest
I           the entrance, with my back to the next 'bay*.             Sitting behind me were


I           three men, who were already there when I arrived.

            After a few minutes       I became aware of their conversation.         1 cannot

I           now remember the exact words,       but I gathered first of all that they

            were football supporters,       intending to go to the semi-final at
I           HI 11sbo rough.

I           As    I went to sit down I had noticed that these three men were as

            follows:-

a            1.     Mid thirties,   black or dark brown hair,       cut slightly longer than

            normal, with a dark moustache.        He was wearing black leather hip
i            length coat, dark trousers.

            2.      Mid twenties,   light sandy hair,    cut very short,    but not a crew
i
             cut,    clean shaven, wearing red sweater,      crew neck and a pink shirt

i            collar worn outside,      light grey trousers.

             3.     Mid twenties,   hair light brown and cut ear length, wearing a
i            tweed sports jacket.       I cannot describe this man as well as the

             others as he sat farthest away from me.
i
             At I listened to this conversation,         I hea»;d this older man (no.     1)

■            talking to the others, saying that they should not worry about not
                                                                         PAGE     -3
                                                                         S45

having tickets.   They would meet up with "the others" outside

Leppings Lane entrance.   They would organise as many people as

possible to cause whatever trouble they could.           If enough trouble was

caused the gates would have to be opened.          I gathered that this had

happened before, and this man seemed confident that this action could

be forced.

The sandy haired man   (no. 2) asked how the "others" would know to

meet up at the right time.      (No.    1) The other man said if they got

there for about 2.15pm (1415) he knew most of the other lads and they

could quickly be got organised.          He said " We’ve got to get as close

to the turnstiles as possible."          He said when the gate was opened,

they would force their way through to "the back of the goal".

At this point one of the three men noticed I was listening, and they

glared at me   in an unfriendly way.         I hurriedly drank the remainder

of my drink and left the pub.          The time would then   be about 12.20pm

(1 2 20 ).

I was in the   pub for about ten to fifteen minutes.          I was able to see

these men as   I walked from the bar to my seat, and         as I stood up to

leave.

I knpw that these men were Liverpool         supporters because nos. 2 and 3

had Liverpool accents.    No.    1 had an East Midlands/Nottinghamshire

accident.    They spoke of the Leppings Lane end arrangements as though

they were well aware that this was their team's end of the ground.

I did not place too much importance on the conversation I had heard,

and went to play golf.    On my way home in the car I heard on the

radio that there had been an incident at the semi-final, and

thereafter the r.onver sat ion became more significant to me.         The

course of the public hearings of the enquiry currently being

conducted by Justice Taylor,      prompted me to tell this to the Police. *

1 must say that I gained the impression that the Police were being
                                                                             PAGE

            unfairly blamed for this courre of events.

           On the day after the Hillsborough tragedy,    I discussed with a golfing

            friend,              what 1 had heard in the pub on the previous day.

           He suggested I tell the Police about it, but I did not do so

            immediately.

                                                                  G. TAYLOR SIGNED

I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife and

daughter.         I cun employed as a driver/salesman at a                                           in

about 10 years.

We are regular golfing partners and have the occasional drink together.

On Saturday the 15th of April 1989 I worked from 3.30am until 11.30am.                                                I

had arranged to meet Gary TAYLOR at the Concord Municipal Golf Centre.                                                I

think we had agreed to meet for about 1pm.                           I got there at about 12.30pm

to 12.45pm.          Garry was not there when I arrived but turned up a few

minutes later.            I recall him saying that he was a bit early and that he

had called into the Sicey Public House.

I remember commenting that if I had known then I would have joined him.

We played a round of golf finishing at about 4.30pm.

Continuation of statement of



I was aware of the fact that the FA Cup Semi Final was being played at

Hillsborough and knew that there was a strong likelihood of traffic delays

and congestion.                I drove the back route back to my house to avoid delay

and Garry TAYLOR followed me in his car.

It was only when I listened to the car radio that I became aware of the

disaster at the Hillsborough football ground.

It was a couple of days later that Garry mentioned to me about what he had

heard being discussed in the Sicey pub.                     He said that he had overheard a

conversation between some Liverpool fans saying that they didn't have any

tickets, that they were meeting up with other fans and they knew how to

get into the ground without a ticket.

At the time Garry told me this it was at the time that the press were

blaming the police for what had gone on.

Over the next couple of weeks I could tell that this was playing on

Garry’s mind.            He wanted to tell his story to the Judicial Inquiry but I

could understand his reluctance to do so

I am the licensee of the above public house and have been running it since

1983 with my wife.

On Saturday 15th April 1989, the day of the semi-final, I opened the pub

as normal at 11am.              I went outside to see to the tables when I came back

my barmaids were already serving two fans of a group of about 12.                                          I found

out they were part of a mini bus group and they were young lads and I

didn't like the appearance of them, so I told them they'd have to leave

and tried to explain why one immediately began swearing at me and I said

to the group, "if you'd have left him you might have been served.”                                           I

stood my ground and eventually they left.                          From then on I stood on the

door monitoring the numbers going in the pub and also refusing entry to

some.      I only really let middle aged groups in.                          I let one mini bus with

about 12 young lads on in but the arranger was

There are 38 references in this category to entering the ground by forcing

gate or gates opened.



ACC Mervyn Jones in his report believed that there was no major
'conspiracy' as such, more so a sizeable hard core who will attempt to
enter the ground by fair means or foul, obviously looking for any weakness
in the system or the architecture which they could exploit to their

advantage.

former was used for both Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest supporters and the latter for Liverpool

supporters only.    One special train and 3 service

trains from Liverpool conveyed a total of 825

supporters (430 to Wadsley Bridge), with service

trains from other areas bringing this to a total

of 1,337.



A total of 1,932 Nottingham Forest fans travelled

by a combination of special and service trains to

attend the match.



Train arrivals in Sheffield City Centre and at

either station are dealt with within this report

as is the behaviour of supporters.    British

Transport Police conclude that on the ’dry*

trains on which they travelled, the supporters

behaviour was happy and good natured.    Very few

supporters showed signs of intoxication.



LOCAL SHOPS AMD BUSINESSES



Inevitably the large number of supporters

converging on Hillsborough for the cup semi final

must have had an influence on the local populace

                         were not in fact opened until 1130 hours even

                         though the letter from South Yorkshire Police and

                         the Liverpool Football Club programme indicated

                         they would be opened at 1100 hours, may have some

                         bearing on the effects that were noted in local

                     supporters using the premises from about 1345

                     hours, many in possession of cans of beer,

                     obviously under the influence of drink (though

                     not drunk) and concludes they were rowdy and

                     swearing, but not violent.



                     Other statements in the file follow the same

                     general picture of drinking, boisterous and rowdy

                     behaviour including urinating in public and

                     private places.



                     LICENCED PREMISES



                     As part of the Police arrangements for the semi

                     final many of the public houses within a mile

                     radius of the stadium were closed for the sale of

                     alcohol.     Those premises that did open generally

                     instigated some sort of control on the door but

                     obviously the further away from the ground the

                     supporters were the easier it was for them to




                                                                           93

                              Clearly this sort of control was more difficult

                              for supermarkets and off licences and most of

                              them did open and indeed they sold a considerable

                              amount of drink, both alcoholic and otherwise.

                              That said, it is not possible to show the

I                             quantities of alcohol consumed by any one

                              individual, or any particular group of

                              individuals and all this report can highlight is

                              the amount probably taken by Liverpool supporters

                              overall.

                              when some 250 people were present.    Shortly after

                              this the numbers decreased probably due to the

                     that this continued up until 1500 hours.          As a

                     result the daily takings were up £500 on normal.

                     She reported an incident of theft appertaining to

A number of other statements and questionnaires

from this type of licensed premises are included,

the above witnesses being only a representative

sample.    The theme of their evidence is that

whilst considerable increases in the sale of

alcohol were reported on the day, supporters’

behaviour in licensed premises was generally

good, although there were some isolated incidents

of bad behaviour and these are described.



LOCAL RESIDENTS



People living near to any football stadium are

well accustomed to the disruption that occurs in

their neighbourhood when there is a match taking

place.     In those areas where major stadiums are

located they are usually aware of the difference

between an ordinary match and a Cup Semi-Final

where the number of supporters is greater.

Taking this a stage further, by reason of this

experience they are able to identify those teams

whose supporters are likely to cause greater

trouble.    As a result some teams’ supporters earn

a reputation.    From this point of view local

residents are in a somewhat unique position in

being able to compare and balance behaviour by

different supporters, not only from week to week

at ordinary matches, but from year to year with

                            the more important games.



                            The following section of this report seeks to put

                            the local residents’ views of the Liverpool

                            supporters’ behaviour during the morning and

                            early afternoon of the 15 April 1989,

                            particularly prior to kick off.     In some cases,

                            comparison is made with the semi final in 1988.

                            the stadium.   She describes the parking of

                            vehicles from 1015 hours until 1100 hours when

                            her road was full and her surprise at the amount

                            of alcohol being carried by the occupants of

                            these vehicles.   She observes excess drinking

                            whilst making a journey across town.

                     1350 hours when she left her home to catch a bus

                     and the subsequent bus journey.    She mentions the

                     drinking in the streets by fans and their

                     presence in the public houses.    Her main point is

                     that because of the distance they still had to

                     travel to the ground they would inevitably be

                     late in arriving for the start of the match.



St.Pages 1359-1364   Emma Louise LEE (15 years), is a student and has

                     lived with her parents at



                           for about three years.     She describes the

                     behaviour of Liverpool fans both in the street

                     drinking and at the turnstiles pushing and

                     shoving.   She comments that she has never

                     previously seen such behaviour by fans.



                     The consensus of the evidence from local

                     residents seems to be that the Liverpool

                     supporters were generally badly behaved and that

                     alcohol influenced this behaviour.    Those

                     residents able to compare the 1988 Semi-Final

                     with the 1989 conclude that the fans behaviour

                     was much worse and that many fans arrived late.

                      persons living in the vicinity of the Sheffield

                      Wednesday Football Club Stadium which describe

                      the supporters behaviour and the situation on the

                      Late arrival at the ground by supporters has

                      already been mentioned by local residents.                  The

                      two main reasons put forward for late arrival of

                      fans are traffic delays locally or en-route, and

                      fans remaining outside the ground, either in

                      licensed premises or elsewhere, until the last

                      minute and then all later converging on the

                      ground.



                      The fact that there were some traffic delays has

                      already been discussed.

                        by the Police searching the mini bus for

                      It is not possible to quantify the number of

                      ticketless fans that were in Leppings Lane or to

                      effectively evaluate their overall effect on

                      congestion and crushing at the turnstiles.

                      Evidence from supporters is provided that

                      suggests many travelled without tickets in the

                      hope of purchasing them in the ground.    In

                      addition when the statements of police officers

                      are assessed in a later part of this file there

                      is considerable evidence of supporters without

                      tickets.    It has not been possible to quantify

                      the number evidentially but an estimate of 2,000

                      would not be unrealistic.

                      the West Stand terraces) and subtract that from

                      the 24,256 tickets sold it leaves a total of

                      3,264 in Leppings Lane still waiting to enter the

                      ground.    Add a possible 2,000 non ticket holders

                      to this figure and there is a potential crowd of

                      5,246 which coincidently is the estimate given by

                      some of the police and supporters present.

                      ticket tout.    He later swapped them with another

                      ticket tout for tickets for the Leppings Lane end

                      paying an extra £15 in the transaction.

                      Supporter.     He also purchased two tickets from a

                      ticket tout for the Spion Kop at a total cost of

                      £20.     However, he tendered them at the Leppings

                      Lane end and was admitted.

                      Liverpool Supporter.           He relates how he had no

                      ticket and no intention of purchasing one, but

                      waited and entered by the ’double click method’.

                      This entails following immediately behind a

                      ticket holder and going through with him on the

                      same turn of the turnstile.

                      Supporter.     He attempted to purchase a ticket

                      from a ticket tout but they required too much

                      money.     He entered with others, through a

                      turnstile, by paying the operator £30.            He claims

                      he saw numerous other people throwing money at

                      the operator as they went over the turnstile.




                                                                                    1 02

                        the amount required by ticket touts in Leppings

                        Lane and he entered the ground with other people

                        through Gate ’C ’ on its opening.



                        There are a large number of statements referring

                        to ’ticket touts’ and fans seeking what they

                        refer to as ’spares.’     ’Spares’ means any

                        available and unused tickets for the match.

                        Statements included are intended only to be a

                        representative sample.



                        SOUTH YORJgSHTBK POT,ICE - CONSPIRACY THEORY



                        As the title suggests, this concerns a theory put

                        forward by the South Yorkshire Police, based on

                        conversations overheard at different public

                        houses indicating that Liverpool supporters

                        without tickets would en-masse descend on the

                        turnstiles in Leppings Lane and create such

                        pressure that the police would be forced to allow

                        them access.



St.   Pages 1664-1670   Garrv TAYLOR is retired.     He explains that he was

                        in the Sicey Public House in the lunch period

                        prior to the match.    He overheard three

                        Liverpudlian males discussing the fact that they




                                                                               103

                       outside Leppings Lane and enter once a gate had

                       been opened.



St. Pages 1671-1673.   Julie Dawn SHELLEY is an office worker     She tells

                       how she overheard a group of Liverpool supporters

                       talking whilst she was at her            >ublic

                       They implied that although they did not have

                       tickets they would still be able to get in to the

                       match as they had on previous occasions.



                       One other witness statement is included.     This

                       represents the total evidence presented.




                       The gates referred to are tho^eacross the mouth

                       of the entrance to the tpfnstiles off Leppings

                       Lane.   These were c^sed at about 144S hours by a

                       combination of/foot beat and mounted officers.

                       The purpoMrof the police closing off the

                       entrance gates to the turnstiles was to try and

                                                                              104
                      COMMENT



                      By far the greatest number of statements taken

                      during this investigation fall into what we call

                      the supporter category.   This section of the

                      report has recorded the supporters view of

                      events.   The views of non supporters have also

                      been dealt with in this section.



                      Because of the large number of statements it is

                      not considered practicable or desirable to

                      include them all in this file.     Indeed, many of

                      these statements relate to the situation in pens

                      3 and 4 and were primarily obtained for the

                      purposes of the coronal inquiry.     They refer to

                      identification of the deceased and identify the

                      crushing, death and injuries.



                      In respect of the consumption of alcohol, which

                      is a theme throughout, the evidence of the

Doc.No(s) 191         analysis carried out by Dr Alexander Robert
Doc.Page(s) 991-997
St.Pages 2433-2456    Walker FORREST. Consultant Chemical Pathologist

                      at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, on

                      blood samples obtained from 94 of the deceased at

                      postmortem is relevant.   This revealed that of

                      the males 51 had no more than 10 milligrams per

                      cent in their blood, which is negligible.

                      Fifteen had over 80 milligrams per cent and six




                                                                           117

were over 120 milligrams per cent.     (NB A

specimen of blood was not taken from a male who

received hospital treatment but who subsequently

died).   No traces of alcohol was found in any of

the females who died.     A total of 21 persons

(22.3Z) who died had consumed above the legal

limit to drive a motor vehicle.



CONCLUSION



The day of the match was a warm sunny day, with a

temperature of 12 degrees Celsius (53.6

fahrenheit). Many of the supporters attending

the match enjoyed a traditional pre-match

alcoholic drink either at, or en-route to

Sheffield.   In some cases the alcohol caused

supporters to behave in a rowdy, boisterous or

disorderly manner around the ground.     The

evidence confirms this.     However, it can be

argued that this is common behaviour for football

supporters attending a match of this importance

in the football calendar.

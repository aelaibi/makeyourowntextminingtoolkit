Dear Mr Owston

HILLSBOROUGH: Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

I am aware of the latest summonses taken out by the Hillsborough Family Support Group at
Leeds Magistrates’ Court returnable for 20 August 1998.

Enclosed is a copy of our latest letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group and which
explains the policy that will be applied in this case. While we would wish to complete the
CPS review as soon as possible we do need to be assured that we have all the relevant
evidence before us when coming to our decision.

I would be grateful if you could let me have voluntary disclosure of any material in your
possession that you consider may be relevant to our review. I do hold or have access to all
the evidence that was available to the Taylor Inquiry, the Inquests and to the Judicial Review
hearing. I may not have all the material that was submitted to the Scrutiny. Please contact
me if you have any queries on this point.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Manning

HILLSBOROUGH: Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

Thank you for your letter of 23 July 1998 asking for details of the CPS policy in private
prosecutions.

Enclosed is a copy of our latest letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group and which
explains the policy that will be applied in this case. While we would wish to complete the
CPS review as soon as possible we do need to be assured that we have all the relevant
evidence before us when coming to our decision.

I would be grateful if you could let me have voluntary disclosure of any material in your
possession that you consider may be relevant to our review. I do hold or have access to all
the evidence that was available to the Taylor Inquiry, the Inquests and to the Judicial Review

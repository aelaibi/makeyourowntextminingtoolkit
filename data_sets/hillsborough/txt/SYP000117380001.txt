Dated                  280489                                                                       Signed


           On Saturday,         15th April,    1989,     I came on duty at          ’B l * at 9.00 a.m.

           From that location I travelled to Hillsborough Football Ground to

           Police the F .A. Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool and Notts Forest.                             I

           was on serial         14 which was supervised by Police Sergeant Crawford.

           Upon arrival at Hillsborough we were seated in the North Stand whilst

           the briefing was given by the senior officer at 9.45 a.m.                           Following

           the briefing we were given a packed meal.

           At about 11.00 a.m.           our serial      joined with a ’B2'          serial and attended

           in the West Stand where we had a second briefing from an Inspector

           White who was in command of both serials.                       My serial was deputed to

           the Leppings Lane turnstiles to supervise the entry of supporters and

           to conduct searches.            We were covering turnstiles A-G of the area

           marked     'C' on the plan.         We were deputed          in pairs,     each pair to cover

           one t u r n s t i l e .   I was paired up with WPC 3347 T h o m a s .          We took up a

           position at approximately 11.15 a.m.                   and at that point I believe that

           two of the turnstiles were open.                  Spectators began to arrive           in dribs

           and drabs and were on the whole good humoured.                          There were officers

           outside the turnstiles and they were also searching people before

           they entered and we were instructed by the Inspector                         to duplicate the

search.     Altho ug h these early fans were being searched they were very

amicable.     However,   from approximately 2 p.m. onwards it became

apparent that there was a build-up of large numbers of late arrivals

and these people were causing public order problems on the other side
                                                                                     i

of the turnstiles.       Many of these late arrivals were the worse for

drink,    their attitude was aggressive and their behaviour was on the

whole appalling.     I saw several cases of people attempting to enter

the ground without tickets.       People were attempting to bribe the gate           j

man and I saw one ma n attempt to enter at no less than three

different turnstiles by pushing a ten pound note to the gate man.                    ;

Others were climbing over the turnstile.           I chased one youth who did

this but lost him in the West Stand to the cheers of other f a n s .            I
                                                                                     !

witnessed several cases of fans entering the ground and then passing

their ticket back into the crowd for someone else to use.             Many           ;

others were just waiting until they got to the turnstiles without a

ticket leaving the gate man no alternative but to let them through
                                                                                     i
because of the pressure of the crowd b e h i n d .     I myself ejected at

least four people who had entered the ground without tickets and saw

other officers eject many more.        We were passing them out through the

large metal sliding gates to our l e f t .      There were officers standing

immediately on the other side of these gates outside the g r o u n d ,

including an Inspector and there was an officer on the inside,

together with a steward.

At about 2.15 p.m.       the officers who had been standing outside the              |
                                                                                     I
                                                                                     j
turnstiles searching were forced to leave their position due to the                  i

pressure of the c r o w d .   From approximately 2.30 p.m.      it was obvious       j
to me that there was a serious problem outside.             I could see people

being crushed against the turnstiles and many were entering in a very

distressed state,    having difficulty in breathing etc.          Large numbers
                                                                                     I
were climbing over the roof of the t u r n s t i l e s .   We were encouraging       s
                                                                        PAGE
                                                                        R99

them to come down and if they had tickets they were allowed into the

ground.    These latecomers who were entering the ground from 2.45 p.m.

onwards were very agitated and groups of them were making threats

towards myself and other officers pleading with us to do something

about the situation outside.        One of these people lashed out at me

with his feet kicking me on the shin and was then protected by

others.    Entry to the ground was now becoming a ’free for a l l ’ and we

were losing a degree of c o n t r o l .   As I had not been issued with a

personal radio I had no knowledge from any Police source what was

happening outside.      The noise had become tremendous and upon entering

the ground many of these supporters were loitering in the entrance

area.     At that point I anticipated there would be an en mass attack

on Police Officers.      After several minutes of this I became aware of

a surge of people entering from my left and I saw that the sliding

gates had been opened.       This gate was forced closed and I assumed

that the gate had been forced open by fans probably after         it had been

opened to eject someone.       By this time a large percentage of the

people in the enclosure were the worse for drink.          The gates opened a

second time,    again X was not aware why or by whom,      but it was futile

to attempt to close them again and I could not even manage to get

over to the gate because of the pressure of people surging in the

opposite direction.      The job of searching and checking if people had

tickets was then made impossible and again there was no appraisal of

the situation or instruction from any supervisory officer and

Inspector White was out of my view.          I then made my way over to the

programme seller nearest to the section marked         ’B ’ on the plan in

order to check on their safety and to supervise a large group which

had gathered around them.       In my opinion we had lost control of the

area completely and did not have sufficient officers at that stage to

Police it.     The earlier good humour of the crowd had long since

onto the pitch at the first entrance,           climbing over a low wall.        Once        j

on the pitch I could see several people sitting on the turf in a                         ]

approached gate four I could see that it was open and that people                        ;

were clawing to get out.        I could see persons forced against the                   j


fencing and some being pulled over to top by officers and I then

began to realise what was happening.            I then assisted with getting

people out onto the pitch as quickly as possible.            The people who were

standing and able to walk were sorted out first.            I then saw that

there were a number of people lying on the ground beneath the gate

who were being trampled.        I had to physically pull a large male

supporter back into the stand as he was treading on the head of one

of the persons on the g r o u n d .         This man was the worse for drink and

was extremely a b u s i v e .    I then lifted a s m a l 1 male from the ground

and carried him onto the p i t c h .          I would describe him as follows;

m a l e , w h i t e , 5 ’5" , slim build,   25-30 y e a r s , with dark hair and                  |

prominent front t e e t h , he was unshaven and wearing a 't ’ shirt and

jeans.    I then proceeded to clear the m a n ’s airway and gave him mouth

to mouth resuscitation.           Another person assisted me by giving chest

compression.        We continued this for several minutes until a doctor

arrived and upon checking his p u l s e , declared life extinct and covered

the m a n ’s f a c e .   I then left the body with a female officer and made

my way back to the gate where I assisted with the removal of several                              i

more p e r s o n s , ma ny of them obviously dead.         Every person I saw that

was removed from the stand was given first aid u n t i 1, as the case may

b e , death was declared by a d o c t o r .        I assisted with first aid                      ;

was wearing jeans and a light coloured               ’t ' s h i r t . Immediately on his      S

pitch.     The ambulance already contained several people and was                             i

beginning to drive away before he was placed inside.                   I also assisted

by carrying one dead body on hoardings tothe gymnasium.                   There were

other officers with m e .         The body was heavy and as we reached outside                i

the gym the hoarding began to snap.               We therefore left 1t outside and

one of the other officers remained with it.                 I then returned to the            ;

West S t a n d .   While trying to p u l 1 people from the stand other fans

were being abusive towards us and missiles were thrown at us.                      One of     i

the missiles missed us by inches and I saw that it was a large metal

running down the steps at         'ON' making a Nazi style salute and

Shouting,     "THATCHER,   T H A T C H E R , PRAISE THATCHER YOU B A S T A R D S ." This

was typical of much of the behaviour towards us while these terrible

events were taking place.          While some fans were removing hoardings

and piling them up on the pitch to use as stretchers,                  others were

climbing on to them singing and jeering and p u l 1 ing them to p i e c e s .

One of the bodies on the pitch was a young girl whose clothing had

become dishevelled and some fans were shouting out obscene comments

towards the body.

At one point some of the fans ran across the pitch towards                     the North

Stand end shouting and chanting.            While I was giving mouth to mouth to

one of the bodies a press man shoved a camera in my face and when I

objected he retorted,       " I T ’S FUCKING N E W S . ”   During this period I'm

afraid I lost all track of t i m e .        Once the ground had emptied and

there was nothing further we could do on the pitch, we returned to the

North Stand for a de-briefing,          h o w e v e r , the tannoy system was

in op er at iv e.   I later joined the remainder of my serial outside the

gymnasium.

During the early part of the searching at Leppings Lane I had

confiscated two small penknives from the f a n s .             I had attached a

label to the items with their respective names and address and my

number on.      I had also written my number on their h a n d l e .           At about         I

7.15 p.m.    I handed this property in at the g y m n a s i u m .        I went off duty I

at the ground at approximately 8.00 p.m.

I have been on duty on countless f o o tb al1 matches and have worked

this same Semi-Final       on three previous o c c a s i o n s .   Alth oug h I have

not carried out the turnstile duty on these occasions.                    Compared to

last year I not iced a marked difference             in the attitude of the

Liverpool fans for the worse on this o c c a s i o n . Upon leaving the

ground I returned to the turnstiles at Leppings L a n e .                I noticed that
                                                                               PAGE

             the corrugated iron wall at    'B' on the outside of the turnstiles was

             badly dented and damaged as an obvious result of the pressure caused

             by the Liverpool   fans trying to force their way into the ground.      I

             then took no further part   in e v e n t s .

2780 Director General's Quarterly Review

      Home Division

      The Director General referred to the Branch Directors and
      A d m i n i s t r a t o r s C o n f e r e n c e s , b oth of w h i c h had b e e n
      s u c c e s s f u l and w e l l - a t t e n d e d .      S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e and
      Merseyside Branches had responded extremely well to the
      major emergency at Hillsborough, but it was disappointing
      that only about half the Society's Branches were represented
      at a seminar for Branch Emergency Planning Officers.                                 The
      Government's study of civil emergencies had resulted in the
      appointment of a Civil Emergencies Adviser and the widening
      of the Civil Defence College's remit to cover peace-time
      emergencies.             The fact that the main response to disasters
      would continue to be at local level made it important for
      B r a n c h e s to d e v e l o p t h e i r links with their emergency
      services.           A number of new Branch Director appointments had
      been made recently at more realistic salary levels and three
      Branches were acquiring new or refurbished headquarters.
      Centre Organiser training was progressing well in several
      regions.

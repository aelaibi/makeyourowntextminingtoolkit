             whilst          stood          at     this       location,             I saw       other          Police          officers             standing

             nearby          get       urinated           on       by    football          supporters                   standing             at    the       edge     of

             After       approximately                    3-5       minutes          I was          instructed                onto       the       pitch

             together             with        a    large       number          of    other          officers.                 We    made          our    way       onto

             the    pitch          from           the    entrance          between             the    KOP          and    North          Stand          and    my

             attention             was        immediately                drawn       to    a    la\ge          number          of       people          on    the

             Once       infront             of     the    North          Stand       I was          subjected             to       a melee          of

       I am writing with regard to the attached correspondence from Joe Benton. Given the
protracted history o f the case, it might be helpful to let you have a potted version.

        Officials here concluded that there was nothing for us in Mr Benton’s letter o f 30 July,
and w e faxed the papers to the Department o f National Heritage asking i f they would accept a
transfer. They declined and advised that, as DNH did not exist when the matter was under
consideration, the Home Office should answer. We faxed the papers that day to your
ministerial correspondence unit who refused to accept the correspondence on 9 August, saying
it was for DNH.

       We went back to DNH, who were unmoved, and thought that the Home Office still
held the relevant papers. One o f our correspondence clerks, David Ruyoka, then contacted
your correspondence unit and asked them to reconsider the matter.          I believe the
correspondence was then referred to your Disasters and Inquest Inquiry Group and then to
your Operational Policing Policy Unit for consideration.

        Mr Benton wrote to the Lord Chancellor on 20 September seeking an update. I replied
on 25 September explaining the position, and after several calls to your Operational Policing
Policy Unit, David was informed that Mr Benton had written directly to your Ministerial
Correspondence Unit on 21 October, requesting the same information. I understand that it
was at that stage that your officials decided to liaise directly with DNH to resolve the matter.

       On 31 October, your correspondence unit told David that DNH believed w e were best
placed to answer, as w e had general policy responsibility for steering groups. We have no
                              FROM THE PRIVATE SECRETARY

such responsibility (Cabinet Officc do, but they do not hold the sort o f information requested
here). DNH therefore concluded that your department should respond, and your Operational
Policing Policy Unit agreed to investigate the matter further. O n 5 N ovem ber OPPU
contacted David reiterating the claim that the issue was for DNH.

         M r Benton has now requested (in his letter o f j 1 November) a meeting with the Lord
Chancellor, but, as LCD had no involvement in the Hillsborough Steering Group, I fear their
is little more w e can do, and a meeting with the Lord Chancellor or the Parliamentary
Secretary would be inappropriate. I am sorry to have to trouble you w ith this, but the
Parliamentary Secretary is now concerned about the length o f time it is taking to resolve the
disagreement, and as we have done as m uch as we can here without any success, I w onder if I
can pass this over to you to take forward? I f that is acceptable, 1 will let M r Benton know.

                      M r and M rs Church,

       I write with reference to your letters o f 30 July and 20 September 1996. I have also
spoken to your secretary about this matter.

        A s I mentioned to your secretary, we have had considerable problems in discovering
where responsibility lies for taking forward the matters raised in your letters. I can confirm
that the Lord Chancellor’s Department has no responsibility for matters relating to the
security o f football stadia, and w as not to my knowledge represented on the Hillsborough
Disaster Steering Group. Our difficulty in locating those responsible for the matter has been
exacerbated by the transfer o f responsibility for the issue from the Home Office to the
Department o f National Heritage in 1992. We are in touch with colleagues in each
department, however, and are attempting to track down the information for you.

        I am very sorry not to be able to be more helpful at this stage, and that it is taking such
a long time to provide the information. I am copying this letter to the correspondence sections
at the Hom e Office and the Department o f National Heritage.

My     above      constituents     and   X have w r i t t e n to you
previously         regarding     the p r o v i s i o n of i n f o r m a t i o n
fo l l o w i n g their s o n ’s tragic d e a t h at Hills b o r o u g h .

Si n c e      our last cor r e s p o n d e n c e   thin g s                                                                                                             have c h a n g e d
r a d i c a l l y in that my c o n s t i t u e n t s have                                                                                                              s e c u r e d Legal
Aid.

Essential             to our case is to o b t a i n a list of the
names         of      the  peop l e    who   f o rmed  the  Hillsborough
S t e e r i n g Group,        but frankly/ we have hit o b s t a c l e
after o b s t a c l e in trying to o b t a i n this; the latest
of      this         is   the    cop y    letter     attached  which  my
c o n s t i t u e n t s have received from the C o u r t Service.

Therefore/ I hope you will not min d me wr i t i n g to you
p e r s o n a l l y and stressing the natu r e of my p e r s o n a l
r e q u e s t for you r assistance in o b t a i n i n g this list.
It is a b s o l u t e l y essential for me and my c o n s t i t u e n t s
to o b t a i n this list in p u r s u a n c e of w h a t we c o n s i d e r
to be right and just aims.

I hope you can see your w a y clear                                                                                                         to f a c i l i t a t e                                          this,

      Dear Mr and Mrs Church

             Thank you for your letter o f 22 March concerning the Hillborough Disaster
     Fund. It would seem from your letter that you have corresponded with other offices
     within the Court Service or Lord Chancellor’s Department as the letters on our file do
     not follow. I cannot see from this current letter how I can be o f any help to you. This
     office can only respond to complaints about the administration o f the courts or for
     requests for advice on procedural. I f I can be o f further assistance, please do not
     hesitate to contact me.




                                         Your? sincerely

JOE BENTON MP AND CONSTITUENTS MR & MRS CHURCH

Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter of 18 November to Ken Sutton,
enclosing correspondence from Joe Benton MP and his constituents, about the
names of the members of the Hillsborough Steering Group. Whilst this Department
had no responsibility for the Group, we have made every effort to find information
Mr Benton may find of use.

Newspaper reports of the period suggest that the Hillsborough Steering Group
consisted of a group of six solicitors who co-ordinated legal claims on behalf of 300
firms representing the victims of the Hillsborough disaster. The only representative
of the Group that was named in the press was a Ms Nicola Harrison, unfortunately
her law firm was not named.

From the correspondence from Mr Benton's constituents, there appears to be some
connection between the Steering Group and the Hillsborough Disaster Fund, which
was a charity which ceased to exist in November 1995, but which may provide
another lead. The Liverpool office of the Charity Commission gave their last
Chairman and address as: Mr C M Reddington, PO Box 220, Liverpool, L69 2PN
(tel: 0151 236 0044).

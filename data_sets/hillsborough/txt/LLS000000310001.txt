       Dear Ronnie,

       I enclose herewith copies of the two Petitions in Alcock and Others and Copoc
       and Others.

       These are the beginning of proceedings in the House of Lords.  The Petitions
       were formally presented on Monday and I would be glad if you would keep those
       with the Hillsborough papers available for members of the Group if they want
       to have a look at them.

       There is another Petition to consolidate the two separate actions.  I haven't
       a copy of that at the moment but as soon as it is available I will let you have
       a copy  to put with the others.

       Every good wish.

       Yours sincerely,

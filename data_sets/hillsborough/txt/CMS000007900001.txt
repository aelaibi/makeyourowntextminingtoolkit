Dear Mr Webster

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 - HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM
Thank you for sending me so promptly a copy of the safety
certificate for Hillsborough Stadium and for quickly following
this up with copies of the stadium plans.

In his statement to the House of Commons on 17 April about the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster the Home Secretary said that he had
asked for factual reports from the police and other services, the
local authority and Football Association. A copy of the page
from Hansard which records the Home Secretary's statement is
attached.

I have been in touch with you by telephone requesting factual
information but I thought I should follow up the telephone
conversations to confirm in writing the request for a factual
report.

I am most grateful to you for your help in providing all the
factual details so far in the form of the safety certificate and
plans.  I would now welcome any additional information on the
action taken by your authority.  I stress that we are not seeking
judgments about the issues arising from the tragedy. These are
for Inquiry led by Lord Justice Taylor. But if there is any
further factual information which you can provide it will be most
appreciated.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                          D J MOULD

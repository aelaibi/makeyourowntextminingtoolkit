Dear Miss Butler

Re:   Revised Major Disaster Plan

Ifoank you for your letter of the 12th September.      May I suggest a few changes.

1. Page 7. I think the Ambulance Service should establish a control point at
B306 rather than B80, which does not have a direct outside line. This would inprove
canaunications at a time when the Department would be busy and crowded. In
addition, I could have done with Ambulance liaison on 15th April.

2. Page 11. In Section 2(i) I think we should change the name of the so called
Hon-Accident Unit to Emergency Department Control Point i.e. B306. In due course
it might be worthwhile getting a sign made to that effect.

3. Page 12. Section 3. Medical staff should be advised to report to the
Accident & E m e r g e n c y control point, where sane attempt can be made to register
than and provide identification.

4. Page 13. Following on from the above under Section 6 I am not sure how much
use it will be having a Consultant Physician in the Unit Accountant's office.
Physicians of any sort tend to display a robust independence of mind, so we may as
well advise them to report to the control point where they can decide amongst
themselves how best to disperse their available resources. This would also enable
the Accident & Emergency Consultant to collar any available Senior Physician to
assist in manning the triage point.

I hope you will find these comments helpful.      Thank you for all your work in
revising this plan.

Tours sincerely

                           MAJOR ACCIDENT PROCEDURE
               SECTION 1 MAJOR ACCIDENT PROCEDURE IN SHEFFIELD
             (This Paper briefly describes the arrangements agreed
               across Sheffield and is intended to supplement the
                        detailed plans at each Hospital.)
                           WHAT IS A MAJOR ACCIDENT?
There is no standard definition, but, for hospitals this is generally an
accident where the number and severity of live casualties requires special
arrangements to be made.
                                 NOTIFICATION
It is normally declared by the Ambulance Control but could also be declared by
other Emergency Services, and notification is to the Switchboards of all
designated major accident hospitals (Royal Hallamshire andNorthern General
Hospitals in Sheffield). The Switchboard Operator receiving the call should
notify the Northern General Hospital to ensure that the message is received.
However, on site, the Major Accident procedure should not be put into effect
until confirmed by either:-
      Consultant in A & E
      Senior Registrar in A & E
      Senior Registrar in Surgery.
The Switchboard Operator should contact the above mentioned staff in the order
shown and the first one to be contacted will liaise with the ambulance service
to obtain more precise details of the incident. This doctor will decide
whether or not to implement the Major Accident Procedure. The Switchboard
Operator will take no action to implement the procedure until instructed to do
so by one of the above mentioned medical staff.
Alternatively, if large numbers of severely injured casualties arrive without
notice at the Accident & Emergency Department the Consultant in charge may put
the procedure into action locally.
                           DISTRICT HOSPITALS CONTROL
 To provide co-ordination of Sheffield Hospitals and communications with other
 services and areas, a central point will be manned in the Hospital AdminiÂ­
 strator's office at the R.H.H. Local hospital controls will be set up
 separately at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and the Northern General Hospital.

                               DISTRIBUTION PRINCIPLES
The first patients will be taken to the relevant Accident Dept as shown below:-
9.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m. daily                        Royal Hallamshire Hospital
                                                    (except where accident occurs
                                                    close to the Northern General
                                                    Hospital).
8.00 p.m. to 9.00 a.m. each night                   The hospital whose Accident
                                                    and Emergency Department is
                                                    rostered to be open after
                                                    9.00 p.m. according to
                                                    the following rota:-
                                                    Monday       - R.H.H.
                                                    Tuesday      - N.G.H.
                                                    Wednesday    - N.G.H.
                                                    Thursday     - R.H.H.
                                                    Friday       - R.H.H.
                                                    Saturday     - N.G.H.
                                                    Sunday       - R.H.H.
One hospital will not normally be expected to take more than 25 seriously
injured casualties likely to require admission before the other takes an equal
number.
The District Hospital Control will be responsible for the distribution of
casualties by liaison with the Ambulance Service where necessary.
Children will be taken with adults to the appropriate adult Accident and
Emergency Department (at least initially). Children will not be taken direct
to the Children's Hospital.
SITE MEDICAL OFFICER/MOBILE TEAMS
A medical and nursing team or Site Medical Officer will not be automatically
despatched to the site of a major accident. However, should medical and
nursing assistance be required by the Ambulance Service in the light of the
particular circumstances the Medical Controllers at the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital and the Northern General Hospital will make appropriate arrangements
in the light of the particular needs and staffing resources. The mobile team
will normally be sent from the hospital not accepting the initial casualties
and any further teams required will be sent on a rotational basis. The
Ambulance Service provides a vehicle with certain basic supplies for
transporting a medical and nursing team and further specialised equipment,
supplies and protective clothing are held in readiness at both hospitals. On
arrival at the site the senior person on the medical team will evaluate the
 situation and act as Site Medical Officer. He must contact the Ambulance
 Incident Officer and will normally locate himself at the Ambulance Service
 Communications Point.




                                         - 2 -
The Site Medical Officer is responsible for:-
1.   Formulating a casualty evacuation plan in collaboration with the
      Ambulance Incident Officer.
2.   Arranging for the attendance of further medical and nursing teams
      if required.

               DEPARTMENT BY EITHER THE RED TELEPHONE OR RADIO, THE PERSON
               RECEIVING THE CALL SHOULD INFORM THE SWITCHBOARD TO COMMENCE THE
               PROCEDURE.
               The Department will be cleared of patients being treated as
               quickly as possible. They will be sent home, to a ward, or to
               the Physiotherapy Department, if they require transport home.
               When they leave the Physiotherapy Department, on the arrival of
               their transport, they will depart via the Medical School,
               1B 1 Floor (no. 6) exit. Accident and Emergency Staff will be
               allocated for patient assessment and treatment.
               Security Staff will place notices outside the Department, to the
               effect that it is closed because of a Major Accident, and in
               Claremont Crescent, and will lock all doors in the Department
               except those to the Orthopaedic Clinic.
               The Switchboard will divert G.P. referral calls to Bed Bureau.
               Those that are on their way in will enter the hospital via
               B Floor entrance and go straight to the ward.

(V)      A Floor Out Patient Department
         The Medical Out Patient Clinic should be cleared as quickly as
         possible and this clinic and the Ambulance Waiting Area should be
         screened off from the rest of the building by the portable
         screens which are sited in this area. The Social Work Department

       member of laboratory staff and inform him that the Major Accident Plan
       has been activated. A list of senior staff member's telephone numbers is

     The procedures to follow will be those invoked for any Major Accident
     with the exception that there must be a demarcation line established
     in the Accident and Emergency Department to separate "clean and
     "dirty" areas in terms of contamination. This also applies to
     Ambulance Personnel who may accidently become contaminated. Blankets
     and stretchers used in the "dirty" areas must not cross the
     demarcation line.
     On stand down from the emergency situation staff engaged on the
     "dirty" side of the demarcation line should use the shower facilities
     on site or alternatively the Fire Brigade may be requested to provide

                                        Sheffield
       (i)    An area should be set aside (the "dirty area") for the
              reception of casualties and should be covered with plastic
              sheeting.
       (ii)     Protective clothing should be issued for all staff who will
                handle the patient.
       (iii) A plentiful supply of paper towels and tissue should be
             avai1able.
       (iv)     Large polythene or paper bags will be needed for the collection
                of the patient's clothing and contaminated equipment etc.
       (v)    An area should be cleared where the ambulance can wait for
               monitoring and possible decontamination.
       (vi)     A limited number of staff should be appointed to handle the
                patient and a person should be designated to log the movements
                of any of those staff who must leave the "dirty" area after the
                casualties have arrived, in order to minimise the difficulty of
                tracing contamination.




                                            - 33 -
(vii) If other areas of the hospital become involved in handling the
      patient, e.g. a theatre or intensive care unit, similar
      arrangements should be made for these areas as appropriate.
The following initial decontamination procedure should be followed:-
(i)    Experience has shown that washing with soap and water will
       effectively remove contaminated material from the skin in most
       cases. Initial treatment and any necessary washing to remove
       as much of the suspected contamination as practicable should be
       done in the "dirty" area.
(ii)   Open wounds should be irrigated. Special care needs to be
       taken in the cleaning of areas near the eyes and in preventing
       the spread of possible contamination to other parts of the
       body.
(iii) It will usually be possible to seek further expert advice from
      a designated hospital before proceeding beyond the initial
      treatment stage, it is inadvisable to excise wounds unless
      contamination is obvious or unless surgically indicated before
      monitoring assistance is available.
As far as is reasonably practicable, all scattered radioactive
material and contaminated surface materials (e.g. soil, herbage etc)
should be collected and contained in order to minimise the amount of
residual contamination which may subsequently have to be flushed into
sewers or watercourses. The consent of the Department of Environment
Senior Radiochemical Inspector (tel. 01 273 4014 during office hours
a n d d u r i n g silent hours) should be obtained before any
flushing is undertaken but if decontamination by flushing is urgently
necessary before the Department can be contacted, then sufficient
flushing water should be used to keep the activity of the effluent
below the following limits and the Senior Radiochemical Inspector
should be informed of the action taken as soon as circumstances
permit.
1.     500 microcuries per 1,000 gallons of water for discharge to
       sewers;
2.     50 microcuries per 1,000 gallons of water for discharge into a
       watercourse.
 Incident Reports
 In order that the effectiveness of NAIR can be assessed, a brief
 report on each incident will be required from the radiation staff
 involved and should be sent to the National Radiological Protection
 Board, Harwell, Didcot, 0X11 0RQ (tel. 023 583 600) as soon as
 possible. This is in addition to any police report and should cover
 the following points:-




                            - 34 -
1.     Date, location and time of incident.
2.     Nature of incident and who reported incident.
3.     Assessment of radiological hazard, whether present or not.
4.     Nature of assistance given and any difficulties encountered.
5.     Whether Second Stage assistance was sought.
6.     Effectiveness of arrangements.
7.     Outcome of incident.
Casualties exposed to large doses of radiation
It is not intended that the Royal Hallamshire Hospital should treat
casualties affected by a high radiation dose such as might occur from
an accident at a nuclear power station or Ministry of Defence
establishment. Facilities for the treatment of persons suffering
from severe whole body irradiation exist at the following hospitals.
Enquiries about treatment or admission of casualties should be made

                                  STAND DOWN

The Police and Ambulance Control at the site of the disaster will have kept the
Accident and Emergency Department informed of the numbers of casualties injured
at the disaster, so that they can prepare for their arrival.
When all casualties have left the disaster area, the Police and Ambulance
Controls will inform the Accident and Emergency Department.
Accident and Emergency Department Control and the Hospital Control will consult
and agree when the Accident and Emergency Department has cleared casualties and
is able to return to normal.
The Hospital Control will then consult with other control desks and establish
what extra services will be needed over the next 24 hours and inform those
departments who can return to normal levels of service that they can stand
down"   The Hospital Control will inform other departments of the services that
they will need to provide for the next 24 hours and confirm that these needs
can be met.
When departments feel that they have concluded their contribution to the
disaster they should notify the Hospital Control that they are reverting to
normal service.
The Hospital Control will continue to monitor the need for additional services
and co-ordinate press statements and other activities in the following days.
The Hospital Control will liaise with the Police to ensure that relatives are
informed where casualties have been taken and what arrangements are being made
to trace missing persons, and to identify any unidentified casualties and to
identify the dead.

                          COPING WITH THE AFTERMATH


After a major disaster, it is important that staff are offered an opportunity
and encouraged to talk through the events that have occurred.
As soon as possible after the disaster, the Hospital Administrator will
circulate to all Heads of Department, information about the counselling
services available including telephone numbers of Helplines, counselling
services and the Family and Community Services Task Group.
Heads of Department should make arrangements for debriefing of staff as soon
as possible.
The Occupational Health Service will be available to provide confidential,
professional counselling for any member of staff who requires it. Any
individual member of staff can approach them. Any Head of Department who is
concerned about any of their staff should ask Occupational Health for advice on
how best to offer support and help.
During debriefing meetings, Heads of Departments will receive comments about
the way the Hospital responded. These comments should be forwarded to the
Hospital Administrator to assist in planning for future major disasters.

                             DEBRIEFING OF STAFF


After a major disaster, many staff will have been involved in caring for the
injured, their relatives and the bereaved. Even staff who normally work with
patients and relatives may find that a major disaster is stressfull.
Heads of Departments should ensure that all staff have an opportunity to meet
in a group (large departments may need to organise several groups) to talk
through the events, how the hospital as a whole coped, how their department
responded and to emphasise areas that worked well, as well as identify areas
for improvement.
Staff who did not come in should also be involved and assured that their help
is needed now to support their colleagues who are tired and to cope with the
increased workload which occurs for a time after the event.
Heads of Departments should ensure that staff who have been under pressure,
worked long hours or were upset by the event are given time off to rest and
relax. These measures will be all that the majority of staff need to come to
terms with the events. Some staff may need more help in coming to terms with
their feelings about the disaster. Various organisations who normally are
involved in counselling will be available to help individuals e.g. C.R.U.S.E.,
Relate (marriage guidance), Hospital Occupational Health Services and Hospital
Chaplains are also available for individuals or groups who need more
professional help.
After a disaster, Family and Community Services will establish a 'Help Line'
for individuals to seek advice and be directed to appropriate organisations
offering practical help and counselling.
Health Service Psychology Departments will also provide help in leading group
discussions and individual counselling. Details of these services will be
circulated as soon as possible after the event.

                                    VISITS


After major disasters, it is probable that a number of public figures will wish
to visit the hospital to thank staff for the work they have done and are
continuing to do and to meet the injured and their relatives.
In a major disaster, both the Northern General Hospital and the Royal
Hallamshire Hospital will be involved. Therefore, the District General Manager
himself or his nominee will co-ordinate the arrangements for those public
figures who are making official visits to both Hospitals.
The Unit General Manager and the Hospital Administrator will co-ordinate
arrangements within the Royal Hallamshire Hospital liaising with other Heads of
Departments as required and ensuring that any security arrangements requested
by the Police can be met.
"Official" visitors are deemed Members of the Royal Family and members of the
Government only. "Official" visitors will be accompanied by the Unit General
Manager and a few other staff he selects on a route planned in conjunction with
their representatives, the Police and the Regional Health Authority Public
Relations Officer.
Members of Parliament including members of the opposition may visit in a
private capacity only.
Any clergy who wish to visit, will make private pastoral visits to those
patients, relatives and staff who wish to meet them.


Following a major disaster, patients, their relatives and the hospital staff
will be the object of much attention from the media. Many people find
prolonged publicity stressful, and unwelcome, particularly when they are coming
to terms with after effects of a major disaster. The Unit General Manager will
designate one person to co-ordinate visits so that individual patients,
relatives and staff are not subjected to unwelcome attention or publicity.
Apart from the official visits of members of the Royal Family and members of
the Government, other visits will be conducted in as unobtrusive and low key
manner as possible.
Press inquiries will be channelled through the Hospital Administrator's office
and after a few days should be reduced to basic statements about the numbers of
patients still in hospital, and the numbers of discharges or deaths.

            Our    duties as       briefed were       to attend the M i d i R a i l w a y     S t at i o n to

            assist       foot    officers    in the    reception   of jyootball    specials.



            I c o mmenced these           duties at    1015am and was     stood down at 6, 4 5 p m on the

            same    day having a meal          at West Bar Police S ta t io n during          that    period.



            T hr ou gh o u t    the duty    period    I worked at the station,        at no    point were

            we    r equested to a tt en d the ground.           In fact   it was   not until       just

            prior     to our      ’stand d o w n 5 that we became       truly aware    of the

            se ri ou sn e ss     of what    had happened,      I feel   I am unable    to assist wit h

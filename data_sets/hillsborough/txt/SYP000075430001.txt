             I am a Driver/Warel"louseman employed Jyf'                                     and I

             live at the above address.



             I am a long term L ive rp o^r FC Su ppo rt er and when I learned that the

             semi final of the F .A . Cup was to be played at Hillsborough I decided

             I would watch the game.



             I attempted to get a ticket via my relations                in Liverpool but without

            success.                                       /

                                          -   * 0
            On Saturday 15th April            1989 I left work at about Midday and then hitch

            hiked to Sheffield,           my intention being to purchase a ticket from

             someone outside the ground.
                                                                       PAGE      2
                                                                       SI 969



I arrived at Sheffield at about 1 p m .       I walked for two ot three miles

following signs for Hillsborough and I stopped at a pub for a couple

of pints.     I telephoned for a taxi to take me to the district of

Grerioside, where I had arranged to meet friends and go with them to

the match.     When I arrived at the pub it was shut,     so I went straight

          ground.   I was dropped aff on Pennistone Road at the Spion Hop

(Nottingham Forest)    end at about 2.15pm.      I could see quite a

gathering of supporters attending the match some of which were

drinking beer from cans, although none of them appeared to be drunk.



      §d back up to a traffic     island and then left into Leppings LAne.

   alked along that     lane to the entrance of the West Stand, As I

neared the g/mind I was on the look out for anyone selling a ticket.

At aboutyg .4 5 pm w h ilst outside Leppings Lane I managed to pur chase a

six ^Hinds terrace standing ticket from a person who I d o n ’t know,          but

v4^e ticket   cost ten pounds.



    his time,,there was a large crowd outside the main entrance and the

flow of/triese supporters to the turnstiles was being controlled by a

Mounted Policeman and other Officers.



I passed through this     point to the turnstiles as indicated at A*G on

the attached map.      There were somewhere    in the region of a couple of

hundred supporters trying to get in at this area.         There were no set

queues,    to go through individual turnstiles, and this resulted in a

  t of jossling and pushing to get through the gates.         I was nowhere

near the turnstiles when I became aware of a Policewoman directing the

fans under a barrier to our right, and in through a concertina gate

which brought us into an area immediately behind the tur nstiles.          I
                                                                                PAGE     3
                                                                                S1969

 would say that the majority of the people waiting to g o ^ r f o u g h the

 turnstiles at this time went through this side qj            ".    No-one took the

 ticket stub and I can produce it (Jhn                 cXSL%" GJLkf^pjk-



 From this area I followed the crowd into the tunnel               leading to the

 West Slurffid terracing.    There were .no Stewards or Police officers at


bt
 tunnel
       tunnel entrance nor were there any signs.         As I walked through the

          I was on the left hand side and I was being pushed along

 with the crowd.     I heard some people shout that they had got into the

 a*r'6und without a ticket.



 At the        end of the tunnel,    I went   into the left hand Pen (4) and I

        up a position marked     XI on the Questionaire 036 (JPM 1).           I   was

     Tt aware of any Stewards    Police or Officials   in that area and

 at the time,    I took up my    position, I can describe the amount          of

 people   in the Pen as full     with slightly restricted movement.           I tried

 to moy€ towards the scene as the match was about to start.                The ma t ch

     arted and I felt then the pressure on me was        increasing, I

 was aware of more    persons corning into this section.           This   in turn,

 increased the pressure within it.



As the pressure increased I found myself being moved forward

 involuntarily to position X2.        I was unable to control this movement

and I found myself     in a position where my arms were on my chest and my

 elbows were    in other    people faces.


                                    w                     '


At abourt the same time I saw a 14 yr ^Tld lad          passed over the heads o f

       crowd from behind m e , I was just able to       use my lefthand to

in front of me as people                                                                                              in front couldn't get their hand up to assist.

It was at this time that                                                                                              I became aware of people at our f e e t .                                                                Such

was the crush that I couldn't get my arms down to help these, and I

remember grabbing hold of a mans arm to stop him from disappearing

below the level of the crowd.                                                                                                                       I felt myself going and I had to let go

                 lim to stay upright.                                                                                  In front of me at the perimeter fence I could

see people climbing over the fence onto the pitch behind me I was

aware of people being                                                                                     lifted into the seating area above.                                                                           Throughout

this pepitni, people were shouting to "Open the gates" and "There are

                                  underneath us".                                                                 I joined in this shouting but the pressure

still                        remained constant.



I saw the 14 yr old lad be i ng^fdil led over the front fencing and onto

the pitch.                                                I co uldn’t                                                           anything happening                                                         in Pen 3 but on the

pitch there was a                                                                                         of Police Officers and Spectators around

pens Pen 3 a n d ^ r perimeter                                                                                                     fencing.                                          I saw some of these ki ck i ng at

the fence iff the corner of                                                                                                        Pen 4 and 5.                                                     They      managed toget      the

fencint;y^away from the frame and people began to climb over.                                                                                                                                                             This had

an jfffect of relieving pressure from the front and I felt a relax in

   Tie pressure from behind.                                                                                                       As an area cleared                                                          I    was aware of       t

bodies of men on the fljcxir                                                                                                       in front of me.

I saw one PjyjFiceman giving these the kiss of life, others were banging

                                           chests to revive them.                                                                                            I had lost a shoe during this, which

         found close to one of the bodies.



By this time I had sufficient space to extend my arms to try and

restrict people from moving forward past me,                                                                                                                                                           in order to protect the

injured and persons giving first aid on the terraces before me.Events

then became very HAZY I think the bodies had been removed but
                                                                                     PAGE          5
                                                                                     SI 969

          I ’m not sure I believe I got out through the hole in the fence but

          again I am not sure as I was         in a state of shock and confusion.        I

          found myself on the pitch wandering about,          not knowing what to do.         At

          this    point with o>+fer spectators     I began to pick up hoardings which

          had been puLJ^d down by other spectators.           We then ran back and

          ,as$istej/fn the transportation of the injured to an area by the side

          of thp North Stand.




          One thing that stands out at this point to me,          is we went to pick up a
m r i ^   body to take him to the area, when someone said,          "Leave him,   he s

          dead,    take someone else".       I c a n ’t remember what the person looked

          like nor who said it to us.

                   /
                  /
          We t/ok about three injured people across and the area was quite
            /
          congested.        I was asked to stay with a ginger haired lad in his early

          3 0 ' s. I was told to keep him on his side.     His eyes were open and he
             ----
          was grasping for air, he d i d n ’t seem to be all there or aware of what

          was going on around him.          I remained with him for about    13 to 20

          minutes until someone came for him.          Throughout this time I tried to

          speak to him and reassure him after that I returned to the pitch and I

          saw another body with a coat laid over his head.            I d o n ’t know what he

          was wearing.




          I remember at this point a young         lad having a heated argument with one

          of the Police Officers.         The argument was motivated very much by the

          emotional       situation,   two other spectators took the youth over

          which eased that confrontation.

                                                                                  S1969



         I then spoke to a tall heavily built Policeman who consoled me as I

         was very upset by the two situations that I had witnessed.




         I continued wandering     round for a whilef^affid then I think I went

         through the fence again into Pen j5r**^to try and work out what had

         happened.     I then lefit tjn^^ffound a nd made my way home.




         In retrospect    I feel   if there had been better directions from no ti ce s,

         stewards or Police    inside the ground,   this may not have happened.

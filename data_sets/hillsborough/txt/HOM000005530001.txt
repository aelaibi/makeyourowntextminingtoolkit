BILL ON TAYLOR OFFENCES


TJjfcpk you for copying to me your note of 21 December.     I have
ol^y one small point, which is that the power of search which
is included in paragraph 2.10 of the draft Instructions is really
redundant in the light of section 32 of PACE, which provides an
automatic power of search in respect of any suspect who has been
arrested if he is arrested, at a place other than a police station
and if the constable has reasonable grounds for believing that
the arrested person may present a danger to himself or others.
There is also a power of arrest to search an arrested person for
anything which might be evidence relating to the offence of which
he has been arrested.     I don't know what Counsel's views on
duplicating provisions are, and I would not myself object if you
wanted to have a freestanding provision in order to tie up all
the details, but strictly there is no need for a new power here.

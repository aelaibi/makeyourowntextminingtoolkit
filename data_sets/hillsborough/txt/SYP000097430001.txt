    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

    I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
    from a selected number of police officers their recollections, in writing,
    of what happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989* The reason for my
    request is that I understand that a number of your officers performed duty
    on a mutual aid basis. Counsel are keen to obtain a cross section of
    accounts as soon as possible.

    I would like to make     arrangements as soon as convenient, through a Liaison
    Officer whom you may     care to appoint, to receive these written submissions
    as soon as possible.      There will be no need for my officers to see yours
    personally, although     a proof of continuity will be necessary, but I would
    hope that this could     easily be achieved through your Liaison Officer.

    The invitation to submit written recollections is based on criteria that I
    have already adopted with South Yorkshire Police officers. That is,
    there will be no interviews just simple requests to which the officer will
    be free to decide what he or she wishes to say. When supplying any written
    submission the officer will be free to keep a copy. I have also been asked
    by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, if a copy of
    any submission can be made available; I have no objections nor have Counsel
    appointed by Lord Justice Taylor.

    In this respect copies of any written submissions can be forwarded direct
    by you to Mr Wright at his Sheffield Police Headquarters.

    It would be helpful if I could arrange for one of my senior officers to
    contact your Liaison Officer in the next few days.

    Attached to this letter is the list of officers who I understand were
    seconded from your Force.

                 On    15 A p r i l ,      1989       ( 1 5048 9)                                                                               At 9am

                 (0900)       that        day    I attended             at       Niagara           with          other      Dog       Handlers             for

                 the    main       briefing.               From       then       on    I took          up    duties         w i t h PC          Morton a

                 West       Yorkshire           Dog      Handler.            Our       duties          were       to a s s i s t       with          the

             /searching              of    coaches,,            vans    etc.          at    A61    Tankersley.                   We    were
             /
         /       responsible.to                 an    Inspector             and       his    Doncaster                serial      of       officers.

                 From       then     on    I was         not     deviated             elsewhere.

                 At    3.00pm        (1500)          I was       detailed             for    a meal          at       Niagara and               as    s o o n as

                 possible          after        t ha t     to    take       up    patr o l        of    Leppings            L a ne ,       Halifax          Road

                 area       and     finally          after       the    match          to    escort          coaches          away         from       town.

                 At    3pm     (1500)        whilst         taking          m eal      at    Niagara             it    became         obvious           through

                 listening           to    the       radio       transmissions                that          matters         at    the       Leppings

                 Lane       end w e r e      getting            out    of    hand and             that,people               were       getting             hurt

                 and    a    possible           major       public          order          situation             could      ensue.              Along       with

                 other       officers           we    turned          out    to L e p p i n g s         Lane          and   stood          by    on     the

                 forecourt           of    Law Bros,             coaches.              By    t his      time          it w a s    obvious             t hat      the

                 game       would      not      go a h e a d a n d          that       many       people          were      dead       or       injured.

                 I personally              did       not    se e      anything             leading          up    to    the      incident.                 After

                 taking       up     the     position            on    the       gar-age      I j u st           stood      out       of    the       vehicle

                       we     attended          at       one    or    two      reports                of    fighting           in the       area.        I

                       reported           back       to N i a g a r a         at    approximately                      7 pm    (1900)       and went             off

0 «s A
                       transmissions                 are       concerned,               it w a s           a very       bad     situation          arid t h i n g s

                       and     people          panic       and       get      ups e t .           In v i e w       of w h a t        the    officers             in s i d e

                       the     ground were                having        to     deal          with          I think        the       transmissions                were

                       fairly        lucid.

                       I had        no    dealings             with     any        of        the       bodies.

                       From what              limited          information                   I have          learnt          about     the    p o l i c i n g of         the

                       Leppings           Lane       end       I feel         tha t         the       gates       should        have       been    better-

                       manned.            I worked             the     s ame       match          last       year       before        being       a Dog          Handler

                       and whether               it w a s       there         were           supposedly                forged         tickets       about          the

                       gates        were       well       policed.             The           f a ns        were    kept        in     fairly       orderly           queues

                       due     to    the       presence          of at          least            two       serials.            We    did    not    lea v e        the

                       gates        last       year       until       about         3.20pm              (1520).

                       I feel        that        may      be    a bit         of    complacency                   c r ept      in b e c a u s e    we    policed

                       t he    match          very       well    the        year        before.                                        ■     .               ■     x.

                       At     the    end       of    the       day     I think              S u p t . ,M a r s h a l 1 ’s d e c i s i o n         will       and

                       should        be       vindicated.

               We    were       still          being       crushed.                  People       were           shouting               at    the        Police              on

               pitch       and    the          pressure           in       the       pen    seemed           to        ease.            We    started               to       move

               back       and    just          in    front        of       me.        I saw       someone                fall          down.            He    was        a

               white       male       about          19 y r s         of    age.           He    was        about           5*9        he    was        medium           build.

               He    had       a moustache.

               He    had       short       hair       but       I can           not    remember              the         colour.              He        was     wearing                a

               white       button          up       shirt       that        was       ripped           he    did- n o t            have       any        trousers                 on.

                He    had       brown          boxer       shorts.               I can          not     remember                  if    he    had        any        socks          or

               Police          officer          came       into        t he      p^n.           The     ^eryfn              who        had    given           him        mouth

               to    mouth       picked             the    lad        up    off       the       floor        and         passed             him     over        to       t he

               We    then       helped          to    take        down          the    hoarding              from           the        front        of       t he    West

               them       as    stretchers.

               Eventually             I    left       the       ground           with                        and         went          back        to    the        van.

               All    the       others          were       back        there          at    the        van.            We     then          left        and     stopped

on    the      way     to    phone          home       to       tell        everyone          that       ws    were     all       alright

I was       not      injured              physically             at     the       match.




While       I was       on       the       pitch       I    saw        that       near    to       the    goal       were     a    pile         of

clothes.             A. m a n     was       going          tnrough           the    clothes.              I could           not    describe

him.        There       were          a    number          of    people           near    him       saw       what     he    was    doing              and

chased         all    the        way       down       the       pitch        to    the    corner          between           the    Spion          Kop

and    the      South        Stand.              He    was       surrounded              by       people       and     I do       not        know

what     happened            to       him       after       that.

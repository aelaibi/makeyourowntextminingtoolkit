1.   I was born on


2.   I   am   an   ambulance   man,   based   at   Parkway   Station   in
     Sheffield.      I joined SYMAS in December 1986 on a part time
     basis,    working a 30 hour week.        I became   full time in
     November 1987.


3.   My training included      attending a basic two week induction
     course at Fairfield, Rotherham, and when I became full time
     undertook another one week course at Fairfield.          I have no
     paramedic training.


4.   I was on duty on Saturday 15th April 1989, and my shift was
     0900 to 1630.     I drove to work directly from home, and prior
     to my involvement with the Hillsborough incident, my day had
     been fairly routine.      My call sign for the day was Sierra
     203.     I was driver for the day, and my attendant was ____




5.   At approximately 1450 whilst I was driving the ambulance to
     Middlewood Mental Hospital with a patient on board who had
     been collected from Northern General Hospital, we actually
     drove past Hillsborough.     At this point in time there was no
     sign of any crowd trouble,       although I noticed that there
     were large numbers of supporters still outside the ground.

        I would say that the patientL was
                                      w< dropped off at Middlewood
        Hospital at approximately 150(

6   .   When             and I returned to our vehicle, we heard on the
        vehicle    radio    that   Control    were       sending    a vehicle    to
        Hillsborough.      I had no Idea at this time of the enormity of
                                                   oArlS !/             \)
        the incident.               |radioed control/^to confirm that the
        patient    had   been   dropped    off      at    Middlewood    Hospital.
        Control immediately advised us to proceed to Hillsborough,
        to the police control point at the Leppings Lane end of the
        ground.    Whilst travelling on emergency to Hillsborough, we
        were advised by Control that there may be some casualties
        with crush injuries.


        I drove down Leppings        Lane,    turned       left and_ parked the
        vehicle at— eoinfe— A— ©ft— the— attached plan.            h estimate— ttte
        time- to have boon 1515.         I stayed with the vehicle and
                ran towards the turnstiles at that end of the ground
        to find out what was happening.          There were large numbers of
        people milling around this area.                 I then got out of the
           vehicle to see what was happening,                      beckoned me to
        bring   the vehicle     inside    the ground,        where upon     I got
        straight back into the ambulance and drove                   it into the
        ground and parked the ambulance behind another ambulance
        near to pe-int A/C on-the attached plah.


8.      I instinctively grabbed        the    "bag and mask"          out of    the



                                             11 7
      vehicle,     and when I got to the front of the ambulance I
      noticed an ambulance crew just In front of me putting a
      casualty onto a cot.         I specifically recall seeing a lot of
      people looking very dazed, and the situation appeared very
      chaotic.     I helped the other ambulance crew put the casualty
      onto their cot.


9.    I also noticed a number of supporters being carried out from
             4\/*v -o »A.
      the -fcttrnatilea— direction by two or three policemen at a
      time.     T11 i11 I jiiii111 n nn the-e^ -feeohod plaj^.


10.   A casualty was then brought to me by two police officers,
      and was      placed down      by the side of my ambulance.             This
      casualty     was unconscious, and was clearly not breathing.              I
      tried to resuscitate the casualty with my bag and mask and
      with heart massage.         After trying to resuscitate this man
      for some minutes, and gaining no response, I realised that
      he was clearly dead.           I pveejume he was/^dead when he was
      brought out from the football pitch by the policemen.


11.   I also noticed a number of other casualties in the immediate
      vicinity     of myself,     who were receiving        attention from a
      number of police officers, ambulance men and supporters.


12.   I left the police to deal with the fatality who had been
      laid by the side of my ambulance, and proceeded to go up
      towards     the west     stand,    to   see    if   I could   assist   any



                                              life
      further.     I immediately came across a second casualty on the
      floor, who was not breathing.        I tried to resuscitate this
      person with my bag and mask and with heart massage,                     but
      after trying to revive him for some minutes,                 there was
      clearly no hope for this person.


13.   I was then called across by a female supporter who was
      trying to revive a third casualty on the floor.                   I went
      across to help again, and I tried to revive this person with
      my bag and mask whilst          the female supporter gave heart
      massage.     Unfortunately,     despite our efforts,       this person
      was clearly dead and I covered the person's head.                 At this
      time,   a    police   officer   asked    me   for    the   keys    to   my
      ambulance.      He knew my name,        so presumably he had been
      speaking to my attendant,                           who had asked the
      police officer to find me.         I gave the keys to the police
      officer as requested.


14.   I believe I then asked a woman police officer whether there
      were any other casualties in the vicinity.             She replied in
      the affirmative and I made my way down through the tunnel of
      the west stand with my bag and mask.          This tunnel was fairly
      clear by this time, and so were the terraces when I arrived
      at the end of the tunnel.       The football pitch was still very
      crowded and I could clearly see a number of fatalities and
      casualties on the pitch.          I walked down the terracing,
      through gate 3 onto the pitch, and I made every effort to
      assist wherever possible.                    In particular, I saw a group of
      people around one casualty who was not breathing.                                I used my
      bag and mask equipment and also heart massage trying to
      resuscitate this person, but unfortunately, I was unable to
      resuscitate               this    person.       In    fact,    I recall          a doctor
      assisting with the bag and mask and deciding after a few
      minutes that there was nothing that could be done for this
      person. ^                              afc XLsl                                  -i-o ,Avof

15.   I particularly                   noticed    a number      of    supporters           taking
      casualties on advertising hoardings across the pitch towards
      the     other           end of the ground.             After     a short while,               I
      returned up the terracing on the west stand,                                 through the
      tunnel, and tried to locate my ambulance vehicle.                                  At this
      point in time,               I was approached by a number of fans who
      asked me what was happening and I also recall a number of
      fans hurling abuse at the police.


16.                            arrived shortly afterwards,                with    a policeman
      driving our vehicle.                  The ambulance was parked at the same
      point as before.                 I noticed a lot more casualties on either
      side of where we were parked.                        We immediately took one cot
      off the ambulance, and loaded a young boy, who appeared to
      have back and neck injuries,                         onto the cot and into the
      ambulance with the assistance of police officers.                                   I then
      noticed          another         casualty     lying     on     the       road,    who   was
      conscious,              but obviously in pain.           I assumed that he had



                                                    itp
      crush     Injuries.     The    second       cot was     taken out   of the
      ambulance, but before the second casualty was put onto the
      cot, I noticed that the police had put a different casualty
      onto the cot in the meantime.                This casualty appeared to
      have similar crush injuries.              The second cot, with casualty,
      was loaded into the ambulance, together with a relative or
      friend.                 and I stayed in the back of the vehicle
      with the casualties and a police officer drove the ambulance
      out of the ground up to Northern General Hospital.


17.   Both casualties were conscious in the rear of the vehicle,
      and when we arrived at the casualty department, it was the
      hive of activity with a number of medical teams waiting.
      The older casualty was taken off the ambulance first into
      the casualty department, along a corridor to where trolleys
      were situate.     The casualty was put onto one of the hospital
      trolleys.                     and I proceeded back to the vehicle
      and with     the help of the police officer who drove                  the
      ambulance, took off the second patient, down into casualty
      and onto a hospital trolley.                Both cots were then placed
      back inside the ambulance, and thei same police officer drovQ

      radiood -eontre-1.            We proceeded directly back            to the
      Leppings Lane end.       When we arrived back at the ground, I
      noted that there were still large numbers of people milling
      about.     Once the police officer parked the ambulance,                he
      then left the vehicle.         A call then came over the radio and
      requesting all ambulance crews in the vicinity to go to the
      gymnasium.                    then drove the ambulance around the
      ground onto Penistone Road and parked the ambulance behind a
      line of vehicles      ahead on Penistone Road.              I left    the
      ambulance to find out whether I could be of any further
      assistance.     I was instructed by Station Officer Paul Eason
      to drive a West Yorkshire ambulance, which had reversed into
      the   ground    up   to    the   gymnasium,    to     Northern   General
      Hospital, because the driver of that vehicle did not know
      his way to the hospital.         Two casualties were being attended
      to in the back of this vehicle.               I drove the ambulance
      directly     to the casualty department         at Northern General
      Hospital with a police motorcyclist escort.             As I parked the
      ambulance,     medical     teams   were     waiting    to   receive   the
      casualties, and I assisted with lifting the casualties out
      of the ambulance.         I did not go into the hospital with the
      casualties, rather I moved the vehicle away to allow other
      ambulances access to the casualty department.               I waited for
      the two West Yorkshire crew to come back to the vehicle with
      their cots and I drove the vehicle back down to Hillsborough
      via Herries Road South, onto Penistone Road, behind a queue
      of waiting ambulances.


18.   I got out of the ambulance,           without taking it into the
      ground.    A number of ambulances continued to reverse into
      the area around the gymnasium, and a number of bodies were
      taken out of the ambulances, put onto stretchers, and then



                                          [tfZ-
      taken into the gym.           I assisted with this task by putting a
      number of bodies into body bags.


19.   After all the bodies           were        unloaded into the gymnasium,all
      crews   were      informed      to park      their   vehicles    behind   the
      gymnasium.        I walked round to this area, and after sometime
      David     Jones     called     allcrews       together,    and   began    to
      ascertain which crew were on which particular shifts and who
      were volunteers.        I said I was willing to stay on, and after
      waiting around for approximately 20 minutes, ambulance woman
                         and I asked Station Officer                       who is
      based   at Maltby what we were                to do because we had no
      vehicle.     He then spoke to David Jones who called
              and I across and told                            to take a Longley
      minibus    and     transport    me     back    to    Parkway   Station.     I
           actually drove to Parkway, and then                         presumably
      drove the vehicle to Longley.               I arrived back at my station
      at   approximately      1900,    met up with                       who had
      already cleaned our vehicle, discussed in general terms what
      had happened during the course of the day, and signed off at
      1915.

  thicker,           and     I t hought w e 'd better                        try to get          in.     We went       to turnstile


  B* w h i c h was           by the fold in g                gates and the                crush was       getting worse.                I

  was      being      p ushed up against                     those          gates     and      I could feel        them bending

  under all           the w ei g ht        being          forced on them.                      I saw two m o u n t e d Police

  men who were               trying       to get          some         order       into     crowds      but    they couldn't,

  if a n yt h i n g        they were making                         it worse       by pushing everyone                together.             I

  saw no s tewards              or Po li ce men on foot at this                                  time*        While    I was

  waiting           I saw several               lads       climbing           up onto the w alls and going                       into

  the ground,              I t ri ed to do this                       but    c o u l d n ’t,    I only tried because                the

  crush was            ge tting w o r s e . E v e n t u a l l y we got thro ug h the t urnstiles and

  into the grounds.                   I went            straight             to the toilet             and w hen      I came out            I

  h ea d ed for         the    tunnsll.                On my way             I could walk           quite      easily there was

  a lot of            people    coming           over         the walls,            and a usual          slow amount           of

   people           coming    t h r ou gh the turnstiles.                             When      I got    into one tunnel was

  able       to walk         quite    freely            thro ug h           it.     There were          people     either        side of

  me but we w e r e n ' t c ru s he d together                              or a ny th in g      like that.           Whe n    I got tc

   the end of the              tunnel           I went              to the     left    side of the fence               into P en 4

I tried        to get         back     to him but was             unable     to as      I got      carried        away an

saw a man         of about           40 years        old,    having       his    back    to one of the

barriers        being         oushed        so hard against             it I heard      a cracking           noise        and

his     head a n d       neck were           being    forced       back     as well,         I w ou ld describe            his

as a f a t t is h man,              wit h    light    coloured grey or                blond hair        not balding

at all a nd        looked quite               thick*        He was about 5 ’IQ" tall a nd wearing a

casual      shirt        of a grey is h            colour*        I was s qu ashed up against                 this man

and my head was                under his           chin*     He was       shouting       “P us h back,        Pus h

managed        to get         down to his waist                 level    and s li ghtly        to the side          and

under     the     barrier           and     eventually          I mana ge d to stand up,             being    pulled

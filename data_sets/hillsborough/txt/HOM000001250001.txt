SOUTH YORKSHIRE COUNTY FIRE SERVICE


INCIDENT - HTT.T.SBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND - 1STK APRIL, 1989

REPORT OF ACO A. HORNSBY


At approximately 1530 hours I received a telephone call from FCO Cuckson
in Fire Service Control. He informed me that they had a "Major Incident"
in progress at Hillsborough Football Ground involving a large number of
fatalities and casualties.     I informed FCO Cuckson that I would attend
the incident.

On arrival at Hillsborough I was directed by the Police towards the
Leppings Lane entrance and I parked my car at the rear of a fire
appliance 100 yards from the Control Unit. I ascertained from the Sub
Officer in charge of the appliance that the Control Unit was in
attendance at Leppings Lane but he had seen the OiC, DO Lockwood, proceed
towards the Gymnasium where most of the casualties were. I handed my
tally to the Sub Officer and asked him to take it to the Control Unit for
me and to inform them that I was proceeding to the Gymnasium.
       accompanied me to the Gymnasium (the crowd at this time were
impatient and I noticed several scuffles with the police).

On arrival at the Gymnasium I contacted ADO Robjohns and he briefed me
that there were approximately 50 fatalities and 70 seriously injured
persons in the Gymnasium and to the best of his knowledge all casualties
had been removed from the terraces, etc. He could not at that time tell
me how the incident had occurred.        I walked round the inside of the
Gymnasium and met Stn.O. Fletcher. I asce-rtained that all Fire Service
personnel were all right and were standing by to assist in first aid
treatment. I contacted DCAO Hopkins who was organising casualty handling
in the Gymnasium and I asked if there was any additional services he
required from the Fire Service. He replied that the Fire Service had
done a grand job and that no additional services were required. I
contacted ADO Robjohns and instructed him to remain at the Gymnasium as
OiC of the Advanced Control Point and that the Fire Service Crews were to
stay there with him.

Accompanied by               I went to the Police Station in the grounds
to ascertain any further details of how the incident occurred and I was
informed that three barriers had given way in one corner of the "Kop".

I telephoned Fire Service Control from the Police Station and informed
them that there were possibly 70 fatalities and 30 seriously injured and
that the information was to be passed on to the Chief Fire Officer.

 I then proceeded to the Control Unit and informed Fire Service Control
 and all personnel on the fireground that I had taken over as OiC of the
 incident . I, then proceeded to the Police Control Viewing Gallery to
 establish a contact with-the Senior Police Officer. An Inspector was in
 charge of the Police Control and he informed me that ACC Jackson was OiC
 of the incident and he was located in the middle of the football pitch.
 I asked if there were any further casualties requiring Fire Service
 assistance, to which he replied "No"/ and I also asked if he required any
 additional Fire Service assistance, to which he also replied "No".



                                      -   1   -
Whilst discussing the incident in general a telephone message wan
received in the Police Control from a Club Official requesting that a
carefully worded message be transmitted over the Public Tannoy System
informing the crowd that the match had been abandoned. The senior Fclica
Officer refused to transmit that message unless authorised by ACC
Jackson. He stated that there had been a lot of skirmishes and with the
current atmosphere he was afraid a riot mi.ght ensue.

I left one officer, ADO Green (with fireground radio), at the Police
Control Viewing Gallery and instructed him to act as Liaison Officer.  1
returned to the Control Unit and issued instructions to all Fire Service
Personnel to either:-

              1.   Report to the Gymnasium and remain there.
              2.   Report to the Control Unit.
              3.   Remain seated on their appliances.

I instructed SDO Smoothey to report to the Gymnasium and       to ensure en
route that any Fire Service personnel he saw were              informed of my
instructions.

The Chief Fire Officer arrived and I informed him of the situation
although at that time I was still unsure of how the incident occurred.
The CFO took over as OiC of the incident.

I remained on the Control Unit until the crowd had adequately dispersed
and then I accompanied the Brigade Photographer to the "Kop end‚Äù where
the injuries had been sustained and then we proceeded to the Gymnasium.
I ascertained from the DCAO, Mr. Hopkins, that no further immediate
assistance was required of the Fire Service personnel and then contacted
the CFO suggesting that, with the exception of 4 appliances and tho
Control Unit, all other appliances be returned to base.

The CFO arrived at the Gymnasium and informed me that he had reduced
appliances as suggested. The CFO was briefed by ADO Robjohns and Stn.O.
Fletcher.

I was instructed by the CFO to contact the Senior Police Officer to see
if they required any further assistance from the Fire Service - ACC
Jackson was contacted and he informed me that our services were no longer
required.

                           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
            OPERATIONAL EQUIPMENT IN ATTENDANCE AT THE INCIDENT

            REPORT BY ASSISTANT CHIEF FIRE OFFICER A.D. HORNSBY


The policy in the South Yorkshire   CountyFire Service is that      all
operational fire appliances carry the same firefighting equipment which
is located in the same position on eachappliance.     A list     of the
appliances in attendance at the incident is attached (see Appendix A),
together with an inventory of the rescue equipment carried       on the
Emergency Tender (see Appendix B).

1.    Resuscitation Equipment

      Each appliance carries a Brook Airway and an Oxygen Resuscitator
      with two oxygen cylinders.

      There are two types of Oxygen Resuscitator on appliances

      (a)    Motivus   -   ) details of which appliance carries which
      (b)    Maxaman   -   ) resuscitator as detailed on Appendix A.

      The reason that two types of resuscitator are maintained within
      the Brigade is that the Motivus set is no longer produced and has
      been superseded by the Maxaman set.

      The resuscitators work on the principle of a controlled flow of
      oxygen being    supplied to   the patient which will ventilate the
      patients lungs if he/she is not breathing or assist if he/she has
      difficulty in breathing.

      The only difference between the two resuscitators is :

      (a)    Maxaman - ceases to supply oxygen once the patient breathes
             on their own.

      (b)    Motivus - continues the oxygen flow after the patient
             breathes on their own and the oxygen is released to open air
             by a trip valve.

      Each set operates on a rotary scale which is suitably variable
      from child to adult settings. The duration of the sets varies
      from 20 to 40 minutes per cylinder.

      Each set is subject to a weekly standard test which consists of
      checking the contents of the oxygen cylinder to ensure that the
      cylinder is at least 75% full. The set is also checked to ensure
      that the cycling changes on the adult and child settings.

2.    Failure of Resuscitator

      At the incident resuscitator set no. 1297 which was carried on
      Stocksbridge 2 appliance did not function properly.

      As part of the Brigade procedure the resuscitator was impounded
      and an -investigation was carried out by the Brigade Equipment
      Officer as to the reason for the failure (see Appendix C).
3.     Specialist Resuscitators

       Enquiries have been carried out to determine if resuscitation
       equipment suitable for dealing with crush injuries is available,
       but to date we have no knowledge of such equipment.

4.     Rescue Equipment

       Most operational   firefighting    equipment can be utilised for
       rescue purposes    and a list      of such equipment is attached
       (Appendix D).

       Equipment which could have proven useful in removing the             barrier
       fencing in such an emergency is as follows :

Bolt Cutters

These are approximately 3 feet in length, similar in operation to a
pair of scissors and are capable of cutting through metal rods.

Hydraulic Rescue Set

Consists of various pieces of equipment suitable          for    spreading       and
forcing apart obstacles up to 8 ton in weight.

Air Tools

Air operated pneumatic      zip   gun    suitable   for cutting through metal
sheeting and rivets.

Air operated pneumatic saw for cutting through       metal      sheeting,     bolts
and rods.

Tirfor Equipment

Equipment which works on the winch principle of pulling of lifting
obstacles up to 2 ton (5 ton on ET) in weight utilising slings and
chains.

Thermal Cutting Equipment

This equipment is carried on all Emergency Tenders and is capable of
cutting through all ferrous metals of unlimited thickness even under
water. It operates by a special cable being burnt at high temperatures
as a result of oxygen being fed into it. There is sufficient equipment
per Emergency Tender for 6-10 minutes duration.

Hurst Cutting/Spreading Equipment

 A petrol driven engine provides hydraulic power through hydraulic hoses
 to either -

 (1)   Cutters                                                              '.

        Providing a cutting force of 15 ton in the optimum position.             Not
        suitable for hardened or tensile steel.
(2)   Spreaders
                                                                       Z!
      Providing a spreading distance of 24" with a force of 3.60 ton
      and a pulling distance of 24" with a force of 2.55 ton.

          tttt.
              t.r r q r q PGH   INCIDENT.   MAXAMAN RESPSCITATOR FAILURE


At approximately 0915 hours on Tuesday, 18th April, 1989, I received a
telephone call from West Division Headquarters stating that they were
holding Maxaman Resuscitator, Serial No.1297 which had been impounded
after failing to work at the Hillsborough incident. This resuscitator is
normally carried on Stocksbridge 2 appliance. It was reported that the
resuscitator was delivering an oxygen flow comparable with the control
knob being in the "child" setting and would not adjust.

The set was collected from West Division Headquarters and brought to the
Technical Services Office at Command Headquarters. On examination it was
confirmed that the set was working as described.

The end cap of the control knob was removed and it was discovered that the
control knob retaining nut had worked loose allowing the knob to turn on
the spindle without turning the spindle itself which wouldadjust the
flow.   Thecontrol knob was set in its correct   position and the nut made
finger tight. This allowed the set to function correctly and adjustments
to the flow rate between "child" and "adult" to be made. The set was then
transported to the Brigade Training Centre to be placed on the test lung
to ensure the correct tidal volume of oxygen was flowing at maximum and
minimum settings. Once this was confirmed, the control knob nut was fully
tightened and the set returned to West Division Headquarters to be put
back into service.

Part of the Brigade weekly test on resuscitators     is to startit cycling
and adjust     the control knob to its extreme settings    to ensurethat the
flow rate does adjust. It is possible that this nut was slightly loose at
the time of the last weekly test but not loose enough to show a
malfunction. Further vibration due to being carried on the appliance may
then have loosened the nut to the extent of not operating the spindle at
it's next use.

Records show that this resuscitator was last tested on 10th           April,1989,
and was working satisfactorily.

Opinion as to if -the Fire Service had been called     to   -the   incident
eai-lier could they have been of more assistance




At whatever stage the Fire Service had been called in attendance we
carry sufficient equipment on each and every appliance to be able to
cut and remove the perimeter fence quickly. In addition we carry
equipment with which we can pull the fence down. Over and above that
on the Emergency Tender we carry more heavy duty equipment which would
also perform the same function.

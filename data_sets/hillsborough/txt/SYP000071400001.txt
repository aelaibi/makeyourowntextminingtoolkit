               I am a married man living at                                       with my wife and family.                  I

               am at present unemployed.

               On Saturday       15th April        1989 (150489),         I attended the FA Cup Semi-Final

               match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forrest at Hillsborough

               travelled from my home by car with my neighbour's son,                                                     We

               arrived in Sheffield at about S. 30 pm (1430) and parked the car on a

               garage j p i r e c o u r t W e   walked to,the ground arriving at the Leppings Ln

               t u r e « ^ i ^ ^ ^ ^g^5      pm ( 1435)/        On our walk to the ground there were a

               lot of fans,       the atmosphere was            "happy*.

               When we arrived outside the ground,                     the queues were spilling                 into the

               road.            and I split up at this time because he had a seating

               ticket and I had a standing ticket.

               From my arrival and standing                  in the    road it took about            10 minutes

                    for me to get t h r*pi/ah^ne    railings where there we re 3 policemen on

                    area between thjs glkteSs aoa turnstiles.    Inside that area (marked W
  L~ \   U-
                    on map)    I had no control where I went,      it was   packed solid,    it

                    seemed very slow progress of people going through the turnstiles.                          I

                    was about halfway between the. outer        railings and the turnstiles,        when

                    on my right,    I saw a larjge bltye gate    (gate C - marked on map).         I saw

                    the gate being opened by two pto 1 i cernen ft/om the     inside.   There was one
               / ---------------------------- 1 / -------- a — :------------
              / policeman on each side jojr the g\^te pu)A ing it open.    I was            carried by

U L V yd X )    the crowd       towards the gate,    I had no cont/c 1 over where I w e n t .          I

    ^           went through the gate and into the ^ard sti 11 having no control

                    Once    inside the yard,    a few yards    inside I^tJTej^7 was able to walk

                    normally.     It would be about 2.55 pm (1455) when I        got to this point.

                    In the area outside the       turnstiles   it was very compact, you could              not

                    move your arms and it was difficult to breathe.           There was a great

                    pressure on your body.        I had no control over where I went,       it was

                    dictated by the crowd.

                    In the area outside the       turnstiles   I did not see any policemen or

                    stewards other than the       policeman on horseback.

                    On entry through the gate       (Gate C)   I was not asked for my ticket,              I

                    did not see anyone     checking tickets.

                    Once    I had free movement    inside the Leppings Lit yard I walked over to

                    a staircase and asked the steward and policeman stood there              (position

                    marked    on map) where    I was to go, showing them my         ticket.        I               was

                    directed to the tunnel      leading to the area behind the goal.

                    On the    staircase was one policeman and one steward.          I was not told

                    that I    could go anywhere else other than down the tunnel.         I entered

                           ^unne-*-' having walked from the area of the staircase.

                    As I entered the tunnel       I could see the pitch.     There was a large

& T tW f )          amount of people     in front of me and a large amount of people following
                                                                                  PACaE           3
                                                                                  S 1 S 66

me   in.

Again,     once   inside the tunnel,    I lost control       of where   I went.     I was

able to move my arms       and breathe but I had to follow the            crowd.     It

was not possible for       me to go back up the tunnel          or move across     it.       I

walked down the tunnel       on the right hand side and on reaching the

terraces at the bottom I went to the right              (into pen 3).

As I entered the terrace       I could see how packed it was.             I decided to

go over the right and get against the wall at the back of the pen.                           As

I was trying to get across the the right             I was    pinned against a

barrier     for seconds and it was a tremendous          physical strain to release

myself.      I ended up about a yard from the back wall and about 2~3

yards to the right of the entrance to the tunnel.                 It was a physical

strain on all of my body.           I had difficulty in breathing and was not

able to move,       it was almost    like a vice being squeezed from the sides.

When I got inside the terrace          it was just before the kick-off.

The situation I have described didn't          change as the game started.

About 5 minutes       into the game,    I saw people in front of me trying to

climb the fence and,       shortly after,    I saw a policeman run onto the

pitch and stop the game.        There were    people at this time shouting for

us to move back but there were no room with the wall so we started

passing the kids upwards and into the stand above.

I could see in front       of me people on the railings pulling people up

and a big policeman doing the same.           By now there were a lot of people

on the pitch,      pulling up boards and carrying         people on them.         I'm not

sure how long I stayed       in the terrace,       I lost track of time.

I then saw the crowds had eased around me and/I walked off the terrace



out of the tunnel       I saw about    15 bodies

injured people and people crying and peo           i   e just^millirtg about.

I was asked by a policeman to give him a hand to move some of the

                    doctor    checking the p>eople to see if they were alive.

                    Together with the policeman,        I lj/f'ted a man whj^yas white, about 27

                    placed    in the same area as others.

                    After that    I c a n ’t remember any description of the others.             All the

                    bodies were    in the area of yard between the entrance to the tunnel and

                    the gate I entered through       (Gate C).      The way the bodies were lay

                    gave me the impression thats where they had died.              They were not laid

                    out in an orderly way.        I did not see any people moving the bodies out

                    of the    pens to the area.

                    There was a lad I saw being       crushed in the area of pen 3 (marked on

                    map) against the barrier just inside the pen.             He was pinned against

                    the barrier and couldn’t move.         His back was pinned against           it.     He

                    was shouting out and I tried to get hold of him but c o u l d n ’t.                I was

                    moved further over     into the terrace and d i d n ’t see him again.              I would

           frizzy hair,          brushed back,            wearing a lilac/mauve shirt.

           I left the ground about 4— 4.30 pm (1600— 1630).

           Liverpool and he has handed it in.

I arrived at the football       ground with                                 and

                 around 2pm    (1400).      After staying at the first aid room

for a while,    we left and went to the corner we were based at,

which was by the Liverpool       terrace.      There were two others with us,

an adult and a cadet,     who was probably a little older than myself.

Before the match started,       we were told what to do if someone      in the

crowd was injured.                                      would stay at the

corner while the rest of us would go into the crown.             About a minute

into the game we were aware of a supporter trying to get over the

fence.     There were a few police stood around him.                     ind the

other man went across,     followed by the other cadet and myself.          As I

walked across    I remember seeing the faces of people squashed up

against the fence.       The   police opened the small gate and they started

pulling supporters out.         We (the other cadet and myself) were told to

go back to the corner.           As we did, we were confronted by supporters

getting hold of us and         saying things to the effect of 'Help,   people

are dying in there,     get them out,’.       There was nothing we could do.

The police were now putting the supporters          into an enclosure which

wasn't   really full.     The police were also      putting injured people into

this enclosure.      By this time,       too many people were   coming out of

the crowded enclosure.         We received our first    casualty.    The other

cadet and myself got either side of him and took his weight as he was

suffering from chest     injuries.       When we had taken him to    the first

aid room, we went back          round to the pitch.   I was handed   a casualty

who had complicated wrist fracture.            He was in great pain with it and
                                                                              PAGE       7
                                                                              D701

showed this by his expression on his face and what he said to me.

When I arrived at the first aid room this time,            the police were taking

stretchers round onto the pitch.            I carried one round with the other

cadet.      When we arrived on the pitch, we were         confronted with the

sight of people lying down on the pitch with their friends              round them.

None of the people       I saw were dead.      A policeman told me that a

casualty by him was feeling faint and sick.             He was lifted onto the

stretcher we had and was taken to the first aid room, with the help of

three supporters.         When we arrived at the first aid room we placed

the stretcher down on the floor,           along with the other injured       people

on the floor there.         I was told     to go and sit with a woman and keep

her company.      I found out she had twisted her ankle before              coming

into the ground.         She d i d n ’t really know what was happening,       so I

told her.      She said she felt guilty because she was taking up space

and time that could be used by someone with greater injuries than her.

I reassured her and she stayed.            I was also told to look after a

teenager who had suffered chest injuries.             He had to be sat upright

so he could breathe easier.           He   kept crying and asking to go to the

hospital.      He said he wanted to        go to the toilet,   so I asked     one of

the South Yorkshire Ambulance drivers if I could borrow a bucket as a

casualty was    wanting     to go to the toilet.      He replied,    "Tell him to

do it up the    wall".       I went into the first aid room and was given a

bag for the casualty        to use.   Just as I went out of the       room,    the

casualty was    brought     in and he used the toilet in there.         I went to

the woman with the twisted ankle and sat with her for a while.                   I

gave a cold compress to a man who had an injury at the top of his leg.

After this I went and sat with                             who were on the      police

cell bus.      I stayed there for quite a while.          At around 5pm        (1700)

            telephoned our parents to tell them that we were alright.                   I

remember seeing police and St Johns Ambulance memebers              crying from
                                                                           PAGE     S
                                                                           D701

         what they had experienced.   We left the ground at around 3.45pm

         <1745).   It seemed really stra nge because   it was so quiet as we

         walked along Penistone Rd.   Fr om a day that started out so nice,    it

         ha d ended in tragedy.

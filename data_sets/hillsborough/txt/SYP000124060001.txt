 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                            X.

 THE FA ALLOCATED TOO FEW TICKETS TO LIVERPOOL, THEREFORE, THE FANS WENT DOWN

 TO HILLSBOROUGH TO GET A TICKET.     THERE WERE DS^AYS ON THE MOTORWAY AND POLIC

 DELAYED BY SEARCHING COACHES.    TOO FEW POLICE OUTSIDE TO MAKE FANS QUEUE UP.

 FANS WERE MASSING AROUND MOUNTED POLICE.          THE POLICE HAD NO AUTHORITY OUTSIDE

 THERE WAS A BUILD UP OF FANS - ONCE INSIDE THERE WERE NO SIGNS OR POLICE/

 STEWARD DIRECTIONS TO SHOW WHERE TO GO.           I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE ABANDONED

 MATCH SOONER AND GOT FANS OUT.     THERE WAS LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN POLIC

 IN AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND - NONE KNEW WHAT TO DO.          FANS HAD BEGGED POLICE

 THEM TO MOVE BACK, BUT THEY COULDN'T MOVE.     THE POLICE IN THE CONTROL BOX

 KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT THIS WASN'T RELAYED TO THE OFFICERS IN THE GROUND.,

 THE POLICE MADE IT SO CONJESTED OUTSIDE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO GATHER OUTSIDE

 STOPPING THE AMBULANCES GETTING THROUGH.     PARKING WAS A PROBLEM, THE COACHES

 WERE TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE GROUND, THUS DELAYING US GETTING TO THE GROUND.

 WHEN WE GOT OUT ONTO THE PITCH AFTER CLIMBING OVER THE FENCE, THERE DIDN'T

 SEEM TO BE ENOUGH FIRST AID.    PEOPLE WERE LYING ALL OVER THE PITCH, SOME DEAD,

 SOME ALIVE.    THERE WASN'T ENOUGH MEDICAL AID.      A FEW POLICE OFFICERS & FANS

 TOGETHER. W E R E GIVING MOUTH TO MOUTH AND WHAT FIRST AID THEY COULD.     HOWEVER

 A LOT OF POLICE WERE JUST WALKING AROUND DOING NOTHING, THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

 TO DO.     I PERSONALLY WAS VERY ANNOYED AT THE POLICE ACTION, ESPECIALLY WHEN

 THE CORDEN OF POLICE WERE PUT ACROSS THE HALF WAY LINE.         THEY SHOULD HAVE

BEEN HELPING THE INJURED.     A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE WALKING ABOUT IN SHOCK.

     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

FROM THE MOMENT WE ARRIVED IN SHEFFIELD THE POLICE SEEMED TO TREAT US LIKE

ANIMALS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WERE QUEUING TO GET INTO THE GROUND, POLICE

HORSES WERE GOING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS NOT CARING ABOUT CRUSHING PEOPLE

AGAINST THE F E NC E AND THE HORSE. TREADING ON PEOPLE.      THERE SEEMED TO BE A

LACK OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN OFFICERS ON THE INSIDE OF THE GROUND AND THOSE

OUTSIDE.     THERE WAS A LACK OF STEWARDS ON THE LEPPINGS LN TERRACING.

ALL THE EMERGENCY SERVICES (POLICE/AMBULANCE & FIRE) ARRIVED FAR TOO LATE.

 VERY POORLY, OBVIOUSLY THE POLIC]   i WAS STRONG BUT THEY LOST CONTROL OF IT

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 (1) I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE TUNNEL LEADING TO PENS 3 AND 4 WAS NOT BLOCKED

 OFF SAY BY THE POLICE FORMING A LINE TO PREVENT      RSONS ENTERING THE TUNNEL

 BECAUSE BY 2.10PM 1410, THE FANS IN PENS 3 A      4 BEHIND THE GOAL WERE IN SUCH

 LARGE NUMBERS THAT THEY COULD NOT MOVE

 (2) IT WAS JUST BAD POLICING.

 Q 54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1)     THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL WAS THE ONLY OBVIOUS ENTRANCE TO THE STANDING

 AREA AND THE ONLY ONE CLEARLY SIGN POSTED.        THERE WAS NO SIGNS FOR THE OUTER

 PENS.

 2.     IF YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE PENS YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO GET OUT OF THEM.            I

 sKI THE EMERGENCY GATES THEY WERE ONLY 3 ’ WIDE AND YOU HAD TO CLIMB 4 ’ TO GET

 OUT OF.

 3.     ALSO THE ACCESS GATES AT THE SIDES SHOULD BE AT THE FRONT BECAUSE THAT IS

 WHERE THE PRESSURE IS.

 4.     I BELIEVE THE PRIME CAUSE IS THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS.      LIVERPOOL SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE LARGER ALLOCATION.

NO

Q53

DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE i^Y THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

I BELIEVE THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE RESPONDED A LOT QUICKER.       THEY SHOULD

HAVE TRIED TO RIP THE FENCING DOWN,           DIDN'T TRY UNTIL THEY SAW THE

LIVERPOOL FANS DOING IT.    THEY SHQflL D 'VE OPENED THE GATES A LOT QUICKER.

I ALSO SAW THE POLICE ARGUING \A^ONGST THEMSELVES INSIDE PEN 4.

l ^ T H E R E ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

1. I D O N ’T BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE PENS AND IF THERE ARE THEY SHOULD BE

HORIZONTALLY PARTITIONED NOT VERTICALLY.

2. LAST TIME I WENT TO HILLSBOROUGH THE GATES WERE CLOSED AND POLICE WERE

ACROSS THEM AND THEY WERE DIRECTING PEOPLE LEFT AND RIGHT TO THE STANDS

AND TERRACES THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO ENTER THE TUNNEL THIS WAS WHEN

LIVERPOOL PLAYED SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY IN THE LEAGUE, SO WHY DI D N ’T THEY DO

IT THIS TIME.    THIS WAS 14/1/89 (140189).

3. THERE WA S N ’T AS MANY POLICE EVIDENT AT THIS SEMI FINAL AS THERE WAS FOR

Tffi[ LEAGUE MATCH.

4. TICKET ALLOCATION.

5. THE POLICE LOST CONTROL,    I BELIEVE THEY SHOULD’VE DONE MORE.

6. AT 1450 I SAW A POLICE OFFICER WALKING ALONG THE FRONT OF THE STANDS

AND LOOK INTO PEN 3 HE MUST HAVE SEEN THE CRUSH.

7. I SAW POLICE STOPPING PEOPLE CLIMBING INTO THE STANDS FORCING THEM

BACK INTO THE PENS.

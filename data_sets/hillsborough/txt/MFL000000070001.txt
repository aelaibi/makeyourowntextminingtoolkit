Dear Sir,

¥hen the August Delegate Meeting of the Sheffield Trades Union Council
discussed the Interim Report of The Right Honourable Lord Justice Taylor
on The Hillsborough. Football Ground Disaster a Resolution was
unanimously adopted instructing me to advise your Committee that the
Sheffield Trades Union Council considers that all Police
Officers,irrespective of rank, found responsible in any way whatsoever
for the Disaster, should be dismissed.

Additionally,the Resolution also instructed me to convey the thanks and
appreciation of the Sheffield Trades Union Council to Mr. Martin
Flannery, M. P.,for his publicly made demand that such Police Officers be
dismissed.

                                  Yours faithfully,

      Councillor Clive Betts,          1st September,1989.
Leader,Sheffield City Council,

Dear Clive,
              HI LLSBQRQlfG.H_£QflI£ALL....SEQMP--P. I£A5I£B.,.

In a letter dated 1st instant addressed to the Chairman of the South
Yorkshire Police Committee I stated as follows:-

    "Vhen the August Delegate Meeting of the Sheffield Trades Union
    Council discussed the Interim Report of The Eight Honorable Lord
    Justice Taylor on The Hillsborough Football Ground Disaster a
    Resolution was unanimously adopted instructing me to advise
    your Committee that the Sheffield Trades TJnion Council
    considers that all Police Officers, irrespective of rank, found
    responsible in any way whatsoever for the Disaster, should
    be dismissed."

    "Additionally, the Eesolution instructed me to convey the
    thanks and appreciation of the Sheffield Trades Union Council#
    to Mr. Martin Flannery, H.P.,for his publicly made demand
    that such Officers be dismissed."

It is the view of the Sheffield Trades Union Council that with a view to
avoiding future disasters such as The Hillsborough Football Ground
Disaster that the relevant Sheffield City Council Committee should
discuss with the Sheffield Trades Union Council Safety Committee (a)
the benefits which workplace health and safety committees
bring to industry; and <b)the benefits that similar committees, with
spectator as well as employee and employer representation could bring.

During the period that I was the President of the ASLE&F I participated
in a Committee chaired by Dennis Howell, M.P.,the then Minister of Sport
and at meetings of same football hooliganism was a frequent subject of
discussion. .When I suggested that football matches should commence at
say, 11.00 A.M. or 12.00 noonto overcome alcohol related problems I was
supported by the representatives of the football clubs in attendance.In
fact, the Eepresentatives of the Scottish Football Association supported
my suggestion and stated that they had experimented with mid-day
commencements and the problem of drink-related hooliganism had been
eliminated. Surprisingvly, the Minister of Sport rejected the suggestion
on the grounds that footballpools provide a substantial amount of
Government Eevenue and should the commencement times of football matches
be moved forward then it would not be possible to get the football pool
coupons returned in time.

                                  Yours sincerely,

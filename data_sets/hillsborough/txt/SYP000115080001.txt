              towards           the        stadium.           This     trickle               increased           in v o l u m e    as     time went

              by.         At    approx.              1.55    p m , (1355)             the    football         special          carrying

these       fans       who    were       asking       for    directions                 to     the    nearest          pub.        Quite

a    number       of    these       requests          were       made       for a        specific           pub      called

seeking          tickets.           On    several          occasions             I overheard               th e    words      "any

As    time       progressed          there       was      a noticeable                  increase           in f a n s     carrying

 could       see    that        a    crush       barrier            had    been          twisted and              flattened           to    the

 ground.           There        were       items         of    clothing             and     other       personal           effects

 stewn       everywhere              and       I could         see     blood         smeared along                  the    l e n g t h of

 the    damaged          barrier.

Because        most        of       the    dead and            injured          had       been     removed           from       the

 enclosure          I made           my wa y       on     to    the       pitch.            It w a s        there      that      I was       met,

with a        couple        of       supporters               carrying          a    display           hoarding.               This

 hoarding          was     immediately               used       to     transport             an apparently                 lifeless          man

from     the       pitch        to a       location            behind          the       North Stand              adjoining           the

gymnasium.               This        unknown         person was                placed        on    the       ground and           myself

and a        supporter              commenced            giving        mouth         to m o u t h a n d           heart        massage.

This     proved          unsuccessful               as        indicated             by a D o c t o r        who      examined          the

bo dy.        I arranged              for       this      person          to    be       taken     into        the m a k e s h i f t

E N D OF    REPORT
                         LIVERPOOL V NOTTINGHAM FOREST.
                H % nA
I am Pc 27^9 Allen currently stationed at Askern Police Station in the
Mexborough Sub-Division.

At Sam on Saturday 15 April 19&9 I commenced duty at Adwick le Street Police
Station. From there myself and other officers were transported by the force
coach to Hillsborough football ground where we were briefed about the forth­
coming event.

kf%m? the briefing and a meal break myself and the rest of my serial being
No. 33 took up our positions on Penistone Road North between the Travellers
public house and Wadsly Bridge railway station. The serial supervised by
Ps 2228 Atkin was split up into pairs of officers, I myself pairing with Pc
2576 McEwan. We took up a position directly outside the John FAirest funeral
home at approx. 11 .30am. This location is approx. 15 minutes walk to the
Hillsborough ground.

Even as I took up my position Liverpool fans had started to trickle towards
the stadium. This trickle increased in volume as time went by. At approx.
1.55pm the (football special carrying Liverpool supporters arrived at Wadsley
Bridge station. From where I was standing I could see the alighting fans being
lined up in an orderly fashion at the entrance to the station by mounted and
foot patrol officers alike. These fans were then led in an orderly procession
towards the ground by accompanying officers. In my estimation the whole
operation from the fans disembarking from the train to being organised at the
station entrance took 10 minutes.

By the time the football special had arrived Penistone Road North was a sea of
fans heading towards the ground albeit large numbers of supporters were seen
walking in the opposite direction against the general flow of fans. I was
approached on numerous occasions by these fans who were asking for directions
to the nearest pub. Quite a number of these requests \ere made for a specific
pub called ’The Fox* which to my knowledge was somewhere beyond Wadsley Bridge
Station. Also walking against the general flow of fans were youths seeking
tickets. On several occasions I overheard the words: "Any spares." or "Any
spares lads."

As time progressed there was a noticable increase in fans carrying and drinking
alcohol in various forms as they made their way to the ground. Some were
seated at the roadside on walls etc. endulging in drink. There was also a
noticable increase in youths being rowdy although none could be seen causing
traible form where I was standing. The surrounding walls and other level
surfaces va*e being used as dumping off places for empty or discarded beer cans
etc.

From approx 2.30pm onwards there was an air of urgency as fans quickened their
step towards the ground, some were jogging. All the time coaches were pulling
up in Penistone Road North beyond Wadsly Bridge and fans coSild be seen alight­
ing as late as 2.i*5pm»

It was around this time that I was ordered to proceed towards the ground. Our
serial were to take up a position in Catch Bar Lane area at kick-off time.
From my point near Wadsey Bridge I walked down Pen&stone Road North to the
•Gat#' public house where my progress was halted by suppoters arguing and
squaring up to each other in the pub yard. Other officers already at the
scene prevented any further trouble by dispersing the arguing factions. It
was whilst I was in the vicinity of this pub thefc officers including myself
were commenting at the myriad of alcohol containers left strewn around on the
ground and walls etc.
                              SHEET 2


After leaving 'The Gate' pub myself and other members of my serial
continued towards the ground. For reasons unknown to me we were being
hastened towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground. From Penistone
Road North I made my way irfc Leppings Lane and up to the ground entrance
arriving there shotly after 3pm» On my arrival there were numerous fans
milling around in the road and in the turnstyle area of the west stand.
Sorae fans appeared to attempting to gain access to the ground but their
progress was halted by Police Officres who were turningthem back* I was
then ordered to form a cordon along with others officers along the turn­
style entrances to the west stand. Momments after forming the cordon
we were ordered into the ground. Once inside the perimeter fence just
beyond the turnstyle entrances it started to become apparent what was
taking place inside the ground.

I was first met by supporters in a distressed condition emerging from
the tunnel situated below the west stand. Some fans were in a collasped
condition and others were being assisted from the tunnel enteance. One
such fan I could see was laid on the grand in the tunnel mouth, he was being
attended to by two fellow supporters. Fearing he would be trampled on
myself and the two helpers dragged hi* clear to relative safety where he
was placed in the recovery position. Leaving that scene I ran into the
tunnel and emerged at the other end into Bo. 3 enclosure where I was met
with a barage of verbal abuse aimed at myself and other officers who were
busying themselves with the injured.

Once fully inside the ground I could see the full scale of the events taking
place. Pitch was awash with Police and fans alike attending to injured
parties laying on the playing surface. Directly in front of me inside No.
3 enclosure were people laying on the terraces. Police officers and fans
H i k e were working frantically passing apparently lifeless bodies through
through a gate on to the playing area. Attempts were being made to force
back the blue mesh fencing surrounding the enclosure to make the recovery
of bodies easier. It was as the dead and injured were being moved onto the
 r>itch that fans in the seating area of the west stand appeared to be
spitting on officers and fans alike working below. Also in No.3 Enclosure
I could see that a crush barrier had been twisted and flattened to the
ground. There were items of clothing and other personal effects stSJewn
everywhere and I could see blood smeared along the length of the damaged
barrier.

Because most of the dead and injured had been removed from the enclosure
I made my way on to the pitch. It was there that I was met with a couple
of supporters carrying a display hoarding. This hoarding was used immed­
iately to transport a apparently lifeless man from the pitch to a location
behind the North stand adjoining the gymnasium. This unknown person was
placed on the ground and myself and a supporter commenced giving mouth to
mouth and heart massage. This proved unsucessful as indicated by a Doctor
who examined the body. I arranged for this person to be taken into the
makeshift mortuary (gymnasium).

Has other lifeless bodies were brought to the rear of the North stand I
assisted in their removal to the gymnasium. It was whilst I was under­
taking this task that myself and other officers had to manouever around
a stream of liquid pouring from the rear of the stand above our heads.
This liquid had the appearanee of urine which was running down the sheeting
which made up the rear of the stand wall. Lined up behind this wall were
numerous Liverpool fans who were observing the events taking place below*

It was whilst I was outside the gymnasium I was approaced by a man
who announced himself as a medic. He asked if I could assist him
with the injured inside the gym. He hande me various bits of
medical equipment and once inside the gym he performed first aid
on the injured. I was also required to transport the injured by
stretcher to awaiting ambulances.

It wasn't until the last of the injured had been removed from the
gymnasium that I was ordered to the North stand for a de-briefing.
At the conclusion of the de-briefing I made my way to Claywheels
Lane traffic garage and then I was transported home.

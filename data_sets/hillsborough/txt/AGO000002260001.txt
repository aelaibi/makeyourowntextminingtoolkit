ATTORNEY GENERAL

Please see the letter from the Home Secretary dated the 20th
August setting out proposals to implement recommendations of
Lord Justice Taylor in the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
Report for the creation of four new criminal offences.


Beneath this note is a letter from the Head of Policy and
Communications Group at CPS Headquarters indicating their
general support.   It is accompanied by a more detailed letter
sent at official level commenting on the proposals.     You need
not weary yourself with the longer letter.


The proposals seem justified although some care would be
needed to ensure that the provisions relating to ticket
touting - which are justified on public order grounds - do not
become extended in the Parliamentary passage of the
legislation to embrace other forms of perceived profiteering.
Finding a suitable demarkation line would be difficult.     The
proposals are about public order and football and not the
iniquities of the street trader!


You will see that I have put down a marker to the effect that
we do not wish to see an Attorney General's consent provision
in relation to the racial chanting provision.    If you have any
difficulty with that perhaps we might discuss.


Finally, the Home Secretary's letter has an inconsistency in
seeking agreement to legislate at the earliest opportunity but
suggesting that we should not take advantage of the
willingness of a private member to pilot this through
Parliament because the Government ought to take the,credit.        I
have made the point that there could be disadvantage in
appearing not to take the first available opportunity.

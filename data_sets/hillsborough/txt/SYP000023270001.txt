Dear Mervyn,

Just a note to thank you and your colleagues for giving me the time
on the 9th May and showing me all the tremendous amount of work
which is being done at Nechels.

I was very impressed indeed and am very much obliged for the great
effort which you are putting into this inquiry.

I would also like to take the opportunity of thanking you for lunch
and for arranging transport for me, it was very much appreciated.

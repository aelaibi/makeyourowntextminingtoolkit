                  at the Hi 11 sb V rough grounds Sheffield, England.                            I am a L ivj^^'pcTcTl

                  supp-drter-       I did not go in an organised party.                          I had arranged to go

                  with two other boys.              We had all got our tickets from a friend in

                  Liverpool who organised the tickets and a coach then-posted them over
    \}J & t
                  to us.      I paid L b .flQ      (six pounds)         for my ticket and it was for the

                   eppings Lane sjfend of the ground.                      The two other boys were



                                                                        We travelled by ferry across on
                  i.
                  F r iday n igj r\, from Belfast to Liverpool and then by a coach from the

                  Amber Lir/e coach firm down to Sheffield.                          The coach let us off at

              ' ^ approJivi/iately a mile from the ground.                      We did not stop any where while
              &
         V        travelling down in the coach.                    We were not delayed in any way

and arrived in Sheffield at about 12.3Q pm.                I did not see anybody

drinking while on the coach or as we made our way to the ground.                     We

were made to park near to a Brewery by police.                  We were not escorted

to Jfc'he football ground by Police.          On the way to the ground I did not

 ee any fighting or drunkeness.

At about      12.45 prn we reXched the ground there didn't seem to be any

rush on the turnstiles but there was a steady traffic going through

 hem.     The re was a police       pr e><ence at these turnstiles but they d i d n ’t

seem to be giving any directions to anybody/6r assisting the crowd.

There were quite a number of stewards nyOling about and we had to ask

one of these for directions to our places.               After that we had no
                        /
difficulty in / i nding our entry point and entered the ground.                 We

entered through a turnst ile .          I did not see any gates open nor did I

see A .ny g a t e s    be i ng opened at any time.    Eve rybody was using the

     rnstileV.        As we passed through we handed over our tickets.          After

gairug entry we did not see any signs directing us to our jxTsition but

we had no difficulty in finding this.                  made our wa>^by a tunnel to

Pen 3.      There w a s n *t very may pe opU r using the tmcmel at the time and

there were no police or stewajyfljjj^contro 11 ing it.            1 he crowd that was

present was good h u m o u r e ^ a n / t h e re was no f ight i ng in other

incidents.        I did not yfee anybody drinking        in the actual ground at any

time.     At about 2.Q0 pm we moved out of pen 3 and went               into a balconey

above Pen 4.           Ws^got down close to the front of this balcony and could

see t t\e peo pljf be low in pens 3 and 4.           I did n#t see any

barriei\ brgfek in Pen 3 as we weren't clos^/to it.                At about 3 pm as

the match started there was a crowd crysh from behind m e .                 I ’ve been

to matches and have had this experience before but I've never felt

it     as bad,        We were packed in l^Tke sardines.         I was standing with my

two mates,                                                  ■    As the crowd surged

we got se pa rated and I was pushed forward.              I shouted back, to them

                              I could see down into Pens 3 and 4 and at about 3.04 pm I saw a

                    ^crowd surge down in these pens.            This surge did not effect us.           I

                    don't know what caused this surge and I wasn't                 injured in any way by

                    it.       People down in these    pens started to scream and cry.           These
          r iF      people were very lightly packed and I            could see the>f      faces.   I    could

                    see that they were         panicing    and shouting for        Ip.   I knew something

                N   was wrong.       I saw one fellow climb the f»nce an d I saw a police man

                    push him off.          He fell back among thj/’sea of heads and disappeared,

                J&^The     police
                           pc     were more      toncerned iy    keeping people off the pitch a nd

feMlL .nf&ey                       t seem to understaMI what was happening.              When they did

                          1 is6 this they began to lift fans over the fences a nd to rip the

                    fence down in places to get the fans o u t .             As the crowd thinned out
 foP
                    onto the pitch 1 saw bodies            lying on the terraces.        I did not witness

                    any deaths nor was I in a position to assist anybody injured.                      We left

                    the ground at about 4 pm of            our own accord.    I    didn't witness anything

                    that I would consider to be            a criminal offence by any member of the
 (P C *
                    crowd.       After the incident everything seemed slow and everyone seemed

                    to be looking for advice from somebody else.                  The Police weren't ready

                    for what happened.          I suppose nobody was but it wasn't until the fire

                    service arrived and took control that things picked up speed and

                    people were      looked after.        Last year I attended a football match

                    between Liverpool and Forest at the ^sarne ground in the same semi final

                    stage of the FA Cup.          It went off smoothly because the Police had

                    things      in hand.     There was enough of them and they policed the             crowd

                    well.       This year there seemed to be no organisation inside or outside

                    the ground.

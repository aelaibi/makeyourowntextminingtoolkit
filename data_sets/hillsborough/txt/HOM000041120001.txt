          responsible to Police Sergeant 1561 Reynolds.         Briefed at

          Hillsborough ground and commenced duty on road junctions on Leppings

          From about midday onwards there was a steady flow of supporters

          passing the road junctions where I was on duty with other officers.

ground.   The only information we got was gleaned from the

intermittent 'tannoy* messages from the loudspeaker system.

For the next one and a half hours the trickle of people leaving the

ground via the Leppings Lane exits became a flood, some were drunk, a

large amount dazed and in shock, some were 'walking wounded' who

refused further assistance. Those of us outside the ground did not

find out for at least half an hour what, if anything had happened on

the terraces.                                                 S'
As it became obvious what had happened those of us attempting to keep

some sort of order outside the ground, and keep the way clear for

emergency vehicles, were subjected to a non stop torrent of vehement

verbal abuse and threats from a good proportion of the crowd by now

leaving the ground, this was a frightening situation as we were by

now vastly outnumbered by a potentially hostile mass of distressed

people. We were deflecting the insults, threats and abuse, still

being unaware of what exactly had happened.   Radio messages being

passed were more difficult to understand all through this time.

Eventually the crowd cleared, we were de-briefed in the ground.     Went

for a meal at Claywheels Lane, were transported back to Doncaster.     I

went off duty at Stainforth at 8.15 p.m. that evening.

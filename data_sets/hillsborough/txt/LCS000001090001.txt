NOTE FOR INTER AGENCY MEETING - FRIDAY, 9.6.89



1.        Bill Utting, Chief Inspector , S.S.I.

          Bill Utting has agreed to visit Merseyside on 11th or 12th July to
          see first hand the work which is being undertaken.   He would like to
          spend as much time as possible in discussion with front-line staff and
          reduce the amount of time spent travelling around the region.

          Would the Group endorse the invitation and consider draft programme
          to be finalized with S.S.I.

          Liverpool is prepared to host and co-ordinate the visit and I would like
          either at the end of the day or during lunch-time to arrange for a brief
          meeting with Directors.

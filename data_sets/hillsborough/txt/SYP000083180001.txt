                   two     daughters.           F rom      the age     of six        I have      been a s u p porter            of

                   On the 15 Apri1 1989 <150489) together with my friend,                                                             _______

                   We trave 11 ed together                  from Bristol            by t r a i ty\yan tSs^krliary B r i t i s h R a i 1

                   We .didn't        have tickets            for the match,;                     fitention was          to buy ticket,s

                   f r orn touts.

                   We st a y e d outside             the    s ta t i o n for a while            just    to see       if a n y    other

 supporters          came along who may have had spare                   tickets.         We    stayed the

 for about          half an hour.

 P o l i c e started a r ri vi ng at         the Station,        some    football        specia ls were

 arriving,          so we d ec i d e d to move awa y from           the S t a t i o n and take a tax

 to the ground.

 We found a taxi and the                 j ou r n e y to the g r o u n d took about            twenty

 m i nutes.

 On the way we a sked             the    driver    if he knew where           the      best    place    to ge

 tickets w ould be.             He    r e c koned the N o t t i n g h a m Forest        end w o u l d be th

 best     bet.       He took us straight           there.

 1't was about m i d d a y i s h whe n we got to the ground                    (I never w ear a

 watch).

 I o b t a in ed a ticket         for    the S pion Kop en#,
                                                                 /   paying a tout £.20 for                  it.

 None    of the touts at             the Notts     Forest      emd h^S/T any tickets           for     the

 Liv e r p o o l    end.                 bought a tickfet/as/we11 & 6 r                £20.

 We    then went         to the L e p p i ng s Lane     end an d spoke       to the touts            there.

 T h ey had Leppings L ane              tickets.      T hey w a n t e d £35 for them but               they

 w o u l d n ’t take the S p i o n H op tickets            in part      exchange,        ie the ticket

 plus £15.           The    touts were     saying     t h e y ’d take    the S pion Kop          tickets

 plus £ 2 5 . 0 0 each - that was             too muc h to       pay — £45       in total.

 So we went          back down to the S pi on Hop end.                                 found a tout who

 had a L e p pings Lane           end ticket       for £35.       He a c c e p t e d    off                   he

^S p i on Kop ticket          plus £15.        I thought £35 was          too much to           pay.

 The    touts,       there were about         twelve      in all,    had so many tickets                I

 thought       it was       unfair.

 We went       off for some          fish and     chips    buying    them from a chip shop                   in

 Leppings          Ln.     We then made      our way back        to the ground and a r o u n d to

 the S p i on Kop end.            This    time we were a p p r o a c h e d     by the same           g roup o

It was about                                        1330 hours                                                   to     1400 hours and by now time was                         getting         on

In all            this                        time                        I saw Police about who were directing                                                          people about at

the L e p p i n g s Ln end.                                                                          The y were also                       cordoning      some of the Streets

off and                 redi re ct i rig traffic.

I notic ed quite a few                                                                                people                   in jOhe Street and everyone was                    in good

humour

T here were a few drun k e n                                                                                      t\ar| \ atrdXit but          there was        no trouble.            I saw a

Once       w e ’d got our                                                      tickets                                we hung about            for a while            on the    bridge         in

L ep p i n g s Ln just across                                                                                    from the turnstiles.

the     turnstile without                                                                            too much d i f f i c u l t y though there were                               quite a

few     people about.

I became aware                                                that a lot                                              of       people    s u d d e n l y seemed       ts^arrive      behind

It was           our                    intention to go behind                                                                       the goalmouth.             Right     in front        of u •

I made my way to the tunrv^lffiand into it.

There were                             no Police                                               or St/wau»dfs at the                            entrance       to the tunnel.

We     had free m o v ement                                                                    along                   the       tunnel.       There were         no o b s t r u c t i o n s    of

 an y kind.         In fact     one or two       fans were        just     larking about           in the

 tunnel.        It was     v ir tu a l l y empty,

 I did not witn e s s any d i s order              or a n y t h i n g    else    of note b e t w e e n

 entering       the ground and going             through the            tunnel.        I did not see

 an yb od y drinking          any alcohol       in the ground.             In fact       I don't     recall

 seeing an y fans          drinking      outside       the ground either

  Je/went      into the       pen behind       the g o a l m o u t h as we went          out of the

 tunnel.        There was a barrier and                I had to go to the               left hand side of

 it.     As    I did so       I trip p e d and had to get               back    up.     I carried     on down

 the   terrace.         It was    fair ly      crowded at        this time        but    no more     than

 y o u ’d expect,       you    could get       by people.

standing        up against       people     but you      could still            move your arms about

People        could for       instance    get    their        cigarettes        out and    light    up.

P eople were singing             and e v e ryone was           happy.

 I was      under   the    i m pression     that    the Pen               full and that        no more

 people w o u l d      come    into the Pen.             /)

The    players      came      out onto    the                 yfTherg      was a sudden s u r g e from

 behind.        I was     crushed    up agai nst M m e          barrier.         Pe o p l e were   shouting

 for ever yone         to get    back and       push back.         There        was a slight       ease     in

 the   pressure and           I was able       to duck        down and go under the            barrier.

 I had to       push up against          the    legs    of     people     in front       to stand     up.        I

forced rny way up and stood wit h my back against                                the    barrier.      It was

 very tight.

My front was           right    up aga inst      the    backs     of the        people    in front.

P eo pl e     behind me,       even wit h the barrier             in between,           were   pushed up

agai n s t me.         I d o n ’t know where                      was at        this    stage - I think              h

was    off     to my    right.      My arms      were    pinned down.             After a w hile         they

went      numb.       The    pressure was           intense.        I was       trying       to    push my        arms

out and my neck              out just        to make       space to get air.                 E v e ryone       was

sc r earning and s houting.

I was aware           of people        coming       thyf/oughyfJeneath me and through my                             legs.

The P o l i c e m a n up above was              using      his   radio.          I got       the   impre s s i o n       he

was      saying      that    there was        nothing       he   could do

standing           on my feet     or    it was       people      beldw      pulling at me.                 My jeans

were      being      pulled.      I could not             look down.            It was       too tight.           My jean

were a c t u a 11y r i pped by this                 pu11ing.

My body was           just sort        of    being    swayed wit h          the m o v ement         of the           crowd

s truggli ng         for air.        Some were        going        blue in the face.                I     cannot      say

th o u g h that       I a c t u a l l y saw anyone          die.

People        were also       s t a nding     on my head as           they       came from behind                to     climb

out      of the Pen over          the       perimeter       fence.

       people      back      in who were        tryi/fg par climb o u t .         Some were        s t a nding aboul

\W    doing     nothing.

      E v e n t u a l l y , I was    carried along          towards      the gate       to the     left of the

      goal    looked at from behind.                    I was    pulled j^p and o u ^

       I s u f f e r ed bruising        to my feet and           p a i n / / m y ^ ^Kest    frorn the      constant

       pressure.            I did not     receive any medical V ^ s a t m e n t            though    it was

      offered.

       I w a l ke d    behind the goalmouth.                I was      crying,    a c o m b i n a t i o n of    relief,

      anger,       shock and so on.

      I recall         walking      out onto      the    penalty area.           Three     officers       were

      amon g s t      others,    walk i n g     down the      pitch towards        the goalmouth.               I began

      sweari n g at t h e m , w o n d e r i n g w h e r e t h e y ’d been.             W e ’d ha d t o wa i t, s o

      long for assistance,                they d i d n ’t seem to do a n y t h i n g          for such a long

      time.

      I collapsed           into them.          They were       two male O f f i c e r s and a female

      Officer.          They took me           up to the other         end of the ground.                I sat       down

      a g a i n s t a wall      right     by the Forest          fans and       brought me a drink              of

      water.          Forest    fans    close     to me    could see       how upset        I was.       T h e y a sked

      me what         was   going   on.        I told them       people were       dying      down there.             They

      clearly d i d n ’t know what was                  going    on.

     * 1 began to wonder where                             was.        I a s k e d one of the three

      Officers,         the one who        st a y e d wit h me - the           other    two went     s t r aight

      back    down the         pitch,     if    I could go back down the                other     end.     He    said

      that    I could so I b egan to walk                  back down the          side of the        pitch       in

      front     of the North Stand.                 There were         press    photogoa-ohers       coming          right

      up to me taking            photog r a p h s    of me.       T hey were we/rijKg tye arangfe bibs.

          I w a lk ed       through side Streets.                  I was     upset and       the    roads were         fairly

          quiet.           People were        looking at me.               A couple     of Police       officers        came

          up to me and asked me                   if     I was    okay.      The y a s k e d me what was         going        on

          inside       the ground.            I told them.            I think       they alre a d y knew s o m e t h i n g

          was    h a ppening        but they d i d n ’t know exac t l y what.

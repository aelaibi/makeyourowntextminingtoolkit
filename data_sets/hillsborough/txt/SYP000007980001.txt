After       this       briefing             Inspector          MEEK     collected             my     serial         a nd PS C L O K E S

serial       together               and     explained          that     our       duty was           Coach         reception              for

the    Liverpool               fans.         The    coaches         were      to       be    parked       in C l a y w h e e l s           Ln

and    when       this         wa s    filled       the     remainder             would       be     parked         on H a l i f a x        Rd

and    Penistone               Rd.     It w a s     to    be     explained             to    the     fans      before          they        left

the    coach          that      they w ou ld          not      be a 1 1 ow        to    take       bottle          can    or a n y t h i n g

similar           to a n        offensive           weapon          into     the       ground and             that       many        of    them

would       be    searched             as    they     left      the     Coaches.

Packed       l u n c h ’s w e r e           then    collected           and       eaten.           During          this       time        Chief

Super intendent                 DUCKLENFIE US walked                    amongst             the    assembled             Constables.

He    spoke       to me         and        appeared       to     be w o r r i e d       that       many       of    the       younger

Constables             did      not        have    experience           of m a j o r         Public       disorder.

At    11.15am           (1115)         I took       my    serial        on    to       Claywheels             Ln and          soon after

this    the       first         Coach        pulled       in.

This    Coach          from         the     sign    on    the       back     originated              from MAGULLAND                   was

empty       when        it     came        into    C l a y w h e e 1s Ln.          It w a s        turned          around          and

parked       .in s u c h a            position        that       it w o u l d      be       the    first       Coach          to     1eave       at

the    end       of    the      g a me.       The     second Coach                then       carne    in,      1 believe              this

was    No    4 Coach            of     the    Liverpool             Supporters              club.        I caused             the     Coach

to    stop       as    it      entered        C l a y w h e e 1s Ln.         X then          spoke       to    the       fans        re

bottles          cans        and weapons.                They were           then       allowed          to    disembark              and       as

they    did       so     three         Constables           searched          them.         No     complaint             could        be    made

re    the    behaviour                of    these     fans.

The    Coach          then      proceeded           down       C l a y w h e e 1s L n        in o r d e r      that       it       could

turn    around           and        take     up    its    position           as    the       second Coach                to    leave.            I

then    received a Radio                      message          to   the      effect          that    rny s e r i a l          wa s    to    take

up a    position               on H a l i f a x     Rd    near       to G a l l a g h e r s        Factory.              We    therefore

walked       to       t h at    position           and    as     I did       so    I saw          that    the^JA

                                                                                                                                           S702A

the    hill        and       over     the       road      to    it.

A Coach          had     been       parked        on H a l i f a x         Rd a     considerable                  distance             further

along       Halifax           Rd    and     this       was      to    be    the    first          Coach          to    leave.

Inspector             MEEK     and       P S C L O K E 's s e r i a l         were      near       to       this       Coach          and       I

positioned              my    serial        in    pairs         about       50    yards       between             each       pair          around

the    bend        in H a l i f a x        Rd    whi ch        is    just     above         the    White          Horse          Public

up    to    the       top     of    the     hill       before         a l 1 owi ng F a n s         to       disembark.At                   t h at

time       no C o a c h e s        were     being         unloaded          further          up    the pirTl a n d

yet    from        12    noon       onwards           there         was    a s t e a d y ^Jffeam of                   fans       walking

down       the     h i ll.         Many     of    these         were       c a r ryj^ng      cans       and       bottles             of

No    complaint              could       be m a d e       about       the     behaviour            of       these       fans.              At

about       2.00pm           (1400)        I received               a Radio       message          to       assist          two m o u n t e d

Officers           in K i l n e r        Row     n e ar    to       the    Cornet W a r e h o u s e .             At    that          time          I

saw    near        to    the       first        Coach      and       over     half      a mile          from          the    location                   I

was    required              at.    My     serial         were       spread       out       and    I was          not       in    radio

contact          with any           of     them.          I therefore             collected             a    group          of P C ' s           wh o

were       standing           nearby.            These         included.

                      dark       brown medium                 length       hair.           This    man    was       the

                      owner/driver                of    the        vehicle.

Also    present       was       a g i rl     who       wa s    either       related          to    or    the    girlfriend              of

                      with       long       dark       brown        hair.

PC    Smith searched             the    vehicle           and       removed       from a          compartment             in    the

d ri v e r s side    d o or     of    the    vehicle           a number          of    p a irs     of    scissors.                The

owner'driver          of       the    vehicle          claimed        that       these       were       what    he    used        in

his    business.

Men    numbers       1 & 2 were             anxious           to    take    any       ill    feeling          out    of     the

situation       and       insisted          on    shaking           hands       with       the    Officers          present.            I

had    not   seen what           had    caused          me     to    be    sent       for    and    whilst          the m e n      from

the    van   had     been       drinking          I did        not    consider             them    to    be    drunk        and    di d

not    see   them     commit          any    offences.

The    matter       was    resolved and                I then        walked       back       towards          Halifax          Rd wi t h

the    Officers       I had          taken       w i t h me.         As    I did       so    I spoke          with Special

Constable                                 who      was      leaving          th e    Supermarket              in his       white         Volvo

Estate         car.         He    pointed          ou t     the       large       numbers        of fans          who    w e r e sitting

around         on    the       grass      areas        around          the    Supf-rrnar ket           drinking          cans

of     b e er.       I saw        between          5j3- a n d     1     0     0      on    the    corner          of H a l i f a x       Rd

and     Kilner           Row.                     /

1 then walked                  back     up H a l i f a x        R d a n d as         I neared          the       White     Horse         there

was     an am bulance              call       on      the R a d i o         requesting           Officers           to a t t e n d       as    a

youth         had    sat       on a     broken         gl a s s .

As     there        were       other      serials           detailed          to     look       after       that       side    of    the

road      I did          not     attend.

As     I neared Gallaghers                        I saw      that C o a c h e s           were    coming          down Halifax                Rd

at     a steady           rate     but       as    yet      they       were       not     being       sent       up H a l i f a x    Rd       to

park.          Despite           this     there        was      a steady            stream       of    fans       walking       down          the

hill      many       of w h o m        had    beer        cans        with    them.

At     around        2.30pm        (1430)          the      Coaches          began        to    park     at      the    top    of

Halifax            Rd.      The    fans       from        these        Coaches          were     well       behaved.

I saw         one    group        of    perhaps           20 who        after        walking          down       the    hill    towards

th e    ground           came     walking          b ac k    up.        I asked           the    reason          for    this    and       was

told      that       they        had    been       told      the       tickets          would     be     given         them    ne a r     to

the     ground           but     they     had      since        been        told     that       the    tickets          would       be

given         to    t h e m at     the       Coach.          These          fans     were       upset       at    the    time       they

were      losing          and     the     extra        walking          which        poor       organisation             had    caused.

The     rate        at    which        the    Coaches           arrived           increased           rapidly          and many          of

them      were       empty when              they      arrived.

Officers            were       sent     to    the      area       of W a l k 1ey B r i d g e           to     prevent         Coaches

unloading            at     that       area.

As     th e    line       of C o a c h e s        Lengthened            their        distance          from       the    ground

shortened.               By a r o u n d      2.50pm         (1450)          the     number       of    coaches          had

slackened            and       I was      standing           between Claywheels                       L n a n d W a 1 k 3.ey B r i d g e .

At     this        location        there          is a P u b l i c          House       called        the     Ga te.

To    reach          the     -front         d oo r     of      t h is     it     is    necessary             to    go     down a           flight              of

stairs.              At    the        top    of      these          stairs          I saw       the       tall     man       1 had         spoken              to

on K i l n e r        Row       (1)        Near      the       front       door        of    th e      Public        House         was         the     man

with     the         red     shirt          (3)      He     was      being          spoken        to      by PC      Rod HIGHTON                  w ho

is    stationed              at       Hexborough.                   From       this       manner          I assumed           t h at       th e       was

warning          hi m      re     his       behaviour               rather          than     preparing             to a r r e s t          him.            I

said     to      the       tall        man     (1)        “A r e     you       capable          of     1ooking          after         your        mate"

He    replied             "Yes"         1 said            " I ’ ll        take        y o u to       him     get     him a w a y           from        here

or    h e ’s g o i n g          to      end       up      in t r o u b l e "           The tall           man then           led hirrm a way.

I    learnt          that       there        had       been         some       trouble          inside         "The G a t e "           a group                of

•fans    had         been       singing           which         had a n n oy ed             one      of     the    regulars             and       a

fight       had       taken           place.

The     front         doors           of    "The       Gate"             we/'e      closed.            On m a t c h       days        this        often

happened             and     selected             customers               are       let     in t h r o u g h       th e      b ac k     doo r .            I

began       to       receive           Radio         messages             to     the      effect          that     there          was      a    crowd

In    view       of       this        I gathered               my    serial           together            a n d we      stood         on       the

corner          of C l a y w h e e l s / L n           rather            than       going       in for         meal.          I was            then
                                /
joined          by    Inspyfecto/ M E E K                 and       I explained              what         I had      he a rd .          I said

that     I w o u l d jfeeej/ m y               serial           there          in     case      we     were       required.                There

then     followed               several           Radio         messages              about       opening          a gate          and         someone

said     that         th e      kick        off      would          be    put       back     to 3 . 1 5 p m        ( 1 515).            I then

heard       a    great          roar        from       the       crowd and             assumed            that     the       players            ha d

come     on      to       the     pit c h .          Soon       after          this       a^Xadio           message          was      received

•from all            Serials            to    get         to    the       grpum

The     serial            and     I     then         set       off       for    the L e p p i n g s       Ln   Gate          at    a half             march

half     trot         pace.

On    arrival             I saw a           l i ne     some         30    to 4 0 y a r d s           long      of C o n s t a b l e s           forming

an    arc       around          the L e p p i n g s            Ln Gates             with     about          100 f a n s       between             them

and     the      g at e s .           Someone          shouted            for       the     line       to    be    completed and                      as

there        was    a gap          of   about           5 yards           in t he          line       near       to w h e r e         the    shop         is

I p o s i t i o n e d my           serial          in    this        gap.         I        was    then          informed          that       an

Ambulance           was       expected            and     that        we     needed          the       fans          clearing           from       the

gates.         I therefore                moved          my    serial         into          the       crowd and             began         clearing

them     through          the       gap      in the           line        created.               As    I was          doing       this       I saw

The    fans        moved        out     far        easier        than        I had          expected             except          fo r    two       wh o

ducked        into       the       shop.           On    there        coming           out       they       were       also       removed.                An

ambulance           then arrived                  along        with        several           Serial             of C o n s t a b l e s .           I

went     thr o u g h      the       gate       i          the        ground           at    the       same       time       as    the

Ambulance           and       w a 1k e d / l o w a r d s       the        centre           tunnel.              As    I neared           the m o u t h

of    the     tunnel          I /ww       that          there        were     about          6    persons             ly ing      on     the       floor

in f r o n t       of Jine         tunnel          with       other        persons           desperately                giving           them

first        aid.        The       farthest             away         of    these           person would                be    no m o r e        than          3

yards        from       the     tunnel         and       the     nearest              less       than        two      yards       from       the

tunnel.            As    I walked            towards            it    there           was    a    surge          of    persons           from          the

centre        of    the       tunnel         and        I saw a group                  of m e n        running          from          the    tunnel

carrying           an    injured          or       dead       pe r s o n .            They       narrowly avoided                       running           on

to    th e    persons          who      were        lying        in f r o n t          of    the       tunnel          I radioed             t hat

more     Ambulances                were      needed           and     then        ran       to    the        tunnel.             I positioned

myself        at    the       centre         of     the       tunnel         to       prevent          t h o s e jx?r<            s     l y in g

As    t he    crowds          of    persons             coming        through              the    tunnel             eased       I went        down

the    tunnel           and     into      the       enclosure              which           was    to m y         left.           There       was

room     to m o v e       about         in     this       enclosure.                   I saw          no    dead       persons           in this

enclosure           though          there         were        several         people             sat       on    the    floor           looking

extremely           pale       and      ill.            I spoke           to m a n y        of    these.              Other       f a ns     were

not    arrest        the       Nottingham                Fans        as     they       had     caused          it all.           At    one

point        he    appeared             to     be    preparing              to    charge          along        the    pitch       towards

the    Nottingham              fans.            Myself          and        a Liverpool             fan      managed         to    calm       hi m

and    I then        went          to    the        front       of     that       enclosure.                I saw      that       a section

of    the     fance       had       been        damaged.,,             A section             of    the      wire      mesh       had    been

pulled        away       from       the        bot>dm          leaving           a gap       through           which       entry       to the

pitch        could       be    gaimra.               With       the        assistance             of     two    Li ve r poo 1 f a n s I

l i f t ed    this       wi r ^ n i g h e r to m a k e                 entry       to a n d        from        the    pitch       easier.              A

fan    on     the^tfther            side        had a          length        of    green          coloured           thin       rope.        He

threw        part    of       the       rope        over       the     fence       and       with        the    assistance             of

others        I tied          the       wire        as    high        in the       air       as    I could.

From    the        enclosure             I could           see       that        there       appeared           to    be    fans       standing

and    shouting           on       the       pitch        to    a     point       midway          between        the       penalty          area

and    the        half    way       line.

I went        through          the       hole            in         th e   fence         and      on   to      the    pitch. I t h e n

found        that    the       crowd           on        the    pitch         were       not       all      standing         as I had

thought.            Amongst             them        were       several           collapsed             persons.            Some       were

lying        with    their              coats        over       their        faces        apparently             d e ad.         At    others

there        were    person             frantically                 giving        cardiac          massage           whilst       others

gave    th e       kiss       of    life.            In one           case       the     cardiac         massage           on a d e a d

youth        was    almost          frenzied             as     a    group        of     fans      strove        desperately                to

find    a spark           of       life.            As    I knelt           to    check        th e    condition            of    one m a n

who    was        laid    unattended                 I was          joined        by a       casually           dressed          young       man

who    i n f o r m e d me          that        he        was    a Doctor.                 I said         "I    think       this       ones       dead

y o u ’d be        better          looking               for    some         live      ones"           He      then made a quick

check        of    the    body and              confirmed              t ha t     th e    man was           dead.          He    then       went

anything          I could          do    to a s s i s t .           Several          of    th e    fans        were      extremely

emotional          shouting             obscenities             and       threats          towards           the     Nottingham

Forest       Fans       in S p i o n       Kop.Other            fans        were      walking           around          in a d a z e d a n d

shocked         condition           looking          for       some       way     in w h i c h         they     could         assist.              As

Inspector          walked          by    shouting          for       the       pitch       to     be    cleared          and       I

commenced          asking          fans       to    leave       the       pitch       so    that        we     could       see         the

number       of    casualties              on      the    pi t c h .        Some      left        but     others         were

reluctant          pointing             out     that      they were             looking           for     relatives.

I then       saw       a group          of m e n     carrying             the     body      of a d e a d           or    injured

person       from       the    general             direction           of      the    South Stand West                     Stand         corner

diagonally             across       the       pitch       towards           the      North        Stand        and      gymnasium.

The    Spion       Kop     fans         c h e e r e d as       the     group         neared        them.           Other       groups

began      to     follow       the       actions          of    this        group         often        using       hoarding             boards

as    stretchers.              I decided             that       the       movement          of     the       injured          from       the

pitch was          the     greatest             assistance             I could            give.

At    1540hrs          that    date        I saw         a^jfoup          of    three       men around               the      body       of a

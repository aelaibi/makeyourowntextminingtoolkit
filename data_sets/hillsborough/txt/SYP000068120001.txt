Apart     from        the    safety         requirements                 demanded             by    c l ubs      they      should          be

reminded         of    their       responsibility                   of    regular             good       house       keeping          and

maintenance            of    its      property.              Some        individual                spectators           have         failed

to a c c e p t    their          responsibility                for       the       correct          standard          of       behaviour

upon    which         the    organising            of a n y         event          is    dependant.

I will       now s p e a k       about        fencing.              Fences          were       the       direct       result          of

irresponsible               behaviour            and    there        removal             can       only       follow       a    period          of

correct       behaviour.                Removal         of     fences          could          result          in d i f f i c u l t i e s        on

the    field      of    play       by    invading            spectators.

I also       produce         for      the     information                of L o r d       Justice             Taylors          enquiry          a

copy    of    the      1979 F o o t b a l l        Grounds           Improvement                   Trust       deed w h i c h         w as

the    beg i nni ng         of   the     trust.             Th e    t rust         previously             operated             under       an

earlier       trust         deed      granted          in    1975.

I have       read      o ver     my     statement            and     I would            wish        to    re~iterate             one

point.        I do      not      wish       to    be    pretentious                 but       my    observations                are    based

on    personal         and       practical         experience                 as    a F.I.F.A.                official          at    the

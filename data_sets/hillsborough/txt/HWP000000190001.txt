RESOLUTION - HILLSBOROUGH WORKING PARTY 8TH AUGUST 1989


The Liverpool City Council Hillsborough Working Party welcomes
the Interim Report of the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster and its clear statement that no blame for the tragedy
can be attached to the supporters of Liverpool

We recognise the importance of the recommendations contained in
chapter 24 of the Interim Report which are described as the
"minimum necessary" to ensure that existing football grounds can
be safely used.      In order to ensure that the supporters of
Everton and Liverpool can feel confident that Gog^son^arid A^fj^ld.
remain and w m c g r i t ^ / t a Jje safe for spectators
Party s h a l l ^ p ^ ^ P o n F r M a y 11th:August, 1989 at 10.00 a.m.
to receive repbrtsrrom appropriate Chief Officers concerning
the implementation of Lord Chief Justice Taylors 43 specific
recommendations.

We believe the Interim Report highlights a series of appalling
errors by the South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday
         Club, Sheffield City Council and the Football Association.
We cair*i*peiPthe Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, the Chief
Executive of the Football Association and those at Sheffield
Wednesday F.C. and Sheffield City Council responsible for the
safety certificate for the Hillsborough Stadium to resign
                      Jr   Cwef                  O u x k ^ e td   M i
We also call for Jzhe resignation of the Chairman of the South
Yorkshire Police Authority. We believe his actions in seeking
to defend a Chief Constable who was ultimately responsible for
the inadequate policing that led to the deaths of the 95 supporters
and who was ultimately responsible for the presentation of the
heavily criticised evidence from police officers to the Lord
Chief Justice Taylor Inquiry, are shameful.

We also believe that the Executive Coimnitee of the Football
Association bears a heavy responsibility for forcing through the
use of an inadequate stadium. Time and again Liverpool supporters
protested, well in advance of the day of the tragedy, about the
inadequacy of the ground and the unfairness of the match being
played there. The Executive Committee of the F.A. should therefore
also face up to their responsibilities and resign as well.

This Working Party also recognises the need to remove all fences at
football grounds in the interests of spectator safety. We also'
recognise that the introduction of Identity Cards for football
supporters will not increase spectator safety - on the contrary,
it will cause massive safety problems.outside football stadiums.
In addition to the report on ID cards, the Hillsborough Working
Party research officer be requested, as a matter of urgency, to
submit a report on the question of fences at football grounds.

We note that the relevant recommendation contained in Lord Justice
Popplewell's Report covering police procedures, perimeter fence
gates and stewarding arrangements were absent at Hillsborough.

This Working Party believes the issues of spectator safety will
never be resolved unless safety recommendations are backed with
legal requirements and the footballl clubs and authorities have
effective supporter representation.

                                                         SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

 1.      Background

 1 .1   The Committee will recall that the County Council's powers and duties under
        this Act are delegated to this Committee.  On 8th January, 1976, the
        Committee decided that any necessary detailed investigation should be
        undertaken by Officer Working Parties for each of the four Borough Council
        areas.  These Officer Working Parties consist of representatives of the
        Fire Service, the Police, the Building Inspectors of the Borough Council,
        co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

 1.2    Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds which have
        accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should be subject to the
        provisions of the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the Secretary
        of State to date as requiring General Safety Certificates from the appropriate
        County Council have been certain "International" grounds and those of clubs
        in the                                   Footbal 1 LeapueC^^a

JOINT REPORT OF THE COUNTY SOLICITOR                    FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
AND THE CHIEF FIRE OFFICER                              6TH FEBRUARY, 1986

                     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

Background

The Committee will recall that the County Council's powers and duties under
this Act are delegated to this Committee.  On 8th January, 1976, the
Committee decided that any necessary detailed investigation should be
undertaken by Officer Working Parties for each of the four Borough Council
areas. These Officer Working Parties consist of representatives of the
Fire Service, the Police, the Building Inspectors of the Borough Council,
co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds which have
accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should be subject to the
provisions of the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the
Secretary of State to date as requiring General Safety Certificates from the
appropriate County Council have been certain "International" grounds and
those of clubs in the Football League (see separate Report on the "Popplewell
Report" regarding further designations).

Position in South Yorkshire

Following their designation by the Secretary of State and detailed investi­
gations and specialist advice given by the Officer Working Parties, General
Safety Certificates have been granted as follows, after approval by the
Committee:-

Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield                   21st   December, 1979.
Wednesday Football Club pic.

Millmoor Ground of the Rotherham United                 20th   February, 1984.
Football Club Ltd.

Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football                 25th   February, 1985.
Club Ltd.

Following their promotion to the Second Division of the Football League, the
Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. were dasignatedby the Secretary of State
as requiring to apply to the County Council for a General Safety Certificate
by 1st January, 1985.

The Belle Vue   Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club Ltd. was
designated by   the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
Council for a   General Safety Certificate by 9th August, 1985, following the
Bradford City   tragedy.

Both Clubs complied with these requirements, and have been undertaking works
to meet the provisions of the Act in consultation with the Officer Working
Parties.
                                                                                      r




2.5   All of the required works at the Sheffield United Ground will be completed
       shortly, and those at the Doncaster Rovers Ground concerned with fire
      precautions, fire detection and electrical (including emergency lighting)
      upgrading have been largely completed. The number and siting of the crush
      barriers at the Doncaster Rovers Ground have yet to receive attention.
      However, the Ground capacity has been reduced from a potential in the region
      of 30,000 (bearing in mind the area of the Ground if it fully complied with
       the Act) to 10,759    to take account of such factors.

3.    General Safety Certificates

3.1   The Committee on 3rd September, 1981, approved of minor amendments to the
       standard General Safety Certificate previously agreed (on 30th November,
       1978) to be used throughout the County.

3.2   Paragraph 9 of the standard General Safety Certificate contains provisions
      relating to the appointment of and duties of safety stewards.    It is
      suggested that the following wording arising from the recommendations of
       the Popplewell Report should be substituted for parts (a), (b), (c) and (d)
      of the paragraph:-

      (i)     that they should be trained and instructed to deal with any emergency
               relating to fire or evacuation;
      (ii)    that they should be given written instructions about the action to
              be taken in cases of emergency;.
      (iii)    that they should receive practical instruction and training
               appropriate to their responsibility;
      (iv)    that no one should be employed as a steward unless they have been
              So instructed and trained; and
      (v)     that they should be adequate in'number, physically and mentally
               capable of performing their duties, effectively deployed,
               effectively supervised and readily identifiable.

3.3   The Committee is also requested to consider the question of whether a fee
      should be charged for the Certificates in view of previous decisions that
      no charge should be made to the Sheffield Wednesday, Rotherham United and
      Barnsley Football Clubs.

4.    Recommendation

      (i)     That the General Safety Certificate now submitted in respect of the
              Bramall Lane Ground, Sheffield, and the Interim General Safety
              Certificate in respect of the Belle Vue Ground, Doncaster, be
              approved, subject to the suggested amendments to paragraph 9
              relating to Safety Stewards.

      (ii)    That the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee be authorised
              to agree any amendments necessary should any of the requirements of
              the Certificates not be able to be complied with in full by the
              actual date of issue (such amendments not to reduce the overall
              level of safety to be required at either Ground).

      Jiii)   That the Committee make a decision as to whether a charge should be
              made to the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd. and the Doncaster
              Rovers Football Club Ltd. for the Certificates.         ^     ^

The Fire and Civil Defence Joint Authority have not made a decision about the

Reccrrmended that the agreement of the Fire and Civil Defence Joint Authority
be obtained before the acquisition of these premises proceeds.

FIRE PREVENTION - COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL
AT SPORTS GROUNDS - INTERIM REPORT

1.   As requested at the meeting of the Fire Service Committee on 6th June,
     1985 I am now able to provide further information regarding the safety
     provisions in sports grounds within South Yorkshire.

2.   Following the events which occurred at the Bradford City Football Ground
     on 11th May, 1985 a survey of sports grounds in South Yorkshire was under­
     taken to identify stadia to which the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
     might'be applied should the safety standards be considered unsatisfactory.

     In addition to       the       5 major   football   club   grounds   the survey   revealed
     stadia at :-

              9     Association football grounds
             10     Cricket grounds
              5     Rugby football grounds
              4     Greyhound tracks
              1     Joint speedway/greyhound/rugby ground
              1     Horse racing course
             40     General sports grounds

     The 40 sports grounds provide mixed activities such as football, tennis,
     cricket, bowling, rugby and athletics.   Included in this number are both
     private clubs and others that are local authority controlled.

3.   Of   the 70 grounds visited only 13 requiredattention.   Work to improve
     the standard of fire safety has been agreed and includes :

       (i)    Fire proofing and means of escape work at -

              (a)     Doncaster Greyhound Stadium.
              (b)     Dons Rugby Club, Bentley.

      (ii)    Roof repairs at -

              (a)     Elsecar Cricket Club.
              (b)     Dodworth Miners WelfareGround.

     (iii)    Improved housekeeping and fire equipment at 9 stadia, all of which
              are considered to be of a satisfactory standard.
 4.   A r^aalntion to fire proof the main stand at       the Hillsborough Stadium,
      Sheffield has been          ‘ml 'rn   »nm-par^    of* t-hia work will be com­
      pleted before the start of the 1985/86 season.     11 11 1 1 ~TT in l|i,111 suggested
      that a new roof be provided for this stand and    work has already*>»mmenced
      on the design and structural specification.  It    should be complete/ before
      the start of the 1986/87 season.

      Work is still progressing at the Bramall Lane Ground, Sb€ffield with
      a view to the authority issuing a general safety certificate in the near
      future..

      Doncaster Rovers Football Club have applied for a general safety certifi­
      cate following the coming into operation of the yF§85 Designating Order
      S.1. 1985 : 1063.  A considerable amount of workyftas already been carried
      out to improve the fire resistance of the main^stand and additional work
      is being undertaken to improve the final exits^from the ground.

 7.   Only the usual maintenance work is considered necessary at the Barnsley
      and Rotherham Football Club grounds.  t/
                                             s
 8.   The interim report of Mr. Justice ^opplewell became available to the
      County Fire Service early in August And makes a number of recommendations,
      a copy of which, together with ^tfome Office Circular No. 5V1985, is
      attached as an appendix to this report. To satisfy these recommendations
      the Joint Officer Working Par^Sr has already discussed the implications
      with the Club Managements and^Steps have been taken to satisfy them.

      of the Green Gufde modified. The effects of such changes will be reported
      to the Fire Service Committee when known.

A.     A resolution to fire proof the main stand at the Hillsborough Stadiur,
       Sheffield has been agreed and the major part of this work will be com­
       pleted before the start of the 1985/86 season. It has also been suggested
       that a new roof be provided for this stand and work has already commenced
       on the design and structural specification. It should be completed before
       the start of the 1986/87 season.

5.     Work is still progressing   at the 3ramall Lane Ground, Sheffield with a
        view to the authority issuing a general safety certificate in the near
        future.
                                                                                    v

6.      Doncaster Rovers Football Club have applied for a general safety     ^
        certificate following the coming into operation of the 1985 Designating    V
        Order S.I.1985 : 1063. A considerable amount of work has already been^
        carried out to improve the fire resistance of the main stand and additional
        work is being undertaken to improve the final exits from the ground.

7.      Only the usual maintenance work is considered necessary at the Barnsley
        and Rotherham Football Club grounds.

8.     The Interim Report of Mr. Justice Popplewell became available to the
        County Fire Service early in August.   It is a detailed document of
        almost 100 pages, including much technic?.] data. The Report concludes
        that the Bradford fire was caused accidentally and that there were tvo
        causes of the fire and the resultant casualties; the presence of litter
        under the seating and the absence of sufficient exits.   ihe Repor<_
        comments that, had the safety advice contained in the Heme Office Guide
        to Safety at Sports Grounds (Football) - the "Green Guide - been
        followed, the tragedy would not have occurred.   It must be added that, at
        that time, the Ground had not been designated by the Secretary of State
        under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act, 1975. As regards the
        Birmingham City incident, the Report concludes tuat a substantial number
        of Leeds United Fans, full of drink, had gone to Birmingham to cause
        trouble, and thereby sparked off the Birmingham City supporters whose
        subsequent behaviour was as bad as, if not worse than, that of the visiting
        supporters. The Report states that it is not possible to be sure hov the
        brick wall came to fall, but feels that the post likely explanation was
        the surge of people.

9.      The Report makes a number of recommendations. These, together with tne
        Government’s responses to them, are set out in Annexe B of the copy
        of Home Office Circular No. 54/1585 attached as an Appendix to this
        Report. To satisfy these recormendations, the Joint Officer T’orkinp
        Party has already discussed the implications with the Club ;-Ianagementa
        and steps have been taken to satisfy them.

10.     It is considered that from this additional information now made available
        all reasonable steps considered necessary have been undertaken to ensure
        the safety of members of the general public at sports grounds in the
        County of South Yorkshire.

 11.    Following Mr. Justice Popplewell's further detailed consideration of his
        findings and the production of a final report it is expected that the
        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 will be amended and the content of
        the Green Guide modified.  The effects of such changes will be reported
        to the Fire Service Committee when known.

A.'        COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY INTO CROWD SAFETY AND CONTROL AT SPORTS GROUNDS


2.         The Report          concludes that                 the Bradford                   fire        was caused accidentally
and comments .that,                    had the safety                advice                contained            in the Home Office
Guide to Safety at                     Sports       Grounds          (Football)                   (the       ’ Green Guide’ ) been
followed,              the tragedy would not                       have occurred.                        On the Birmingham City
FC incident,                 the Report           concludes          that         the disorder                      was the product
of violence              by both sets              of       fans    to a ;degree which the police                                          could
not        reasonably have foreseen.


3.         Attached at           Annex A is             a copy of             the          text    of     the Home Secretary's
oral        statement          to Parliament                 on 24 July                responding to the Inquiry's
Interim Report ,and at                          Annex B a copy of                      his    more detailed                       written
statement.              ,The latter              sets       out    each of             the    Report's                   recommendations,
including the provisional                           recommendations,                         and the Government's
responses to them.                        All     this       material            has been circulated                              to the
governing bodies of                       the major           sports          in England and Wales listed
at       Annex C in           the expectation                 that       they will                advise            their         members
to continue              to co-operate              by assisting                   in the          implementation of                         the
Inquiry's              recommendations.

     concerned in his working group on the financing of safety
, {improvements.'Managements have responded in a co-
     operative way and have either set necessary work in hand
     or are enncirferine how to comply with the requirements.
■ Local authorities and local fire authorities have sufficient
  - statutory powers to ensure that essential fire safety
 - requirements are complied with. These will in no way be
     affected by the separate proposals directed towards
      streamlining the present law on fire precautions published
     yesterday in a consultative document and which I am
      inviting the inquiry also to consider in the context of its
      work.'
          My right bon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland
            ] u t grateful to chief fire officers and firemasters for
      the prompt, efficient and careful manner in which this
      survey has been carried out. A digest of tbe reports will
      be submitted to tbe inquiry.
           Thirdly, the House will, of course, be aware of the
       rapid passage through both Houses of tbe Spotting Events
       (Control of Alcohol Etc.) Bill. It will be in force by the
       beginning of tbe football season.
           Fourthly , steps have also been taken to enhance police
       effectiveness next season. In England and Wales the
        Association of Chief Police Officers has introduced a new
        system for exchanging information about the conduct^ of
        fans, which should assist in anticipating and preventing
        trouble. Three of the Home Office photographic vehicles
        will be available to be deployed at football matches,
        together with two experimental high-definition tripod-
        mounted cameras. This is in addition to tbe £500,000
         worth of closed circuit television equipment purchased
        through funds provided by the Football Trust.

     England and Wales to introducing membership system so as to exclude

    Both these recommendations are for foo tb a ll auth orities and clubs, but the

           JOINT REPORT OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE,                        FIRE SERVICE COMMITTEE
           THE CHIEF FIRE OFFICER AND THE CHIEF                        8ch SEPTEMBER, 1983
           CONSTABLE

                                    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT, 1975

    1.    Background

    1.1   The Committee will recall   that the CountyCouncil's   powers andduties under
           this Act are delegated to this Committee.   On 8thJanuary, 1976, the
           Committee decided that any necessary detailed investigation should be
           undertaken by Officer Working Parties for each of the four Borough Council
           areas.  These Officer Working Parties consist of representatives of the
           Fire Service, the Police, the Building Inspectors of the Borough Council,
           co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

1.2        Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds which have
           accommodation for more than 10,000 spectators should be subject to the
           provisions of the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the Secretary
           of State to date as requiring General Safety Certificates from the appropriate
           County Council have been certain "International" grounds and those of clubs
           in the First and Second Divisions of the Football League.

2.        Position in South Yorkshire

2.1       The Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd. was
  ;       designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
           Council for a General Safety Certificate by 1st January, 1979. Following
           detailed investigations by the Officer Working Party for the Sheffield
          District, the Certificate was granted on 21st December, 1979, after approval
          by the Committee.

2.2       The Officer Working Parties for the four Districts have also given informal
          advice on a continuing basis, on request, to the remainder of the ioocball
          league Clubs in South Yorkshire.

2.3       Following their promotion to the Second Division of the Football League, the
          Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the Rotherham United Football Club Ltd. were
^         designated by the Secretary of State as requiring to apply to the County
          Council for a General Safety Certificate by 1st January, 1982 (as reported to
          the Committee on 3rd September, 1981).

2.A       The two Clubs did so, but have taken rather longer than they anticipated to
          carry out the works required to meet the provisions of the Act in view of
          certain development and re-development proposals which the Clubs had in mind.
          Naturally, the Clubs were reluctant to incur expenditure on their Grounds
          if these proposals were to be put into effect.   It should be pointed out that
          the Act does not specify a time limit for consideration of an application
          for a General Safety Certificate once the application has been formally made.

3.        General   Safety Certificates

3.1       On 30th November, 1978, the Committee approved a draft General Safety
           Certificate as the basis for the standard certificate to be used throughout
           the County.

The General Safety                  Certificate granted to the Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club Ltd. on 21st                   December, 1979, was based on the standard certificate with
additions to meet                   the particular conditions at the Hillsborough Stadium.   The
Committee decided                   on 14th January, 1930 not to make any charge for^the    ^ ^
Certificate after                   referring the matter to Policy Advisory Sub-Committees ’A*
and ’B 1.

Experience gained since the granting of the Sheffield Wednesday General
Safety Certificate showed the desirability of incorporating two minor
amendments to the standard certificate and, on 3rd September, 1981, the
Committee agreed to the Standard Certificate being amended so as to
incorporate the two suggested minor amendments.

    q £ the required works   the Barnsley and Rotherham Grounds have been
carried out or will be completed shortly and drafts of the Certificates in
respect of the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the
Millmoor Ground of the Rotherham United Football Club Ltd. are attached for
the Committee's consideration. These are, of course, based on the standard
South Yorkshire General Safety Certificate previously approved by the
Committee.

The Committee is also requested to consider the question of whether a fee
should be charged for the Certificates in view of the earlier decision of
14th January, 1980, that no charge should be made to the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club Ltd. for the General Safety Certificate in respect of the
Hillsborough Stadium.

Recommendation

(i)          That the General Safety Certificates now submitted in respect of the
             Oakwell Ground, Barnsley, and the Millmoor Ground, Rotherham, be
             approved, and that the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Committee
             be authorised to agree any amendments necessary should any of the
             requirements of the Certificates not be able to be complied with by the
             actual date of issue, such amendments not reducing the overall level of
             safety to be required at either ground.
(ii)         That the Committee make a decision as to whether a charge should be
             made to the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. and the Rotherham United
             Football Club Ltd. for their General Safety Certificates.

                     S A F E T Y O F S P O R T S G R O U N D S A C T , 1975

        Background

1.     As. the Committee will, recall,, the County .Council's powers and duties under the
       Actareparto#ih»s\ecBnamiitte£rs terms ©Preference.* Oti 8th January,.1976,- the Committee
        decided that their functions should be exercised through Officer Working Parties
        for the four Borough Council areas, consisting of representatives of the Police,
        the Fire Service and the Building Inspectors of the Borough Councils, with
        co-ordination being undertaken by the Department of Administration.

2.     Whilst it is Parliament's intention that all sports grounds should c o m e under
       the Act eventually, the only grounds designated by the Secretary of State up to
        recently had been First Division grounds and certain international grounds.
        Following representations by the County Council, the Hillsborough Stadium of the
       Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has now been designated by the Secretary of
       State on the basis of its quasi-intemational use.

        General Safety Certificate

3.1    The Officer Working Party has been considering in detail the terms and conditions
       which they feel should be attached to a General Safety Certificate.

3.2    The following recommendation is submitted for the Committee's consideration:

                That the draft General Safety Certificate n o w attached be
                approved as the basis for the standard certificate to be
                used throughout the County.




        Fee

4..1   This,.leads. on to the question of the fee to ..be charged to applicants for General
       Safety Certificates. TheRegalatibris'stipulate-thatm local authority m a y determine
       the fees to be charged in respect of applications for the issue or amendments of
       safety certificates, but that such fees shall not exceed an amount commensurate
       with the w or k actually and reasonably done. H o m e Office Circular No. 130/76
       referring to this, expresses the view that local authorities should, in the normal
       course,not find it necessary to charge fees representing m o r e than 17 man/days'
       w o r k per certificate.

        The-fees-charged, by the local: autho^rrfctfesjwJjiQ.hav'e'issued Certificates to date
      range from no charge at all by the Nottinghamshire County Council to an
      average of £4, 000 by the Greater London Council.

4.3   There would appear to be five options open to the Committee, as follows:

      (i)     to charge no fee at all                        t
      (ii)    to charge a purely nominal fee
      (iii)    to charge a fee which is a purely arbitrary figure (i.e. not related to
              any specific n u m b e r of man/days' work)
      (iv)    to charge a fee related to the H o m e Office estimate of 17 man/days' work
      (v)     to charge a fee based on the actual n u m b e r of man/days' work.

      In the event of the Committee deciding on option (v), the charge for 17 man/days'
      w o rk (without including any element of clerical support or supervisory staff) has
      been currently costed at £850.      This figure would need to be up-dated, of course,
      to take salary increases, etc., into account as necessary. In the event of the
      Committee deciding on option (v), the fee could not, of course, be determined
      until all of the work has been completed.

4.4   Whilst the City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council has yet to m a k e a
      decision as to the basis of charge for w o r k undertaken by its Building Surveyors,
      it is likely that any decision taken will be influenced by whether the County Council
      makes, say, a purely nominal charge or a full economic charge.

4.5   T he Committee's instructions as to the fee to be charged are requested.


      Po w e rs of Entry and Inspection'

5.1   The Act provides that the County Council, the appropriate District Council and
      the Chief Constable are em p o w e r e d to authorise entry of their officers to sports
      stadia for the purpose of making inspections.

5.2   The following recommendation is submitted for the Committee's consideration:

              That the Chief Executive for the time being be authorised to
              issue formal authorisations to the requisite officers under the
              Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, to enable them to exercise
              the powers of entry and inspection specified in the Act.

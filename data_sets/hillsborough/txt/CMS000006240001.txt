MINISTER'S CASE - RA / 0515 / 1042


1.   You asked that I look at this case from a Science Branch
perspective as it did not seem to rest easily within the remit of
SARD.


2.   The 1990 International Trans Antartica Expedition was
neither scientific nor exploratory.       It was purely a high
adventure undertaking which, quite incidentally, caught the
imagination of many school children and was used by their
teachers to stimulate the appetite of their charges in the
Geography class and across other parts of the curriculum.        It was
viewed as an " honest " venture though purists would quickly
point out that a dog sled journey across the Antartica, with
'planes and hellicopters in attendance, is rather a mixture of
metaphors.


3.   Geoff Somers was a key member of the six nation team,
doubling as Chief Navigator and dog handler, skills he acquired
whilst employed as a General Field Assistant over two winters and
several summers by the British Antartic Survey (BAS).      He now
makes a living as a sled builder.


4.   His request would seem to be one for sponsorship after the
event and the event was not one that the Science Budget could
have funded in the first place.     BAS and its parent body, the
Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), have confirmed
that they are in a similar position.


5.   If SARD is unable to provide assistance then, regrettably,
the request would seem to fall between stools. As a last resort
Mr Somers might be pointed in the direction of one or other of
the educational charities or, possibly, the discretionary

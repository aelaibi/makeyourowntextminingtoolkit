       Dear Dr Popper

                                Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

       Thank you for your letter of 9 November 1990 concerning Rule
       28 of the Coroners Rules 1984 and the Director of Public
       Prosecution's decision, that there were to be no criminal
       prosecutions instituted in this case.

       I should be grateful if you would accept this letter as formal
       notification from the Director that an adjournment under Rule
       28 will be unnecessary in this case.  The Director will
       consider any new evidence at the conclusion of the inquest
       hearings.

       Yours faithfully




       C J CLEUGH
       Head of Police Complaints Division

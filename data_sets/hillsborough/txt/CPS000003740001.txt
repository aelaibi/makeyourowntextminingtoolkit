Dear

HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY
REQUESTS FOR STATEMENTS

Thank you for your letter of 24 October.  I have given careful
consideration to the points which you raise on dealing with
requests from witnesses for copies of their statements.

I can quite understand the decision to supply statements upon
request during the earlier phase of the enquiry.  However, I
feel that there is a distinction to be drawn between the
inquisitorial nature of Lord Justice Taylor's Public Enquiry
and the full criminal investigation which is now being
conducted.  I feel that such statements should remain the
confidential "property" of the investigation and they should
not be released until either after the end of any criminal
proceedings or after the Director has reached a decision not
to issue proceedings.

If it is necessary, of course, there would be no objection to
witnesses refreshing their memories from their statements in
the usual way prior to giving evidence.

I would, of course, be prepared to discuss this matter with
you on the telephone and I would also be most interested to
hear the response which you receive from the Police Complaints
Authority.

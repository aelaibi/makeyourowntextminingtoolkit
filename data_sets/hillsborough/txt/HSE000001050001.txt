A/V DR CHRIS NICHOLSON, HSE, who said that a return to terracing in football stadiums is
possible. ANDY WALSH, of the Independent Manchester United Supporters Association,
interviewed, discussed terracing and the demands of the fans, SIMON INGLISS, author of
Safe Terracing and Safety at Sports Grounds, interviewed, said Terracing has become
■inpractical new. It's difficult beirfg a Manchester United supporter new. They are top of the
-sague but the stadium is poor. Trey pack in as many as possible on poor seating often w'th
a poor view of the match, Old football grounds were built without planning regulations. The
situation has become more complex since then and ground alteration* require that alt sorts
of considerations be addressed. I used to 'ike standing at matches and s t i do at lower
League games. This is not an issue of government vs the people. FIFA want seated
stadium?. 30 do UEFA. We would not win opportunity to host the World Cup if we went back
to :erraco3 There is a lack of research. I worked wi;h D; Nicholson on the Safe Terracing
document. JOHN D£ QUIT. CEO, Fcotbaii Licensing Ajthcrity, w js also interviewed, he
said: The Hillsborough disaster was net the first in which large numbers of people were
injured at a football ground. The Liverpool Cop was renowned for injuria* to fans and those
injuries were reduced by seating. Our safety regulations are better than the Germane. We
are promoting our bid to host the World Cup on our safsty standards and FIFA wiS not give
us the World Cup If we go back to Premier Lsegue Terracing. We cannot increase capacity
by re-introducing terracing. TCNV BANKS - Sports Minister, interviewed, said; The
government position is that there will be no return to terracing . We wiB continue with the
programme to have a!1seating stadia We have told people that the*e is no way that we will
go back to terracing .

               SY B IL R U SC O E:
                          The man who headed the health and safety investigation into the Hillsborough disaster
               sa; is he believes terracing can be safe. Dr Chris Nicholson, who gave key evidence to the
               Tajylor enquiry which eventually forced the top two English divisions into all*seater stadia
               ra:4de the comments today on 5 Live, just as the Government's football task force is hearing
               ca Is from fens for a return to terracing.
                          Now, with that exclusive is our sports news con-espondent, Catherine Robinson,
                 ijtherme, what's he said?


               CATHERINE ROBINSON;
                          Well, Dr Nicholson's the chap who headed the health and safety laboratory
               investigation that then reported to Lord Justice Taylor and at the time he was extremely critical
               o f what happened at the Leppings Lane end. He said it was overcrowded, the barriers were
               wc rn, they were too close together, but now he’s saying that doesn't mean that terracing itself is
               dangerous.


               m CHRIS NICHOLSON;
                          I think terracing can be made safe and can be constructed in a safe manner as long as
               thd correct guidelines are followed. There is this The Green Guide which is used for... as
                  ueral guidance and after Hillsborough the densities of crowd were altered and slightly
               re<cjuced.      But if those guidelines were followed, then certainly safe terracing could be
              constructed

                         I put his comments to the Football Association, but It says until the Government is
              willing to reconsider the issue, it doesn't believe now is a good time to reopen the debate.

                 i
              sJ& i
                         Why didn't they say that at the time, Catherine?


              £Ei
                         Weil, Hie remit o f this role was really to examine the e vidence o f what happened on the
              day and he said he wasn't asked broader questions o f policy, in fact he wasn’t asked for a view
              on the safety o f seating at all. Obviously, he did make recommendations about how terracing
              could be made safer in terms o f capacity and barriers and things like that because of course it
              w; ,s always envisaged that there would be some terracing for a certain period o f time in the top
              two divisions till the end o f '94 and in the other divisions till the end o f 1999, although
              ob viously that situation has changed for the lower divisions.


              S J&        '                 '
                        Now, lots o f organisations as I understand it, you know, like the FA, the Football Trust,
              th<; Hillsbrough Support Group, they do say the support all-seater stadia, don't they? Is safety
              tho main reason they give for that support?



                        The Hillsborough families always say that and they always say. if you have a defined
              spiice that is yours throughout the game then common sense says it must be safer.                                             It's
              intsresting when you talk to people like the Football Association that you always feel that the
              ar$ uments over time have mutated slightly into the fact that we get much better behaviour now,,
              that we're attracting more families, there's less racism, that the image o f the game has
              im sroved, so I think we're seeing a shift there.


              S.ljl:
                        What about this football task force that's sort o f campaigning around the country at the
              me ment, getting the views o f fans? They are hearing, aren't they, from a small, vociferous
              mi: writy for the return o f terracing?

                         They certainly heard from a very large majority when they were in Manchester, I think
                  jviously the Manchester United fans feel this quite strongly.


              SR:
                         They've been standing up, haven't they, at recent games?



                         They have been and arguing that, you know, A - it’s their right to stand and B - that they
              fejel more involved, they're passionate about their football and they want to stand and not
              allowing them to do it ruins the atmosphere.


              Sfe:
                        W hat about the atmosphere; what is the evidence on that?                                Because I can see the
              argument for the defined space and it does encourage families and it feels a lot nicer and you
              cen breathe and you don’t have to smell Bovril, cigarette ends and whatever else you used to
              s n e ll on the terraces. But haven't they come up with some research that shows that the all-
              seater stadia have some of the best atmosphere?


              GEi
                        Well, I think if you go to a lot o f the all-seatcr stadiums, certainly if you go somewhere
              lil e Pride Park, you know, compared with the atmosphere that used to be at the Baseball
              Ground, I think there is a distinct improvement - and obviously, some design features can help
              th. it, you know, if you get closer in to the pitch and there are ways not to lose atmosphere. B ut
              I think it's also interesting that some people argue that if ticket prices go up and if you do
              attract perhaps a different sort o f fan and if you are attracting more women and more young
              children, perhaps inevitably they’re not the people who are going to stand up and scream and
              sh jut. perhaps, as much as the men.                     Personally, I disagree, haying stood and sat in the
              Kippax* for years, but that's the argument.


              SJ&L
                        Okay, 1 think some evidence as well said that Middlesborough's Riverside Stadium
                 a n ie top o f the atmosphere which o f course, is a new aJl-seater stadium.                                Stay with us,
                  therine, if you like.

                Association who are behind that call for a return to terracing. What do you think. Andy? Arc
                y<iu... do you think it’s atmosphere that's been ruined?



                          I think very much so. I think from our point o f view, from the supporters' point o f view,
                th ;re are three key issues really. One is the choice o f football supporters to be able to watch
                and support the team in the way that they wish and also the atmosphere question's a very
                irr portant question, and many grounds are now facing pressure on their capacity - and these are
               thu three key issues that we wish to address. With terracing it’s now a number o f years since
               Taylor has been implemented and all we’re asking for is for the Government to have a
               thoroughgoing review post Taylor and the Government said that, when they were in opposition
               an i they're now refusing to do so now they're in Government and we want to know why.


               SJii
                          What about the safety aspect?


                  m
                          Safety’s very important but football fans were campaigning on safety issues before
               19:59, before the Hillsborough disaster and we were ignored. Football fans’ organisations are
               being ignored by those who run the game and the clubs over a number o f years and that has led
               to :hings like we saw at Hillsborough in 1989. So what we're asking for is, don't impose all-
               sea ter stadia on football ignoring the wishes of football fens again, because again you're
               str; angling the 1ife out o f football.



                         But to go back to terracing, wouldn't it be a return to the bad old days where it's all
               urniclean and people are squashed together and it's not terribly pleasant, is it?



                         Well, that's precisely the issue; we were expected to watch football in squalor and
              ex pjected to like it and then people objected when those people who were treated like animals
              rea<fcted like animals, What we're saying now is (hat like, where there is a need for a review of
              Ta;>lor,; there's a need to listen to football fans' experiences and listen to football fans
              th<em:selves. One o f Taylor's key recommendations was that football fans should be involved
              and consulted at all levels o f the game and that's one issue that Taylor raised which has been

               ignored by clubs and by local authorities who are in charge o f ground safety certificates.
                          When we had the task force in Manchester, we asked the task force to go back to the
               Government and ask them to increase their remit so they could cover terracing. We got a very
               stiongly worded press statement from Tony Banks' office saying that they were not going to
               consider terracing. The task force is supposed to listen to football fans and football fans are
               quite clearly saying up and down ihe country that there is a sizeable minority of football fails
               wljto wish to have terracing back.
                          We're not talking about swathes o f terracing. 10-15,000 bank o f terracing that w e’ve
               se&n previously; we're saying that there is a role for terracing and money and resources have
               be m put into grounds to develop executive suites and family facilities, They also need to look
               after the other fttns who wish to stand and sing and get behind the team, bccause those who buy
               ex jeutive tickets and those who buy family tickcts also buy the spectacle that is football aud
               th< spectacle is less now than it used to be when we did have terracing.



                         Are you planning to stand up again at Old Trafford?



                         Well, the standing at Old Trafford was far more complex than your reporter has referred
              to k id it’s... you know, wc haven’t got time now to really go into it, but the issue o f standing in
               seating areas is something which we are due to discuss with Manchester United and Tratford
              Bo rough Council and the police on 12th March and those issues will be addressed there, We'li
              overcome the initial problems..,


              S-tf:
                         (Interrupting) Andy, do you see it more or less as a section o f the groiuid returned to
              tertjacing so that people could choose to go and stand if they wanted; is that...


              A JV i
                         Very much so.



                         That's how you see it?

                Lm
                           Yes. What’s... there \vas very little thought given to ground configuration when all-
                saater stadia w ere brought in. What tended to happen was that most fans were expected to just
                go into the seated areas and find their own way and there was no... there was very little
                consideration given at most clubs as to how those fans wouid actually sit in a stand, where they
                v 'ould sit, whether those who created an atmosphere would sit together and what we've seen at
                C(Id Trafford is that we've got different types of fans mixed together. Those who want to sit and
                vatch the game and applaud when there’s a goal or when there's an cxciting piece o f play arc
                mixed in w ith those who want to have a more boisterous involvement in the game. Now. Old
                1 rafford should be big enough to be able to accommodate all different types o f supporters, but
                v,hat we're seeing now is friction in the stands bccause the ground configuration wasn’t given
                d le consideration on the implementation o f all-se&ter stadia.


               SEi
                         Andy, stay with us. Simon Inglis is listening in; Simon is the author o f Safe Terracing
               and also the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.                          Simon, would it          be   as simple as Andy
               e? plains   there j ust to have 3 section where people can stand if they want ?


               S MQN INGUSi
                         It might have been a few years ago but certainly not now and I do sympathise a great
               deal with what Andy is saying, not just because o f the business o f standing, bui the business o f
                     mg a Manchester United supporter in this day and age, which I think all genuine fans can
               sy tipathise with. Despite the fact that they're top o f the league, you have a stadium at Old
               Tr afford which with the best wijl in the world has been developed along fairly minimal lines
               a n i the area in question where people are standing has poor sight lines, so I understand and
                o      not particularly comfortable seating because o f the need to pack in as many people as
              po?sible. So thafs one factor.
                         But I think the main problems, really, is that you cannot consider increasing the
              capacity o f the stadium simply by putting in standing spectators. When old stadiums were
              b u lt, were football grounds, there were no planning regulations, you could put 50,000, 60,000,
              nobody cared. As soon as you pulled those terraces down or applied for renewed planning
              pel mission in the 1990s you suddenly had to become subject to all the kinds o f planning
              regulations that applied to hospitals, schools, wherever. And that means that the buildings
              wh ich have been created now - I don't mean the reconfigured terrace at Old Traflord
              nec essarily, but the new stands which are now seated - you cannot simply put barriers back on.

                          Apart from anything you have extra loading, more people creates extra loading and the
               building may not be strong enough to take it. Secondly, if you have more people on the
               tetrace, then you have to add extra vomitories, extra circulation areas, extra turnstiles, there are
               all sorts o f knock-on factors which have to be considered.

                      ' Simon, ,quite apart from the logistical side o f it, what about Andy's point that it's a
               qusstion o f freedom o f choice, personal choice if you're a football fan, to be able to sit or stand,
               or do you think it is kind o f people going, "Oh, we want to go back to the good old days o f the
               terraces"?


               SJi
                          Well, I can understand it. I stood for many, many years and still occasionally when I go
               to lower league games I do enjoy standing. But the point is, this is not just big government
               against the people, as it were; It's too easy to portray it as that. First of all, if we returned to
               sot ne areas o f standing, we could kiss goodbye to any chance o f staging the World Cup in
               2006, that's for starters.            It's not just the English Government, the British Government, it's
               FIFA as a whole and UEFA as the confederation.
                         In addition to that, there is no given right, there is no Doomsday Book which says, you
               sh d i have the right to do this, that and the other. Where 1 do agree with Andy is that I think
               that ciubs could pay more attention to creating areas where those people who want to behave in
              such a way that other people; may take... object to is right, but if I can just say one other thing:
               the evidence shows... you talked about research. There has been no research; the only research
              is anecdotal - and I worked with Dr Nicholson on the safe terracing document. We did a lot o f
              effort at that point, but there is no research to say that people stand because they have to stand.
              Yo l can take one area where the sight lines are very poor and people will sit through the whole
              game, then next week another set o f supporters will come, perhaps a bit more boisterous,
              different weather facilities and they will want to stand. So it's not cut and dried.


              U l
                         Let's bring in John De Quit* who's in the studio with us, struggling a bit with a sore
              throat today I think, John, aren't you? John De Quit is the chief executive o f the Football
              Licensing Authority and the FLA is an independent public body set up under the Football
              Spectators' A ct in ‘89 to license league and international football grounds in England and
              Wales. What's the FLA view on the return... the call for a return to terracing, John?

                  JOHN PE QUIT:
                            I have a Jot o f sympathy with those who call for it but I'm afraid I do not agree with it,
                 because I have to go back to the Taylor Report and to the sheer fact that however good you
                 >nake your standing terraces, seating is always going to be safer.
                            I think the whole debate about football post-Hillsborough has                                         rather been
                 overshadowed by seating. In his report, Lord Taylor said that seating was the single most
                 i ttportant factor in bringing about safe grounds, though he didn't see it as the only factor, it was
                 tie chief amongst many measures and the upgrading o f fa c ilitie s, the provision o f proper
                 stadium management, the provision o f good quality stewarding, o f crowd safety measures and
                 c f measures like the law preventing people going on the pitch, All o f these arc an important
                 part o f the package and I think seating has to be seen in that context.

                sUi
                           What about the personal choice issue, because it strikes me that if you just say, it is
                 liifer, it's a bit like telling people to wear seatbelts or not cat T-bone steak. Some people would
                 iiiy, "Well, I'd rather be able to choose that m yself.


                jjD .Q ;
                           Well yes, but if you drive down a motorway at 120 miles an hour Without a seatbelt, it
                may not just be yourself who gets written o ff - and I think we tend to assume that Hillsborough
                w is a bit o f a one-off. The '60s and the ’70s saw enormous numbers o f incidents in which large
                m rabers o f people were injured. They didn't make the press but every year there was a m^'or
                incident somewhere with 2 0 ,3 0 ,4 0 , 50 people being seriously injured.
                           Just to give you the figure I always quote, only it relates to the Cop* at Liverpool, one
               of the most popular terraces o f all, at any match while it was still standing, you had between 10
               and 25 people treated by the first aiders. Now that the ground is all seated, the first aiders are
               probably treating three to four people o f whom the majority are going to be ill and not injured.

                         Yes, Andy Walsh is from the Independent Manchester United Supporters’ Association.

                         (Interrupting)        Right, and what would... so therefore, terracing per se is not unsafe
              wl ich is w hat John Nicholson is saying.                      What is required is proper regulation and proper
              review o f the technology that is available. What we're saying is, is that it is a number o f years
              no iv post Taylor, there is a need for a thoroughgoing review. We hoped the football task force
              wc uld be able to look at that and they weren't.                           And as regards the mechanical loading o f
              beaims in grounds, we've had architects look at that situation at Old Trafford and at other
              gr­ounds and where., if the will was there, the technology’s certainly there where grounds could
              ad;taally modified (sic) to ensure that the beams were sufficiently stressed, to ensure as Simon

                E ngland's staging the World Cup in 2006 and in those grounds they have the facility whereby
                fiins can stand but they call them seated areas, now, what we're saying is that technology's
                available for Germany, it's also available in other countries in Europe. All we're asking for as
                football fans is, listen to us, listen to our experience which is dismissed as anecdotal by some
                ot'your people in the studio and...


                m i
                           (Interrupting) Lei’s get Simon Inglis's view now, Andy, Simon.


                S ili
                          Andyy 1 don’t wish to be quaint with you and I don't wish to dismiss what you are
                spying, but you are wrong.                  The technology does not exist in Europe to have all seated
                st idiums which can also be used as standing areas. They are simply very poorly seated areas
                that people stand up in. They are not... they would not pass muster in this country with our
                safety regulations and they will not pass muster with FIFA for the World Cup; the Germans arc
                gc ing to have to spend a fortune in order to bring their stadium...



               S lit
                          (Interrupting) As I understand it, that's part o f the reason England's promoting its bid
               so strongly on that safety issue, bccause they know that Germany's got to get their house in
               order stadium wise.


              ■S J i
                          Germany has got a long way to go. But just one other very quick point about what's
               happening in the power divisions. Where existing terraces are there in the lower divisions, you
                   1 find that in aiany cases they’re not being used to ftill capacity because they do not comply
               wi’h the very, very highest standards which have been laid down by the safe terracing
               docum ent Premier league clubs simply have to get as many people in as they possibly can and
               a return to the terraces would not increase capacities. If they...

                         No, no, not less but not more. You could not increase without... it's not ju st a question
               oi strengthening beams, it's a question o f a lot o f other factors. I'm not being patronising here

                         Simon* I'm not saying you are but the Government are, unfortunately. When they were
               in opposition they said they’d look at it. Now they've set up a football task force and they're
              being asked at every single meeting around the country so far and they will be asked
               co ntmually by other fans to look at it.


              s ji
                         But you only have to look at who the head o f the task force is to understand why that is
              habpening.

              something

                         I was sort o f rather in full flow when cut off. I'm sort o f faintly surprised that Chris
              Nicholson's comments are being presented as news, because I've actually been saying that
              arc und the country for the last five years. It is possible to create terracing o f a reasonable
              standard. It is never going to be as safe as seating, but I think where 1 would start arguing is
              over the size o f terraces. You can create a small terrace and a small ground o f a reasonable
              standard.       It will never be as good as seating and what wc are finding, therefore, is that
              although many clubs in the lower divisions were permitted or have been permitted by the
              Government to retain a certain amount o f standing accommodation,, they were nevertheless
              en< ouraged to go down the road o f seating and many o f them are choosing to do so. And one

                       The man who headed the Health and Safety investigation Into the Hillsborough disaster
             haii said he bdicves terracing at football grounds can be safe. Dr Chris Nicholson's comments
             have been welcomed by supporters, who've been campaigning for a return to standing areas.
             B it the Government remains in favour of all-seater stadiums.                                             Heres our sports news

             CATHERINE RQB1NSOH;
                            Dr Nicholson says that the Hillsborough disaster was causcd by overcrowded terracing
             ■tbit was badly designed and p o o r ly maintained. That doesn't mean tcrracing is intrinsically
             dangerous.


             » k C H R IS NICHOLSON:
                    1 think terracing tan be made safe and can be constructed in a safe manner as long as
              thje correct guidelines arc followed. There is this, the Green Guide, which is used for, as
                    ncral guidance, and after Hillsborough, the densities o f crowd were altered and slightly
               •educed.           But if those guidelines were followed, then certainly safe terracing could be
                instructed.

I was asked by             if there was any problem about you giving a 2 minute
interview on HSL's role m the Hillsborough inquiry. I said there was no
problem, it was all in the public domain. what would not be right is if Radio 5
tried to draw you into a debate on the relative merits of standing and seated
arrangements, which is what the programme is about. Any such attempt would need
to be firmly registered - 'not for me to comment' etc.

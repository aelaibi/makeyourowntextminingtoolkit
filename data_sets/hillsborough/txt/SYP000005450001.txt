I condemn           the Police          for      the     sixth mistake,           that     no Senior          Offi c e r           f

I condemn the Police                    for      the     seventh mistake,            this     time at the             exit

from the ground.                 It was          the Liverpool           fans who were           persuading

others       not     to go t h r o u g h the first                gate,     because        there were          sights

that we need not              see?        the      dying and the             injured       lay    piled,

I   condemn       the Police              for     the    eighth mistake,              and this        time     1 may

temper my opinion,,                   I do u n d e r s t a n d      now that          of   the    number       of the

the gates         onto     the       tunnel        of d e a t h ’ ,     1 do feel          that    those       officers

surge      coming from the                exh a u s t e d      fans who       had     lost    their      loved ones.                i

also     believe       that, someone               should of at          least, cont r o l l e d         the    noise

level     by switching               of   the      screaming        sirens       of    police,        ambulance        and

fire     tenders w hich went                    on and on a t t r a c t i n g         no further         attention,

merely      deafening         the a l r e a d y exh a u s t e d          crowd.

Finally        ,my daughters,              who were            in L i v erpool        and saw the         scenes       on the

other      poor     souls     of Me r s e y s i d e ,          frantically          tried to make            contact,

found for hours and hours an engaged signal                                         only.        If the Police          put

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
SUNDAY TIMES REPORT ABOUT CONSERVATIVE PARTY CONFERENCE


You will have seen the report in the Sunday Times for 15 October
about the alleged computer malfunction at the Conservative Party
Conference.   For convenience, I attach a copy of the article.

2.   Lord Justice Taylor is, as you know, now looking at the
Government's detailed proposals for a national membership scheme
for football supporters. He is looking particularly at how large
numbers of people can be processed according to computer based
systems. With that in mind, the article I refer to caught his
eye (the markings on the copy attached are his).

3.   I wonder if you would be able to help me find out some of
the detail behind this alleged incident.  I have, of course,
asked Mr Brian Johnson, one of Lord Justice Taylor's assessors,
but he tells me that the system which failed was one operated by
the Conservative Party themselves and not by the police.  I
should be grateful for your advice, either in the form of some
detailed information, or with a contact who could supply that for
me.

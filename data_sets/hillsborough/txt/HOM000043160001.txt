    Dear Mr Whalley,

    At the opening of the Inquiry Lord Justice Taylor confirmed that the cost of
    representation of the injured and bereaved by the Hillsborough Solicitors Group
    would be met from public funds.

    Sadly the figures involved have not as yet been capable of agreement and it will
    be necessary for us to proceed to a taxation of costs.

    The remarks of Lord Justice Taylor do not technically amount to an order for
    taxation and payment of those costs and to enable an appointment for taxation
    to be obtained we would be grateful if he UJould consider making a formal
    direction that the costs should be taxed in default of agreement.

    The Treasury Solicitor has no objection in principle to taxation but we are both
    faced with the technical difficulty of producing the actual authority to tax.

    I look forward to hearing from you.

    All good wishes.

    Yours sincerely,




    MESS E M STEEL

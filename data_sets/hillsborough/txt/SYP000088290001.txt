            I am a registered general        nurse employed at the Northern General

            Hospital,         I qualified in April    1987 but before that was a state

            enrolled nurse.         I qualified at South end on S e a .       I have worked in

            the Accident and Emergency Department              (A & E) at the Northern General

            since May 1987.

            On Saturday 15th April        1989 <150489)       I w4s on at work working the

            afternoon shift.         I started at 12.30 Dto.      At around    3pm I went for my

            meal     break.     It was not long after this that I became aware that there

            was some kind of incident taking place at the Hillsborough football

            ground I di d n ’t know any details.

            The unit received a telephone         call via the emergency telephone stating

            that there was a paediatric cardiac y r e s t on route to the h<?4 pi tal
                                      b/ipss    j
            I was instructed by Charge Nurse Bjg/ty to receive the patijgnt
                                                                                           PAGE       2
                                                                                           S3255

               The major        incident   cupboard was opened and the equipment     contained

               therein was distributed to the resuscitation points.              The unit was

               informed by ambulancemen at the hospital            dealing with unconnected

               matters that there were first of all six <6) and then twelve              (12)

               ambulances on route to the Hillsborough Football            ground.

               Within a short time the first ambulance,            containing the child cardiac^

               arrest,      had arrived.      The ambulance   crew brought the patient straight

               into the resuscitation room.            I think that there was a# po1i ceman^ffls

               present.  I remember that the paeditri cian (Dr Pett&riqe r ) had arrived

               at this stage.  The patient who I now know was Lee Nicol




                                                      There were ^wo doctors working on this

               pat i euu.
                     ent     One of,them was the paediatrician and I think the other was

               The student nurse was needed somewhere else so the Police Officer who

               was present took over the cardiac massage under my su pervision.                 One

               of the doctors was called away by this stage the patent seemed to

               sta b il is e,



               The other doctor moved on as she was required else where wi^h other

^   />r   $d   patients.        I remained with the patient.      After a short tim J a sister

               from mid w i f e r ^ c a m e   into the resuscitation room and tqok/over the

               manual    ventialation from myself.         Once I was convinced that the sister

               was confident in what she was doing            I made myself available elsewhere.
                                                                               PAGE     3
                                                                               S3255

         I became involved in obtaining drugs and equipment       required by medical

         staff through out the rssusciation points in the department.

         Through out I kept an observation on the first       patient and ensured

         that sister was alright.      I recall that she was joined by an

         anaesthetist whose name I d o n ’t know but he is of oriental    origin.

         Sometime   later the pati.   -transferred to ITU .

         I am aware that this ga_ied on Monday 17th April     1989 (170489)

         and donated his organs.

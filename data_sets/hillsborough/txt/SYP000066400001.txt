          .nto    the                         3u b 1 i c H o u s e            opposite.

          The    landlord           of    the       Public            House       w as    letting                s m al l    numbers          into       the

          premises        at    a time             and      the       others         hung         about          outside          waiting          their

          turn.      They       were          quiet         a n d well           behaved           whilst             they waited.                 None       of

          them a p peared            to       have       any         beer      or a l c o h o l         with          them outside.

          Around     2    pm    (1400             hrs)      alot        of     the     youths           started             to m a k e    their          way

          from    the     pub       towards           the        match.           Alot        of    them again                used       the       shop       and

          I no ti c e d a great                   number         of     them      had     either                cans    or     bottles         of       b e er

          with    them.         Some          of    the      youths            seemed         a    little             worse       for    wear       with          the

          drink,     they       were          noisey         but        not      what     I would                describe          as    disorderly.

          I found alot              of    the       f a ns       we re        usi n g the          d r i v e w a y at         the       side       of    a
C   ' I
                   shop        to    urinate             and         didn't       s e e m at        all          bothered          who    saw       them.

          Up    until     2.45       pm       (1443         hrs)        I sti ll         h a d at           least       a dozen          of    the       fans

          in the                shop waiting                     to     be     served and               they          didn't       seem       to    be       in

          any    rush     to    get       to       the m a t c h .

          There    were        still          a    lot      of       people       in the           area          and    they       slowly          started

          making    their           way       down                         towards        the       ground.                 I was       very       surprised

          that    the     f a ns     had          left      it       t h is    late      to       get       to    the       match,       knowing             it was

          a semi    final           and       the     amount            of     people         that          would       be a t t e n d i n g        but       they

          didn't     seem       in a n y           r u s h at         all.        At     no       time          would       I say       the    fans          were

          disorderly           but       they       were         noisey.

          I suffered           no    damage           to m y          premises           in a n y           way,       but    on    clearing             up

          after    the      lunch         time        opening              I did       remove           a       number       of    bottles          and       beer

          cans    p r o b a b l y 6 or             7 from            the      shop w hich           had          been       left    by    the

          supporters.               All       of    these            were      empty.             There          were       only    a    fe w m o r e         cans

          outside        the    shop          but     not        a    great       number.

          At    around     4.30          pm       (1630      hrs)          the    same        day,          a    number       of    f an s     started

          reappearing           in the             area.             I had       heard        about             the    disaster          and       knew       what

          had    occurred.               The       f an s    were          Liverpool              supporters                and    I heard          a

          scuffle        a n d an        argument            outside             the     shop       but          1 d i d n ’t go         out       to    them.

             I believe        one    of    their     friends          had    been     killed        and    they    seemed

             distressed         o ve r    the    f a ct.     I did         have   occasion          to    speak    to    o ne    of    them

             t h o u g h as   he wa s      urinating         up      the    driveway.         He     seemed       distressed           and

             commented        on    the    fact     that     he      h a d n ’t n e e d e d   his    ticket       to    ge t    into      the

             ground and        s h o w e d me     his      ticket       which     looked       in tact.           He    said     t h at

             h e ’d ha d      problems      getting         i nt o    the    ground      through          the   proper         channel

             and    had    entered with           t he     crowd when          the    gates     were       opened.

                                                                                                                                SIGNED

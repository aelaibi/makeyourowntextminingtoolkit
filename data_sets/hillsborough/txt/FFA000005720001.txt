 I Adrian Richard Titcombe of 16 Lancaster Gate, London W2
will say as follows:


 1.       I am 43 years old and have worked for the Football
Association (FA) for the last 16 years.                                                             I am a BA Oxon and
before joining the FA was a teacher of Arabic and Turkish at
Millfield School.                I joined the FA as competitions secretary
and handed over that job to Stephen Clark in 1982.                                                                         My
present main responsibilities are for the competitions
department, referees, regulations, discipline and fixtures.


2.        When I was the competitions secretary I was
responsible for dealing with the FA Challenge Cup
Competition and so dealt with the semi-final arrangements.
There are a number of clubs that have been used over the
years as venues for FA semi-finals and consideration would
be given first and foremost to geographical location and
capacity of the grounds.                              It would also be relevant that the
club had experience in dealing with big matches and also had
a high ratio of seating capacity i.e. a£— Xoa&t 20,000 seats.
The reason for this is that the charge for seats is at least
double that for standing room and so greater revenue can be
generated from the match.                               The grounds are chosen from a
list which includes from London: Arsenal, Tottenham and
Chelsea; from the Midlands: Villa Park, Nottingham Forest,
West Bromwich and Birmingham; and from the North: Everton,
Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Sheffield
Wednesday, Sheffield United and Leeds United.                                                                      In fact the
  final choice is generally much narrower because of practical
  reasons.        For example this year Arsenal did not want to have
  a Challenge Cup match, Tottenham j^ars doing work on their
  ground fr-Bot in -corresp ondence-}1 and Chelsea was not really
  large enough as it only has a capacity of 39,000.
                             x
                  The existing administration of a club would be an
  important factor as there is a great deal to organise and an
  inexperienced secretary and staff would be unlikely to be
  able to cope effectively with the problems that can arise.

                                        st--^aeab«gg--of the. ■Challenge
/ Cup Committee^that the venues^sixauldr'^e' changed
 year so as to ^iye-dr±fterent clubs the opportunity of
             a~‘Hemi-fina3r.     This is because clubs have to
 carry out a certain amount of work to their grounds to
 provide for the required segregation of supporters and so
 the proceeds of a match are a means of recouping some of
•thattexpenditure.         With the semi-final draw this year the
 onljZ--MssJ±iJLB clubs for staging ife would have—teeeft' Villa
 Baste, Manchester United, Manchester City and Sheffield
 Wednesday.         My own feeling was that the likely choice for
 the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest would be
 Hillsborough because it had been held there the previous
 year without any reported difficulties.              If it had been
 Manchester it would have been Manchester United rather than
 Manchester City because it was their turn.


 4.               I do remember that on 16 March, Bernard Halford
 the secretary of Manchester City had telephoned me to
 express great interest in holding a semi-final at City's
 ground.      At that stage Liverpool, Everton, Manchester United
 and Nottingham Forest were still in the competition.              I
 suggested to Mr Halford that he should find out from
 Manchester police the views of City staging the match even
 if Manchester United were involved^              Mr Halford phoned back
                                             Of

 my experience the Manchester police are one of the most

 country who would allow this to happen. I discussed the
 position with Mr Clark, and we agreed that he would telephone

of playing at Manchester City. / I- understood Eveg%on-3f<s£uged

5.         I had a brief meeting with Graham Kelly the chief
executive of the FA on 17 March.          Mr Clark was at this
meeting.   The purpose of the meeting was to discuss
semi-final venues as I would be going to Birmingham to deal
with the semi professional match against Wales from 18 March
until 22 March and so would be out of the office on 20 March
when the draw was to be made.        I particularly wanted Mr Kelly
t|£?be aware that there was no London club available for a
semi-final march*.   At that time Brentford, Wimbledon, West
Ham, and Norwich were st^.1 in the competition and<gt London
^-dlul^-Looked as though itycould be needed.           I also told
Mr Kelly aboutT^Ehe^ telephone calls with Manchester City and
Everton.   Sheffield Wednesday and Villa Park were
mentioned as possible venues.       I had some concern about
Sheffield Wednesday because depending which clubs were in
therj final it could involve two lots of supporters travelling
on the same route and this could lead to problems.                  Mr Clark
was not as concerned as I was on this point.                The meeting
discussed other points and was fairly brief lasting about
15-20 minutes.
     6.           After Hillsborough had been chosen as the ground
     for the 1988 Liverpool/Nottingham Forest semi-final I
     attended a meeting there at which were present
     representatives for Liverpool, Nottingham Forest and the
     police.     The principal point of the meeting was to discuss
     the point raised by Liverpool as to whether the ends
     designated by the police could be swapped.            The police had
     allocated the Leppings Lane end to Liverpool based on
     geographical considerations.        Liverpool ^Ss^unhappy about it
     and had asked for a meeting.        I would not normally have gone
     to this meeting but Mr Mackrell had told me about it and as
     I happened to be near Hillsborough on FA business the day
••




     before the meeting I attended it.            I also wanted to inspect
     Sheffield Wednesday's new facilities as I knew I would be
     the FA representative at the semi-final match.            The meeting
     was quite amicable but the police made it clear that they
     were not prepared to change their decision.            I cannot now
     remember exactly what I said at the meeting but I am sure I
     supported Liverpool from a football point of view but I also
     understood the police's view.            I remember that the police
     had a map at the meeting showing the various traffic
     considerations.     I did not really participate in the
     discussion.     I regarded myself as being there as an
     observer.     I did not keep any notes of that meeting.

     7.          The FA as a matter of policy does not become
     involved with every day decision taking once it has
     nominated a staging club for semi-final matches.            This is
     because it is impractical and also the clubs are chosen
     particularly because they do have the facilities and
     experience to deal with the arrangements.           Clubs are usually
     approached by the FA in February to see whether they are
     prepared to stage semi-final ties and at that time are asked
     to provide details on spectator segregation, present
     capacity, numbers of seats and standing places and indicate
     if safety fencing is provided around the pitch.           A further




                                     -   4-
reason for leaving the staging club to deal with all the
organisation and arrangements is that it will generally know
the behaviour and habits of the supporters who are coming
from the other clubs as it will no doubt have played against
them.   This means it has a much better detailed knowledge of
the type of arrangements that are needed and can liaise with
the police.


8.          Clubs attach importance to being selected as the
venue for a semi-final cup match as there is some prestige
involved as well as some financial^benefit.         The rule is
that the competing clubs should ireceive 50% of the tickets
for sale.     However in practice this can not always happen as
the ticket allocation is governed by the ends which have
been allocated to the supporters.         The police have a large
part to play in this decision as segregation of         fans is
regarded as an overriding consideration for safety at
matches.    The staging club technically should not be
allocated any tickets but it generally retains a v<wy small
number for directors and club officials.         The FA usually
takes an allocation of tickets for each tie on the basis of
all directors box tickets a a ^ ^ t h e number will depend on the
size of the box) f 350 complimentary and 850 purchase
tickets.    These tickets are allocated to Council members,
County associations, members of staff, other football league
clubs and organisations connected with the FA.


9.          A member of the FA staff attends each semi-final
match and in recent seasons this has principally been
myself, Glen Kirton, or       Dickie Bird.   Our duties are to
return any spare tickets to the staging club, and        generally
to supervise the hospitality and protocol arrangements at
the match. As a matter of courtesy the club secretary often
informs the FA staff if any problems have arisen in
connection with ticketing or policing arrangements. C

    10 .        The FA plays a vary different role when it comes
    to the staging of matches such as Internationals and the Cup
    Final at Wembley.         The reason for this is that the company
    which owns Wembley only stages about 6 football matches
    during the year and is a commercial organisation.                       It
    therefore is not nearly as experienced as a staging club in
    a semi-final Challenge Cup in dealing with the issues of
    crowd control.      Further, njany of the supporters have never
    been to Wembley before anc lack of familiarity with a ground
    often leads to a greater lumber of complaints.                    Wembley has
    generally been quite keen for the FA to attend a number of
    the administrative meetings that have taken place with the
    police and local authorities.               I think that the staging         ^
    clubs for semi-final matches would probably regard the FA as
    ixLberfe^ing^if^fefoey "turned up for meetings and started
    participating »ifli -fchQ-garoe w ay.        I also feel that FA members
    of staff would have little to contribute to any discussions
    at the staging clubs because of their lack of^knowledge of
                                                             jocT   " ‘ '   -

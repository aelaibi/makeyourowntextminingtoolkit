The    Home   Secretary    has    general    responsibility       for   the   law
governing inquests but he has no power to comment upon the way
in which      a coroner,    who   is an     independent    judicial officer,
carries out his duties in any particular case.                    I should also
explain that it is not the function of an inquest to determine
liability.       The law states that the purpose of an inquest is to
ascertain the identity of the deceased and how, when a.nd where
he came by his death.          The Coroners Rules specifically provide
that neither the coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion
on    any   other   matters.      In   addition,    the   Rules    specifically
prohibit the framing of an inquest verdict in such a way as to
appear to determine any question of criminal liability on the
part of a named person, or civil liability.               Any issue of civil
or    criminal    liability    is a matter     for the civil or criminal
courts and not the coroner's inquest.


You state that certain witnesses were not called by the coroner
to give evidence.         However, although those who are entitled to
examine witnesses at the inquest may make representations to the
coroner on these matters, an inquest is an inquisitorial process,
not    a trial,     and it is entirely a matter for the coroner to
decide upon which witnesses to call.               As you know, in the event
the    inquest took over a hundred days to examine the relevant
facts.


If anyone is dissatisfied with an inquest, under section 13 of
the    Coroners Act    1988    it is open to them to apply,             with the
authority of the Attorney General,            for the High Court to quash
the verdict and order a fresh inquest to be held, either by the
same coroner or a different one.              Coroners'    inquests are also
subject to judicial review by the High Court.

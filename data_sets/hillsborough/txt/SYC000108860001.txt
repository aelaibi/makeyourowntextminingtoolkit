            THE CORONER:   Good morning.  I understand that
B      whoever it was, everything is better, I hope.  We will
       be starting with that young man again tomorrow because
       he is taking a driving test today so we can hardly
       prevent that, but we have got plenty of other people to
       hear, so it is Carl Andrew Sterritt first, please.

                                            CARL ANDREW STERRITT (Affirmed)

                                                                 By THE CORONER

       Good morning.  I am sorry about yesterday but I am sure
       you understand. - A. Yes.

    Q< Is it still                                                                            ? - A. Yes.

    Q. Is that                                                                                    in Cheshire? - A. Yes.

D   Q. Are you still a student? - A. Yes, final year.

    Q. What are you studying, as a matter of interest? - A. A
       degree in biochemistry.

    Q. I think I am right that you were coming to the semi­
       final on 15th April, 1989? - A. Yes.

    Q. You had a ticket for the Leppings Lane terracing? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. You were coming, I think, by car with some friends? -
       A. Yes.

    Q. You left Warrington at about 10.30, is that right? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. You arrived in Sheffield at about 12.30? - A. Yes.
    0. You parked your car and then did you make your way to
       the ground? - A. Yes, slowly but surely we walked down
       to the ground.

    Q. I think you saw nothing that concerned you as regards
       ^   n   A   W   A   M   A •* «   A   Am    — _—   _   ___ _ _ ■   I . — __   _   _ 1   _   A    A   % *r   .   ■   ^   1
       the behaviour or anything else ? - A. Not at all, no.
       It was very, very quiet.

      It was quiet.  Does that mean that there were not many
      supporters at the time when yo u were walking about or
      ...? - A. Not necessarily, no.   Everybody was just sort
      of sitting round and waiting to go to the ground.   It
      was still quite early.




H
                                           C. A. STERRITT

Yes, I appreciate that.  You, in fact, arrived at about
1.30, I think, at the ground? - A. We walked in about
1.30, yes.

I assume that you had no difficulty whatsoever getting
through the turnstiles? - A. No, we weren't searched,
we didn't have our tickets checked, we just walked
straight into the turnstiles.

You didn't have them checked? You mean they weren't
taken off you at the turnstiles? - A. No, I mean
beforehand.

Once you got .... - A. Yes, once we got to the
turnstile itself we just gave our tickets in.  We
weren't checked prior to it.

I see.  Were you searched on the inside, as a matter of
interest? - A. No.

Have you been to the ground before? - A. I have, yes,
once before.

Was it for the previous semi-final? - A. No, it was
just for a league game.

Did you make your way down the tunnel towards the
central pens? - A. Yes.

You knew where to go because you had been before and I
take it you like being behind the goal, would that be
right? - A. Yes.

You went straight through the turnstile, straight down
onto the terracing, I take it? - A. Yes.

So you would have arrived at about half-past-1 on the
terracing, would that be right? - A. Yes.

There were a few people there but it certainly was not
very busy at that time, was it? - A. Not at all, no.

You took up a position on the terracing,   is that right?
- A. Yes.

Was that the position you maintained throughout or did
you move at some subsequent time? - A. We maintained
our position until you could no longer maintain the
position because it was so crowded.

So that was your preferred position and you would have
stayed there if you could have done? - A. Yes.
                                            C. A. STERRITT

Whilst you were there I think   you saw a relation of
yours, didn't you? - A. Yes.

That was Carl, was it? - A. No, I     am„Carl.

I am sorry, yes, he addressed   you as Carl. Who was it?
- A. James Gary Aspinall.

About what time was that, when he was chatting with
you? - A. It was after 2 but before half-past-2, I
would say.

Did you then stay together with him    or did    he move
away? - A. No, he moved away.

Did you see him again after that at all? - A. Glimpses
and little shouts   but nothing totalk. He was towards
the front. He was only small so he tended to go towards
the front anyway, whenever I saw him at Liverpool or
wherever.

So it was a conversation but it was a transient one? -
A. Yes, just as you would have with somebody who you
knew at the ground.

What happened between 2.30 and 2.45? - A. It was just a
gradual build-up, nothing really spectacular - no
sudden surges as has so often been said.

So you never felt any surges? - A. No.

Just a build-up, as far as you were concerned? - A.
Yes.

This went on until about what time, would you say, that
sort of build-up? - A. I would say between quarter-to
    10~to-3, myself and the two lads I was with noticed
that it was getting a little bit stupid.  It was really
getting, well, quite crushed really.

Yes. - A. And we talked about moving away, and you
could see either side of you the pens, the two pens
away on either side, they were empty, and we thought
about moving down there but then we thought we would go
to the front maybe, because there was still quite a bit
of space at the front.  Where the steps end there is
maybe two yards width and then the fence, just flat
concrete, and we thought, no, we always stand here,
it s a better laugh and a better view, so we just
stayed where we were.

Perhaps I ought to just check, you said about quarter-
to, 10-to.  Did you actually look at your watch or the
clock or what makes you say that time, or was there
                                           C. A. STERRITT

something else that happened which you can relate the
timing to? - A. On the right-hand side in the corner of
Leppings Lane there was a big advertising hoarding and
that had the time on it as well.    v

Was it a digital clock? - A. Yes.

You think that you were looking at that from time to
time? - A. I would probably have been looking at my
watch anyway, because I had been standing there for an
hour.

So you are reasonably confident that the time which you
mention is accurate? - A. Yes.

That is all I am trying to establish.  You were saying
that although you yourself in your position at that
point you were crushed, further forward in that pen
there was still space? - A. I would have said so, yes.

Did you, in fact, move forward? - A. No.

What happened? Why did you not? - A. I always have a
habit of standing with my back against one of the
barriers, purely because you don t want to get crushed
and you know you are quite safe there.  Obviously you
can only move within so far when you have got your back
against the barrier, and you know you are always,
hopefully you are always going to have your back
against the barrier when everybody settles themselves
down.  During the game when a team nearly scores
everybody obviously pushes forward, and if you are
leaning against the barrier ....

With your back to the barrier? - A. If you are on the
other side of the barrier and you have got your front
against the barrier, you have got much more chance of
being hurt than you have if you have got your back
against the barrier.

Yes, so you had actually gone with the barrier to
protect you from behind? - A. Yes.

That is why you decided to   stay? - A. Yes.

Did you see the teams come   out pre-match? -   A. Yes.

When I say pre-match I don't mean for a kick around,
but prior to kick-off I am talking about? - A. Yes.

Were you then at that point standing with your     back to
the barrier? - A. Yes.
                                          C. A. STERRITT

This barrier, was it one that broke or not, do you
know? - A. No, it wasn't.

At the point when the teams came out., the pre kick-off,
was it the condition as you have described it at
quarter-to-2 .... - A. I am sorry?

Sorry, what was the condition as far as you were
concerned at the time when the team came out? - A. I
don't think anybody could gauge the seriousness of it
but yes, I was very concerned.

You were concerned at that point.  Was there still
space in front of you at that stage? - A. I could not
say.

Did you see match kick off? - A. Yes.

Had it deteriorated any further by then or not, or had
it stayed constant between team coming out and match
kick-off? - A. I think it was still a gradual build-up,
or a gradual deterioration, and I suppose everybody
just thought that it would settle down once the game
got going, everybody would find their own space.
Although really you were beginning to feel that it was
quite claustrophobic, I don t think you would have
thought that people were going to be killed and the
crush was that bad.




                 /Q. You never saw .
You never saw what happened to your cousin, did you,
because you lost sight of him? - A. No.
But he was further forward, you say?   A. Yes.
Did you notice people climbing over the front
fence? - A. Yes, I did.
At what point did you notice that? - A. Timewise?
Yes, are you able to say? - A. Just before the game
ended.
That is when it first impinged upon you? - A. Yes.
Was there anything else significant? - A. I saw
people being pushed back into the pens.
Tell me about that then? - A. I think by that time
people had obviously realised there was something
very wrong. Looking behind, people were being pulled
up from behind into the seating above and people were
trying to climb into the pen, to the left hand side,
and people were trying to climb over the fence on to
the pitch. At first there were only relatively few
people doing it and I saw people being pushed back
in.
You said you first noticed this just as the match was
finishing? - A. No, this was before the game had
finished.
After it had started but before it finished, you say?
- A. Yes.

Were you able to see the little gate in the front? -
A. Yes, but I don't recall whether it opened or not.
What was the time interval so far as you can judge
between people being pushed back in, as you said, and
people being helped out? - A. Probably two or three
minutes, I think purely because the number of people
trying to get out increased to the extent that they
couldn't all be pushed back in and then people
realised there was something seriously wrong. People
who were supposedly officiating realised there was
something very wrong.
When did you first realise that things were seriously
wrong in the pen? - A. Probably about three o'clock.
At kick-off you mean? - A. Just after the kick-off,
yes, because I saw the kick-off and then I don't
remember anything else so far as the game was
concerned.

                                               C. A. STERRITT


Q. You did not see Beardsley hit the crossbar? - A. No.
     MR. ISAACS:   Do you intend to ask vCarl to indicate
his mark on the plan?
     THE CORONER:    Yes, thank you, Mr. Isaacs.
Q. We have a little plan and I want you to show us where
   you were? - A. Yes.
     MRS. PERKINS:   C.399.
               Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:
Q. Carl, just so that we know exactly what the position
   is, that cross that you have marked, in fact, you
   were standing in front of the barrier? - A. Yes,
   towards the pitch.
Q. Do we understand it correctly that you remained in
   that position throughout? - A. I remained in that
   position until the crowd was moving so that you could
   not stand in one position. Just the force of the
   crowd moving to and fro took you away from the
   position but until the crush got so bad that that
   happened, yes, I stood with my back there.
Q. That was after the kick-off? - A. I would say so,
   yes.

Q. I just want to ask you about one or two things in the
   evidence you have given. You have talked about the
   gradual build up? - A. Yes.
Q. You   considered moving away? - A.   Yes.
Q. Butit never got so bad that you actually decided to
   move away from the place where you normally sat or
   stood, I should say? - A. No, it got to the stage
   about three o'clock where you could not move.
Q. I appreciate that but you told us a short time before
   that you actually thought - and whether you talked
   about it to your pals or not - about either to moving
   to the sides where there was room or moving to the
   front where there was room? - A. Yes.
Q. Despite the fact that you tell us it was getting
   quite crushed really you decided to stay where you
   were? - A. Yes, because I didn't consider that it
   would go to the extent that it did go to.
                                                                         8
                                                            C. A. STERRITT

         Q. Of course not because otherwise you probably would
            have left the stadium? - A. I didn't feel I was at
            risk at the time.
    JJ | Q. You did not feel you were at risk. Despite how you
            felt you were going to stay where you were? - A. I
            just felt it was very busy but there again it was the
            Semi Final.
         Q. That was quite normal? - A. For a game that was sold
            out, yes.

         Q. You believed that come the kick-off everybody would
    £1      find their own space and it would ease off a little
            bit? - A. Yes.
         Q. At that stage in the period up to the kick-off when
            it got really bad, kick-off time or just after, up to
            that time you felt that however you felt at that
            particular moment, however claustrophobic it was, it
            was going to get easier? - A. It was going to get
            easier once the game had started?
         Q.    Yes, I think that is what you have told us. - A. At
              that time, yes.    I am talking about ten to, quarter
              to three.
         Q.    When you had theopportunity and thought about moving
              that you decided not to do? - A. Yes, but then again
              a lot can happen in the ten minutes in between.
         Q. A lot did happen but even you did not actually decide
            to move at any stage until there came a time when
            just after the kick-off I think you have told us you
            could not move? - A. Yes.
                         Cross-Examined bv MR. HUMPHREYS:
   Q. At this time when you gave consideration to moving,
      you looked to the pen I think to the right
PJ    presumably? - A. Both sides.
         Q. Having regard to the build up of the crowd atthat
            stage how easy or difficult would it have been for
            you to move that way? - A. You could have forced your
            way through. You wouldn't have been able to walk
            straight through. You would have had to force your
            way through.
Q j Q . Thinking back to that, can you say whether that would
        have been more difficult or easier than say when you
        are attending at the Kop at Liverpool? - A. I would
        say in a very busy game at Anfield when you would
        expect the Kop to be very full it would be very
        difficult to move in the Kop either side. You could

      do it but again you would have to force your way
      through.

         MISS ADDLEMAN:     I wonder if C.360 „could be put on the
g j screen please?

        THE CORONER:      Is that the one you want?
        MISS ADDLEMAN:    Yes, that is the one.
                 Cross-Examined bv MISS ADDLEMAN:
   Q. Have you got it? - A. Yes.
   Q. What I would like to ask you about in the picture is
      that you will see there on the extreme right is Pen 3
      and then more to the left and middle of the
      photograph we have Pen 2. What I would like to ask
      you about are the people on the perimeter track here.
      We can see a procession of movement, of people
      appearing to be shepherded along the track into Pen 2
      but did you see anything like that from where you
      were standing? - A. You are trying to say that that
      shows people were being moved?




                          /Q. It appears to show a movement,
                                          C. A. STERRITT


It appears to show a movement from right to left? - A.
As you look at the photograph?

Yes. - A. Yes.

Did you see anything like that from where you were
standing in Pen 3? - A. No.

Did you have a view which was sufficiently good to see
anything like that if it occurred? - A. I could see
people on the far side of the fence, but I don't think
you could say that that photograph shows there was
movement one way or the other.

You do not know? - A. No, I don't know.

     THE CORONER: Mr. Sterritt, thank you very much
indeed.  I am very much obliged to you.  I am sorry
that you have had a double journey.

                 IAN SOUTHGATE Sworn

                  By THE CORONER:
You are Ian Southgate, is that right? - A. Yes.

                  Liverpool, is that right? - A. Yes.

What is your occupation? - A. I am an engineer.

You are also a Liverpool supporter? - A. Yes.

You managed to get a ticket, I think, through your
friend Philip Hammond, I believe, is that right? - A.
Yes.

It was a terracing ticket, was it? - A. Yes.

This was, of course, for the semi-final on 15th April
1989? - A. Yes.

Had you been to the previous year's semi-final? - A.
No.

In your case you decided to travel by coach, I
believe, is that right? - A. Yes.

It was Amberline coaches? - A. Yes.

Do you know what time it left? - A. I think it left
about 11 o'clock.

What time did you arrive in Sheffield? - A. It would
be about 1 o'clock.
                                            I SOUTHGATE

Was the coach searched at any point or stopped? - A.
It was searched once some way outside Sheffield.

Outside Sheffield? - A. Yes.

What was checked for? - A. I think they must have been
checking for alcohol in the luggage compartments.

They looked for alcohol in the luggage compartments? -
A. Yes.

Did they ask about tickets, as far as you can
remember? - A. No.

You do not remember or they did not ask? - A. No, I
d o n 1t.

I am sorry? - A. I don't remember anyone asking for
tickets, no.

It was not searched in Liverpool, was it, your coach?
- A. No.

When you got to Sheffield at 1 o'clock you parked, I
think, at least the coach was parked, you did not park
yourself? - A. No.

Then you made your way to the ground, is that right? -
A. Yes.

Did you go straight to the ground? - A. We walked past
the ground, went to get something to eat and drink,
and then we walked back to the ground and went in.

As you were walking did you notice other supporters at
all? - A. There were a few supporters all just walking
round, just talking.

Did any approach you for spares? - A. No.

You did not notice anything unusual about them? - A.
No.

Nothing that concerned or worried you? - A. No.

So what time did you get into the ground? - A. It
would be about half-past 1.

No problems I take it? - A. No.

Were you searched as a matter of interest? - A. Yes.

Twice or once? - A. Just the once.
                                                 I SOUTHGATE

Outside or inside? - A. It was outside.

No problems there either? - A. No.

So you got into the ground at 1.30 and did you go
straight down the tunnel to the pen? - A. Yes.

It was the right-hand     one, or   the left-hand one? - A.
It was the right-hand     one.

We will call that Pen     3. - A. Yes.

I did ask you whether you had been to the previous
semi-final.  Had you ever been to the ground before? -
A. No.

So it was all new to you? - A. Yes.

Was it empty or full at that time? - A. It was empty*
We were sitting on the terracing reading our
programmes.

No problems at that point? - A.       No.

That is you and Philip,      is that right? -     A.Yes.

I will get you to show me on the plan where you were
in a moment.  I think at 2.30 it began to fill up, is
that right? - A. Yes.

Describe to me then what it was like at 2.30 and what
happened after that as far as you can remember? - A.
Between 2.30 and 2.45 it started to get quite full and
by about 20-to 3 I would say it was full, you couldn't
get any more people in.There was a     lot of pushing
and shoving, but I just   thought that was the semi­
final, that was the way people acted at the semi­
final.  Then about 5-to 3, 3 o'clock, you just
couldn't move.  It just got too full.

Did you see the team come out pre-kick-off? - A. Yes.

Getting ready for the kick-off I mean? - A. Yes.

Was that the point when you say it was so full that
you could not move any more? - A. Yes.

Or were you still able to move at that point? - A.
Still able to move just a bit, but it wasn't much.

Not much? - A. No.

Did you see them kick off? - A. No.
                                               I SOUTHGATE

You did not see that? - A. No.

Was that because by then things 'were so bad that you
were thinking of other things? - A. Yes.

Were you and Philip together? - A. Yes.

Throughout the whole time? - A. No.  Just after the
kick-off, or when the big surge happened, Philip got
pushed forward and I got pushed sideways, and that was
the last I saw of him.

You have already said there was quite a bit of pushing
and shoving which you were not too worried about
because you thought this was a semi-final big match? -
A. Yes.

But tell me about this big surge now, tell me a little
bit more about that? - A. We were all jammed in and
all of a sudden there just seemed to be a great big
push from behind and then people were flying forward
past me, going sideways and falling over, and that is
when I lost sight of Phil.

Was that after kick-off or not? - A. I couldn't tell
you.

It was after the teams had come out? - A. Yes.

But you cannot say anything else? - A. No.

That is when Philip got carried away, so to speak, and
you were fortunately pushed to the side? - A. Yes.

I have not asked this question of anybody, but when
you were pushed to the side were you as squashed in
that position as you had been, or was it a little bit
better? - A. I think it was a little bit worse.

It was worse there? - A. Yes.

So whatever the reason for it, it was definitely
worse? - A. Yes.

Did you see the match finish at all? - A. No.

How did you get out, as a matter of interest? - A. I
got helped up into the stands.



                                 /Q. Tell me
                                                I . SOUTHGATE



Tell me, was that the position you were in when you were
in this squashed position, or had you moved back up? - A.
I had moved back towards the stands^

Tell me this, by that time when you got to the position
where you could be helped up, do you remember whether at
that time the players were still on the field? - A. They
weren't on the field.

Because by then, of course, things were a little bit
easier for you? - A. Yes.

Having got that far back why did you decide to go up into
the stands instead of going out through the tunnel? - A.
Well, I tried to walk forward to look for Phil, but it
just got too packed.   I got far enough back to be under
the stands but I couldn't go any further back because it
was still packed towards where the gate was.

Which gate are you talking about? -A. The tunnel gate to
get out.

The tunnel was open? - A. I think so, but I can't
remember.

But you felt you couldn't get through that way? - A. No.

Did you know there was an access route?    That there was
a gap at the back of the... - A. No.

So you went up because that for   you was the easiest way
of getting out of the pen? - A.   Yes.

When you say the tunnel, you couldn't get out, did you
actually try and find it was blocked or did you just look
and say, "I think it is easier to go up"? - A. I just
looked and saw it looked like it would be easier to get
helped up into the stands.

Now you have got to mark our little plan.   Can you just
go and show us where you were?   I think you lost Philip
when the teams came out, would that be right? - A. Just
afterwards, yes.

Show me where you were at that point in time.     (The
witness marked the plan

     MRS. PERKINS:    That is C.400.

     THE CORONER:    Are Mr. and Mrs. Hammond here?      Yes.

               Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

When the great big surge came whereabouts did it come?
Go up to the   plan and just point. -A. The surge seemed
to come from   directly behind and I seemed toget pushed
this way and Phil got pushed forward downwards towards
the pitch.

     THE CORONER:   Thank you very much indeed.         I am
very much obliged to you.

     Mr. and Mrs. Hammond, your lad   was very young and it
is very very    sad you have lost him. I have said this
before already I know, but it is still the same.     I
wrote to you to check on Mrs. Hammond's occupation.
Have you sent it back?    In that case we will just use
the note.   It pure formality.

                   JOSEPH GLOVER Sworn

                     By THE CORONER:

You are Joseph Glover? - A. Yes.

Of                     , Walton? - A. Yes.

You are the brother of Ian who unfortunately lost his
life? - A. Yes.

It is our dad at the back? - A. Yes.

You went by car with Ian and others to the match on the
15th April, 1989? - A. Yes.   In my statement I made a
while ago, it was the day after I buried my brother and I
have left a lot of things out of it.

Yes, that is why you have come so you can tell    us.     At
the moment I am trying to find out how you got    to
Sheffield.   You came by car? - A. Yes.

What time did you leave? - A. About eleven o'clock.

You had a ticket? - A. Yes.

Did Ian have   one as well? - A. Yes.

Having left by car, did you drive straight to Sheffield?
- A. Yes.

What time did you arrive in Sheffield? - A. It was
roundabout two o'clock, just after two o'clock.
                                                   J. GLOVER
Did you stop en route at all? - A. No.

That is quite a long time from Walton? - A. Coming up on
the motorway we hit a bit of traffic, there were hold­
ups .

Which way did you come?   Did you cdme across the Passes
or did you come on the motorway? - A. No, on the
motorways.

You were in a car so I assume you weren't stopped and
searched? - A. No.

Did you notice whether the Police were searching coaches
as you were driving along? - A. Well, when we got not too
far away from the ground, I am not sure how many miles it
was, I think we saw a few minibuses getting stopped and
coaches.

Of you just drove on? - A. Yes.

It was of no interest to you.      Having got to Sheffield.
You weren't driving? - A. No.

Somebody else was driving.      Was the car parked up? - A.
Yes.

In fact you parked quite   a long way from the ground? - A.
I think it was a mile or   a mile and a half.

You then had to walk to the ground? - A. Yes.

What time did you arrive at the ground, about? - A. I
couldn't really say.

How long does it take you to walk a mile or a mile and a
half, normally? - A. Ten minutes, fifteen minutes.

That is quite good walking.    Did it take as long as that
or longer? - A. I am not sure.    I think it is at
Penistone...   I am not sure the road we parked in but it
was just a straight walk down.

Don't worry about the time. - A. I am not sure of the
times.

It isn't that important what time you arrived.  I just
like to know if I can find out.   Walking down did you
see other supporters? - A. There were a lot, all walking
towards the ground.

Did you see any of them carrying cans of alcohol? - A.
No.
                                                                     17

         Q. You didn't see any? - A. No.

         Q. None at all? - A. No.
ii
         Q. Do you remember walking past a big roundabout before you
            got into Leppings Lane? - A. No, I can't place it.
     B      Were you checked for alcohol at any point as you were
            coming down? - A. No.

         Q. Did you see whether anybody else was? - A. No.

         Q. Of course you were driving in the car and you hadn't
            stopped from Liverpool to Sheffield? - A. No.

            When you got to the turnstiles, never mind what time it
            was, how did you enter?   Did you enter through a
            turnstile or through a big gate? - A. We entared through
            the turnstiles.

         Q. Do you remember the big outer perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

         Q. You do remember those. - A. As we walked down we got to
            the Leppings Lane turnstiles.   We left Danny, just me
            and Ian, and we joined...   They weren't queues.    There
            was just like a crowd outside the turnstiles.    We joined
            the back at the turnstiles and then a lot of fans started
            coming down and getting behind us.   That is when we
            first started getting into trouble at the turnstiles.
            We started getting crushed at the turnstiles.

            Are you saying you were actually crushed at the
            turnstiles? - A. Yes.

         Q. Did you see any Police horses there? - A. We noticed one.

         Q- Was that outside the perimeter gates or inside the
            perimeter gates when you noticed that? - A. I think it
            was inside.

         Q. Which way on was it to you?    Was it broadways or
            longways on? - A. Long.

         Q. Was he communicating with you or the other people in the
            crowd?   Was he shouting or waving his arms or anything
            that you can remember? - A. No.   I think he was just
            longways by the gates.   There is like a barrier.

           How crushed were you in the area outside the turnstiles?
           - A. It started getting pretty bad.

         Q. Could you feel any pressure from anywhere? - A. Yes.

         Q- Where was it coming from? - A. From the back of us.




H
                                                 J. GLOVER
Did you shout out about pushing or anything at that
point?    Pardon?    I didn't hear you. - A. There were
just crowds coining behind us.   I am not sure how many
turnstiles there are, but there didn't seem to be any
queues or any stewards or anything there.    It was just
people entering the turnstiles to queue up for the match,
but there were no queues.

Did you see any Police Officers outside the turnstiles? -
A. Not outside the turnstiles, no.

You didn't see any? - A. No.

Apart from the mounted Officer you saw no other Police
Officers? - A. I think there might have been two or three
on the side.   There wasn't any outside the turnstiles.

Were they saying or doing anything that you noticed? - A.
No.

I didn't hear your answer to my question when I asked
whether you were shouting out to people not to push.
Did you do that or not outside the turnstiles, you
yourself? - A. Yes.

Did it make any difference as far as you could tell? - A.
I think there was just that many coming down and there
was no-one to stop them.   They just all tried to come
towards the turnstiles to queue up to get in. With there
not being any queues it just formed into a crowd.

I don't know whether you will be able to help me on this
because the perimeter gates were behind you, but did you
notice whether they were open or shut? - A. I didn't
notice.

Did you hear any messages over the tannoy while you were
out there? - A. No.

Did you hear any messages from a Land Rover behind you? -
A. No.

Did you see it by any chance? -   A. No.   Me and Ian had
split up by then as we got into   the entrance to the
turnstiles and he shouted over,   "I'll meet you inside."
As I got through the turnstiles   Ian was waiting inside
for me.

So he had got in before you? - A. He got in before me.

So once you had got through - there is a biggish area
there? - A. Yes.
                                                 J. GLOVER
 Was it quieter in there?   Was it easier? - A. Yes.
 Once you got through the turnstiles, yes.

Were you searched in that area at all? -A. No.

Did you see any Police Officers? - A. No.

None at all? - A. As we got through the turnstiles there
was none on the turnstiles.

Pardon? - A. There was no-one searching at the turnstile
as we went through.

Was anybody searching on any other turnstile? - A. I
couldn t tell you.  The turnstile I went through,there
was no-one on that one.

How long did you stay in this big area behind the
turnstiles? - A. As we got through the turnstiles?

Yes. - A.How do you mean?

Did you go through the turnstile, saw Ian and walked
straight into the ground or did you go to the toilet, did
you buy a programme, did you buy a cup of coffee? - A.
Ian was there waiting for me as I came through we just
went straight down the tunnel.   That was the only
entrance we saw.

Had you been to the ground before? - A. No.

So you could see the tunnel ahead of you? - A.That was
the only place we could see.   Usually as we go through
the tunnel we would usually go towards the left or the
right, to the corner, so we could see.   We would have a
better view with only being small, but we didn't know
there were the dividing fences dividing it into pens.
We just thought it was it was one big area.

When you got to the tunnel entrance on the concourse
side, were you able to see the pitch at all? - A. Through
the tunnel?

Yes. - A. Yes, we just seen the tunnel and like daylight.

But you couldn't see what was happening on the pitch? -
A. No.

Before you left the turnstile area had you noticed...
There was a big gate there, we call it Gate C.   Did you
notice whether that gate was open or shut? - A. I think I
just caught it getting shut, so I presume it had just
been opened.
                                                 J. GLOVER
You actually saw it being shut? - A. Yes.

Did you notice whether a lot of people were still coining
through that gate at that point? - A. No, I just seen
them getting closed.   They were just finished filtering
through.

Are you quite sure that you saw it closed because in your
statement you say you actually saw it being opened?    Was
it being opened or was it being closed? -A. No, it was
being closed.




          Q.   How wide open - when.
                                              J. GLOVER

How wide open - when you first caught a glimpse of it,
okay, let's assume it was being closed, was it at that
point when you saw it being closed wide open, or was it
only a narrow little opening? - A. N.o, it was about
three feet wide.

So it had been opened quite wide? - A. It was as though
it had been open full, people have come in, they have
let a few in and they have sort of like closed it, then
we walked down to the tunnel and went into pen 3.

When you got into pen 3, when you first got into pen 3,
did you have a quick look to see what was happening on
the field? - A. There was nothing happening on the
field.

No one was on it? - A. No.

Now you are quite sure about that? - A. I think the
players had been out, a couple of players, and had just
gone off the pitch as we came in to pen 3.

You are quite sure - I am going back to the gate,
because you say the gate had been wide open and was
being shut, you are quite certain about that? - A. Yes.

And yet when you got out of the tunnel there was nobody
on the field? - A. I think they had just left the
field, yes.

Kick-off had not taken place yet? - A. No, it must have
been about 20-to-3 by the time we came in, 25-to.   I am
not sure of the times but it was a while before the
players came out.

How long did it take you, once you got to Leppings
Lane, when you joined the crowd, how long did it take
you to get through? Have you any idea? - A. I couldn't
tell you, no.

The reason why I ask you this is that if the gate had
been wide open and it was being shut, we know from the
video, at least we think we know, that that gate was
opened at 8-minutes-to-3. - A. No, it was before that.

And it was shut at 3-minutes-to-3. - A. No, it was
before that.  I would say the gate had been open before
that.

Okay, so you went through, you think, at about 20-to.
You don't know but you think it was about 20-to? - A.
Yes, it was about that time, yes.

You thought the players had left the field? - A. Yes.
                                               J. GLOVER

But not pre kick-off? - A. No, not pre kick-off, no.

You are right, there were players on the field at about
20-to-3 or thereabouts, and they wer^e going off at
about that time.   Did you actually see them disappear
off   the field or is that an assumption you have made? -
A. That was an assumption, yes.

You   are not sure, okay. So you got into pen 3, yes?
Did  you see at that point a beach ball being knocked
about? - A. I am not sure.   I can't remember, no.

You can't remember, or you didn't see it? - A. I can't
remember, no.  I never seen it.

Sorry? - A. I can't remember, no.

Did you hear the players being announced over the
tannoy? - A. No.

You didn't hear that? - A. No, I never heard it, no.

Sorry? - A. I never heard it, no.

You didn't hear it, okay.  Did you see the players come
out before the kick-off for their .... - A. No, by that
time in pen 3 me and Ian, we were worried, before the
players came out.

Yes, I will come to that.  I am just trying to find out
what you saw.  Did you see .... - A. No, I never seen
the players come out.

Did you see any players on the pitch at any time? - A.
Just after kick-off or ....

So you saw them at that .... - A. I ended up on the
pitch.

Did you see them before you ended up on the pitch? - A.
No.

Right, so you came out - now we will go back to your
story - you came out into pen 3, you say? - A. Yes.

Tell me in your words what happened.  You and Ian were
together, right? - A. We went into pen 3, sort of like
got through the crowd, took up positions to the right
of the gate.

Fairly near the front, were you? - A. Fairly near the
front, yes, and then we sort of like, I think it was
like a surge, we sort of like just got pushed over a
bit and then it just started getting tighter where you
                                                            23

     couldn't move.  You were just crushed against people,
     where you couldn't move at all.  Then Ian was, you
     could see as though he was choking.

Q. Sorry? - A. You could see him as though he was choking.
   As I was looking at him, he just, I couldn't explain
   it, his face was changing, and I couldn't move.  His
   face just kept changing.

Q.   That is what you can remember, isn't it? - A.   Yes.
     Just changing colour in his face.

Q.    What happened after that? Was thatwhile you    were
     still in the pen or had you already left it when you
     saw his face change? - A. It was just before leaving
     the pen.    I was right by him and then there was a lad
     in front of us who vomited.    There was a lad in front
     of us who vomited on his jumper and there was another
     lad who fell onto the floor ....

0. Have a little drink of water. - A. Could I just have a
   break for a minute?

Q. Yes, by all means.  Just leave us for a few minutes and
   settle yourself down.

                 (The Witness left the Court)

          THE CORONER:   Ladies and gentlemen, I should
     perhaps, while he has gone, say that on the whole I do
     not insist on relatives giving evidence.  Basically
     where a relative gives evidence it is because he wants
     us.  Of course this poor young boy is obviously very
     distressed but I don t want you to think that I have
     made him give evidence against his will and indeed, if
     he were to say to me now, "I have had enough, I don't
     want to say any more", I would stop because we have
     plenty of evidence from other people and we can piece
     it together.

          On the other hand, it is only fair that if
     somebody was there who is a relative and he wants to
     give evidence, that he ought to be given that
     opportunity, otherwise quite rightly he will feel, "Why
     wasn t I allowed to speak?", so we will wait for him to
     settle down and then I might, in fact, ask him whether
     he wants to carry on.  I suspect he does want to carry
     on.

          While we are waiting, can I mention something else
     to do with Rule 37 and documentary evidence?  You will
     have noticed that I was asking earlier whether Mrs.
     Hammond had filled in a form which I had sent to her,
     to do with names and things of that nature.  What I
intend to do is right at the end we are going to have a
wad of these, and in fact those of you who were here in
April/May time may remember that with every single case
I referred to the form which I sent „out, where I asked
people to check that we had got the names and the
spellings right.  As far as I can see reading the
transcripts I don't think I actually said in so many
words, "and I admit these forms as documentary
evidence", so I think for the sake of good order, and
so that we have got a complete picture, rather than
just viva voce exchanges across the Court, right at the
end what I propose to do is to admit these documents as
documentary evidence.  I don't propose unless you
insist that I read them all out in detail.   I will
probably read one so that you know the format in which
they were.  They contain basically name, address,
occupation, date of birth, a little bit of information
about the GP which is not actually relevant but when we
did them we thought we might need that so we thought we
would get it.

      I am quite certain that these matters will not and
cannot actually be disputed, but I don't intend to do
it now, I will do it right at the end at a convenient
point, and finally, while I am on documentary evidence,
because of the way we took the medical evidence, you
will recollect those of you who were there, that I had
the pathologists.   Normally I get the pathologist to
produce his PM report and say, "Here it is, I produce
it", but for some reason I did not use my standard
formula and again, just as with these forms, certainly
in some cases, in fact, probably most, I did not
actually refer to the typed PM report, and again
similarly I intend to produce them as a wad, simply so
that the information forms part and parcel of the
Inquest proceedings.   All the information that is
relevant was given viva voce and in fact as far as I
know everybody who has wanted a copy of the PM reports
has had one anyway, but I take it that will be
acceptable?   I hope it will be acceptable to all of you
because I will be reluctant to read 95 PM reports in
full.

     MR. PAYNE:    Thank you for that information.   The
procedure certainly would be acceptable to us.    I think
I can speak for everybody.   I don^t think anybody will
dissent from that.

     THE CORONER:   I will probably do it right at the
end, or at some point when I know that I have got five
or ten minutes, when I have got them here.  It is just
dotting "i's" and crossing "t's", so that the record
for the future is complete, rather than having little
gaps in it.

     Is the witness settling, Sergeant Killoch?

     MR. KILLOCH:   No, sir.  The social worker asks if
you could possibly take the next witness, to give Mr.
Glover a little time to settle down.  He does wish to
continue.

     THE CORONER    He does want to continue?
     MR. KILLOCH    Yes, but not at this very moment.
     THE CORONER    I                     don t like splittin
like that but I think in the interests of time, I am
sure it won't confuse you, so let's have Mr. King.

  -                                        v
jj|Q. There were not many people, do you say? - A. No, just
      a few streams of people walking.

      Q. Sit forward please.  Can you say that again? - A.
         Just a constant, like, a few streams of people.
         There wasn't many though.

      Q. You were not impressed with the numbers in fact? - A.
         No.

      Q. Did it surprise you that there were what sounds like
         relatively few people? - A. I didn't really think
         about it.  They were dotted all over the place
         really.

      Q. You had no problems getting to the ground? - A. No.

      Q. Because you knew the way? - A. The others did.

      Q. There was somebody in the group who knew? - A. Yes.

      Q. Had you been to the ground before? - A. No.

      Q. You yourself I mean? - A. No.

      Q. In fact, I think you did not see many fans and you
         did not see many or any Police Officers either, is
         that right, or at least you have no recollection of
         seeing them? - A. Not until I got to the ground, no.

      Q. That means, I take it, that you were not stopped or
         searched or anything? - A. No.

      Q. When you were driving along, getting here, did you
         see coaches and minibuses being stopped and searched
         at all? - A. Only off the end of the motorway.

      Q. I am not asking you what happened but you saw that
         there were Police and that they were doing something?
         - A. Yes.

      Q. You then approached the Leppings Lane entrance, is
         that right? - A. Yes.

      Q. Did you turn left into it or right into it, can you
         remember? - A. I can't remember, no.

          . Had you come down a little hill and across a little
            bridge? - A. That is the one, yes.
_    I                            V
jj | Q. What met your eye when you approached it briefly? -
        A. The lack of Police really.

     | Q. Pardon? - A. The lack of Police really because the
          others were talking about the year before about there
          being a cordon near the ground and so I was expecting
          that m y se lf.

          . You, of course, did not know what had happened the
            year because you had not been there? - A. Yes.

          . Where were they describing the cordon? Can you
            remember where it was? - A. A few hundred yards away
            from the ground.

         Q. They were saying that the previous year that had
            happened? - A. Yes, and they were checking tickets.

Dj       Q- Pardon? - A. They were checking your tickets and
            stopping you.

         Q. That did not happen? - A. No.

         Q. You say you saw no Policemen at all? - A. Only at the
            ground.

          . On the way down you saw none at all? - A. No.

         Q. You are sure about that? - A. Yes, positive.

         Q. Once you got to the ground do you remember the big
            perimeter gates? - A. Yes.

         Q. Do you remember those? - A. Yes.

         Q. Did you manage to get through those without any
            difficulty or not? - A. Yes, it was okay going into
            it.

         Q.    There was not a big crowd in front of it at that
              point in time? - A. Not when we first got there,     no.

         Q.    Do you know what time it was when you first got
              there? - A. It must have been twenty five past or
              half past.

         Q. At that point you say there was not a big crowd? - A.
            Not very big, no, just normal.

         Q. What about people within the turnstile area, the
            people between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles
                                                                        29

                                                                R. B. KING

            themselves? Was that quiet at that time when you
*’   1      first got there? - A. When I got there first, no.

         Q. Pardon? - A. Not when we first got there, no.

         Q. I take it you then aimed for the turnstiles, is that
            right? - A. Yes.

         Q. What happened then? - A. People just seemed to come
            from nowhere and that was it.  It was just a big
            crowd.  I mean, I don't know where they came from.

 C j Q- You are saying there was a sudden build up? - A. Yes.

         Q. Can you time it? Do you know how long you had been
            there when that happened? - A. Only a couple of
            minu tes.

         Q. It was sudden from what you say? - A. Yes.

         Q. You mentioned that you did see some Police Officers
            at the turnstiles.  Where were they? - A. There was
            one outside on horseback and one inside      the perimeter
            fencing on horseback.  There was two at the side of
            the turnstiles.

     Q. On horses or      on foot? - A. No, on foot.

     Q. Were there any in front of the turnstiles that you
        noticed? - A. I can't recall any, no.

     Q. There is a little barrier at     the side.     Do you
        remember that? - A. Yes.

     Q. What were people doing in relation to that barrier
        that you can remember? - A. Once it got a bit crowded
        and there was no queues as such and the perimeter
        fencing, people were trying to get underneath it.

pj   Q. To join in? - A. Yes.

     Q. Would you call that pushing in or not? - A. Not
        really, no.    Not at first, I mean, but itgot that
        crowded that   people didn't want them in. Then it
        started pushing.

     Q. Let me put it this way; were these people who were
        ducking under trying to get in front of the people
        who were already standing in the area? - A. I
        wouldn't say they were trying to get in front.  I am
        just saying that they didn't want to come round the
        other way, the proper way, because it was easier to
        get through that way.
                                                                 30

                                                         R. B. KING

      . The Officers that you saw, did you form any
        impression as to what activity they were engaged in,
        what they were doing? - A. The two a t the side?
B
      . However many you saw? - A. They were just standing
        there really.

     Q. Doing nothing? - A. No.

     Q. Did you think they could do that? - A. Yes.

     Q. Pardon? - A. I think they could, yes.

     Q. Were the Officers being spoken to by the crowd? - A.
        People were shouting at them, yes.

     Q. What were they saying? — A. Things like, to stop
        these people getting in.

     Q. In other words, people were objecting to other people
        going underneath that barrier? - A. Yes.

      . You were not objecting? - A. I didn't have much
        choice.  I was sort of in the middle of it but I
        could see them getting through.

      . You did not mind that happening? - A. They weren't
        affecting me by pushing these other people and so I
        didn't really have any objection, no.

E|   Q- I want to just double check this and can you have a
        look at page three of your statement and read from,
        "I could see"? Read it to yourself first of all? -
        A. Yes.

     Q. To the end of the first paragraph which is quite a
        long one? - A. Yes.

     Q. That differs a little bit from what you have been
        telling me at the moment.  Having read that, is that
        correct or is it not? - A. Yes.

        Do you stand by it or not, that is really what I am
        asking you? - A. Yes.

     Q. You do stand by it? - A. Yes.

     Q. Could you read it out aloud then from "I could
        see"? - A. Yes.  It says:

            "I could see two Police Officers standing
            behind the barrier at the side of the
            turnstile.  People were just ducking under
            the barrier to get to the front of the crowd
    and these Officers weren't doing anything
    about it.   In truth, there were so many
    people just pushing and shoving all the time
    that there wasn't a lot they could have done.
    It took about ten minutes or so to get to the
    turnstile because I just didn't have any
    control over where I was going.   I don't even
    know if people were showing their tickets. I
    got to the turnstile and handed m y ticket in.
    I got the other side and within a couple of
    minutes we had all got together again.   I saw
    three or four Police Officers spaced in
    between the turnstiles and they were taking a
    lot of verbal abuse from fans complaining
    about people climbing over the top of the
    turnstiles.   We were standing next to a large
    concertina gate which was at the side of the
    turnstile we had just come through when I saw
    a Police Officer open the gate to its full
    extent and a mass of people just rushed in.
    Some made their way to the tunnel that leads
    to the terracing but a lot of them just stood
    in a clearing behind the turnstiles.   At that
    point we decided we had better get a decent
    view.  We went for the tunnel because we
    thought it was the only way to get to the
    terracing."

It is possible I may have misread this when I read it
a moment ago. Are you saying that the three or four
Police Officers spaced between the turnstiles were on
the inside? - A. On the inside, yes.

I thought you meant   they were on the outside?     - A.
No.

You were within the concourse area when   you saw    the
big gate open? - A. Yes, that is right.

Having seen that, you decided that it was time to get
in? - A. Yes.

What time would you have estimated that was? We know
what time the gate opened but what time did you
estimate it was? - A. Ten to three, something like
that , quarter t o .

You are pretty close actually.  You then made your
way towards the tunnel I take it? - A. Yes.

The whole lot of you, ten of you I think? - A. No,
not ten of us, no.  There was only five of us went to
the turnstiles.
What was the tunnel like when you went through? - A.
The tunnel was empty or fairly empty, you know, a few
people walking through.              „

You found it quite easy to walk through? - A. Yes.

At a normal pace? - A. Yes.

You did not have to shuffle or anything like that?    -
A. No.

Could you see the pitch from before you set off?
When I say that we know it can be seen but did you
actually see it? - A. You can see the pitch from the
tunnel, y e s .

Did you see whether players were already on it or
not? - A. No, I didn't see the players on.

I think you traversed the tunnel really without any
difficulty and without any concern? - A. Yes.

That would be right, would it not? - A.   Yes.

When you came out of the tunnel which side did you go
in? Which pen were you going to go into, the right
or left? - A. The right hand side as you look at the
pi t c h .

Pen 3? - A. Yes.




                   /Q. As soon as you got out of the.
                                                 R. B. KING

 As soon as you got out of the tunnel how did that pen
 look to you at that point? - A. „Just like a normal
 game.  You just had to shuffle to get a bit of a
 position to see.

 So at that point you just thought this was a normal
 game? - A. Yes.

Did you look at the    pitch at that point,   can you
remember? - A. No.

You were busy getting through? - A. Yes.

So you do not know whether the players were on it or
not? - A. No.

Did you see them come on at all? - A. No, I did not
see them come on.

Did you see any part of the game? -    A. No.

Did you   see the kick-off? - A. No.

So you know nothing about what was going on? - A. No.

In fact, you had a bit of a job getting through the
crowd initially, did you not? - A. Yes.

But you took this as people just standing? - A. I just
thought they were standing in the way.

Because that is a good position, is it not, near the
top there? - A. Yes.

You did   not know anything about theradial fences,
that is   right, is it not? - A. No, Ididn't know   about
them.

How far were you able to get?  It sounds to me from
what you say as if you were actually making your way
to where you wanted to go, is that right? - A. Yes.

Eric, I think, was ahead of you? - A. Yes.

By how much? - A. Only an arm's length.

I see, so you were still together as a group.  You
were coming through as a group of five, would that be
fair? - A. Yes.

Tell me then what happened? - A. Just all of a sudden
you just got squashed in, you just couldn't move.  You
didn't know why you weren't moving.  You didn't know
whether it was people just weren't bothered moving or
                                              R. B. KING

 what, like, you know.  So with not being able to move
 any further I started thinking there was something
 wrong, you know.

You started what? - A. I just started thinking to
myself there was something wrong, it wasn't right, you
know, and you could feel more people coming in behind
you.  So I just said to the lads, like, "They've got
to open that  gate soon, get down there because they'll
have to move   some of them".

I cannot hear you very well. - A. I said, "They'll
have to move   some of this crowd, so just get to the
gate in front".

     MR. ISAACS:  I am sorry, sir, could he repeat
that because I did not get it.

     THE CORONER:    Could you just repeat that answer?
- A. From where?

     MR. ISAACS:  I think it was "I said to my mate,
'We'll have to move ..." and I couldn't hear any more.

     THE CORONER:  You repeat it.  I think I heard
what you said. - A. I said to them, "They'll have to
open the gates soon to ease the crowd a bit".

When you say the gates, do you mean the gates at the
front? - A. Yes.

Had you seen that? - A. Yes.

You could see it? - A. Yes.

At that point you were, of  course,     notaware   thata
tragedy was going to occur, were you? - A. No.

You just thought that there were too many people and
some had to get out? - A. Yes.

Did you then make your way towards the gate? - A. I
started to, yes.

Were you still able to make forward progress atthat
point yourself? - A. Only a little bit, yes.

Did you   see it being opened? - A. No.

You did   not see it being opened? - A. No.

Did you see it open at any point? - A. Only when I got
on the pitch, if that is what you mean.
                                            R. B. KING

Did you get out through the gate? - A. Yes, I got out
through the gate.

So you cannot say when it opened, because you did not
see anything of the game either? - A. No.

Having got onto the pitch was the game in play at that
point? - A. Yes.

It was still in play? - A. Yes.

Can you remember whether, after you were on the pitch-,
Beardsley hit the cross-bar, after you went out, do
you remember that at all? - A. I don't know.  Looking
at it afterwards, I think it happened while I was in
the pen because there was a big cheer.

A big cheer? - A. Yes.  It got even more squashed
then, people moved forward, but I don't know what
happened.

So would that mean that the game finished almost
immediately after you got out, would that be right? -
A. Yes, it must have done.

All your friends, apart from Chris and Eric, were with
you when you got to the pitch? - A. That is right,
yes.

So you had managed to come through as a 5-some, so to
speak? - A. Yes.

And then get through towards the gate and out as a 3-
some? - A. Yes.

You lost two? - A. Yes.

Chris was okay in the end, was he not? - A. Yes.

But Eric of course,as we know, unfortunately lost    his
life.  - A. Yes.

When you were on the pitch side, were you asked to
move into one of the other pens? - A. Yes - well,
pushed along to the other pen, yes.

Encouraged? - A. If that is what you call it.

Whichever word you wish to use.  You can use whatever
word.  It is you who are giving the evidence. - A.
Well, I call it pushed because I doubled over, I was
in pain and I was pushed along to the other pen.
                                            R. B. KING

Did you, in fact, enter it or not, can you remember? -
A. I went into the other pen, y$s.

Which one was it? Do you know which one it was? - A.
As you look towards the pitch it was the right-hand
side one.

Right in the corner was it? - A. Yes.

How much control over your own movements did you have?
- A. When we first started moving down the crowd I had
all of it, but just all of a sudden you didn't have
much.  You didn't have anything really.  What we did,
we had hold of each other's shirts, or whatever, first
but you just couldn't do that.

So what you are saying is initially you did have
control over your movements when you first made your
way into the pen and forced your way through the
people who you thought just were not moving? - A. Yes.

Then there was a surge, is that right, and the
movement became more involuntary, is that right? - A.
Yes.

Then it sounds to me as if you are saying that you
then decided you were going to aim for the gate? - A.
Yes.

And you did manage, in fact the three of you managed,
to find your way through the crowd to get to that
gate, would that be right? - A. Yes.

Did you get through them or over them? - A. I got
through the gates.

No, no, the crowd.  Did you climb over people's heads,
or did you manage to work your way through? - A.  It
was just luck, we just got directed that way.

Show us on the plan where you were when you had forced
your way through - go up to the acetate - and before
the surge began.

     MRS. PERKINS:   C401.

     THE CORONER:  Mark with a cross the position
where you were when you and Eric and the others were
together as a 5-some up to what point you were able to
make progress of your own volition, so to speak. - A.
About there all together. (Witness marks plan

You are saying that at that point it then became so
tight that you had to move forward, or did it become
                                               R. B. KING

 so tight further on? - A. It became tight there, but
 not to the extent later.

Okay, show me where you were when it became so tight
that you decided you had to move towards the gate.
Mark that with a *2 * would you? You had better mark
the first one with a '1' so that we do not get
confused. (Witness marks p l a n ) From there you then got
down to the gate, is that right? - A. We started to go
to the gate then.

You managed to get out just before the match finished,
as far as you remember? - A. Yes.

Are you saying that from that position down to the
gate you were actually able to make progress on your
own volition then? - A. No, not really.  You were just
leaning forward towards that gate.

Okay, thank you.  Just one more question, from me that
is.  Can you say how long it took you to get from that
position which you have marked, the second one, to
getting out of the gate? - A. I haven't got a clue.

You have given a time in the statement, but are you
saying that was a pure guess? - A. Yes, just guesswork
- a few minutes.

A few minutes, but you do not really know? - A. No.

           Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Have you given a time for your arrival into Pen 3?     I
have got 10-to 3? - A. Yes, about 10-to 3.

Looking at the plan which you have just marked on the
screen, can you give an estimate of how long it would
have taken you to shuffle and push your way through to
position No.2? - A. A few minutes.

At that time, at position No.2, were you still
together with your friends? - A. Yes.   I thought we
were all there, but there was apparently only four of
us because Chris had got pulled up into the stands.
He stayed at the back.

So at position No.2 a few minutes after 10-to 3 there
were four of you? - A. Yes.

Then between that time   and just before thegame ended,
you and two others made your way down the pen to Gate
3, is that straight down? — A. I don't know what
course we took.  We just got to the gate.
                                                                 38
                                                        R. B. KING

     Q.   You were aiming to get to Gate 3? - A. Yes.
    Q.
B         And you  got out onto the field together, did you? - A.
          Not all of us, no.

    Q.    Three of you did, did you? - A. Three of us did, yes.

    Q.    How did you manage to get through the crowd? - A.
          Pushing.  It got to that point where you were just
          leaning towards it and hoping you would get there.

          Did the three of you stay together during the journey?
          - A. At first we did, but then you just had to let go
          of each other just to keep your own balance because
          you could feel yourself going and being pushed over
          and your feet going.

          The Jury has heard a lotof evidence that at about
          that time, aflter 3 o'clock, there were people
          shouting to push back. - A. Yes.

          And there were some policemen standing on the
          perimeter fence signalling to push back.  Did you see
          that? - A. Yes, at first I did, yes.

    Q.    You did. - A. I mean I didn't take much notice of it,
          I didn't know what it was for at first.

    Q.    I am sorry? - A. I didn't know why they were shouting
          "Push back" at first.  I just thought that people
          weren't filling the gaps, or perhaps they might have
          been.

          You did not know why they were shouting "Push back"? -
          A. You didn't really think that there wasn't any gaps
          in there, you know.

          Actually you and your friends were doing the opposite:
          you were pushing forward? - A. Well, we were pushing
          sideways at first, yes, to go along the side because
          from where we were standing at the first point you
          could see the gaps at the other side of that fence, so
          we were just going along trying to get a bit of a gap
          there.

    Q.    Yes, but when you decided to go for the gate, you were
          pushing forwards? - A. Yes.

    Q.    What effect did this have on the people in front of
          you? - A. I don't know.  I suppose they were getting
          crowded as well.  We were getting crushed and they
          must have been getting crushed, yes.
                                               R. B. KING

You three succeeded in getting through the crowd and
onto the field? - A. Yes.




                             /Q.   Could you
     MR. PAYNE:      Could you put up 276?

On your journey with the three of you going down the pen,
did you see any injured people? -A. We didn't see
anything really.    It was just thatvcrushed you just
wanted to get out.     I didn't really take any notice of
anything round me because you just didn't think you were
going to get out, up to that point when you didn't think
you were getting out.

             Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

I think you told us, Mr. King, that you had had three
pints or so to drink? - A. I said three pints.   I didn't
say "or so".

I think it was perhaps the Coroner who may be said "or
so".   It was three pints?

     THE CORONER:     I may have said "or so"   Three pints
it was? - A. Yes.

     MR. ISAACS:   In the period between 12.30 and 2.15
or thereabouts? - A. Yes.

Did other members of your group have about the same? - A.
Yes.

You recollect when   you got to the turnstile area, now
that our statement   has been shown to you, that people
were ducking under   the barrier to get to the front ofthe
crowd and that was   causing other people to complain? - A.
Yes.

Were those people at the front of the crowd, the people
who were complaining? - A. More or less, yes.    They were
at the side as well, at the side of the barrier.

It was quite clear to you at that time that the people
ducking under the barrier were trying to push in? - A.
Yes.

That was clearly making things far more difficult than
they already were? - A. Yes.

You eventually got out of the tunnel and when you got to
the top of the terrace to you, looking down, it looked
like a terrace for a normal big game? - A. Yes.

Mr. King, are you an experienced football fan? - A. Yes.

You go to plenty of games? - A. Yes.
                                                                 41
                                                        R. B. KING

    Q. Big games? - A. Yes.

    Q. And usually stand on the terraces? - A. Yes.

    Q. So to have to shuffle through, as ydu told us, to get a
B      decent position, that was quite normal for you? - A. At
       first it was, yes.

    Q. The fact it took you some time to get through again
       seemed quite normal? - A. Through where?

    Q. Well, you said it took you some time to get through, but
       you took that to be because people were just standing in
       the way? - A. Yes.

                    Cross-Examined by MR. HUMPHREYS:

         Mr. King, you have just been asked if it was normal for
         you to shuffle through.   That was the initial time when
         you got into the pen? - A. Yes.

    Q. Would it be a fair summary of your evidence to say that
       from the time you got to point 2 to the time you got out
       on to the perimeter of the pitch, that you had lost
       control of your own movements? - A. That's right.

         Was it a case of your pushing down, being pushed down, or
         what? - A. I think it was pushing down, trying to get
         out.    You couldn't go backwards, that is what I am
         saying.

              MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, did he say "I was pushing down
         trying to get out"?

              THE CORONER:   I couldn't hear him.   I was just
         going to ask him what he did say:

    Q. Could you just repeat it? - A, From point 2 I was trying
       to get out, yes.

    Q. The question Mr. Humphreys was asking you was that from
       point 2 to the gate were you being pushed by others or
       were you yourself making a conscious effort to get out?
       A. Oh, no, you were being pushed, yes.   You were being
       pushed from all angles.

    Q.        MR. HUMPHREYS:   So the first summary that you had
         lost control of your movements was the correct one? - A.
         I am sorry, I don't understand.

    Q.   I asked you a little earlier on whether from point 2 to
         going through the gate it was a fair summary of your




H
evidence to say that you had lost control of your
movements? - A. Yes, more or less.

In other words, you were being pushed along? - A. Yes.

Tell me this:  you got in there and at first it seemed
normal, but fairly shortly after that about the time you
got to point 2 on the plan, I think, you realised
something was wrong? - A. Yes.

Your instinct or your thought process was - and I want to
clarify this because Mr. Isaacs didn't quite hear it - I
think what you actually said was, "There is something
wrong here.   They will have to let people out.   Go to
the gate." - A. Yes.

You could see that when you got in there, within moments?
- A. By the time I got to point 2, yes.

            Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL:

Mr. King do you remember that in the course of giving
your evidence you looked through part of your statement
and the Coroner having clarified with you that that was
in accordance with what you recall, you read out part of
it? - A. Yes.

At one point, perhaps because I wasn't writing fast
enough, you referred to being just inside the turnstiles
when Gate C was opened and a mass of people rushed in? -
A. Yes.

Then when you were giving live evidence a little later
rather than reading from your statement, you described
how five of you went to the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Was that ahead of, with, or a little after the mass of
people who rushed in through Gate C? - A. It was ahead
of.

So you saw the rush of people coming in... - A. When we
got to the tunnel and looked back, yes.

So you weren't by the turnstiles? - A. We met up inside
the turnstiles and they started opening the gates.   We
just headed for the tunnel and when we looked back the
gate was open.

I'm sorry, I misunderstood what you were saying before.
Can I finally deal with one small matter?   From point 2
that you have identified on the plan, your movement to
get out of the gate and on to the perimeter track, you
have told us you were aiming and intending to get out and
                                                                43
                                                        R. B. KING

       that you were pushing to get out, is that right? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. You then also said that you were being pushed from all
       angles? - A. Yes.
B
    Q. Is this right:  notwithstanding you were being pushed
       from all angles you were able to decide that you were
       going to head for the gate, is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q. You were able to head for the gate? - A. Yes.

    Q. Notwithstanding you were being pushed from all angles? -
       A. Yes.

            MR. RUSSELL:   Thank you.    I just wanted that
       clarification.

                       Further by THE CORONER:

    Q. This is quite an important point, you see, because you
       have actually agreed to - well, not four different
       propositions but to propositions on four different
       occasions which aren t all the same, so it is important
       to get it right.    When Mr. Humphreys put it to you he
       asked were your movements entirely involuntarily and you
       said yes, or words to that effect.     When Mr. Payne put
       it to you earlier he said, "How did you make your way
       through?"    You said, "I pushed my way through."    Now it
       may, of course, be a combination of those two things, but
       what I want to know at this stage is when you decided at
       point 2 you didn't like it and that the thing to do was
       to get out and you were going to get out through the
       gate, did you make your own way and were you able to get
       through the crowd using your own power to do so? - A.
       Well, what I did was sort of leaned towards the gate and
       I got there.    That is all I know.    I got there.   I was
       just leaning.    I mean, you didn't have any power.    You
       didn't have your feet on the floor, if that is what you
       mean, so you were able to push.     You couldn't push with
       your arms.    It was just your bodily weight you were
       pushing with.

    Q. You are saying that it was entirely...   You see, I am a
       bit concerned about your replies because they varied.
       Have a look at this page of your statement.   Can you
       find page 4?   If you look at about line 11, which says,
       "I realised that someone..." - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you stop en route at all? - A. No.




H
                                                  R. B. KING

Read from there down to "I didn't see who had opened it",
to yourself first to make sure you are happy with it. -
A. Yes.

You are happy with that, are you? -"A. Yes.

Read it to us then. - A. Yes:

     "I realised that   someone would have to open thegate
     at some stage to   relieve the pressure and I was
     shouting to the lads to try and get to the gate.    I
     was really being   crushed by this time but somehow I
     managed to forced my way over towards the gate. It
     took about five minutes or so for me to get there
     and then I got a few yards away from it.    I was
     aware that it had been opened although I didn't who
     had opened it."

Yes, read the next line. - A. "I spilled through the gate
on to the pitch and I immediately saw Steve Brown and
Graham England in front of me."

Now what I want to know is is this a correct description
of what actually happened as far as you were concerned? -
A. Yes.

If not, do you want to modify it in any way? - A. No,
it's all right.

That is right? - A. Yes.

Now the jury has asked me to ask you a question as well.
The question is this:  when you realised the situation
was not normal when you were at point 2, did you think it
would be easier to go back to the tunnel? - A. At first I
thought that but you just couldn't get backwards.

You couldn't get backward? - A. No.

You did think of that? - A. Yes.      We were nearer to the
tunnel than the front.

Yes, that is what is probably in the jury's mind.   Just
tell me this:  what stopped you going back towards the
tunnel? - A. Well, you just couldn't get through any way.
They were packed tight.

Are you saying it was tighter behind you than in front? -
A. Yes, at first it was.   It looked easier to get to the
front than it certainly was to get to the back.
                                                               45
                                                     R. B. KING

          MR. PAYNE:   Sir, in view of the evidence which is
     in the statement which you have just read out, I wonder
     if this witness would be kind enough to look at another
     set of photographs?   What I would like the Officer to
     do is to put up one after the other the photographs
     which cover the five minute period during which this
     witness was pushing his way, with his two friends, down
     from position 2 to gate C, so that he can see what the
     condition of the crowd was like at that time.

          THE CORONER:    Which ones are they?

          MR. PAYNE:     326, it starts.   It is 326 to 330.

Q.        THE CORONER:   Can you find 326 in the folder.  It
     is easier for you, it saves you turning round, and they
     are also slightly better quality.  Can you help the
     witness?

             Further Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

0. We know from your evidence that you and your friends
   got out onto the field just before the game was
   stopped, and we know that the game was stopped at 5-
   minutes—past—3 and 20 seconds, 24 seconds, so we are
   looking at the five minutes before that.  Now, 326 and
   then look at 327.  These are the photographs which show
   what the crowd was like during that five minutes. - A.


Q. Then 328.  In these photographs can you see whereabouts
   gate C is, Mr. King? - A. Just about, yes.

Q. You can? - A. Yes.

Q. So then look at 329 and then 330. - A. I c a n ’t see it
   now.

Q. You see the condition of the crowd in those pens during
   that five minutes? - A. Mmm.

Q. Is the Jury to understand from your evidence that
   during that time you and your three friends were
   forcing your way down from position 2 to gate 3 through
   the crowd? - A. The last   two photos?

Q. The last two. - A. I was      out by then.

Q. You were out by 330.  329, the players are still there,
   the game is just being stopped.   Which of the
   photographs show how thick the crowd was when you were
   pushing your way down to   the gate? - A.When Iwas
   pushing my way? Well when I was pushing myway    to the
   gate there wasn't anyone on the pitch.
                                                              46
                                                       R. B. KING

    Q. I am   asking you   to look at the density of the crowd
       that   you pushed   through? - A. I can't really tell you
       from   looking at   the photo how thick the crowd is. All
       as I   know is it   was packed tight.   ,,
B   Q.        THE CORONER:   Okay, that is fair enough.  What
         you are saying is that when you started your movement
         down towards the gate, you have no recollection of
         anybody being on the pitch side of the ...? - A. No.

    Q. Forgive me, I just want to check this.  When you, were
       actually outside, when you had got through, did you say
       you do remember Beardsley hitting the crossbar or riot,
       I can't remember? - A. No, I donYt remember.  I don't
       remember anything of the game.

    Q. No, but you do remember that the game finished almost
       immediately after you came out? That is what you told
       me, and I just want to be sure that we have got that
       right? - A. Yes.

    Q. \ou   are sure about that? - A. As far as I am concerned,
       all   as I seen when I got on the pitch was my two mates
       and   Bruce Grobbelaar was looking back.  I presumed it
       had   stopped.

    Q. I see.  It is very difficult with times, I know that.
       That is why we like, if possible, to get the witness to
       say he saw this or that, because it is much easier, but
       if you did not see it you did not see it, that's all
       there is to it.  Okay, Mr. King, thank you very much
       indeed.

              THE CORONER:   I think Mr. Glover is ready to
         carry on, so we will go back to Mr. Glover.

                        JOSEPH GLOVER Recalled

                     By THE CORONER (Continued)

    Q. Okay, Mr. Glover? - A. Yes.

    Q. Now, I think you and Ian were on the terrace, you were
       telling me, and I seem to remember you said that you
       could not really remember what was going on, on the
       field, at all? - A. No.

    Q. But do you remember the little gate which leads onto
       the field? - A. Yes.

    Q. You do remember that, and I think I am right in saying
       that you managed to get out of that, fortunately? - A.
       Yes.

                                               J. GLOVER

Were you able to walk out?  Did you walk out through
it? - A. It was more like a scramble.

Do you know whether you were one of „the first people to
get out or not? - A.   No, not the first.

Can you remember it   opening? - A. Yes, it   opened, I
think about ten people got out, and closed.   Then it
opened again and I got out.

What was the time interval between the two openings,
can you remember? - A. I can't say, no.

Okay.  I can't remember, as soon as you got out you
turned round to look for your brother, didn't you? Is
that right? - A. By the gate, before I got out the gate
I could feel myself   standing on someone. There is like
steps, I got out of   the gate but after standing on
someone.  Then I got onto the pitch and just went
straight for my brother because I knew where he was,
then I climbed on the fence, just trying to pull the
fence down or reach over, shouting to him to move.   He
was saying he couldn't.

You were actually shouting to him, you were talking to
him? - A. Yes.  He was just talking back dead faint.
You could see his eyes just closing in front of me.

Did he speak to you at that point?   Was he speaking to
you? - A. Dead faint.

Pardon? - A. Dead faint.   His voice was sort of like
going, yes.

In fact, you have looked at a lot of photographs and
you have found yourself on a lot, haven't you? - A.
Yes.

Did you start calling to your brother as soon as you
got out or was there a little time while you had to get
your breath and sort yourself out? - A. Just a matter
of seconds.

So almost immediately you .... - A. I knew where he was
straightaway, yes.

Yes, because you had been with him, of course. - A.
Yes.  Before I did get out there was a lot of shouting
to the Police at the gate, not the gate, sort of like
the fence, we were shouting for help.  He was just
looking and just waiting for something, something to
happen, waiting for an order over his radio or
something.
                                                J. GLOVER

Sorry? - A. As though he was waiting for an order to
come to him over the radio, to do something.

Can you speak a little bit slower because I am having
difficulty hearing. - A. Before I got out of the gate
there was a lot shouting to the Police Officers, sort
of like on the track, for help, to do something, but it
was as though he was waiting for an order to come
through before he would act.

Was it just one Officer who was there or were there
several Officers at that point? - A. I think there was
one or two.  There weren't many.

There weren't many.  Did he have a radio, can you
remember? - A. I couldn't remember.

You can't remember.   Is there anything else you want to
tell me, at least that you want to tell the Jury, that
is? - A. As I was on the fence more Police Officers
came round then.  I was just interested in my brother
and one pulled me off and just dragged me away, told me
to get off the fence.

Mr. Glover, can I say how sorry I am that you lost your
brother.  It is obviously a very distressing time.   I
think you have also been very brave. I know,   because I
have been told, that this was not going to be an easy
session for you so you have done well, a credit to
yourself and to your dad, and of course I am sorry for
him as well.  Thank you very much for coming.

     MR. HUMPHREYS:     Sir, I am sorry ....

     THE CORONER:     Have you got a picture of 15.03?

     MR. HUMPHREYS:   This is PR1/12A - C354.  Perhaps
Mr. Glover could identify himself on that for the Jury.

     THE CORONER:   Yes. Did    he mark a plan, I can't
remember? We will get him to    do that at the same time.
What time is that one?

     MR. HUMPHREYS:     The time is 15.02.

     THE CORONER:     The number again?

     MR. HUMPHREYS:     354.

     THE CORONER:   Go ahead, Mr. Humphreys.  Ask him
what you wish with regard to this photograph?

           Cross-Examined by MR. HUMPHREYS

Mr. Glover, could you go up to the   screen? Is that you
being pointed out now? - A. Yes.

It is.   Thank you.

     MR. HUMPHREYS:   Nothing more, sir, except that
the time of 15.02 should be recorded.

     THE CORONER:   Can you show us where you were with
your brother within the pen, on a plan?  (The Witness
marked his position on Exhibit C402)               !
                                                   —

     THE CORONER:   Did you say you had a time?    I
can t read it on mine?

     MR. HUMPHREYS:    Sir, I have a schedule of timed
photographs from album    2.  I don't know ifthat is the
list before you or one    compiled by our team. The time
shown on the photograph would be 15.03, but the true
time would be 15.02 because the clock was slightly out.

     THE CORONER:   Yes, we have accepted that as being
an accurate representation of time.  Mr. Glover, thank
you very much indeed.

                         HENRY JOHN CLARK Sworn
                            Bv THE CORONER; *
B   Q You are Henry John Clark? - A. Yes.
    Q. Your address is

    Q.           Liverpool, and you are a foundry worker I
         think? - A. Yes.

    Q. A Liverpool supporter I think? - A. Yes.

    Q. You came to Sheffield on 15th April 1989? - A. Yes.

    Q. I think you travelled by car, is that right? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. One of the people you went with was Gary Collins? -
       A. Yes.

    Q. You waited for another friend I think.  You met with
       Gary and Peter and you waited for Martin Malone? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. You then all set off in Gary's car? - A. Yes.

    Q. That was quite early, about 9.45, would that be
       right? - A. Yes.

         What time did you manage to get to Sheffield? - A. We
         stopped on the way and so I think it was just after
         one.  I am not sure.

         You stopped on the way for something to eat or drink,
         is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q. On the motorway? - A. Yes.

    Q. Then you arrived at about one o'clock, did you say,
       in Sheffield or earlier? Lunchtime you say in your
       statement but what is lunchtime? - A. I am not sure.
       It was after twelve.

         I think you brought some sandwiches with you which
         you ate in the car and then you went to find a pub
         which you did actually manage to find? - A. Yes.

    Q. Was it called the White Horse? - A. I think that is
       what it was called but I couldn't swear to it.

    Q. You are not quite sure? - A. No.




H
It was not very far from the ground anyway, was it?

A. No.

You had three pints of lager I think, is that
right? - A. Yes.

Gary I think had a couple of shandies? - A. Yes, he
was driving.

Having had your drinks you set off for the ground? -
A. Yes.

You got the ground at about what time would you
say? - A. Twenty to three roughly.

What time did you get to the pub, do you remember?
Shortly after you parked? - A. Twenty past one,
something like that.

I forgot to ask you a question, was it full or empty
the pub? - A. It was full.

You got to the ground then and did you have any
difficulty getting into the ground at all? - A. Into
the ground?

Yes? - A. It was all outside the turnstile, we were
all like in a mass, as I said earlier.

Did you go through a turnstile? - A. Yes, I did.

You did not go through one of the gates or
anything? - A. No.

Having got through the turnstile you were in the
concourse area, right? - A. Yes.

Did you see the big gate open at all? - A. Yes.

Can you remember whether it was wide open or just a
little? - A. Roughly about six to eight feet.

So it was wide open? - A. No, it wasn't wide open.
It wasn't fully open for the size of the gate.  It
was just about the size of this h e r e .

Were both leaves open or just the one? - A. Just the
one.

Did it shut at all while you were watching it? - A.
No.
A                                                               52

                                                     H. J. CLARK

    Q. How long did you watch it for, would you say?  I do
       not mean that you stood there and watched the gate
       but how long was it in your observations? - A. Just a
g      couple of seconds.   I just looked back.

    Q. You saw it and then you went on? - A. Yes.

    Q. Were there people coming through it when you saw
       it? - A. Yes.  I had a feeling, like, that they .would
       have to open that up because I was getting crushed
       outside myself against the bin.  There was life a
       half moon shaped bin on the wall next to the
       turnstile and my chest was getting crushed against
       that.  I was pushing off the wall and I had a feeling
       that they would have to open that gate up when I seen
       that gate.

    Q. You felt that you were jolly uncomfortable outside? -
       A. Yes.

    Q. Something had to be done to relieve the crushing? -
       A. Y e s .

    Q. Did you make for the tunnel when you were in the
       concourse? - A. At first, we were there the year
       before and we went round the left hand side into the
       left hand pen.  This year, you couldn't go round that
       way, I don't know why.  I don't know whether the
       Police had blocked it off but you just couldn't go
       and so we had to head towards the tunnel as there was
       nowhere else to head for.

    Q. When you say the left hand side, have a look at the
       model? Put the plan up.   It is easier with the plan,
       which is C.274. Are you any good on plans or would
       you prefer the model? - A. It is okay.

    Q. Walk up to it and show me which way you went in when
       you were there in 1988? Show him where the
       turnstiles are and where the concourse area is? - A.
       You come in the turnstiles.  We seemed to be there.
       We were in that part of the ground the first year.

    Q. Do you remember which turnstiles you came through
       last year? - A. Roughly the same ones but I couldn't
       swear to it.

    Q. Do you remember there being a wall that you go
       through, that there was a gate in a wall? - A. Yes,
       like a doorway in, yes.

    Q. Show him where that wall is, Sergeant Killoch?  Bring
       the pointer down a little bit.  That is where the
       wall is which crosses the concourse.  Can you

                                                               H. J. CLARK

              remember that wall at all? - A. I think I must have
              gone in them turnstiles the first year.
     I                        **
B        Q- You think you may have gone in through those? - A.
              Yes.

              MR. ISAACS:   Sir, would it not be better looking at
         the model in fact?  It shows it far more clearly.

         Q.        THE CORONER:   Go to the model? - A. The first
              year we were coming in these ones.
Cj       Q* Where are you          pointing to?   - A. The top ones.
         Q.    Going through 1 to 16, and that is in 1988? - A. We
              come in here and we tried to get round them that way
              but this wall was here and so we had to go into the
              tunnel.

         Q. I take it that you did not see that little hole in
              the wall on the day? - A. No.
         Q.   Of course, itis not your home ground? - A. No.
         Q.    It was 1988 then and it is 1991 now. From what you
              are saying it sounds as if in 1988 you went through
              the other bank of turnstiles? - A. Yes.

         Q. It was much easier to get to the left because that
            was the natural route? - A. Yes.

         Q. Whereas this year you went through the other
            turnstiles and the thing you could see was the
            tunnel.  That is right, is it not? - A. Yes.

         Q. So that is where you went.  What was the tunnel like
            when you were going down it? Was it full, empty or
            what? - A. No, it was quite okay.  There was no
            pushing.  We were just going through, walking
            through.

         Q. Were you able to walk quite normally? - A. Yes.
         Q. I do not mean that you were squashed but there was
            such a dense mass that you could not walk properly? -
            A. No, you are okay.  You can make your own way
            through.

         Q. You then got through the tunnel and you got to the
            other side, is that right? - A. Yes.

         Q. You went into the right hand pen, is that right? - A.
            Yes.




H
When you got out in the first instance, did you see
anything happening on the pitch at all? - A. No.
What was it like on the terracing at that point? - A.
Just the normal Semi Final at that point.
Do you like being behind the goal normally or do you
prefer to be in what I call the wing? - A. I like
being in the terracing behind the goal but I don't
like being directly behind the goal because you know
there is going to be quite a bit of pushing. I like
to be at an angle to the goal.
What did you do, having sort of exited? Did you find
a position? - A. As soon as we got in, as we said,
turned right and then took the first few steps down
to the first barrier and we just like stood behind
the first barrier for a while or the first couple of
barriers for a while as I am not sure which one.
At that point I think you said you were not too
concerned, it was just another big match? - A. Yes.
Did you then see the players come out before the
kick-off? - A. Yes, I think I did see that. I
couldn't swear to it. I seen them on the pitch but I
didn't actually see them come out. They weren't
there when I first seen the pitch.
When you first saw the players on the pitch were you
still in this first position or had you already
moved? - A. No, we were still there I think.
What happened then? - A. Suddenly when we were in the
tunnel it was okay. Suddenly loads were coming in
the tunnel and you were getting suddenly pushed
further and further down. We couldn't stand where we
originally planned on standing. We were getting
pushed further and further downwards.
Was it at sudden pressure? - A. At first, yes. There
was a surge, and then a slow surge, and then there
would be a surge again a couple of minutes later.
Did these surges which you have mentioned, did they
occur when the players were already on the field? -
A. Yes.

It was at that point that you lost contact with Gary
and Martin, is that right? - A. Yes.
As far as you were concerned had you ended up right
at one of the fences? - A. At the end I ended up
right in the bottom comer on the left hand side.
Was the match still in play at that point? - A. No,

It was quite some time afterwards? - A. Yes.

You then managed to climb out? - A. Yes.

But the game had already finished? - A. Yes, this was
roughly after half three I think.

Did you see the little gate at all in the front? - A.
No, I didn't even know there was a gate there.

So you cannot say anything about that at all? - A.
No.
Did you at any point notice any Police Officers or
anybody on the fencing, not at 3.30 but earlier? - A.
Earlier, yes.  There were people trying to get out
and getting told to get down, like.  The Police must
have thought they were trying to get on the pitch or
something like and they were getting told, knocking
them back in.

When was that? - A. That was earlier, about ten past
three, or five past three, something like that.  It
was just after the match had finished.

You are saying you think that after the match had
finished people were actually being pushed back into
the terracing? - A. They were told to get down.   They
were trying to climb up on the fence and they were
getting told to get down, like, and everything.

Could you hear that? - A. I could hear the Policeman
telling to get down, to get back down.

Were you already right at the front by then? - A.
Near enough, yes.  I ended up right in the corner.     I
was in the front but, like, I was eight feet
roughly, you know the fence going back up to the
tunnel, that way?

Yes, the radial fence? - A. I aimed for the corner to
climb on to that to climb on to the fence and so,
like, I was about ten foot away from that fence but I
was right at the front.

Do you say at that time, after the match had
finished, people were not being helped out of the
terrace? - A. No, I couldn't see anyone where I was.

You could not? - A. No.
When you eventually got out you found Gary, did you
not? - A. Yes.                      „

There were two Police Officers? - A. Two Policewomen
Just as I got there they threw a track suit top over
his face and, like, he roughly had the same clothes
on as me, jeans and a white shirt and the same
trainers. I said, "I think that might be my mate"
because I had been walking round twice already and,
like, there was Martin and Gary. I was looking for
them and I knew my cousin was there because me and
his friend got him over the fence before we got out.
I was just looking round to see if I knew anyone
like.

In fact, you then stayed with him. The ladies went
off. You said, "Go off and help someone else"? - A.
Yes.




                    /Q. Have I then got it right.
                                             H. J. CLARK

 Have I then got it right that when you first got into
   •j fn306* which you thought was about, I think you
 said, 10-to 3 or thereabouts, is that right? - A. Yes
 when we went through the turnstiles.

 Until the players earae out things were --- A. Quite
 normal.                                        x

 Quite normal, and then there was a sudden surge and
 the whole thing deteriorated and became awful, that is
 right, is it not? - A. Yes.

You finished up in the corner? - A. Yes.

Your recollection is that well after the game was
finished people were still being pushed back into the
pen. - A. Well, I think this was about 10-past, a
couple of minutes after the game had finished.

The game finished at 5 minutes past. - A. Yes.

So at what time were people being pushed back? - A.
Well, say they were getting told to get off the fence,
about 7 minutes past.

I see, after the game was finished? - A. Yes.

Can you show us on a little plan where you were when
the players came out? We will put a little plan up
for you.                                          *


     MRS. PERKINS:  This will be C403. (Witness marks
plan)                                   ---- -- ------
     THE CORONER:  Is Gary Collins family here by
chance? .... They do not have to be, but I do not want
to miss them.
So you were free-standing, if I can put it like that?
You were not up against a barrier? - A. Yes.

Perhaps I have misunderstood you.   You know at 7
minutes past, whatever time it was, after the match
was finished, are you saying that the Police Officers
were actually putting people back into the pen, or
     §et^ing thera off the fencing? - A. Getting them
off the fence.

Getting them off the fence? They weren't pushing
them, they were just saying "Get off the fence".

But the people were on the inside, you say, who were
being got off the fencing, or on the outside? - A. On
the inside.
                                              H. J. CLARK

     THE CORONER:  Mr. Payne? Actually, shall we
pause for lunch? We have got to^ stop in two minutes
anyway, so we might as well stop now.  We will have
lunch, and you can have lunch too, if you wish that
is.  Remember you are still on oath, so do not discuss
the evidence until you have finished.  Come back at 2
o'clock, if you will, and we will just carry on then.
Ladies and gentlemen, is that okay, 2 o'clock?

              (Luncheon Adjournment)

     THE CORONER: Mr. Clark, Mr. Payne is going to ask
you some questions.

           Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Nobody is going to criticise about the timing you have
given, and just in the interests of accuracy I want to
ask you some questions about a particular event that
you mentioned when you said that at 10-past 3, or a
couple of minutes after the  game ended, people were
being told to get off the fence by the Police? - A.
Yes.

It is just on that point.  I would like you to look at
a series of photographs just to see, in fact, what was
happening at that time, and there are 4 all together,
beginning, please, with PR2/12.

     THE CORONER: Can you give us the 'C ' reference
number?

     MR. PAYNE:     It has not got a 'C' reference at the
moment, sir.

     THE CORONER: You mean these are new ones?

     MR. PAYNE:     These are four new photographs, sir.

     THE CORONER:    They will be on the screen.

     MR. BEECHEY:     The'C' number then for the   first
one, sir, is C404.

     MR. PAYNE:  Can you look in the bottom right-hand
corner of this photograph?  I know it is difficult for
you to have to turn round.  It has got the time 15.06,
do you see that? - A. Yes.

So we are now just about half a minute after the match
stopped, because we know from the timing that it was
stopped at    minutes past. - A. Yes.
                                             H. J. CLARK

So behind the goal, if you look over on the right-hand
side of the photograph, and about in the middle of the
goal, there is a white square and there by looking at
that we can see that that is where Gate 4 is.  Then if
we go over to the left we can see the gate into your
pen just on the edge there, that is Gate 3. Would you
be in sight on that photograph?  I am not saying we
can find you. - A. No.

You are off that photograph to the left, are you not?
- A. Yes.

A bit further over on Pen 3, but at half a minute
after kick-off, we can see that both gates are open —


     THE CORONER: Not after kick-off.

     MR. PAYNE:  The game stopped, I beg your pardon.
After the game stopped, both the gates are open, you
can see that? - A. Yes.

And people are coming out onto the pitch? - A. Yes.

We can see some policemen there mixed in with the
crowd - yes? - A. Yes.

And we can see some people up on the perimeter fence
leaning over some fans, either climbing over or else
they are leaning over to try and help other people
out.  Okay.    The next photograph is just about the
same time, and this is DB17/25, a new photograph.

     MR. BEECHEY:   The 'C' number for that, sir, is
C405.

     MR. PAYNE:   Here we are outside Pen 2, and we are
looking across the back of the goal, which is in fact
just off tothe right    as we look at the photograph
behind that   chap with a white shirt.  So now there are
two policemen standing one each side of the open gate
into Pen 2.  If we look further along the railing away
from the camera, there is a policeman standing up
there on the fencing, and he is about by what we know
is open Gate 3, and then in the distance behind him we
can just make out, if we look carefully, some other
people standing up on the perimeter fencing.    That is
also at 6 minutes past, so the last two photographs we
looked at are both half a minute or so after the game
was stopped.   The next one I want to look at is a
minute later, which is a broader view and perhaps a
bit more helpful, and this is PR2/15.

     MR. BEECHEY:   The 'C' number is 406.
                                                               60
                                                      H. J. CLARK

Q*        MR.   PAYNE:  Now we are a minute later.    Behind
     the goal   we can see open Gate 4 <*with the white square
     on it in   the middle of the goal at the back, just to
     the left   of the pointer, there that is it. - A. Yes.

Q.   Gate C is just off to our left, so we cannot see it.

          THE CORONER: Gate 3.

Q*        MR. PAYNE:  Gate 3, I am sorry.  We can see that
     more people have come out, there are more people there
     round about the back of the goal than there were a
     minute ago, and there are lots of policemen arriving,
     you can see that? - A. Yes.

Q.   The last one I want you to look at in       this sequence is
     another minute later, DB17/27.

          MR. BEECHEY:     The 'C' number is C408.

Q*        MR. PAYNE:   Now here we are outside Pen 2, and we
     are looking towards the Police Control Box.   We have
     got our back to the goal and Pen 3 is just behind us
     to the right, probably, so you are just somewhere more
     or less where the   pointer is, is that correct? Can
     you line yourself   up? - A. I couldn't tell.

Q.   Can you work out where that is? - A. I was nowhere
     near the gate, I know that.

Q.   You were in the front right-hand corner, were you not,
     of Pen 3? - A. If we are standing on the terracing I
     am on the left-hand side.

Q.   The front left-hand corner of Pen 3?       - A. If you are
     standing on the pitch and looking at       it, you would be
     on the right-hand side, but as I was       standing out onto
     the terrace looking out at the pitch       I was right in
     the bottom left-hand corner.

          THE CORONER:     Has he marked the plan?

          MR. PAYNE:     No, I am afraid not.

          THE CORONER: Let us do that, because I had
     understood him to mean the corner that you thought.

          MR. PAYNE:  Just before that, while that is up,
     what we can see here, the only interesting thing
     really is the timing, 8 minutes past, do you see that?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   Policemen by now are obviously realising what is
     happening and are trying to help. Okay now can you
                                              H. J. CLARK

mark the plan which will be put up on the screen for
you.  Just wait a moment until ^.t is ready. Could you
go over to the projector.

     THE CORONER: I want you to put two marks on it,
please.  I want you to put a cross with a '1' on it in
the position where you were at about, I think, 10-to 3
when it was crowded but I think you said not much
worse, you know, like a big match, before the surge. -
A. I have already done one X where I was at first.

Have you done one? - A. Yes.

Show me which corner? That is it, yes.   Put a '1'
against that cross, and now show us where you finished
up, where you climbed up in the end. (Witness marks
Plan) That is the opposite corner to what I had
thought.

     MR. PAYNE:  Thank you very much.     Come back to
the witness box, please.

     THE CORONER: So if you put up the middle one of
your photographs, he should be able to locate himself
on that, the one with Gate 4 and Gate 3 on.  I think
it was either the first or the second one.

     MR. PAYNE:     PR2/12 would probably be the best.
Yes it would.

     THE CORONER: Put the first one up.  Yes, this is
it, because that spans the two gates and, therefore,
the fence.  What number is that?

     MR. BEECHEY:    That is C404.

     MR. PAYNE:  This is 6 minutes past.    Just spend a
minute to make sure you understand what you are
looking at.  Look at the left-hand edge of the
photograph and you can see the square which is the
No.3 on that gate, so that is the pen you are in.    Now
as the pointer goes across along the perimeter fence,
there is Gate 4. Now the join between the two pens is
just to the left of Gate 4,   not very far. So you  are
just about there in that front corner of Pen 3.

     THE CORONER:  Do you understand that, Mr. Clark,
are you following? - A. Yes.

     MR. PAYNE:  Thank you very much.  The only object
of looking at these photographs is not to criticise
you about your timing, do you understand that? - A.
Yes.
                                             H. J. CLARK

But what does come out is certainly by the time the
match was stopped and certainly Jjy two minutes
afterwards, fans and Police were doing what they could
to help people to get out of the pens, were they not?
- A. There is no one in that corner, though, where I
was, is there, helping?

I am sorry? - A. In that corner where I was on the
fence.

There is no what?  - A. There were no people climbing
on the fence there because we were getting told to get
back down off the fence there in that corner.

    MR. PAYNE:   I see.   Okay.   Very well, thank you.




                   /Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE
                                               H. J. CLARK


           Cross-Examined by MR. CATCHPOLE:

Mr. Clark, could I just go very briefly back to 1988.
You had a terrace standing ticket in 1988? -A. Yes.

Take it for the moment that if you had a terrace ticket
in 1988 you should have gone through the very same
turnstiles you went through in 1989? - A. Yes.

The other turnstiles were either for the seating area or
for the North Stand.   The same arrangement in both
years. - A. Yes.

When the learned Coroner was asking you questions about
which turnstile you went through, my note says that
initially you thought you had gone through the same
turnstiles? - A. Yes, I said that earlier on.

Then when you went up to the plan you looked at it and
your exact words were, "I think we must have gone through
the other turnstiles"? - A. That was because I didn't
think you could go left from the turnstiles we went in.

Believe me I am not being critical.    I understand you
were trying to help but it does sound to me as if what
you were doing was looking at it and thinking, "No, that
can't be right", and making an assumption as you were
standing up there looking at the plan.    Is that fair? -
A. At first when I first got up I could sworn that was
the same turnstile, but when I went to go left and there
was no wall there and just until you explained them I
didn't know there were another turnstile further on.    I
thought it was the same one and they had just built a
wall, but as you say there was a hole in the wall, but I
couldn't see that wall.

Would this be right - I am not being critical, it is a
long time ago and I shouldn't imagine you remember every
turnstile you go through at every match because you don't
concentrate on the turnstiles normally.   Is it fair to
say in 1988 you don't actually remember - you couldn't be
certain or precise which turnstile you went through? - A.
No.

All you can be precise about is you ended up on the North
West terrace, up on that far corner and when you came
through in 1989 you thought you were going through the
same turnstiles... - A. Yes, and there only seemed to be
one way to go.

At that time you didn't see the gap in the wall? - A. No.
                                               H. J. CLARK

            Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL:

     MR. RUSSELL:   Could the exhibit upon which this
witness marked his position in pen 3 be put up on the
screen?

How close were you to the fence between pens 3 and 4? -
A. When I got over, do you mean?    That is where I
climbed over number 2 , actually climbed on the fence that
was separating the two pens to get on to the bigger fence
to get on to the pitch.

The fence you climbed on to was the fence separating pen
3 from pen 4? - A. Yes.

Was there a time when you were next to the fence that you
climbed on to before climbing over? - A. I was about...
Once I got pushed to the front, I was roughly about eight
feet away from it.   We were all crushed but I gradually
worked my way across towards it.   I headed for that to
get something to climb on to to climb on to the bigger
fence.

The perimeter fence leading on to the track was divided
up by stanchion supports, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

Can you remember in relation to the number of stanchion
supports how far you were away from the dividing fence? -
A. I don't know.    I couldn't tell you.   It would be
about two, I think.    I am not sure though.

Could we have C.404 again?   You can see gate 3 on the
extreme left of the picture? - A. Yes.

You can see gate 4 about two-thirds to three-quarters of
the way to the right of the picture? - A. Yes.

In between those two gates there are four stanchion
widths? - A. Yes.

The first stanchion width, take it from me, is in fact
part of pen 4, so that the dividing fence between  pens 3
and 3 leads off from the first stanchion to the left of
gate 4.   Do you see that? - A. Where the man is pointing
or two along?   That is the third one along, isn't it?

Where the man is pointing, that is the end of the
dividing fence between pens 3 and 4.    In relation to
that stanchion, how far along to the left towards gate 3
do you say you were when you were at the front, in
relation to those people who are on the fence? - A. Not
quite as far as the next stanchion.    Where the fellow is
like sitting on the top.
                                                H. J. CLARK

If you go back to   the stanchion thajt marks the dividing
line between pens   3 and 4, we can see someone on the far
side of the fence   who appears to be standing on that
dividing fence.     Do you see that? - A. Yes.

Is that the route you took to get out of pen 3 when you
eventually did so?   By climbing up on to the dividing
fence and then over the top? - A. Yes.

So that person there is doing what you subsequently did?
- A. Yes.

The next person on the fence is someone who is leaning
over, with very pale coloured trousers and a dark grey
coloured top. - A. Yes.

It is impossible to say whether that person is in the
process of getting out or leaning over helping people who
are inside? - A. Yes.

The next person along is someone who is straddling the
top of the fence, would you agree with that? - A. Yes.

That person is evidently climbing out of the pen? - A. I
don't know.   He could be sitting on the top leaning down
to try to try and pick someone up.

The next person has their legs inside the pen and their
hands on the top of the fence? - A. Yes.

They are supporting their weight by their hands? - A.
Yes.

That person is clearly climbing out? -A. Yes.

Then there is a person who is squatting on top of the
fence, looking almost at the camera? - A. Yes.

Now those last two people, the one who is squatting on
top of the fence and the one who is taking his weight by
his hands on the top of the fence with his legs inside,
are those people at approximately the position that you
were just inside the pen when you were at the front? - A.
I seemed further away from the...   I couldn't even see
the gates.   That is what I can't understand.  I couldn't
see the gate from where I was.

At that point you would be approximately half way between
the gate and the... - A. The railings.

...fence dividing pens 3 and 4, wouldn't you? - A. I
would be about seven or eight feet away from the dividing
feet.   I don't know where the gate was because I never
saw the gate.
                                              H. J. CLARK

Now this photograph was taken at five minutes past three.
It says 15.06 in the bottom right hand corner, but we
know it is a minute out.   It is 3.05 and the game is
still in progress.   We know that because two or three
frames later we can see a photograph of the game being
stopped.   Is this scene in accordance with your
recollection at about five past three, while the game is
still going on, with people climbing over the fence,
climbing out of the pen? - A. It didn't seem to be like
that where I was standing.
                                            H. J. CLARK

So that is not in accordance with your recollection? -
A. No.

But you would accept that that is what the photograph
shows, taken at that time? - A. Yes.

          Cross-Examined by MR. HUMPHREYS

Mr. Clark, I can imagine that in the situation you were
in things can become confused and I hope we can try and
simplify it.  Is it your very clear recollection that
at some time before you rescued yourself from this
situation, that the Police Officers were telling people
to get down from the fence and not to get out? - A.
Yes.

That is absolutely clear in your mind? - A. Yes.

At some time that was happening? - A. After the game
had finished, yes.

That must be so because if I can remind you of your
evidence, you ended up in the corner and you managed to
climb out, but people were being told to get down, and
that was just after the match finished.  The time does
not matter.  Did you have any assistance from Police
Officers in getting out? - A. Yes, but I didn't get out
until, it was half-3, maybe turned by the time I got
out. There was a load out before me. This was earlier
when they were telling them to get down.  It was about
20 minutes before I got out.

But eventually you got out? - A. Yes.

               Further by THE CORONER

I am moving away from that for a moment but I am
interested in another aspect of what was happening in
the corner where you were, if I can put it like that.
Can you remember by any chance whether you noticed
people being transferred from pen 4 to pen 3? Do you
know what I mean? Were people being passed across that
railing fence from one pen to the other? - A. I can't
recall.  I didn't see anything.

You didn't see that? That is just a long shot because
it is to do with somebody else and I just thought you
might have seen it. One final question, back to what
we have been talking about, you are quite clear about
what was happening just after the match finished.  Just
tell me this, were the Officers saying get down? Can
you remember what they were actually saying or have you
forgotten the words? - A. People were trying to, like,
                                                           S. CLARK

they were hanged over a bit and all I can remember was
"Get down".

Okay, thank you.                             v

     THE CORONER:   The next witness is called Stephen
Clark, and as far as I know he has got nothing whatever
to do with this Mr. Clark.  It is just coincidence.

                 STEPHEN CLARK Called (Sworn)

                            By THE CORONER

Good afternoon.           Are you comfortable? - A. Yes.

Stephen Clark, that is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.

                                                 , Merseyside, is
cnat n g n c ;   -   a   . Yes.

And I am right that you are not related to the other
Mr. Clark? - A. What other Mr. Clark?

You are not a relation of the witness who has just ....
- A. No.

It is just chance that you happen to have the same
name? - A. Yes.

You came to      the match on 15th April, 1989,        is that
right? - A.      Yes.

You came with your younger brother, I think, is that
right? That was Joseph Clark, is that right? - A. Yes.

And you also came with Alan McGlone, is that right? -
A. Alan McGlone.

And David Roberts as well? - A. David Roberts, yes.

You had a ticket for the West Stand, I believe? - A.
Yes.

That is upstairs where people sit, in fact, isn't it? -
A. Yes.

All the other three, Joseph and the others had terrace
tickets, is that right? - A. Yes.

You have already told me you came by car.   Do you
remember what time you left home? - A. About 25-past-9.

What time did you get to Sheffield, about? - A. About
5-past-12.
                                                  S. CLARK

What time did you get to the Leppings Lane entrance? -
A. About 25-past-2.

So you must have spent a little bitvof time - what did
you do?  Did you go for a meal or a drink, or what did
you do? - A. We went for a drink.

Do you know which pub it was?     Can you remember? - A.
The Castle.

I am beginning to learn every single pub in Sheffield,
I think.  Was that a Liverpool or a Nottingham Forest
pub or was it a mixed one? - A. Just Liverpool
supporters and a few locals.

Is it big or small? - A. Small.

Not many people there?   It may have been full but not
that many? - A. There wasn't that many people, but with
the pub being small ....

It was full, yes.  Did you see anything in the pub
which caused you concern with regard to people's
consumption of alcohol? - A. No, nothing.  It was just
a good atmosphere.

You stayed there what, about two hours, I suppose,
would that be about right? - A. No.

Perhaps not quite as long? - A. We walked around for a
bit, you know.  It is about a 20 minute walk anyway.

How much did you have to drink on thatoccasion, would
you say? - A. I had four pints.

Then having done that you came towards the ground? - A.
Yes.

Did you see anything that worried you on the way down?
- A. Nothing at all at that time.

When you got to the turnstiles     was it busy or not? - A.
Just so, so.

Did you get through fairly easily? - A. Yes.

You had no problems?   You weren't squashed or anything
like that? - A. No.

Having got in, had you already split up from your
friends and your brother? - A.   I left them because I
was going up the stairs to the   stand.I said, "I'll
see you later by the car".
                                                   S. CLARK

You went up into the stand, is that right? - A. Yes.

You sat   down? - A. Yes.

Did you see the    players come out just before kick-off?
- A. Yes.

Did you   see the match kick off? - A. Yes.

Did you   see Beardsley hit the crossbar? - A. Yes.

In fact, you saw the whole match? - A. Yes.

Did you   see the match being stopped? - A. Yes.

Did it surprise you when the match was stopped?       - A. It
did surprise me, yes.

Is that because presumably you had not noticed what was
going on down below, is that right? - A. I didn't
really notice what was going on.

Could you from where you were sitting actually see the
terracing or was it obstructed by the .... - A. No, I
could see everything, looking down.

But you had not  noticed anything that concerned      you at
that point? - A.  Not at that point, no.

In fact, you did not realise something had gone wrong
until you saw the ambulances arrive, is that right? -
A. When the people were getting over the fence, and
some Policemen were throwing people back in ....

     MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, there is strong competition
from outside.  Could you please ask him to speak up a
bit?




              Q.      THE CORONER:    You were saying
                                                                    71

                                                              S. CLARK

    Q. You were saying you could see people getting over the
       fences? - A. And getting pushed back in by some
       Policemen.                          v
B   Q. When did you see that? - A. That was roughly when the
       game was still going on.

    Q.   Could you see the gates at all? - A. No, no.

    Q.    You could not see those? -A. I couldn't see the
         gates, n o .

    Q. You could not, of course, hear what was being said? -
       A. No.

    Q. How many people were coming over the top at that
       point? - A. At that point?  About 20 to 30.

    Q.    Were people coming up into the stand at all? - A.
         Yes.

    Q. At the same time, before or after? - A. At the same
       time I think.

    Q. When you say you saw people being pushed      back, can
       you just describe what you actually saw?      - A. When
       people were trying to get over the fence      the Police
       were, like, putting them back in saying,      "Get down"
       and more less like t h a t .

    Q. If you are holding on to a fence it is not as easy as
       all that to push and so what was actually
       happening? - A. Where I was sitting all you could see
       was like a hand going over telling them to get back
       or whatever.

    Q.   It was more a gesture? - A. I don't know.

    Q.   I am not putting words in your mouth.   I am trying to
         find out? - A. All I could see was just putting the
         hand, I don't know if he was pushing but I seen him,
         "Get back".

    Q.   Did you see whether people actually went back or not?
         - A. When the Police done that they fell back off the
         fence, didn't they?

    Q. I could not hear you? - A. They fell back off the
       fence into the crowd again.

    Q. So they went back into the crowd, you say? - A. Yes.

    Q. You actually saw them go in? - A. Yes.

     MISS ADDLEMAN:  Sir, I am very sorry, but it is very
difficult to hear the witness.

      THE CORONER:   I know.  I am finding it difficult as
well.   I think he said that the people went back into the
crowd.

Q. Was this after the match had kicked off or before? -
   A. During the game.

Q. Pardon? - A. During the game it was.

Q. You do not know in relation to events when it was?
   Was it before Beardsley hit the crossbar or after? -
   A. I can't remember offhand.

Q. I think you lost your brother and your friend, did
   you not? - A. Yes.

Q. I am very, very sorry that that has happened.  When
   you saw this activity on the fence you have already
   told me that you had not realised that anything was
   particularly wrong down there.  You did not realise
   it until a bit later.  That is correct, is it not? -
   A. Yes.

Q. So what did you actually think was happening in
   relation to these people who were going up? - A. I
   just thought it was a pitch invasion when that was
   happening, like.  That is what I thought it was.

Q. That is what it looked like to you? - A. That is what
   it looked like at first.

               Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

Q. Mr. Clark, can you help us with the times just so
   that we know what you are telling us? You went to
   the West Stand leaving your brother and your friends
   behind.  About what time was that after you got
   through the turnstiles? - A. That is about twenty-
   five to three or something.

Q. About twenty-five to three? - A. Yes.

Q. You settled yourself in the stand.  How far away were
   you from the line which separates the stand from the
   terracing? - A. Near enough the back.

Q. Towards the back? - A. Yes.

Q. So you had a view of it all, going all the way
   down? - A. Yes.
Do I understand you to be saying this; that having
the view you had there was nothing you saw which made
you in the least bit concerned for the welfare of
your brother and your friends whilst they were in the
terracing? - A. Like I just said before, I thought it
was a pitch invasion at first.
I do not mean that. I have heard about that and that
came later on but I mean leading up to the time of
the kick-off. All that period from about twenty-five
to three until about five to three? - A. Yes.
Did you look for your brother at that time? - A. No.
As if to say, "I wonder where he has got to, where he
is standing"? - A. No.
Did you do that or not? - A. No.
           Cross-Examined bv MR. MANNING:
There was just one thing I wanted to ask you about,
Mr. Clark, in that we have heard from some witnesses
rather earlier in the Inquest that people were
actually being lifted into the stand seats that you
were occupying before the kick-off. Indeed one
chappie had seen it the year before happening at half
time and he thought that people had started before
the kick-off doing that, in other words, having a
terrace ticket but getting up into the stand to get a
better view. Did you actually see people being
hauled up into the stand where you were before the
kick-off? - A. Yes.
                Further bv THE CORONER:
Mr. Clark, I have already said I am very sorry that
you have lost two people. There was your brother who
was very special to you but also your friend. I am
very grateful to you for coming and helping us.
Before you go I want you to mark a plan just to show
us where you actually were. We want the plan of the
stadium. It is a bit difficult, of course, because
the West Stand has a slope on it but if you go over
you can show us where you were? - A. Yes.
 MR. BEECHEY:   This will be C.408, sir.
    THE CORONER:    Can you sign it then? - A. Yes.
I have two or three more questions. Were you seated
or were you standing? - A. Seated. How much could
you actually see of the terracing? Could you see the
                                                                 74
                                                          S. CLARK

       concrete first of all? When you first got in there
       must have been a bit of... - A. Yes.

B   Q. You could actually see the concrete? - A. Yes.

    Q. You are sure of that? - A. Yes.

    Q. How far back? You could not see all the way back but
       how many rows back could you see? - A. What do you
       mean?

    Q. When you were looking down from that position on to
       the terracing, how much of the terracing could you
       see? - A. All of it.

    Q. Could you see the bottom of the perimeter fence? You
       probably could see the top, the overhang, but could
       you see the bottom of it where it met the ground? -
       A. Y e s .

    Q. You could? - A. Yes.

         MR. PAYNE:  On that point, I wonder if it would be
    helpful if he were to look at this photograph to see
    whether it would help to show what he can see and if, yes,
    then perhaps an acetate could be made.

         THE CORONER:    I have a feeling we have got one like
    that already.

         MR. MANNING:   C.268, sir.

         THE CORONER:   What we do not know is whether this was
    taken sitting down or standing up.  This is the problem.
    Let us put it up and just check whether that is the view.

    Q. Was that the view that you had? - A. Yes, it was
       about that.

         THE CORONER:   Anything else, Mr. Payne?

         MR. PAYNE:  The title to this photograph in the index
    is that this is taken from the TV gantry.  So it is
    obviously a bit higher than the level of the seats.

         THE CORONER:   That is right, this is the problem.

         MR. PAYNE:  The witness, Stephen Clark, can give his
    own impression of what he thinks.  I am saying that so that
    one knows exactly where this photograph is taken from.

         THE CORONER:   Which photograph are we talking about?
    The one we have just shown him or the one that you have
    got?



H
                                                    S. CLARK


     MR. PAYNE:   It is the same photograph.
      THE CORONER:  The one I am being shown is looking at
it from the other way. Are you sure you want to show me
this?

     MR. PAYNE: Sorry, that is not the one, no.   I am only
just pointing out what is on the index.
     THE CORONER:   What you are saying is that we do not
know where it is taken, which is the point I was making.
Was this taken standing up, on a ladder, sitting down, we
do not know.

A                                                         76.


                                                          S. CLARK

              MR. PAYNE:  Quite, so we can only rely on Stephen
         Clark to give his own impression.
B             THE CORONER: That is right.
    Q.   But you feel reasonably confident that sitting down
         where you were you could see the pens in that sort of
         vista? - A. Yes.

              THE CORONER: That is fair enough, thank you very
         much indeed.   Mr. Lycett is next.  Can I say who we
         are having, because it is Mr. Lycett and somebody
         called Andrew Lawson.  These are new witnesses.   They
         are not supporters in the strict sense of the word, as
         you will discover in a moment.

              MR. RUSSELL:  Sir, before the witness is sworn,
         can I please clarify the 'C' numbers.  We have had a
         duplication of 'C' numbers.  Have we had two 408s?   I
         think the plan marked by Stephen Clark was identified
         as C408.

              MR. BEECHEY:  No sir.  If I can clear it up for
         you, sir, C407 was the photograph timed 15.08 with the
         reference DB17/27, and C408 is the plan of the ground
         marked by Stephen Clark.

              MR. RUSSELL:  What was the reference number for
         the plan marked by   Henry Clark?

              MR. BEECHEY:   No, I have not gota number   for
         that one, so you are probably right.

              MR. CATCHPOLE:  I think it was C403.  The
         confusion may have arisen because when Mr. Payne was
         asking Mr. Henry Clark questions he thought he had not
         signed a plan and then we discovered he had signed a
         plan and we gave that as C403 and he gave the two
         positions.  We can see it now up on the screen, sir.
         You can see the initial position then marked '1', and
         he added in the second position in answer to questions
         from my learned friend, Mr. Payne.

              MR. BEECHEY:  What I have got as C403 is a plan
         of the terraces marked by Henry John King.

              THE CORONER: Can you pass itover to   me?

              MR. CATCHPOLE: It is definitely   Mr. Clark's.
         You can see Mr. Clark's signature.

              THE CORONER: That is Mr. Clark's signature, yes,
         but the question is whether we have got the 'C'
         numbers mixed up.



H
     MR. CATCHPOLE:  That is C403, I get nods from
behind, and there then follows 3 series of four
photographs from my learned friend, Mr. Payne, C404 to
407, then Mr. Clark was asked to go over and sign it
again, which is why I think my learned friend Mr.
Russell thinks it is C408, but at that point we
discovered he had already signed one and then he added
in the second cross.

     THE CORONER: I see.   What have we got at 403?

     MR. BEECHEY:  What we have got for 403, sir, is
the plan of terraces marked by Henry John King.

     THE CORONER: Can you pass me the list, please.   I
can see it now. C401 is Ronald Brian King.  C403, you
have written the wrong name.  It should be Mr. Clark,
if you would correct it.  Thank you, Mr. Catchpole.

            DAVID RUSSELL LYCETT Sworn

                 By THE CORONER:

You are David Russell Lycett, that is right, is it
not? - A. Yes, that is right.


nave movea address now.

Give us vour new address. -   A. It is


You are a professional footballer, I think? - A. That
is right, yes.

With Sheffield Wednesday? - A. Yes.

Still with Sheffield Wednesday? - A. Yes.

On 15th April 1989 you attended the semi-final? - A.
That is right.

Obviously you were interested in it as a footballer? -
A. Yes.

But, in fact, your task was you were actually employed
that day as a ball-boy, is that right? - A. Yes.

I am just interested to know what a   ball-boy actually
does.  It is nothing to do with the   Inquest but just
tell me what you are supposed to be   doing? - A. Just
to give the ball back when it comes   over.
                                           D. R. LYCETT

I see, when it came out you caught it and took it
back? - A. Yes.

I suppose it is obvious, but it never crossed my mind
that one actually had to have people there.  Is it
right that the normal practise is for young men like
you to be used in that capacity? - A. Yes, that is
right.

I suppose it gives you the advantage of actually
having a very good view of the match as well, does it
not? - A. Yes.

You had done this before?   This was not the first
time? - A. No.

Did you do it in 1988, as a matter of interest? - A.
Yes, I did.

Do ball-boys also play a part in League matches, and
so on, or is it only at semi-finals? - A. Every match.

One final question: are you usually in the same
position? - A. Yes.

On the pitch? - A. Yes.

Just tell me where you are normally stationed? - A.
Looking at the Leppings Lane end, just to the right of
the goal.

So you are on the Leppings Lane end? - A. I was
actually sat where one of the gates opens, an old
platform that we used to sit on.

Do you know which gate it is? - A. Gate 4, I think.

Can you put the plan up, or do you want to look at the
model?  Is it easier if you look at the model? - A.
Yes.

Find the gate that you would normally be on and then
show us on the plan. - A. Gate 5.

No.5.  It is a little narrow one, is it? - A. That is
right.

Do you say that you actually sit on the wall of the —
- A. Yes, that is right.

So you are right hard against the fencing? - A. Yes.

You cannot get any nearer without getting inside? - A.
Yes, that is right.
                                            D. R. LYCETT

Is it right that not only do you normally take up this
position, but there is another friend of yours, I
think, who was there as well? - ^A. Yes, that is right.

Mark Dixon, is he also normally there? - A. Yes.

There is also a regular Police Officer, is that right?
- A. Yes.

Did you know his name? - A. No, I didn't actually know
his name.

But you recognised him as being the man who is usually
there? - A. Yes, he always used to stand there for
starters and then he would move around.  He used to
move round.

You were at the ground, in fact, quite early? - A.
Yes.

I am not too worried because you did not come in
through the turnstiles, of course, did you? - A. No.

Eventually you went out onto the pitch to take up your
position? - A. Yes, that is right.

Do you know about what time it was that you came out?
- A. I can't remember.

Did you come out before the teams? - A. Before the
kick-off.

No.  Yes, but did you come out before the teams ran
out for the kick-off or after? - A. They were actually
out when I was just coming out.

So they had already run out? - A. Yes, we had    to wait
until they had come out onto the pitch.

So they come out and get all the glory?   - A.Yes.

And then you creep round the side? - A.   Yes.

If that is the right word.  Did you come round the
South Stand and then walk along Leppings Lane? - A.
No, I turned right towards the Spion Kop and then
walked round in front of the North Stand.

So you came the long way.  Did you come out of the
player's tunnel? - A. Yes, that is right.

So it was the long way round in fact? - A. Yes.
                                             D. R. LYCETT

As you were walking round did you perchance look
towards Leppings Lane? - A. Y e s %

Did you notice anything at that point? - A. Just that
looking towards the Leppings Lane, the right-hand
side, I think it is Section 5 was a bit empty.

Section 6 it is actually.    - A. Is it Section 6 , and
the corner piece as well?

Nothing else struck you? - A. No.

You then came round and you sat? - A. Yes, that is
right.

Were you actually sitting directly outside the gate,
or just a little to one side? - A. Directly.  The gate
was just behind us.

You and Mark were there, is that right? - A. Yes.

Where was the Police Officer? - A. Just stood next to
us.

So he was sitting there as well? - A. Yes.

Were you looking into the pen or out towards the
field? - A. Towards the field.

People   were behind you? - A. Yes, that is right.

Were you sitting there when the match started? - A.
Yes, that is right.

Did you hear anything different than what you had
heard before at that point? - A. Well, I turned round
to see that there were not many people behind me.  The
middle section was quite full.

Immediately behind you, of course, was Pen 5, was it
not? - A. Yes.

That should be empty, should it not? - A. Yes.

Were you surprised that it was empty? - A. That is
right, yes.

Why were you surprised? - A. Because every time there
is a full gate there it is usually evened out across
there.

Across the whole lot? - A. Yes, that is right.
                                                                      81
                                                         D. R. LYCETT

    Q.   You say you were surprised that the pen on your right
         hand was very full? - A. Yes, that is right.
B   Q.   And the pen immediately behind you was emptyish, or
         empty in fact? - A. There weren't many people in at
         all, yes.

    Q.   Did you hear any cries    forhelp    at that   point? - A.
          Not at that point, no.

    Q.   Did you see    people climbing   out at that   point? — A.
          Not at that   point.

    Q.   When was it that you first noticed anything at all,
         either saw or heard anything? - A. I don't actually
         know the time, but it was after the kick-off I heard a
         lady shout, "We're getting squashed".

    Q.   What did you do then? - A. A bit later on somebody
         started climbing over from the middle fence which was
         separating, just climbing over onto the part where
         there were no people.

    Q.   Was the   gate in front of which you were sitting open
          at any point? - A. No, it was locked while I was sat
          there.

    Q.   Not while you were sitting there? - A. Yes, it was
         locked.

    Q.   Did you   see any of the gates being opened?     - A. No.

    Q.   You did   not see any of them being opened. Did you see
          any Police Officers come along past, the same route
          that you took actually, the North Stand and then along
          Leppings Lane? - A. Did I see any Policemen?

    Q.   Yes.   - A. No.

    Q.   Did you see particularly a Police Officer with        a very
         bald head? - A. No, I can't remember.




                                             /Q. Did you see ....
                                              D. R. LYCETT


Did you see anybody being pushed back into the pens at
all? - A. There were people climbing up on to the fence.
I don't know if they actually pushed them down.   They
probably told them to get down.   I don't know actually
what they said.

When was that? - A. I don't actually know the time.

Was it after kick-off or before? - A. It was after kick-
off.

Time is very difficult, but kick-off is convenient.      It
was after kick-off? - A. Yes, that's right.

In which of the pens was it, was it in...    As far as you
are concerned there were three close to you.    There was
pen 6 on your left, pen 5 the narrow one immediately
behind you and pen 4 on your left? - A. Yes.    It was the
end of pen 5, towards my right.

In other words, towards pen 4? - A. Yes, that's right.

Did you see at any point any Police Officers around the
gate of pen 4? - A. Well, they were stood looking towards
the fans, but I don't know about exactly around the gate.

Did you actually see the gate open at any point in time?
- A . No, I can't remember that, no.

Did you see lots of people on the perimeter track and the
pitch eventually? -A. Yes, that's right.   I stayed for a
while.

When did you first begin to notice there were people on
the perimeter track, in relation to the kick-off? - A. It
was after kick-off.   I should say five or six minutes
after.   There were a lot of people building up us and we
didn't actually know what was going off so eventually we
moved round in front of the North Stand and stood there
for a while.

You in fact got out of the way? - A. Yes, because there
were people everywhere around us and we didn't know what
was happening.

You did hear the lady call out? - A. Yes, that's right.

This was after kick-off as well? - A. Yes, after kick-
off.

When you took up your position, when you sat down, was
that before or after kick-off, can you remember? - A. I
can remember getting there just before he blew the
whistle.
                                             D. R. LYCETT

So it was just on kick-off? - A. Just on time, yes.

             Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

     MR. PAYNE:   I wonder if you would be kind enough to
put up the photograph 268:

If you open the folder in front of you you will find 268.
Over to the left of the photograph can you see the narrow
pen with the gate at the end of it, gate 5? - A. Yes.

So that's where you arrived just at kick-off? - A. Yes,
that's right.

Can we see here the wall you sat on? - A. If you go up
the steps you can see there.

The steps from the narrow pen up to the gate? - A. Yes,
that's right.   It is just the top step.   That is
actually where we used to sit, just a bit further down.

You arrived at kick-off and sat there facing the pitch? -
A. Yes, that's right.

From your evidence is this fair to say that it certainly
wasn't obvious to you at that time that there was any
risk of injury to people in pen 4 behind you to your
right? - A. It just looked a bit tight, that's all.   I
didn't think anything was going to happen.   I looked a
bit tight, that's all.

It certainly wasn't obvious to you that people were at
risk of their lives? - A. No.

I haven't quite got your movements.   After a while you
moved away somewhere else? - A. Yes, I moved under the
North Stand, about half way down the North Stand.

That's to the left off this photograph? - A. Yes, to the
left, that's right.

Is that along by the blue wall? - A. That's right, yes.
I stood about where that white thing is in the middle of
the blue wall.

The little white square, about half way along the length
as we look at it? - A. Yes, talking to some Liverpool
fans.

At that time did you realise that people had been
seriously injured and were being seriously injured in
those pens? - A. I knew there was something going on by
that time but not actually injuries.
                                              D. R. LYCETT

You didn't... - A. No, not really. „

Where were you when the game was stopped? - A. I was
still behind the goal when the game was stopped.

We know it was stopped at five and a half minutes after
it had started. - A. Yes.

What the jury have got is that for five and a half
minutes you were by gate 5? - A. That's right.

You didn't realise during that period that people were at
serious risk of injury behind you? - A. No, not really.

            Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

You said pen 4 looked a bit tight.   It would be what you
would expect it to look like for a capacity semi-final? -
A. A bit tighter I should think.

           Cross-Examined by MR. HUMPHREYS:

You have just said that pen 4 was a bit tight, but the
important point you made was that the pen on the far side
was not occupied by many people.   I think you said a few
in there? - A. That's right, just a few people.

That was obviously a noticeable event for you? - A. Yes.

Did any thoughts go through your mind as to why that
might be or... - A. I just thought there might have been
some late coaches arriving, that's all.

You saw the pen was largely empty and you thought coaches
might be late? - A. Yes, or there were people outside
queuing to get in.

Did it cross your mind that the kick-off might have to be
postponed at that stage or anything like that? - A. We
thought it could have been but obviously not.

How old are you? - A. Twenty now.

You were about eighteen at the time? - A. That's right.

The other thing I want to ask you about is the Police
Officer.   He was someone who was normally stationed
where you were? - A. Yes, for the start of the kick-off.

Do you know what his duties were in that position?     Did
he ever discuss those with you? - A. No.

As I understood you. I think you started to say that he
moved off, but didn t quite finish where he moved off to
                                              D. R. LYCETT

later? - A. Yes.  Well, he didn't actually get to his
second point where he usually goes.   They alternate
round, that's all, the Police Officers.

All the Police Officers move round? - A. Yes, they move
round.

Does that mean that normally there would be someone by
gate 5 all the time? - A. There was always somebody by
the gate.

           Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Mr. Lycett, did you look around into pen 5 at all or were
you just looking at the pitch all the time? - A.No,  I
did actually look round to pen 5.

Did you realise it was a very narrow pen, pen 5? It is
just a corridor. - A. Yes.

Were there any people in it at all? - A. I'm sorry.

Were there any fans in that narrow corridor? - A. No, not
in that narrow...

None at all? - A. No, they don't stand people in that
narrow part.

You didn't hear anybody in distress in pen 4, to your
side? - A. Just alot of people shouting.      I didn't
actually hear anybody distressed, no.    Just a lot of
shouting.   I didn't really know what was going off.

Can you remember what time it was when you moved from
your position there to your position in front of the
North Stand? - A. What time did you say the game was
stopped?

     THE CORONER:     Five minutes past, about.

     THE WITNESS:     I should say about two or three
minutes after that so about eight or nine minutes past.

     MRS. McBRIEN:   You say you didn't realise that
people had been crushed in there and this was why they
had come out? - A. No, I didn't realise.    When I knew
people must have been tight in there.    That is why they
were climbing over, but not actually to incur any
injuries.

You didn't see anyone staggering out?   You know, trying
to catch their breath? - A. Not at that stage, no, I
didn't.
                                                D. R. LYCETT

          Further Cross-Examined by MR» HUMPHREYS:

Just something arising   from the last question. You said
just now that you knew   the people were tight inthere and
that is why they were climbing over? - A. Yes.

Are you saying that on that day at that time you thought
the crowd was getting over because it was tight? - A.
That's right.

You didn't think it was a disruptive pitch invasion at
that stage? - A. Well,   I knew it was a bit tight.      There
were some people jumping, you know.    They were jumping
about when they got over, you know, having a laugh and a
joke, so I didn't really...

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Lycett, thank you very much for
coming.   I know you came at short notice.

                ANDREW KENNETH LAWSON Sworn

                      By THE CORONER:

You are Andrew Kenneth Lawson? - A. Yes.

Is it :                                    Sheffield? - A.
It is.

I think you are an ambulanceman? - A. No, I was.

What are you now? - A. I work for an agricultural
contractor.

At the time your job was ambulanceman? - A. Yes.

That wasn't the reason why you were at the Sheffield
Wednesday Ground on the 15th of April, 1989? - A. No.

Because you had a part-time job as well? - A. Yes, I
worked in the bar of the Steps Restaurant.

Is that in the South Stand? - A. It is.

You like football? - A. Yes.

One of the advantages is that once you had finished
serving and the match had started you could get out and
watch? - A. Yes.

You weren't there because you were an ambulanceman? - A.
No.

That was coincidence? - A. Yes.
                                             A. K. LAWSON

You were there because you were serving food and drink? -
A. Yes.

      THE CORONER:  Has Mr. Lycett gone?   Can you ask
him to wait a minute or two.   I want him to mark the
plan.

Can you put the plan up of the ground?   Show me where
this restaurant is where you work? - A. That is the
restaurant there.

Right at the back there? - A. Yes.

Can you see the ground from there or do you have to walk
away from the restaurant to get... - A. You have to walk
through the restaurant, through two sets of doors and up
some steps so you can see the ground.

So you go on to the back of the South Stand, do you? - A.
Yes, that's right.




     Q. I think the best thing to do
                                                A. K. LAWSON

I think the best thing to do is can you mark the
position from where you were observing the events on
the field?  I am not interested in the restaurant.
(The Witness marked his position on^Exhibit C409)
So that is actually more or less above the players'
tunnel, but a lot higher up, is that right? - A. Sort
of to the left of the players' tunnel.

At 2 o'clock you had a few moments so you popped out, I
think, and had a look, is that right? - A. We popped
out and had a look, yes, at the first break we had.

At that time anything to see? - A. Basically nothing
seemed to be filling up quite like it normally did on a
big game.  They still seemed to be a lot less seats
being taken, standing room being taken.

On both ends, or just the Liverpool end? - A. Both
ends.  It wasn't just one side, it was both.

Then I think at about 2.20 you could see the train
coming in? - A. Yes, we saw a train coming in on the
old line.  We know it is for football because they
don't use that line for anything else but football
trains.

Then you went back to the restaurant about 2.30 or so,
is that right? - A. Yes.

You had to do a bit   of clearing up and work   and so on?
- A. Yes.

You then heard a loud cheer,   I think, did you? - A.
Yes.

Do you know what time that was? - A. I can't remember
any times to be precise, but I would assume it would be
about 10-to, 5-to-3.

So you popped out again to have another look, to see
what was going on? - A. Yes.

On this occasion what did you see? Did you see the
teams on the pitch? - A. The teams had come out on the
pitch.  We assumed that it what the cheer was for.

Were they coming out for their pre-match ...? - A. Yes.

Getting ready for the kick-off? - A. Yes.

It wasn't just to kick the ball around? - A. No.
                                            A. K. LAWSON

Did you see them run out of the players' tunnel? - A.
No, they had already run out of the players' tunnel
when we got there.

That is what you thought was the cheer? - A. Yes.

At that point did you look around? - A. I looked around
to see what how the crowd were.  We had a sort of game
to see how many people came into the ground, and we
used to have a pound bet on it.  It was just the first
reaction we all did, to look round and see if it was
full.

What did you notice? - A. What I noticed was ....

The players are on the pitch, yes? - A. Yes.

Okay. - A. Over by the Leppihgs Lane end, the two
middle pens were absolutely jam-packed.  From where we
were standing it looked absolutely jam-packed and the
wings at the Leppings Lane end, you could move around
freely.  There seemed so many people in there it was
unbelievable.

You could see that quite clearly when you looked
across? - A. Yes, it was the talking point between us,
everybody who was stood there, and I don't know if it
is 1 or 2-minutes-to-3 or on kick-off - I didn't
actually take much notice of the kick-off - we seemed
to see some people coming over the top.

Over the top of the fencing? - A. Over the top of the
fencing and our opinion was that it would be very lucky
if the game kicked off, and if it did kick off then it
would be stopped because we thought it was a pitch
invasion.  We don't often have them - I can't remember
the last time we had one at Hillsborough, but that is
what we assumed it was.  We assumed it was a pitch
invasion.

That is what it looked like to you.  It looked crowded
and packed, but it looked like a pitch invasion? - A.
Yes, that is what I assumed it was.

So the reason why you thought the game would not kick
off or would have to be stopped was because you thought
there would be trouble, is that right? - A. Yes.

When you say you were discussing it amongst yourselves,
was it the other catering staff? - A. There was two
stewards and my brother was there as well.
                                            A. K. LAWSON

This was  just a minute or two, Ithink you said, before
kick-off?- A. Yes.   From the day I have not been able
to remember any times.

But it is between the players coming out and kick-off
that this happened? - A. Yes.

That is sufficient for our purpose?  Did kick-off then
take place? - A. It must have done because the next
time we looked they were playing football.   I went back
into the restaurant saying I didn't think it would
carry on because there was a pitch invasion.   I went
back out onto the stand, idle curiosity, just
curiosity, I went back out and I noticed that one or
two people were walking round looking as though they
were carrying injuries.  They had come out of both pens
and they  were carrying injuries.

You mean   they were holding their arms? - A.Holding
their arms.   Whether they had sprained or broken them
or whatever, I don't know what, it just looked as
though it was getting a bit messy.

Was game still in play at that point? - A. Yes, I think
so.

What was happening at the Leppings Lane end? You saw
these people who appeared to you to have injuries.
What was happening at the Leppings Lane end? - A. There
were people coming over the barriers and they seemed to
have overtaken the gravel part, and there were one or
two people either sat down or laying down between the
white line on the grass and the gravel part as well.

Did you at that point change your mind as to what was
going on, or did you still think this was a pitch
invasion? - A. I don't know as I changed my mind about
what was going on.  I had not got a clue what was going
on, and my first instincts were, "If there are people
injured I'll go down and see what I can do", and that
is what I did next.

That is what you did, you went down onto the field, and
by the time you got on the field the game had stopped,
is that right? - A. Yes.

You mentioned you saw the people coming over the front
perimeter fence? - A. Yes.

Did you see people going up into the stands as well? -
A. Yes.

Was that at the same time as people were coming over or
earlier? - A. I have not got a clue as to whether I saw
                                              A. K. LAWSON

them as I was walking out of the tunnel going up     into
the stand, or whether it was when I was actually     stood
in the top of the stand, I can't remember.

You can't remember? - A. I can't remember.

But you definitely saw them go up as well as ...? - A.
They went up as well as coming in any direction
forward.

Did you see any Police   Officers around at that time?
How many yards is it,    by theway? How far is it from
where you were to the    central .... - A. From where I
was at the South Stand   I would say 70.

Could you say from when you were looking at the pens -
you have told us that you thought they were packed, was
the word you used, didn't you? - A. Yes.

Could you see whether anybody appeared injured within
the pen? - A. You could not possibly see that because
there were so many people in the pens.   All you could
see was head and shoulders, just a mass.   It looked as
though there were so many people in there.   I have
never seen it as crowded.

Did you see any surges?  Do you know what I mean by
surge - crowd movement?  You may not have done.  Don't
invent, just tell me what you saw? - A. No, I didn't.

You didn't? - A. No, I can't say as I did.

Were you there in 1988? - A. I was, I was working there
as well.                                        &

It is a long time ago but do you recollect what the
pens looked like in 1988? - A. They were still fuller
than the wings in 1988 but I don't think they were ---
?oao* am s u r e t h e y weren't as packed as they were in


I don't want to go through it but I know you helped
      a        PeoPle » You were fortunate in that some
ot the people who you helped did seem to recover, is
that right? - A. Yes.

So that was a gratifying experience for you.

            Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Mr. Lawson, you were working in the restaurant in the
South Stand? - A. Yes.
                                                                92
                                                      A. K. LAWSON

    Q. Could you help me as to how far that is away from where
       you were looking from, where you took your seat? - A.
       We don t have a seat.

B   Q.   You look from the back? - A. We look from where we go
         upthe steps.  As the people go into   the stand, as you,
         go up to the top of the steps where the stewards are,
         that is where we manage to get a peep from.

    Q. So just explain this to me if you would, you are
       working in the restaurant - were you behind the bar, or
       waiting? - A. On that particular day I was behind the
       bar.

    Q. And that does not have a direct view out? - A. No.

    Q. So explain it to me, you are behind the bar, you have
       to walk out from behind the bar, through a doorway.
       Where does that doorway lead to? - A. It leads onto a
       passageway which leads straight into the ground.

    0. So you have got a passageway that then leads to some
D      steps that take you to your viewing point? - A. Yes.

    Q.   How long is the passageway? - A. Ten,   twelve feet.

    Q.   And then the steps before you get to where you are
         going? - A. Seven or eight steps.

    Q. Then can you immediately see? - A. You can immediately
       see the whole ground then.  The only part you can't see
       is the rest of the South Stand.

    Q. When you came out after hearing the loud cheer, both
       teams were already on the pitch? - A. Yes, as far as I
       can remember.

    Q. Yes, we can only go on what you remember.   We are not
       too concerned about the times more of what you could
       actually see of what was going on because that gives us
       an idea, a very clear idea of the time.   So you hear
       the cheer, the cheer is likely to be the teams coming
       out, you make your way through the passageway that you
       have told us about, up the steps, and you take in the
       ground? - A. Yes.

    Q. Of course, the first thing that you look at would not
       be one part rather than another part, you would just
       have a general broad span, wouldn't you, a sweep of the
       ground? - A. All my father's side of the family are
       Liverpool supporters so I always tend to look towards
           my father was in the North Stand towards Leppings
       Lane, so that was the area I was looking for him
       anyway.




H
                                           A. K. LAWSON

I have a little experience of going to football
matches.  Usually when the players come out for a kick
about, I don't mean the early kick about but when they
come out to be announced, they all come running on,
they go towards the middle and they wave? - A. Yes.

That had all happened? - A. Yes.

By this time that you had got out and were looking, was
there already by this time kicking one or two towards
the goal and that sort of thing? - A. Yes, that sort of
thing was happening.

So it seemed to you that the players had already been
on the pitch for perhaps a couple of minutes before you
got out to start looking? - A. I had not got a clue how
long they had been out on the pitch.

It could have been that quite easily? - A. It could
have been a minute, it could have been two minutes.

You were not there for kick-off, you went back again? -
A. Yes, I went back again.  I went back, it may have
been about a minute-to-3 when I went back in.




           /Q. This is what I wanted
                                                    A. K. LAWSON

Q. This is what I wanted to get at. How long do you
   think you were out there weighing up the crowd for
   your bet? - A. Three or four minutes *
Q. It seems on that basis, because we know the
   Nottingham team went on to the pitch just after five
   to and we know from you that you got out there after
   the Nottingham team had got on to the pitch, that you
   would have been likely to have been looking round the
   crowd at somewhere about three or four minutes to.
   Would that be about fair? - A. Yes, that sounds about
   right.
               Cross-Examined bv MR. HUMPHREYS?
Q. Would it surprise you if anyone observing this scene
   disagreed with your view that the two centre pens
   were very packed? - A. Yes, it would surprise me,
   very much so.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Humphreys he has answered the
question but could you just repeat your question for me?      I
just did not quite catch it.
     MR. HUMPHREYS: I asked whether he would be surprised
if someone looking at this scene, at the two centre pens,
did not comprehend that they were packed, very packed.
      THE CORONER:   Yes, and he has answered it.
Q.      MR. HUMPHREYS: Briefly on this question of people
     getting over the fence, your first thought was that
     it was a pitch invasion? - A. Yes.
Q. How many people had got over the fence while you were
   looking? - A. I cannot remember. All I can remember
   basically is that my first thought was that there is
   going to be trouble. There will be a pitch invasion.
   That was my first initial thought.
Q. How long did it take you to become disabused of that
   idea? - A. About a minute, a minute and a half. Not
   very long. As we came to the decision I went back
   in. I came back out and I must have been stood there
   thirty or forty seconds. No, maybe a bit longer, a
   minute or two minutes, and I thought "I don't know
   what is going off”. I had changed my mind from a
   pitch invasion to that I had not got a clue what was
   going off. I just thought, "I will go down and see
   what I can do".
                                                A. K. LAWSON

              Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:
Q. Mr. Lawson, you said that the middle^pens were jammed
   solid and there were so many people in there that it
   was an unbelievable sight. You actually said it was
   unbelievable? - A. Yes.
Q. You said there were two stewards with you at the
   time? - A. Yes.
Q. Did the stewards go to see what was happening
   immediately you all realised that the pens were so
   full? - A. We were stood so far away. The stewards
   had got their area to look after, I presume, I don't
   know, and they stayed where they were where their
   area of the ground is.
Q. They did not make any comments to you as to what they
   were going to do? - A. No, not really because once
   everything started to happen I basically went my own
   way anyway.

Q. You had noticed that the centre pens were very full
   and yet you thought it may be a pitch invasion you
   say. Didn't the fact that the pens were so full,
   didn't you think it may be an overspill? - A. I
   suppose it is conditioning from what I have been used
   to on TV and newspapers. You see people coming
   towards a football pitch. You think it is an
   invasion automatically and I think that is what
   triggered my mind off. It wasn't until I got down
   there that I realised the full extent of what was
   happening.

Q. The numbers had alarmed you all the same? - A. Yes,
   they had alarmed us, yes. I can't condone myself by
   saying I thought it was anything else other than a
   pitch invasion.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Catchpole, before you cross-
examine, I just want to go over the timings a little bit
more with him and then I will let you have a go. I will
give everybody else a chance as well.
                  Further bv THE CORONER:
Q. I just want to get this absolutely right as near as
   we can get it. We are now talking about when you
   came out when you heard the loud cheer? - A. Yes.
Q. You heard the cheer, you came out, and you explained
   to Mr. Isaacs that both teams were already on the
   pitch? - A. Yes.
                                             A. K. LAWSON


You watched it for a few minutes I think at that
point? - A. Yes.
It was at that point that you saw people coming over
and you formed the impression that there was a pitch
invasion? - A. There was going to be a pitch
invasion, yes.
Did you then go back into the restaurant? - A. I went
back towards the restaurant. There were colleagues
of mine that were having their lunch and they were
rushing their lunch down, it was both me and my
brother, and we turned round and said, "Don't rush.
We think it will be stopped within a few minutes". I
honestly didn't think the game was going to go on.
That is the reason why you went back? - A. Yes.
You told them to take their time, that there would be
a delay for whatever reason? - A. Yes.
When you set off to go in to tell them that, the
match had not yet kicked off, is that right? - A. I
don't think it had.
You then turned round and came back to have another
look, is that right? - A. Yes.
When you got back to your reviewing position, was
game in play? - A. Yes.
Presumably there were more people now behind the
goal? - A. Yes.
You have explained to me they were beginning to
encroach a little bit over the running track or
whatever it is called, that perimeter track? - A.
Yes.
Was it at that point you saw the injuries or was it a
little later? - A. It was when I was actually on the
South Stand. You could see that one or two of the
people who were coming over the top were carrying arm
injuries. They were sort of coming over the top and
sitting down straight away.
What I am trying to find out is when you looked at
those injuries how did you think they were caused?
Your first thought is, "Oh dear, there is somebody
hurt". What did you think was the cause of the
injury? - A. I honestly didn't think of a cause. I
know it is easy to say but I didn't think of a cause.
I just thought, "There's people injured".
                                              A. K. LAWSON

Just look at your statement and the last four lines
on this page? - A. Yes.
                                     v
Does that refresh your memory in any way? - A. Yes.
Pardon? - A. Yes, that does.   That is what I thought
the injuries were from.
The fact that it is highlighted please ignore. That
is just to help me pick it out. Can you read it
please? - A. It says:
      "From my position it appeared that the
      problem was still one of a pitch invasion
      and it appeared people had been injured
      just getting over the fence."
That was your initial thought? - A. That was my
initial thought.
Having had that initial thought, when did you switch
and say, "This is not it"? You told Mr. Payne it was
only a matter of a minute? - A. It was talking about
the pitch invasion and then all of a sudden there was
something more wrong than that. There was too many
people. There was too much.
Too much was happening? - A. They weren't coming
towards the pitch as in running towards it. They
were just sort of milling around.
           Cross-Examined bv MR. CATCHPOLE:
These questions may seem somewhat obvious but they
arise out of the questions put by the lady on my left
here. The place where you were standing when you
watched the match is both the entrance and the
emergency exit? - A. It is.
You probably know at least this much; stewards have a
prime responsibility to ensure the safe exit of fans
from that stand? - A. That is right, yes.
In the event of an emergency? - A. That is right.
One of the reasons they stand at the exit is to keep
it clear? - A. Yes, that is right.
It would not have come as any surprise to you that
the stewards did not move from that position because
that would involve moving away from the very task
that they had been assigned? - A. That is right.
  THE CORONER:   Is there anything else from anybody?

     MR. MANNING:     No, sir.
                                         %

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Lawson, I am most grateful to you
for your help. Thank you very much indeed. Is Mr. Wilson
still here? Yes. Mr. Humphreys, he helped particularly
with the Hicks' girls. He has mentioned them specifically.
Do you want him to tell you what he remembers about them?
I do not think it gets the Inquest any further forward.
Mr. Hicks is not here. Do you want to hear it at all?
     MR. HUMPHREYS: May I just take instructions? Sir, I
understand that would be a proper course to take at this
time although it does not, as you say, specifically help
the Inquest.

     THE CORONER:     You would like him to just recount it?
     MR. HUMPHREYS:    Yes, sir.
                    Further bv THE CORONER:
Q. Mr. Lawson, I was debating about it. I hesitated
   about asking you something and then Ichanged my
   mind. I decided perhaps I should.    I wanted to just
   pick up one particular aspect of your rescue effort
   because I think if I can just quickly take you
   through what I understand you did, having come down,
   you dealt with about three different people
   initially. That is right, is it not, Mr. Lawson? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Some of whom recovered but you do not really know who
   they are. That is right, is it not? - A. No.
Q. That is correct? - A. Yes.
Q. Then I think you ran back inside and decided to ring
   the Ambulance Service, is that right? - A. It seems a
   crazy thing to do at the time.
Q. No, I am not saying that, but that is what you did? -
   A. It is just that I hadn't got a clue what was
   happening.
Q. Because, of course, you are an ambulanceman? - A.
   Yes.

Q. They told you, "We know"? - A. Yes.
Q. So you then went back on to the pitch, is that right?
   - A. Yes.
                                              A. K. LAWSON

You then made your way I believe towards the Leppings
Lane end? - A. I went to where I thought the major
problems would be which was towards the goal.
I think it was then you discovered these two young
girls lying on the ground who you did not know, of
course, at the time? - A. No.

Subsequently you identified them from photographs in
newspapers, is that right? - A. Yes.
They were the two Hicks' girls? - A. Yes.
I think when you got there would I be right in saying
that their dad was with them or at least somebody? -
A. Somebody who I presumed to be their dad was with
them, yes.

Can you remember whether the ambulances had already
arrived at that point? - A. I never saw an ambulance
from the start to when I went out of the ground.
I think you started giving heart massage to one of
the girls and artificial respiration? - A. Yes.
That is the one with the lighter coloured hair , is
that rxght? - A. Yes, I think so.
Do you know or not? - A. Yes, it was the lighter
colour haired one.

Apart from yourself who else was assisting? - A.
There was a young St. John's Ambulance lady.
Did you see any doctors there? - A. There was a
doctor came towards us after we had started but I
think somebody had been trying to give them - I think
somebody had been trying to resuscitate them before
we got there. Their jumpers had been rolled up which
we presumed to be to aid the resuscitation. So we
presumed that somebody had tried before we got there.
When you got there can you recollect whether any
medics were already there or do you think you were
the first?   No, I will start this sentence again.
Apart from their dad, assuming for the moment that it
was their dad, was there anybody else assisting the
girls that you can remember? - A. I can't remember.
You cannot remember? - A. No.
                                           A. K. LAWSON

It is very hard but you tried for a while with this
St. John's Ambulance? - A. We tried for a while but we
just couldn't do anything.

Then I think another young man was brought alongside?
- A. Yes.

And you felt that you could help him? - A. He was
alive.

There was a chance? - A. There was a chance that we
were going to save him, so we did what we could.

     THE CORONER: I take it nobody has got any
questions of Mr. Lawson.  Thank you very much indeed.
I am most grateful to you but I thought we had perhaps
better just deal with it.  Now, Mr. Lycett if you
would just come back.

           DAVID RUSSELL LYCETT Recalled

              Further by THE CORONER:

Actually go to the overhead.   All I want you to do is
to put a cross on the position where you were when you
were sitting outside the gate.

     MR. KILLOCH:  Do you want it marking on this
plan, sir, or the overall plan?

     THE CORONER: No, that plan because it is on there
so we can see it.  It is clearer on there.
Do you want a bigger plan, or are you all right?
(Witness marks plan )

     MR. BEECHEY:   That is C410, sir.

     THE CORONER: Where did he mark it? Can you
point? Yes, I can see it. Anything arising out of
that from anybody?  .... Mr. Lycett, I am very sorry
to have delayed you, but I just like to have it.

      Ladies and gentlemen, it is quarter-to 4 and we
are stopping.   That is nice, is it not?  So go home
and we will see you tomorrow at 10 o'clock, and I hope
your little girl is okay.   That is good, I am pleased.
I was reasonably confident that she would be, but I
thought it was right that you should have the
opportunity to go straight away.   Tomorrow morning
then, all being well, at 10 o'clock.   Thank you very
much indeed and I will just deal with the lawyers for
a minute or two ~ not deal with, that is the wrong
word.   Deal with the list I should say.
            (In the absence of the Jury)

     THE CORONER: I hope I am not rude to you when I
say a thing like that.  I do not mean it, I assure
you.  I do not mean to be rude.  Tomorrow we have got,
all being well, Mr. Motson, Mr. Shrewsbury - I am
still thinking about Mr. Shrewsbury, whether we really
need him, but I will tell you who he is in a moment -
Mr. Brown, Mr. Ball, Mr. Robertson, Mr. Sephton and
Mr. Case.  Mr. Sephton is the young man whom we cut
off in mid-stream, if you will remember, yesterday.

     I think everybody knows who Mr. Motson is. He is
the BBC man, the commentator.  Mr. Shrewsbury is a
producer, and he happened to be coming up this way so
we have told him to call in. As I say, I am still
debating to what extent we need him.

      I am minded to play part of the main BBC video
tape, partly because the compilation tape has a lot of
it in it but it has not got the sound, as you know,
whereas this tape has got the sound and we can
actually hear the conversations between Mr. Motson and
Mr. Shrewsbury and what is said.   I am going to stop
it probably at 6 minutes past 3, in other words when
the match ends, partly because we already have a lot
of the rescue effort on the other film, and partly
because, as we get further and further into it, we get
more and more commentary which is not based on what
Mr. Motson sees or observes, but what he has been told
by other people.   I am exceedingly reluctant to enter
that mine-field, particularly as it is totally
irrelevant to the Inquests.   So although there are
bits, if you like, which are interesting - for
instance there is a scene later on where you can see
what happens at Gate 4 with Sergeant Swift and I could
actually take it up to that point without getting into
the comments which I think would be inappropriate for
the Inquest - I certainly do not want to take it
beyond that.

     I am saying this now because you may say to me,
"Why haven't you taken it to 15.15?" if that is your
cut-off point, and the reason is because I would have
to edit out the commentary and I think it is just too
difficult to do.  So is that clear?  It looks as if
you would be happy to see the video.   That is really
what I wanted Mr. Shrewsbury for probably, so that he
could, if need be, explain any aspects as to its
construction and anything else that he saw because he
was in an enclosed space watching monitors.
     So that is what we will be doing tomorrow, all
being well, and hopefully we intend to start with the
two BBC men, and then we will move on.   We have got to
have these two youngsters whom we postponed from
yesterday and the other people axe relatives or
supporters.

     One of them, Mr. Robertson, Mr. Humphreys, is
associated with the Owen family and the Owen family
have raised a query about the summaries which I have
got my own views about but Hr. Robertson will be able
to deal with it, so we will hopefully dispose of that
aspect tomorrow.

     MR. HUMPHREYS:   Mr. King will be back tomorrow.

     THE CORONER:  I mention it to you.     It will be
passed on if you do not see him.

     MR. HUMPHREYS:   Yes.

     THE CORONER: Is there anything else that anybody
wants or needs to say to me? .... In that case, let us
all go home.  Goodnight everybody.

     (The Inquests were ad.journed until
        10 o'clock the following morning)

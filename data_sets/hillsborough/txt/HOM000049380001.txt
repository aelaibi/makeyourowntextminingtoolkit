 Thank you for your letter of 28 November to Mike Ward about Gary’s body file.

 We have searched through all our papers, and I regret that we are unable to trace the cover to
 the file you sent us. I can only apologise for this, and hope that it does not cause you too
 much inconvenience. As Mr Ward explained in his earlier letter, the file was placed on one of
 our own files, and it would appear that at this stage the cover was not retained.

 Please accept my apologies once again.

 Yours sincerely




C F BONE
Secretary to the Scrutiny

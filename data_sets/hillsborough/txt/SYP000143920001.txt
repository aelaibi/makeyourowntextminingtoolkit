                     I saw Police Officers urging fans in the West Stand terraces

        to get back,,       Then some Police went      into the    crowd over         the   fences,

        c o u l d n ’t see what they did from what      I saw I    formed the         opinion the

        should have been more Police Officers on duty inside the ground.

 That was         th«    last occas ion that we                       saw them arid that must                         have     been

 there were          no orderly queues,                     with      people      jostling             for      space,,        We

 then joined            the     crowd    forming             up outside          turnstiles             A        G„     Wh ilst

leading        up to the West Stand.

When     I was      in my seat         the      three    of us were        s e p a r a t e d and      X couid

unaware        of any      crowd     problem         in the    below    terracing,,           H o w e v e r , whe n

the m a t c h      started,       I could see          fans    climbing        over    the     fencing and            onto

the    pitch f rom the middle                   peris behind the         goal.         Initially         I was

unaware        of the      reason      for      the   people    climbing         over     the     fencing        but       1

pitch,,        I was      then    informed       by a chap sitting              next     to me that            two

people       had been killed             (he had heard this             over      his W a l k m a n stereo)

This    was       at about 3,30          pm    ("1530) and we         experienced         no d i f f i c u l t y

walk i n g     opposite        the L e p p i n g s    Ln entrance       where we had a r r a n g e d             to

extent       of    the tragedy and             that Martin,       Christopher            and D avid        had       not

that    they had been victims                   of the    incident.

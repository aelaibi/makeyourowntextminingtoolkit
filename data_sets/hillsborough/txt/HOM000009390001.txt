3.     The Chairman introduced the mee ti n g by stating that the Chief
Constable had approved the holding of an extra meeting of                 the
A ssociation to discuss "The H il l s borough Stadium D i s a s t e r . "


      Chief Superintendent Surridge explained that it was not to be an
inquest into Hills b o r ou g h but was an excellent opportunity to look ahead
at the roie and r e s p o n s i b i 1ities of the Superintending ranks at f o o t b a l1
matches and, at other large public gatherings.                  He proposed that
Superintendent Rose inform member of the current situation at Gillingham
football ground (and Superintendent Lambert at Dartford alias Maidstone)
- this was done.


       The m e e t i n g then p ro c eeded to discuss, at considerable length, the
issues contained in the letter from the National Secretary of the
A ssociation dated 18/8/89.


       The headings and the meetings views are summarised be l o w : -


(a )   The future role and responsibility of police at football

              — future role and responsibilities of police at all          p laces of
 ent e r t ainment where large crowds gather                                 -------
          The answer above should relate to all events.

 (C)    — Q is n o w P r i m a r i ly responsible for safety at licensed p r e m i a

        The licensee has prim a r y responsibility for safety.

        Who has the righ t to ban matches as a conseguence

       On the day of the match the Police Commander has the right to
ban/stop a match. Should any other authority ie the Club, Fire Service
etc., wish to ban/stop   the match this must be done via the Police
Commander.

        W ho is the best gualified to d r aw up agreements between police and
clubs                                                  ~ ~~         ------—

      Whilst it is accepted that local agreements are required it is
felt that they should be completed only within statutory powers.      The
County Solicitor is dealing w i t h agreements in Kent. It was felt that
if there was no statutory requirement on clubs to inform police of
proposed ^ matches etc., then ma n y would not do so due to the increased
cost.   We must be made aware, accept responsibility and be in command.
The statute needs to say that the Club will p a y .


(^ )    What is m e a n t by 'Chief Officer' in recommendation 26

        An ofticer of ACC rank - who should accept full responsibility.


        Should g ates be left open in every case as in recommendation 8

      No.   Gates should be closed but easily openable in emerg en c y and
manned by steward/police.     A smaller gate is require to facilitate
removal of individuals from the ground by police.

           Considerable. In future the 'risk' should be paid for by the Club
 o o H r p in9ff            responsibility for payment. In our view this includes
  p°        officers inside and outside of the ground. In the Home Office
 used       a c c o m p a n y i n g _ the Enquiry Report the phrase "at the ground" is
              ^ 1S °Ur view that if the Home Secretary wanted to restrict
 payment he would have said "in the ground." Of course the G o ^ m e S
 may well be saying this deliberately to put the full cost on clubs to
 cut down the size of crowds, number of clubs etc., and thereby reduce
 the associated hooliganism!                                                  y reQuce

 Divisions with Football League C l u b s at mid-week and w e e k e n d s



          Considerable.     We must insist on full payment from the club for
resources used on football to allow adequate cover elsewhere. However
In \ H v p r Q inUf? performance of extra duty for football matches will have
fnr d3prf effect 011 m o r a l e and health, despite the initial enthusiasm
for overtime payment.


(j)       — n ^ S u b- D ivisional Commander still plan and police his    district
p r o p e rly when most resources are at football                               ~—

       The answer is clearly !N o . ’ However, it may be possible to use the
D ay  . reP ° rt to get extra police for the whole of the country,
 eview in g of establishment, locally, for fortnightly matches i unlikely
to be successtul.                                                           1

he had used his resources to the best advantage based on his experience
ana reasonableness then a charge of neglect is unli k e ly to succeed.

_hi.s _liability^ has always been present in the past, but it has npypr


      There was considerable discussion on negligence eg: Is there a
corporate responsibility on the Safety Committee? Are you liable even
if^ you vote against a proposal? Are they in fact a corporate body?


   _ This was an area where the meeting felt that professional legal
advice may well be required at national level. There was even some
support for increased subscriptions to pay for it!


,. ., ^here was some discussion on the Luton experience. There was only
limited support as it was felt impracticable to implement throughout the
football leagues. Memb e r s felt that if we have full control then the
Commander can up his numbers in the event of prospective unruly visit i ng
tans;   if the club refused to pay, in turn, the Police could refuse
permission for the match to go ahead.

       In summary, Kent see the role of the Superintending ranks in the
ground, m future. The A ss o c iation must then seek to achieve complete
   ^CeJ. C0ntrC)1 and full resourcing, so that our rank many carry out
tneir tasks and accept their responsibilities.

          the t r e a t m e n t of VIPs.           As you say, a number of D e p a r t m e n t a l
          int e r e s t s are inv olved and we prop o s e to pull these together.
          D O E chairs an int e r d e p a r t m e n t a l w o r k i n g g roup of o f f i c i a l s on

Thank      you       for    the     exc e l l e n t   lunch       on   13      M a r c h w h e n we         discuss#<|
issues       rel at in g to the 1991 R u g b y U n i o n W o r l d Cup.


I said       I would         look      into h o w we          intend      to go about              co-ordinating
the v a r i o u s G o v e r n m e n t       i n t erests and resp on se s to the event.                              The
Department           of     the E n v i r o n m e n t      are v e r y aware          of    the n e e d to pull
the      strand s          together.           The y       have      in     mind      the     possibility                of
setting         up     a    working       g roup      of     off i c i a l s    to    ha n d l e    preparations
for the to ur nament.


I    think       that        it     would     be      a    us eful     n ext       step      if     you       were
d i s c u s s the p o s i t i o n w i t h Mr Moynihan,                    the M i n ister          for Sport.             I
kno w     his     off ic e        have     b een      in    tou ch     with       yo u     abo ut       a     meeti ng .
Perhaps         yo u       coul d    t e lephone          t hem   on      01    276      3449      to       arra n g e    «

          A l t h o u g h the time was              now past 3 . 1 5 p m        (1515)       there were still a number

I made my way further                   into the aKea,           still      trying       to a ss es s what          had

to gain access              to the      g round area,         this     being     due to the          large metal

took    charge        of this     person and b egan to evacu at e                   him to the

                           By 5 p m    (1700)        the m e s s a g e s were      t al king a bo ut       traffic      problems,

                           obviously          being       caused by the fans              leaving    the ground,         made w or se            by

                           r e t u rn in g    e me r g e n c y vehicles.        At the L e p p i n g s Lane a r ea the fans were

                           now    clear,          and as    our original        brief       had been traffic            patrol      in the

                           T a n k e r s l e y area,       I decided       to   resume      to my serial         to a s si s t w i t h

                           traffic,          as    possible.



                           I n oted that as we               b egan to move         off     in our     vehicle       the time was            in

                           fact 5 p m        (1700).        We    p a t r ol le d as best we        could a long        the A61       b et w ee n

                                                                          AjO ^
We    con ti nu ed to       patrol     and a t t e n d e d an   incident       reported as P o li c e

O f fi c e r     in trouble     near    the s up er markets                 ---------------------
                                                                   in Ha\if\ax  Road, but nothing

was    found.         Due to the amount          of traffic on the             radio   it was     still     not

p ossible        to pass m es sa ge s      to    control.



By 6 . 3 0 p m     (1830)    the A61      towards T a n k e r s le y was almost          clear.       As we

t r av e l l e d down towards Hills bo ro ug h,              I noticed a gap in air              traffic

and for the first             time m a n a g ed to       contact    control.        I e xp l a i n ed the

road     conditions and a s k e d for             instructons.        We were       instructed        to

continue          patrol    for the time being.             Due to the fact that we had not

had a n y t h i n g    to eat or drink since               10.30   (1030)      I instructed my driver

to a t t e n d at C l a y w h e e l s Lane Garage w ith the hope                 of obtaining

r ef re sh me nt s     for my serial.



Again,         they were     inst ru ct ed to      remain together          until      instructions were

confirmed.            At 7.15pm      (1915)      I was     i nstructed to stand down my serial,

but    to      remain a v a il ab le my se lf      until     i nstructed otherwise.              At

C l a y w h e e l s Lane,    I could find no one who a p p e a r e d             to be    collecting

d eb ri e f i ng    forms,    radios      or other       paperwork,      but    realised this was due

to the o p er a t i on still           in a c t i o n at   the ground.          At 7.3 0 p m   (1930)      I

was    joined by Inspector Sykes who                     informed me that we had now all                   be

stood down.            I went    off duty at 7.45pm             (1945)    that date.



One    of my officers           had been del eg at ed to go w i th one of the deceased.

Prior       to    leaving,    I made      certain that his w h e r e a b o u t s were          noted,      and

made     pro vi si on a r r a n g e m e n t s   for his transport         back to       ’A ’ D i v i s i o n on

his    return.

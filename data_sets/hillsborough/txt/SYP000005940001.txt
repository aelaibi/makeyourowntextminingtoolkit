1 was        not allo w e d       to go out           the gate             onto         the    pitch so        I climbed

ov   s r    the    fence    because          I was      concerned                fo r    the    safety      of    m   y t r i ends ,,

X wa l k e d ar o u n d         the     pitch     but      could not              find        them,,     1 was about            to

walk aro und again when                      1 saw George              GLOVER            standing        in the        rear     of

the        pen which we          had been         in before            the        trouble,,            I went     up to him

and told him that                 I w ould        go back          onto          the     pitch to try and               find the

other        friends.       I could not             find anyone                  so     1 went       back   to Ge o r g e       who

w a s s t i 3.1 t a 1k n g to a P o lice m a n ,,                    I w e n t t o t n e t o i 1e t n e a r t o

turnstile           and could            not get     back to George                     because        the Police would

not        let anyone       bac,<        in,,I s t o o d      o u t s 1 a & t h e g r o u vsd a n d later

                  came    out,    we wa i t e d       for a        w h i   l e    ana     then went         b a c k    to the

clear.                   was at       the    car and we made                     some     phone        calls,     then we

decided           to go to       the S o 1 u t a t j.o n P u b 1 i c H o use.                   We all      made       phone

calls        to try and find out what                      had h a p pened                to Barry,         but we          could

not        find out any details                 so we      came home.

The        next morning                                    rang up and told me                          that B a r r y had

died.

In my opinion the                 incident was             caused by lack                      of stewards            and

Police.            There    was       no o r g a n i s a t i o n     outside            the     ground.          The     people

outside           were    not    in any       queues       just a heaving mass all                             trying         to get

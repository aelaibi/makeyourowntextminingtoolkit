     To date, the efforts of A n n A d l i n g t o n and C olin M o n e y p e n n y have
     b e e n invaluable. Howe v e r the G roup is aware that both A n n and
     C o l i n spend lots of their own spare time in progressing the
     families case for justice. The unanimous opinion of the Group is
     that so m u c h mor e c ould be a c h i e v e d and the case strengthened if
     A n n and Colin could be seconded to the campaign on a full time
     basis. In this regard I w ould be m o s t grateful if yo u would give
     serious consi d e r a t i o n to this proposal as a matter of urgency.
     Time is of the essence. The families cannot afford to give
     a n y t h i n g less than their best efforts at this final stage of
     t heir struggle for justice.

     As yo u will be only too aware, The Hill s b o r o u g h Families have
     b e e n victims of the biggest cover up in Brit i s h legal history.
     This will be our last chance to set the record straight. As a
     result of thee injustice suffered so far, there are v ery few
     p e o p l e who families can trust. The y have total confidence in Ann
     a n d Colin. Just as important, bot h are totally c o mmitted to the
     families quest for the truth.

     I will conclude by again offering the families sincerest thanks
     for your continued support. I am sure that you will appreciate
     that this is proba b l y the most critical stage of the families
     s e a r c h for justice. We cannot let our loved ones down now. If we
     let this opport u n i t y go we will never forgive ourselves and more
     i m p o r t a n t l y - neither will they.

     All Members of Parliament.


                              H I L L S B O R O U G H D I S A S T E R - JUSTICE CAMPAIGN


     Mr George Foulkes M.P


     I am writ i n g to ask for your support for the campaign m o u n t e d by
     the Hil l s b o r o u g h Family Support G r o u p for the justice and
     a c c o u n t a b i l i t y w h i c h we be li e v e has so far bee n denied to us by
     the complete failure of the judicial system in the a f termath of
     the H i l l s b o r o u g h Disaster.

     Yo u should be aware that following the broadcast on Independent
     T e l e v i s i o n on December 5th 1996 of the d r a m a /documentary
     "Hillsborough", the Home S e cretary is presently considering
     whether, on the basis of the ne w a n d unused evidence which
     e m e r g e d from the programme, there are grounds for hi m to order a
     fresh Inquiry into the Disaster. M r Howard in fact spoke
     p e r s o n a l l y in the H ouse of Commons adjournment debate which was
     h e l d about Hil l s b o r o u g h on 17th December, 1996 and he later met
     p r i v a t e l y w ith the m a n y family memb e r s who had t r avelled to
     L o n d o n to be present at the debate.

     Th e Hil l s b o r o u g h Family Support G roup is hopeful that the Home
     s e c r e t a r y will order a fresh inquiry, p a r t i cularly in the light
     not onl y of the ne w evidence but also of overwhelming public
     support we have received - people from all walks of life from
     right across Britain have w r i t t e n to us and t elephoned to express
     their outrage and anger at the treatment of bereaved families.
     However, regardless of the d e c i s i o n of Mr Howard, the families
     h a v e also separately instigated the following legal actions to
     t ake forward our quest for j u s t i c e :-

    i) a complaint to the Director of Public Prosecutions seeking a
    criminal investigation into p o s sible misconduct in the way
    e v i d e n c e was or was not pre s e n t e d to the Inquest jury. This
    a c t i o n is b ased on the evidence w h i c h has no w come to light of
    v i d e o - technician, Roger Houldsworth, who was not called as a
    w i t n e s s to either the Taylor Inquiry or the Inquest and whose
    e x i s t e n c e was not k nown to the families until the TV programme
    w a s made. The new evidence directly contradicts what some South
    Y o r k s h i r e police officers tol d the jury and Taylor inquiry.

     ii) an a p p l i c a t i o n to the A t t o r n e y General under section 13 of
     th e coroners act asking the H igh Court to consider quash i n g the
     inquest verdict and ordering a fresh inquest.

Liverpool City Council, at an extra o r d i n a r y meet i n g held on 19th
D e c ember 1996, have already pled g e d their unanimous support to
the families in our campaign. W ith the assistance of the City
Council, the c a m paign is n o w being taken out across the country
w here it is our intention to seek the support of local
authorities in all areas of Brit a i n in response to the mass i v e
public disquiet w h i c h has emanated from the television programme
(the "Daily Mirror", for example, has received a huge response to
the petit i o n it launched in December, on behalf of the families,
supporting the call for a new Inquest into the Disaster.) The
response to the programme clea r l y indicates this is a ma t t e r of
public intrest and should be dealt wit h accordingly.

The B e r eaved families of H i l l s b o r o u g h will forever be in debt to
writer J immy M c G o v e r n and to Gran a d a T e levision for bringing the
tale of our fight for justice into homes and consciences of the
B r i t i s h people. However, in some ways the story told on
t e l e v i s i o n could not truly reflect the scale of what we have been
m a d e to endure by having the a b s olute grief of losing our loved
ones comp o u n d e d by what can o nly be described as the biggest
farce and cover up in British legal history. As if this was not
e n o u g h of a burden, the families, desp i t e the unequivocal
findings of the Taylor Inquiry, have also ha d to fight to counter
a c o ncerted and seemingly intentional c a m paign by certain public
and m e d i a figures to scar the r e putation and memories of our
loved ones by blaming them, and their fellow supporters, for
c aus i n g the Disaster.

The "Hillsborough" television p r ogramme seems at last to have
w a s h e d away the cartload of lies about the Disaster w hich have
s tood as a barrier to the reaching of a fair and just conclusion
about the needless deaths of 96 people. On behalf of the
H i l l s b o r o u g h Family Support G roup I would no w urge you to help us
go one step further and establish as a mat t e r of public record
for all time the truth of what did ha p p e n on that dreadful day of
15th April, 1989. Only if that can be done m a y the bereaved
families be able to put our loved ones finally to rest.

Y ours faithfully

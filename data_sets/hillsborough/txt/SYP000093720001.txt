                   Further to the Questionnaire that I completed for the West Midlands

                   Police   in respect of the Hillsborough Disaster on Saturday 13 April

                   1989 (130489).



                   Between about six minutes          past three         (1506) and twenty past three

$                  (.1520)-, I was at the front of the seating area overlooking                 pen thre*

                   of the Leppings Lane terracing.             During this time,        I was pulling

                   people up into the stand from the terraces.



                   At about twenty past three            (1520),    1 went back down into pen three to

                   see if I could assist         in any way.



                   After getting back into pen three,               I immediately became aware of a
                                                                           PAGfc.
                                                                           S379S

number of dead bodies that were       in a large pile at the front of the

pen,   to the right of the-exit gate in the front perimeter fence.              The

pen had gradually cleared and thara was a lot more space            in there.

Some   injured people were still being helped out of the pen.           Bodies

from the pile at the front of the pen were being pulled out of the pen

through the exit gate in the front fence.          They were being pulled out

mainly by Liverpool      supporters with the assistance of a couple of

Police Offi ce rs .



                            ing removed,    I was assisting    injured people out




At a time that I could only estimate to be between three thirty pm

(1530),. and three forty pm (1540).         I could see that the majority of

the bodies had been removed from the front of the pen and there were

possibly five or six bodies left on the terraces.             I was aware that a

crush barrier had broken inside pen three and 1 was standing on the

terracing about five or.six feet behind the hrqken left hand section

of the barrier.       .When--my attention was drawn to one body in particular



I saw a male person lying on the terraces about three feet behind the

broken middle section of the barrier.          The person was about three to

four feet away from me, to my right.          He was lying on his back with

his head towards pen two and his feet towards pen ifour.           He was a

large man with a.large, pot be l l y .     What struck me about him was how

white his stomach w a s , it had no colour at all.       The mans face was
/
 overed,   possibly with a jacket,     but I ’m not too sure.     He was

obviously dead.       Two lads then came over a n d ; picked the man up, one

took his legs and the other took the mans upper body.            They started

walking towards the gate.        It was obvious that they were struggling

               with the man,         so I went over and took one of the mans                         legs,   the right

               leg I think.          The three of us then carried the man to the gate in the

               front    perimeter fenpe where we passed him o u t , through the g a t e , to

Dear Dr Molyneux

                        Re: Kevin Tyrrell (died 15 4 89?
                    Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield

       Thank yon for your letter of 28th November 1989, in connection with the
death of this youth at the Hillsborough disaster in April of this year.

       Although, as Dr Burns quite rightly pointed out, inhaled stomach contents
are commonly found at post-mortem and do not necessarily mean a great deal, the
inhalation in Kevin's case was quite significant and was, I believe, the. main
cause of his deathjfetnhalation clearly occurred while he was still alive, as
seen by the presence of haemorrhage in the lungs, and was not just a post-mortem
phenomenon.

       Although still alive when he inhaled vomit, it is nevertheless quite
likely that Kevin was, in fact, unconscious - due to crushing of his chest and
the development of at least some degree of crush asphyxia.     If the inhalation
had not occurred, presumably he would have died from straightforward asphyxia.

       I am' sorry if these comments go slightly against the sequence of events
as you had worked out.    They shouldn’t, however, really alter your advice to
Kevin's parents that he was in no prolonged distress from the choking given that
he was unconscious when it occurred.

      Yours sincerely,

         Dear Dr. Clark,

         Re: Kevin Tyrrell, (date of death 15.4.89), Hillsborough Football Ground

         I believe you carried out the post mortem on this 15 year old boy who died
         in the Hillsborough disaster. The parents recently received a summary of
         the post mortem findings and the social worker who is working with the family
         asked if I would go through this report with them.   (This is something we
         offer to doNwith many of our bereaved parents and they seem to find it
         helpful.)


                                                                                        The post mortem
             findings"showed 'inhalation of stomach contents' a n d 'c ru sh asphyxia.*
             I was unable to discuss this with you as I o n l y "received a copy of the
             report the day before I was due to see the parents but I took the liberty
             of discussing it with Dr. Jim Burns our University Home Pathologist,
                                                     He told,me that inhaled stomach
             contents are fairly commonly found at post mortem and that I could confidently
             tell the parents that Kevin was dead when this happened, and certainly in
             no distress from choking.

             The parents found this very helpful but asked if I would contact you about
             this too. This is why I am writing to you.   I hope you will be able to
             agree with this sequence and timing of events at Kevin's death.

             With many thanks for your kind help.

             Yours sincerely,

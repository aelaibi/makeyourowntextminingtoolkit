young Liv e r p o o l           fans       climbing        over    turnstiles       to effect        entry,

be dela y e d by             15 minutes,            this    relayed to queuing             fans,     horses

m a na ge d      to    clear      gates       for a short time.              It became a p p a r e n t       that

problems           were a ri s i n g at         the m a i n gate an d turnstiles                  to the West

PL A N gate           being      opened and a sudden surge of Liverpool                             fans    pushing

thro u g h them,             not a chance            of p r eventing        the    rush,     only    lasted for

seconds          before        they were a ga i n           pushed too.

D i f fi c u l t      to estimate            numbers who          entered    the ground at           that    time,

w ou l d say about              200 — 300.            As gates        opened      recall     seeing Police

as   to a ll ow fans              in twos,          they were       i nstructed      to have        their    tickets

Couldn't       believe what           I was       seeing;,      incredible         volume of     fans     in this

section of terracing,                 more    than     I had ever         seen.       As    I ran towards

the    fencing        I could see         people     pushed against            the meshing,          packed, in

like    sardines        crying       out for help,           it was      choca all         the way      back   no

chance     of moving.             I recall        seeing     one young        girl about       IS - 14

years,     her       cheeks      pushed     into the mesh i n g          s t ruggling       for air,      she was

blue and       1 could see                                 her    nose and mouth,            I realised she

was    dead,     other       people were          begging       for   help.        I became    aware      of a

gate being           opened      to the     left    of goal L e p p i n g s Lane an d seeing SO to

30 fans trying           to get through             it onto       the    pitch.       A number       of them

fell    causing the           remainder       to do the          same and before m u c h          longer the

gate was jammed              s olid w ith bodies           begging       to be p u l l ed through.______

the m es h i n g where         I had seen the young                 girl,    fans were       climbing       over

those at the front and                  s crambling      over       the fencing       to get       onto    the

pitch.       I r e a l i s e d then that         it was a serious             incident,       I realised

then that        it was a serious              incident,       I realised that there was a

ste a d y gradient         from the       back of the t e r r a c i n g           to the   front and a

t oddler     of a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 1/2 to 4 feet             stood at the front             of the

terracing would            just       be able to       rest his       chin on the          concrete       base

and that there was a                  large number       of    people       under    the young       girl.

It was an h o r r i f i c       sight,        1 could see       people       dying    in front       of my

eyes and       I couldn't         get    in to help,          the    gate was       crammed,       I climbed

up the fencing           and    begged fans to move                 back until       1 was    hoarse,       1

remember       shouting,        "Get     back    people are          dying at the ■front11.               More

an d more      fans      from the       back    climbed towards             the    front    over    the bodies

a n d up the fencing,             my    initial    t h o ughts were          to get hold of these and

thump them,           X couldn't         believe what          they were doing,             as they       got

closer      to me     I realised         the    look    of terror          in their    faces and          pulled

t hem    over,     a number       of them snagging             their       clothing on the          fencing,

but glad to be this               side.

Poli ce O f f i c e r s were y el l i n g        out    for wire       cutters       to get       into the

terracing,         I recall       seeing a number             of officers          punching,       kicking at

the meshing,          then     I saw the face of a young                    girl    in the    crush near to

the     front,     she    looked about          12--14 years         old,    she was       begging    for help

but     couldn't move,          that was        enough for me,             more and more          people were

blue     in the     crowd,      there must        have    been       10-15 dead at          the    front.

This was a nightmare,                  the only thing          on my       conscience       at that       time

was     getting     into     that      terracing and getting                that young       girl    out and

didn't      give a damn how             1 went about          it.     I couldn't get          over    the

fencing,       ran back        towards        the gate where          officers       continued       to free

those     trapped        in the entrance,          I dived          over    landing o n a number            of

crthers.    Other O f f i c e r s        followed,          the next      thing     I recall         is pulling

b ody after      body a w a y from the fencing,                     passing      them back        to a group

of    bobbies who were          resuscitating,               w here was that girl,               I couldn't

see    her anywhere,          then after what               se e m e d an eternity,           she was      there,

I pulled her free,             but      it was       no u s e , she was         blue    in the       face, _______

                                               she was dead.            1 just      broke      down     crying,

at    the same    time       passing         her back        up the terracing,               everyone      1passed

back was     dead,      I    c o u l d n ’t believe          it.     It got to a stage where I                  was

just    looking for          signs      of    life,       digging and digging            until       I could

find someone        w ith     life      in t h e m , then for          some     reason my thoughts

returned to the young                girl      lying       on the terracing,            I picked her up

and    carried her to the entrance                        gate onto     the     pitch,       w h i c h by that

time had been        cleared and a line                    of bobbies         formed a chain to effect

the    removal    of those         dead from the te r r a c i n g              onto the       pitch.       Having

passed her over,             recall      a person          groaning     in the heap of bodies                  still

piled up a ga i n s t        the     perimeter            fencing,    Icouldn't        believe       it,   1

located a man        in      his early twenties,                   eyes open,    groaning,         at   the

bot t o m of that       lot,    together            wit h other      officers       he was       recovered and

drag g e d up the       terracing.             I remember          shout i n g , “Get your           fuckin'1

eyes    open an d    breathe,           breathe,"          he seemed      to respond,          he was      taken

d i r e c t l y to the front         gate and         carried out.

1 have     no idea how         long      I spent          in that    terracing,         it seemed an

eternity.        I do       recall      officers          being ab u s e d    from the S t a n d above              by

Liverpool     fans,         comments         like    "You m u r d e r i n g   black     bastards,        why did

you open them fuckin'                gates."          I couldn't        believe        it,    bobbies were

breaking     their      backs      to    rescue and save             lives and at the             same     time

subject    to that          kind of abuse,            why?      I recall       a bottle        breaking        on

the    terracing     nearby        towards          the    end of the         clearance.        Angry      fans on

the    terracing     tore      down a dv er ti s e m e n t         boards     to use as make            shift

             As    the t e r acing was           clearing,        I recall     seeing a blue         barrier       laid on

             the steps         b uc kl ed     and twisted,         it had more       or    less    shea r e d off at the

             base-        1 reali s e d       then this must have            been the       cause     of the      crush at

             the front,         w i t h all      the fans     pushing       their way      in from the           back,    this

             must      have    s h ea re d    off and      caused those       to fall      and    create a knock on

             effect.          It was a        n i g h t m a r e , the pressure     that    must have          been on

             those at the           front must          have been     phenomenal.

             Once      the t e rr ac in g     had been cleared of bodies                  I walked        back    onto    the

             pitch and         looked back          in disbelief,         people had come           to w a t c h a game

             of football          on a pleasant afternoon,                  what a disaster,           WHY DID        IT HAVE

             TO HAPPEN.

             All      ar o u n d me were L i v erpool         fans,     some    drunk venting          their anger

             towrds O f f i ce rs who            just    stood     in silence.       I could hear,             "Why did

             y o u open the         gate s . "      "Why did you        let    people     in w i t h o u t    tickets."

             "iiy dad's        dead."        It rang      in my ears.          WH Y was the       blame       being

             apportioned          to    the Police,        other     fans     rallied     round     comforting

             others,       trying       to   calm them and e s c o r t i n g       them back        to the       terracing.

             1 recall         r e turning     back      to the N orth S t a n d where only hours                  before we

             were      being    briefed.          I sat and       cried     like   I have     never       cried,      gazing

             back at       the L e p p i n g s Lane Stand?           saying     to myself,        why did        it have         to

             happen,       and t h i nking        of    the young     girl     I d i d n ’t save.         I will      never

             ever      forget     her    face as        long as     I live.

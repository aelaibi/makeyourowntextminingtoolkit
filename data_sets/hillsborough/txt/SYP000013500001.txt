    R E P O R T OF AC O A. HORNSBY.



    At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1530 hrs        I received a tel e p h o n e    call   from FCO

    in Fire Serv i c e Control.                     He   informed me that     they had a "Major

    I n cident"       in progress at H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o tball         Ground    involving a

    large     number       of f a t a l i t i e s and      casualties.      I informed FCO

    that     I M/ould a t t e n d the         incident.



    On arri v a l      at H i l l s b o r o u g h    I was   d i r e c t e d by the Police   towards       the

    Leppings        Ln entrance an d            I parked my       car at   the     rear of a fire

    appliance        100 yards          from the Control Unit.             I ascertained          from the Sub

    Officer       in charge          of the a p p l i a n c e   that   the Control     Unit was      in

    a t t e n d a n c e at L e p p i n g s   Ln but he had seen the OiC,             DO Lockwood,

r     h a n d e d my tally to the S u b Officer                   and a s k e d him to take       it to the

      C ont r o l     Unit    for me and         to    inform them that       I was    proceeding        to the

      Gymnasium.             S t n O ^ a c c o m p a n i e d       me to the G y m n a s i u m   (the    crowd at

      this    time were          impatient an d          I noticed several         scuffles w i t h the

      Po 1 i ce > .



      On arri v a l      at the G y m n a s i u m       I c o ntacted A D O R o b j o h n s and he brie f e d me

      that    there were approxifnately 50 fatal i t i e s an d 70 s e r i o u s l y                     injured

      persons         in the G y m n a s i u m an d to the best           of his kno w l e d g e all

      casualties         had been       removed from the terraces,                 etc.     He   could not at

      that    time tell me           how the          incident    had occurred.        I walked        round the

      inside        of the G y m n a s i u m a nd met Stn O Fletcher.               I ascertained         that all

      Fire S e r v i c e      personnel       were all       right and were standing             by to assist

      in first aid treatment.                     I contacted D C A O Hopk i n s who was organ i s i n g

      casualty         handling      in the G y m n a s i u m and      I asked     if there was any

      additional         s e r vices    he    required from the F ire Service.                   He    replied

      that    the Fire S e r v i c e         had done a grand job an d that no a ddit ional

      s e r v i c e s were      required.         I contacted ADO R o b j o h n s and        i n s t r u c t e d him

      to    remain at the G y m n a s i u m as OiC of the A d v a n c e d Control                     Point and

      that    the Fire S e r v i c e C re ws were to stay there w i t h him.



      Accompanied            by S   t   n    O    I      went    to the Police S t a t i o n     in the grounds

      to a s c e r t a i n a n y further          details       of how the    incident      o c c u r r e d and    X

      was    informed that           three       barriers       had given way      in one    corner      of the        "

      Hop".



      I then        proceeded       to the Control           Unit and     informed Fire S e r v i c e Control

      a n d all       personnel      on the f i r e g r o u n d    that   I had taken over as OiC                 of

      the    incident.           I then      p r oceeded to the Po l i c e Control           viewing g a l l e r y

was    in charge of the Pol i c e Control                     and he        informed me that ACC

J a c k s o n was OiC         of the      incident and he was               located    in the middle         of

the    football         pitch.          I asked     if there were an y further               casualties

req u i r i n g Fire S e r v i c e a s sistance,             to w h i c h     he replied      "No",    and    I

a lso a s k e d      if he r e q uired a n y addi t i o n a l         Fire S e r v i c e assista nce,         to

w h i c h he also        replied         "No".



Whilst        discussing          the    incident     in general a telephone mess a g e was

received        in the Po l i c e         control     from a C l u b Official           requesting      that a

carefully worded message                    be t r a n s m i t t e d over     the Public Ta n n o y system

informing         the    crowd that         the m a t c h had been a nandoned.                The Senior

P o l i c e Offi c e r    refused to transmit                that m e s s a g e    unless a u t h o r i s e d by

ACC Jackson.             He stated         that     there    had been a lot of s kirmishes and

with     the    current a t m o s p h e r e       he was a f r a i d a riot might            ensue.



I left        one officer,          ADO G r e e n    <with f i r e g r o u n d    radio),    at the Police

C ont r o l    viewing        gall e r y an d     i n structed him to act as L i a i s o n Officer.

I retur n e d to the Control                 Unit and        issued     i n s t r uctions    to all Fire

                  3.       Remain seated            on their appliances.

                   reference was mad e to fatalities.                        I a n t i c i p a t e d that    the

                   F ire S e r v i c e w o u l d most      likely have         been    called and        I

                   i m m e d i a t e l y tele phoned Fire Serv i c e Cont r o 1.              The number

                   was    c o n t i n u o u s l y enga g e d and    it was     not until      about      1540

                   hrs    that     I m a n a g e d to    contract Control.



    3.            I was       i n f ormed that     the Fire S e r v i c e      had    received a m e s s a g e

                   "Major       Incident - cutting gear                required" and was            given

         Offi c e r m o b i l i s e d to the        incident was an d why              I had not       been

         informed.           I was    told that Control            had me shown on a paging

         unit an d that          they had tried to            contact me by that means

         with o u t    success.       T hey had therefore            contacted ACO H o r n s b y

         who was a t t e n d i n g .       I informed then that                I had been at          home

         since     1345 hrs and also              that    I was m o b i l i s i n g    to the

         i nci d e n t .



    4.   I set     off to H i l l s b o r o u g h s h o r t l y after         1540 hrs and a r r i v e d

         at a bout         1614 hrs.       Whilst     enroute,       I received a m e s s a g e via

         Control       from the Chief Fire Offi c e r as k i n g me to o b t a i n

         i n f o r m a t i o n on the exact         details     of the        incident a n d to

         contact       him as soo n as          possible.



    5.   In fact       the Chief Fire Offi c e r a r r i v e d at the Control                      Unit

         about     one min u t e after          I had a r r i v e d and a meeting              took

         place     b e t w e e n the Chief Fire Officer,                myself,        ACO H o r n s b y and

         Divisional          O f f i c e r s H i l d r e t h an d Lockwood.        The Chief Fire

         Officer wanted            to know what a c t i o n s were being                 taken by the

         Fire S e r v i c e an d what         the    police     required the Fire Serv i c e

         to do.        DO H i l d r e t h was    the Offi c e r      in Charge         of the Fire

         S e r v i c e Control       Unit.      He said that         in order         to est a b l i s h

         contact w i t h the          police     he had posted T / A D O G r e e n outside

         the P o l i c e     control      box w i t h a f i r e g r o u n d    radio     so that he was

         able    to    c o m m u nicate    from there        to the fire service               control

         unit.        AC O H o r n s b y had s u r v e y e d the     position w h i c h was           that

         numerous          people had been          crushed on a part of the terraces

         a n d had had to be           removed onto          the   pitch where           they were

         being g iven         r e s u s c i t a t i o n and first aid.          Fire Service

         personnel         were a c t i v e l y enga g e d doing        this on the          pitch and

     been set up as a clearing station.                                ADO R o b johns was       in

     charge of that             operation.



     The Chief Fire Offi c e r               deci d e d    it was         nec e s s a r y to make

     contact w i t h the Officer                in C h a r g e of the Po l i c e C ontrol a n d

     i n s t r u c t e d myself and DO L o c k w o o d to attend.                     W hen we

     arrived       there,       T / A D O G r e e n was at      the top of the steps

     leading       to the       control      box and       I asked         him who the senior

     Police O f f i c e r was.           He said that           there were a number               of

     Police Officers              inside an d he did not know w h i c h one was                           in

     charge.        I went       inside and a s k e d who               the Senior Police

     O f f i c e r was    and     i n d icated that        the Chief Fire Officer wa n t e d

     to know       if the P o l i c e      required an y a s s i s t a n c e          from the Fire

     Service       beyond that w h i c h they wer e                    currently undertaking.



7.   A s s i s t a n t Chief     C o n s t a b l e J a c k s o n spoke       very brie f l y to me

     and said that           he was       in c o n v e r s a t i o n    (by telephone         I think)

     w i t h the Chief          C o n s t a b l e and    could not talk            further at         that

     point      but he w o u l d speak wit h the Chief Fire Offi c e r as soon

     as   he    could.      F r o m what       I could see from that                  point    there

     did not appear             to be a n y t h i n g more        required of the Fire

     Servi c e .



8.   I left      the     police      control        box an d sent a message               to the

     Control     Unit      by f i r e g r o u n d    radio.       I was able         to see the

     sect i o n of terrace a n d             confirmed that              it was     the West S tand

    9.    We   ins p e c t e d the terrace an d           it a p p e a r e d that a single          crush

          barrier      had fa i l e d at a point about                 12 feet from the

          p e r imeter       fence.       (1 know now that            two sections        of a three

          section      crush b arr i e r      had failed).             1 passed this

          i n f o r m a t i o n to the Control          Unit and       then returned to the

          Control      Unit      and then returned to the Control                     Unit   to speak

          with    the Chief         Fire Officer.



    10.   The Chief Fire Offi c e r and myself went                       to    inspect    the

          terrace after w h i c h we went                 to the      police     control     box.     All

          casu a l t i e s    had been      removed from the            pitch at that         time.

          The Chief Fire O f f i c e r             spoke w i t h ACC J a c k s o n    in the     control

          box w hile         I rem ained outside.             W h e n the Chief Fire Officer

          returned,          a m e s s a g e was    received from AD O R o b j o h n s        via the

    W e d n e s d a y Football        S t a d i u m w here    cutting      gear was         required.



    'En    route"        to the    incident a p p l i a n c e s were           d i r ected to the L e p p i n g s Ln

    end of the stadium.                  Ringinglow          1 booked       in a t t e n d a n c e at

    approximately             1527 h o u r s .    On arrival          I contacted S t n O Swain.

    The   sheer m a g n i t u d e      of the      incident was           unsettling,            dozens    of

    Communication             using     fireground        radio's was          d i fficult        because       of the

On   15th April,          1989 I was          nominated Officer          in Charge     of Central        Fire

During      the    course of         the morning a lecture was given on first aid

by that R oute              (B).



Asking       for Police a s s i s t a n c e            the a p p l i a n c e was       reversed back onto

P e n i s t o n e Rd      (A).      At   this       point a Po l i c e         constable was a s k e d for more

forth       coming.          Remounting            the a p p l i a n c e we then proceeded along

P e n i s t o n e Rd      in the      d i r e c t i o n of Wads 1ey Bridge.                At this       point     I

At    point        (C)    on the m a p we were              stop p e d by a Police              Inspector who was

in radio           contact w i t h a           colleague.          H o w e v e r after a short           period of

time     he was          not able        to ofer any          positive         information.          So we

the    casualty           pleaded w i t h us that we                 continue a n d d o n ’t give up now.

An a d v e r t i s i n g     board was         brought        to the side           of the      casualty,      the

c a s ualty was           transferred          to this and           carried from the             pitch     (E)    to a

waiting ambulance                  (F) w here        he was      put        into the   care of the amb u l a n c e

We   then made           our wa y       back onto         the   pitch and walk i n g          in front        of the

n o r t h stand giving a s s i s t a n c e              to    four   people and oxygen to a further

two.



We were       by now d i r e c t l y           in front       of the L e p pings Ln S t a n d          (G ) , I

c o n t a c t e d Divis i o n a l       Officer Lockwood             by storno        radio who had by this

He d i r e c t e d      us to the           g y m n a s i u m wit h our   r e s u s c i t a t i o n equipment.

U p o n arrival          at the g y m n a s i u m       (H) we were        d i r e c t e d to two     casualties

who we gave             oxygen a n d         comfort.         A further      two    casualties were

a s s i s t e d from the a r e a and onto wait i n g a mbulances.                             We    c o ntinued      in

this area           rendering          humanitarian           service.       Five minu t e s        before     the

crowd had a s k e d            to d i s per se we made           our way back           to our appliance.

W h e r e we were          i n s t r u c t e d to wait        for further        instructions.



Some m e m b e r s       of the        public       became a g i t a t e d and upset          that a p p l i a n c e s

a n d a staff           car were         blocking       exits    from the ground.              There was some

verbal      abuse        "You have           done a good job now xxxx off",                    and some        took

their anger             out on the ET              (no damage was         done on later            inspection).

To   try and a l l e v i a t e          the s i t u a t i o n the staff          car was m o v e d to one side.



A number           of m e m b e r s    of    the    public t h a n k e d us for what we had done and

a y oung man            came    into        our    care who had       lost his father              in the     rush to

leave     the ground.                 T h e y were    reunited a few minu t e s              later.



After     the       crowd has          d i s p e r s e d we   returned     to S t a t i o n a r r i v i n g   back at

approximately              1720 hrs.

going.         I took over             control        of both crews            to do what we            could w i t h the

e q u i p m e n t we had,         including           the use of our            own personal            resusciades.



I was      informed there w ere                    some a m b u l a n c e s    outside        near the a ppl i a n c e s

w ere    parked at the side                   of Central         One and Two.              W o r d then     came

through        to all       casualties             to the sports          hall.         All    personnel        and

resuscitators              to    report       to the sports hall.                    S t a t i o n Offi c e r F l e t c h e r

A m b u l a n c e Service,            some    kind of        priority of moving                 the     people from

just walk i n g          into the a mbulances.                   This was        fruitless.             I took over

this     role for a while.                   A doctor         then took         over from me.             We    carried

people        into the a m b u l a n c e s          on his orders.              I was      then a s k e d to take my

crew and        check the g r o u n d to see                  if there were an y more                   casualties.

None was        found.           At that          time a radio m e s s a g e          instructed all            crews      not

in the sports             hall        to   return to their appliances,                        as the ground was to

be evacuated.               We stood by the a p p l i a n c e                 till    i nstructed to           return to

SUBJECT       INCIDENT AT S H E F F I E L D W E D N E S D A Y F O O T B A L L S T A D I U M ON THE        15TH

APRIL,      1989.                                                                     170489




On S a t u r d a y    the   15th April,         1989 at      1522 h o u r s .     I was     informed of

major     incident          requiring       cutting gears at            the H i l l s b o r o u g h F ootball

S t a d i u m and that       six    pumps and E m e r g e n c y Tender           had been m o b ilised.             I

b o o k e d mo b i l e   to the     incident at          1524 h o u r s .



En   route,      I heard a make            pumps     10 m e s s a g e   for   r e s u s c i t a t i o n equipment

on the      radio.



My   initial         a p p r o a c h to the stadium was           via P e n i s t o n e Rd a n d   I

e n c o u n t e r e d some traffic         conge s t i o n at     this side       of the stadium.

Further       radio m e s s a g e s      infor m e d me that a p p l i a n c e s     should a t t e n d the

Leppi ngs Ln entrance.
                                                                                                           PAG E        25
                                                                                                           D 350



I pro c e e d e d to this area and met S tnO S w a i n at the                        contact     point.            He

i n f o r m e d me that    crews were         insi de the S t a d i u m a n d ADO R o b johns was

requ e s t i n g addi t i o n a l     resuscitat ion equipment.              X i nstructed StnO

S w a i n to a s s e m b l e all      crews and equ i p m e n t     not a l r e a d y    committed          into

the   s t a d i u m at the     contact      poi nt and to m a i n t a i n      contact w i t h me by

fireground        radio.



I   the n    proceeded     into       the s t a d i u m via the     centre     tunnel       fo the West

stand.        I was     then   c o n f r o n t e d by a scene     of several          h u n d r e d spectators

and   police      on the football           pitch.



No Fire S e r v i c e P e r s o n n e l    were    evident     to me and       I later        realised that

this was        because    they were        down at gr o u n d      level a t t e n d i n g     to

c asualties and th e r e f o r e          s c r e e n e d from an y view by standing                 spectators.



I then       p r oceeded down onto          the    pitch a n d e v e n t u a l l y    located StnO

F l e t c h e r who   i n f ormed me of the s i t u a t i o n as he knew                it at    that stage.

That was,        that some      casualties         had been taken out to the L e p p i n g s Ln

entrance,        but the m a j o r i t y    had been and were being taken to the

g y m n a s i u m at the P e n i s t o n e Rd entrance.           First A i d a n d        resuscitation

was   being a d m i n i s t e r e d    by crews on the         pitch.



I could find no S e n i o r P o l i c e           officer    present      on the        pitch so       I made

my w a y up to the P o l i c e Control             Box.      W h e n I a r r i v e d at the Control

Box   I could see the whole                of the ground,         an d a number of            casualties

being       dealt w i t h by Fire S e r v i c e P e rsonnel.            When    I ente r e d the Police

box   I ident i f i e d m y s e l f an d a s k e d who was          the Senior O f f i c e r          in

charge.         I was   told the A s s i s t a n t Chief C o n s t a b l e      but they did not

k now w here      he was.       I also a s k e d     if a senior Officer                of the Amb u l a n c e

S e r v i c e was a v a i l a b l e an d was     told that        they did not know.



No P o l i c e Officer        present       came forw a r d an d      i dentified himself       or gave

me a n y     i n f o r m a t i o n on the s i t u a t i o n and   I was    v i r tually   ignored as

they     busied thems e l v e s       on the t elephones an d              radio.



ADO R o b j o h n s   then    con t a c t e d me by radio stat i n g          that he needed m e n and

equipment        in the gymnasium.             This    I a r r a n g e d w i t h StnO S w a i n by radio

an d    e q uipment     from the      vantage      point at       the Police Control         Box.



W h e n the Fire S e r v i c e Control           unit a r r i v e d   I requested an Offi c e r wit h

a fireground          radio     to   relieve me at         the Control        Box so that     I could

On S a t u r d a y     15th April,         1989 at      1517 h o u r s , whilst mobile               to an

incident at Shi regreen,                  Sheffield.          I was     informed       by Fire Serv i c e

Control,           that a major         incident      had o c c u r r e d at the H i l l s b o r o u g h

Football           Stadium.       I i n f ormed      control     that    I would        redirect        to this

an d that R i v e l i n        1 was     contact      point     for the     incident and he was                  to

as s u m e   the duties          of Control         Officer,     at the appliance.                 I then

    con g r e g a t i n g   on the     pitch.          I made my way onto                  the pitch in order               to

    a s c e r t a i n the g r a v i t y    of the situation,                  it was an hopeless              task due to

    the hundreds            of fans a n d       numerous P o l i c e             officers mass i n g at         this        end

    of the       pitch.        It was      obvious          that      there were a large            number of

    casua l t i e s     but    to d e t e r m i n e    the nature           of    injuries      or whet h e r First

    Ai d a s s i s t a n c e was      being a d m i n i s t e r e d was           impossible.          I a t t e m p t e d to

    make     contact w i t h the Se n i o r Pol i c e O f f i c e r                  in charge on the           pitch,

    but    because          I had no means            of    i dentifying who this was                  I approached a

    Police       Inspector.           I s u g g e s t e d that a t t e m p t s        ought     to be made        to    clear

    the    pitch of those             fans    not d i r e c t l y a s s i s t i n g        in casualty handling,

    this w o u l d then enable me to d e termine                            those      casualties       not    receiving

    a ttention.



    I t hen made            contact w i t h S tnO                         ind S t n O F l e t c h e r and     obtained

    f rom them an o v e r v i e w of the situation.                              I was a d v i s e d that      casualties

    were     being      cleared to the P e n i s t o n Rd end of the                          pitch.        I decided to

    make my way to this                end of the gr o u n d and                  control and       deploy Fire

    S e r v i c e P e rsonnel        w here   required.                 I a d v i s e d the    contact      point      to

    send all a v a i l a b l e        personnel            and    resuscitators            to this end of the

    pitch where             numerous      casualties             required a s s i s tance.             Whilst     in

    control       of this       situation,            I was a d v i s e d by a fire m a n that there were

    f urther      casualties          requiring a s s i s t a n c e           in the gymnasium,             I deployed

    personnel         to this        location.



    During       this       period    I h eard over              the F i r e g r o u n d   radio that DO L o c k w o o d

    was    now    in command          of the      incident.                I a d v i s e d DO L o c k w o o d of the

    of the     pitch before            suc h an a n n o u n c e m e n t was made.          I was       concerned

    about    on the       pitch.           I p r o ceeded to the         pitch and      instructed Fire

    being    e x e r c i s e d by the Police,            and    I was s a t i s f i e d that Fire Serv i c e

    Personnel       in the area            of the Gym        could    remain and       carry out any

    within      the area of the Gym.                     Several       Fire S e r v i c e Personnel           informed

    o bserved.           After a        period of time              I returned to the are a of the                   pitch

    an d   noted that          the gr o u n d had almost              emptied,       I returned to the Gym

    and    i n f ormed A.D.O.          Robjohn         that    if all       tasks    had been completed,               he

    sh o u l d a s s e m b l e all      fire       service     personnel       together with any equipment

    and    return to the Control                   Unit.           A.D.O.   Robjohn        informed the Control

    Unit     of my      i n s t r u c t i o n to    return but was           infor m e d to remain w i t h Fire

    S e r v i c e Pe r s o n n e l   in the a r e a of the Gy m until a d v i s e d by the Control

    Unit.          I assumed         that O f f i c e r s at        the Control         Unit   remained       concerned

    a bout     the    reaction of F o o tball              fans a n d felt          it safest for Fire

    S e r v i c e Personnel          to remain         in the Gy m until            the    crowd had m o v e d away

    from the area outs i d e the                    stadium.            I returned to the Control                 Unit      to

    see    if I could be of a s s i s t a n c e               in     any further          role.    At this        point

    A.C.O.      Hornsby        i n f ormed me that the               incident       from an O p e r a t i o n a l    point

    of view was           being w o u n d down.               I left the       incident at a p p r o x i m a t e l y

    1730 hours.

                  15 A P R I L      1989




O n the       15th April           1989,    at   1527 h r s . whi l s t    on s t a n d - b y at my home

address,         I r e c eived a tel e p h o n e         call   from Fire S e r v i c e Control

in forming me of a major                    incident at H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a 11 G r o u n d .

Six   pumps,        two      emergency       tenders and the Control               Unit had been

mobilised         to the          incident,      the    precise    details       of w hich were unknown.

I was       to a t t e n d    the L e p p i n g s Lane     entrance       to the ground.            I

c o n f i r m e d my    int e n t i o n    to attend.



Whi l s t    en route,            I was    requested,      by radio,       to take     charge of the

Control        Unit    on my arrival.



I arrived         in L e p p i n g s      Lane at      1558 hrs at w h i c h time there was                 very

little       traffic         or    p e d e s t r i a n obstruction.        I was a d v i s e d by a police

constable          to    park    in a side street as they wer e exp e c t i n g                       trouble       from

spec t a t o r s    whe n they         left    the ground.            I was    unaware         that the game

was    being a b a n d o n e d or the extent                 of the    incident at this time.



On    proce e d i n g     d own L e p p i n g s Lane,        I met ADO G r e e n who a c c o m p a n i e d me

to the Control             Unit.          O n entering        the Control        Unit     I made       contact

w i t h L.FM.                          I e n q u i r e d who was      in overall        charge from the

P o l i c e an d had       contact        been made w i t h them.              He    replied      in the

ne g a t i v e    but    informed me          that D ivisional         O f f i c e r L o c k w o o d was     in

charge      of the Fire S e r v i c e a n d that               he a n d A D O R o b j o h n were        in radio

contact.            AGO H o r n s b y was also             in a t t e n d a n c e and had gone to the

g y m n a s i u m to     r e ndezvous w i t h D i visional            O f f i c e r Lockwood.           It was

obvious          the Control          Unit was       not    in contact wit h the officer                    in charge

of the      police and that we had at that                        time    no direct           lines    of

c o m m u n i c a t i o n w i t h them.



A D O G r e e n was       instructed          to take a f i r e g r o u n d     radio,        proceed to the

police      control        box,       establish a communication                 link and obtain

information             regarding        the extent of the            incident.



At about          this time,          A s s i s t a n t Chief Officer H o r n s b y entered             the

Control          Unit    having       done a survey of the             incident and            briefed me

regarding          the extent          of the       incident,     the a p p r o x i m a t e    number of

casualties and             their       locations.



I was     enga g e d t h r o u g h o u t      the    incident     in the Control              Unit.         At no

time was an y            police       presence a v a i l a b l e at the Control                Unit.

On the       13th April         1989,    I was O f f i c e r      in C h a r g e of R i v e l i n One

a p p l i a n c e w h e n we were m o b i l i s e d to a major             incident at S h e f f i e l d

W e d n e s d a y F o o tball   Club.        On receipt           of the    call at     1516 hours,        I.

p r o c e e d e d to the L e p p i n g s Lane      end of the ground.                  On arrival        I was

u nable      to enter     nearer        than the     iron      railings at that end of the

ground       because    of the      large     numbers        of    police,     public and a m bulances

at the site.              I c o n tacted      control        and    r e q u e s t e d that Darnall       Road

a p p l i a n c e s a t t e n d at P e n i s t o n e Roa d end.



As    I dismounted        from the app l i a n c e       to speak          to a police      inspector at

the gate and an           immediate         request was made for a resuscitator                         in the

rear    of    the a m b u l a n c e w h i c h we applied.




                                                                                                           39

    I a s k e d the       inspector what          he w a n t e d me to do and he a t t e m p t e d to

    contact      his super i o r       by    radio but w i t h no success.



    I then sent Fm                        down the       road at the            rear of the        stand to

    attempt      to find a more             senior      police       officer.          He    returned to          inform

    me the most           senior    offi c e r    down there was a sergeant.                         Further

    c o n v e r s a t i o n s were made      between myself and                 the    police     inspector as to

    his    req u i r e m e n t s and at      one stage he was             of the o p i n i o n that             our

    s e r v i c e s were    no   longer      required.



    I then sent L / F m                           and 1 Fm to          look onto the            pitch w hilst         the

    inspector made           further a t t e m p t s       to   contact         his superiors.



    A police       officer       then emer g e d from the g r o u n d                 in some state of            shock

    requ e s t i n g     resuscitators        to be taken            into the ground as there were

    dying     people on the          pitch.           In view of this message                   I contacted

    control      by radio and made               pumps     10 for      r e s u s c i t a t i o n equipment.



    At    this   time A D O R o b j o h n s      a r r i v e d and    I brie f e d him of the             s i tuation

    He    then went        into the gr o u n d to assess               the s i t u a t i o n for himself and

    left me at           the gate    to     liaise wit h oncoming                crews.       I then directed

    five    crews to the gr o u n d as               i nstructed by A D O R o b j o h n s and DO

went    to the g y m n a s i u m to       prevent      further    personnel          from going onto the

from the e n t rance             to the Stadium.



I instr u c t e d my        crew,       w i t h the e x c e p t i o n of the driver              to bring our

the ground,          both w i t h       chest    injuries an d having                difficulty         in

The    crew under my             i n s t r u c t i o n were    then    involved        in this     task as well

as a s s i s t i n g w i t h     r e s u s c i t a t i o n needs and first aid as and when

required.



After       the m a j o r i t y of      casualties         had been removed to hospital,                      some

crews       including mine wer e              i n structed to          return to their appli ances,

    t h r o u g h holes        in the fencing.               At this       point        I was under          the

    i m p r e s s i o n that      the    incident         involved a structural                   collapse and

    e x p e c t e d fire       crews     to be       involved       in e x t r i c a t i o n of       casualties.              It

    was    not     i m m e d i a t e l y obvious        to me what        had caused the               large number             of

    casualt i e s .



    Mo v i n g    onto     the    pitch we m i x e d w i t h          crowds       of    confused        civilians and a

    n umber       of Police O f f i c e r s          and e v e n t u a l l y    large     numbers        of victims            some

    a p p a r e n t l y dead.        The      crews     began to a t t e n d to the                casualties           while       I

    t ried to make             contact w i t h other O f f i c e r s ~ i n ~ C h a r g e and assess                      the

    s ituation.            I eventually           located Stn O F l e t c h e r           and      it was a g r e e d      that

    casualties           should be         removed thro u g h the S o u t h S t a n d to the                       road

    behind,        where       I w o u l d set       up a casualty clearing area                        (D).       During

    this     operation           it was       n e c e s s a r y for me to        request         large numbers            of

    fans     to    clear       the aisles         in the S o u t h S t a n d and,              to their        credit,         they

    did this           quic k l y an d     in an orderly manner.                   Along w ith Pol i c e officers

    and Stewards             I arranged         to have a clear                passage        (E) m a i n t a i n e d    through

    to the        roadway.          I believe         over 20 casualties were                     removed by this

    route.         Throughout           this     period Darnall           Rd     crews        remained fully

    It was a b o u t      this     time    that AG O H o r n s b y a r r i v e d and     I passed on

    Once    it had become           cler    that most of the           casualties        had been removed

    from the       pitch and the           c a s ualty area      I went     to the g y m n a s i u m and

    The     call   to this        incident was           recei ved at     control    at    1517 h o u r s .   I

    pr o c e e d e d w ith two       pumps Central          1, Central       2,   and ET    (10 men).



    T he    route f ol lowed to the stadiurn was along Pertistone Rd,                             the   route

    was     r e asonably clear,           the weat h e r was        dry and sunny.



    O n arrival          at the stad i u m there was              no one there to meet us w h i c h           I

    e x p e c t e d given the m e s s a g e        said    (major disaster).



    We drew the a p p l i a n c e s            to a halt just       before    the first set of gates




                                                                                                              53

                                                                                                           D 550

into    the stadium,         I dismounted            the a p p l i a n c e s and asked a police

offi c e r where we were            expected         to go,    he said he had no k n owledge                   of

any    incident        or direction.         I a s k e d a further           police officer            if we

could get        in via the double           gates,      he said yes and              i mmediate ly opened

the gates        into the       roadway down the side of the stadium,                           I went       to a

gate a d j a c e n t    to the e ntr y gate,          the P o l i c e     officer      said they hadn't

called us and d i d n ’t need our a s s i s t a n c e               but    perhaps we should go

further      down the       road,    this we did.



I ran down the           road to the end             of the s t a d i u m where         the police

o b s e r v a t i o n box was     s i tuated and was s hown the                route     to the      pitch     by a

Ma r s h a 11.



I p r oceeded onto          the    pitch the        crowd had not m oved at all.                     The     pitch

a r o u n d the area of the L e p pings Ln goal are a was                         full     of   people       some

casualties,        some     relatives and friends              of    casualties,           people stood,

people kneeling,            people     laid down.         M any     people       in obvious        shock this

i ncluded Saint Johns a m b u l a n c e             p e r s o n n e l , police as well as the f a n s .



Once    on the     pitch     I a s k e d several       police officers who was                    in charge

an d where       the    casualties      were    being m o v e d to - they              couldn't        tell me.



It was     clear       to see that      no rescues as such needed doing,                         but       bodies

an d   casualties        o b v i o u s l y needed    removing       from the scene.               I gave my

men    instructions        to     carry out     first ai d and            r e s u s c i t a t i o n that

requi r e d doing and to try to be as sel e c t i v e as                        possible        (there were

only five men a v a i l a b l e       initially).



I spoke      briefly to S t a t i o n Offi c e r S w a i n who             informed me he was                having

difficulty        in getting        to the     incident.          I informed him I was at the
                                                                                                           PAGE      54

y
    actual       incident.         It was obvious             to me we were going to need more men

    than    the    initial        turnout and there w o u l d             be an urgent      need for

    resuscitators.              I then     lost     contact w i t h him and my own drivers,                     I

    sent a L i verpool            fan w i t h a mess a g e        to my drivers       to make      pumps    10,

    this he did,          but     in the m e a n t i m e S t a t i o n Offi c e r S wain had alre a d y

    sent    the message.



    At    this    point     I con t a c t e d Fm ________ the driver             of Central        1 and a s k e d

    him to try to get a m b u l a n c e s            to the point where             our a p p l i a n c e s were as

    I knew this route was                 clear - this he together w i t h Fm                            driver

    of Central        S did.         S h o r t l y after      this T e m p S t a t i o n Officer

    r e p o r t e d to me      I asked      him to go to the           roadway where        the appli a n c e s

    were    parked and set up a casualty h a n dling area,                           w h i c h he did,     I then

    p r o c e e d e d to try to get          the most         urgent   cases    tr a n s p o r t e d to this

    casualty       handling area,            a p p r o x i m a t e l y SO - 30 persons were t r a n s p o r t e d

    by means       of make shift            stret c h e r s    to this     point,    approximately         10

    persons       were    taken off        the field by ambulance.



    At    this    stage F i remen from D a r n a l 1 and R i n g i n g l o w were a r r i v i n g and

    giving First Aid.                This was also the time whe n ADO Robjo h n s a r r i v e d on

    the    field.



    A D O R o b johns     informed me          that a t e mporary morgue             had been set up in

    the    gymnasium,          I res p o n d e d   by having       the obvious       dead removed to the

    gym and       the other        c asualt ies      to the       point    I had set up.



    DO L o c k w o o d a r r i v e d on the        pitch      I gave him a brief         report     of the

    situation,        he informed me he w ould go to the                       police    control     box

    overlooking          the    incident and set up a control                  point w hich he did.

         ADO Robjohns       informed DO L o c k w o o d that a casualty handling               centre had

         bee n set up      in the gym but         there was   shortage   of ambu l a n c e s   - the

         number     of serious      casualties was        quite   low at this   stage and the

         d e c i s i o n was made   to move      the   reraaineder to the gym,     and di s c o n t i n u e

         the    c a s ualty h a n dling a re a    I had set up and divert       the a m b u l a n c e s   to

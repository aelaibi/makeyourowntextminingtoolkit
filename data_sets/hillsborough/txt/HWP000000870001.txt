                  HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
            JOINT STATEMENT BY LIVERPOOL FOOTRAT.T. CLUB
          NOTTINGHAM FOREST FOOTBAT.T. CLUB AND LIVERPOOL
                   AND NOTTINGHAM CITY COUNCILS

WE ARE CONCERNED THAT IN THE PAST YEAR CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS HAVE
BEEN MADE BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS TO DISMISS OR DISTORT THE
FINDINGS OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR WITH REGARD TO THE CAUSES OF THE
HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER BY PLACING BLAME ON LIVERPOOL F.C.
SUPPORTERS, DESPITE THE OVERWHELMING CONTRARY EVIDENCE GATHERED BY
THE JUDICIAL INVESTIGATION;
THEREFORE ON BEHALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STILL SUFFER TODAY AS A
RESULT OF HILLSBOROUGH AND WHO HAVE NEEDLESSLY BEEN CAUSED
ADDITIONAL PAIN BY THESE GRATUITOUS AND OFFENSIVE COMMENTS WE
CHOOSE TO RENEW THE SPECIAL BONDS FORMED BETWEEN THE TWO CLUBS AND
THE TWO CITIES FOLLOWING THE DISASTER BY PUBLICALLY PLACING ON
RECORD OUR JOINT ENDORSEMENT OF THE CONCLUSIONS OF LORD JUSTICE
TAYLOR AND HIS IDENTIFICATION OF THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL FACTORS
WHICH IN COMBINATION CREATED THE TRAGEDY OF APRIL 15TH, 1989:-
    1. THE LAYOUT OF THE LEPPINGS LANE END
    2. LACK OF FIXED CAPACITIES FOR THE PENS
    3. LACK OF EFFECTIVE MONITORING OF THE TERRACES
    4. BUILD-UP AT THE TURNSTILES AND INADEQUATE TURNSTILE
       FACILITIES
    5. THE BLUNDER ON OPENING THE GATES AND FAILURE TO CLOSE THE
       CENTRAL TUNNEL
    6. THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE BARRIER SYSTEM IN PEN 3
    7. THE CRUSHING IN PENS 3 AND 4 WAS NOTRECOGNISED
    8. THE SLOW RESPONSE OF THE POLICE
    9. THE PERIMETER GATES WERE TOO SMALL

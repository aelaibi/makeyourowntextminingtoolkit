                                 MEETING WITH BECON - 7 MARCH 1989


Present:     George Parker         Director




           explained       who     we    were,     how       we     worked        and   our    emergency        planning
     frameworks viz statutory civil defence and CIMAH duties, GP very sympathetic
     to our planning- approach but stressed that his organisation preferred to be
     seen to be neutral and therefore had not previously been written into either
     district or county peacetime or war plans.                              BECON would respond to specific
     requests however and had helped with comms.                              in the Sheffield Marathon and
     the Lord Mayor's Esteli Appeal,


     A brief explanantion of the GLAF Regs,                         ensued with particular reference to
     where BECON might be able to assist i.e. communications and volunteer comms.
     instructors.           asked GP if,          in the light of an explanation of our honest
     and realistic approach to planning,                     BECON would object to being written into
     our plans,     It was stressed that it was highly unlikely that we would ever
     call upon their services in war and that we would not push a high profile
     for BECON in          civil defence matters.                    offered to give GP an introduction
     to the District emergency planning officers and GP was keen to further this,
           to forward a list of District contacts to GP.


3.   It    was   agreed     that    BECON     could      offer       assistance         to    us     in   the   form    of
     communications instructors                  to the volunteer plan and local corns, expertise
     in    the   Control    and     Co-ordination         plan.         If    requested       to    train   volunteers
     BECON could do this.


4.   GP stated that the BECON membership figures were correct;                                     50 members plus 20
     auxilliaries.        Half     the   membership          were    aged      20-60    without       dependents       and
     approximately         10%     are    employed       full-time           in    essential         industries/local
     government.     40 members are trained in line and radio comms.                                 All members are
     trained in emergency lighting,                 80% in ground rescue and 75% in first aid.
     (St     Johnstrained         BECON     in     first          aid    in       return      for     communications

                                                                                                                             2

            The Ground Rescue section are equipped with several thermal lances as one of
            the BECON members is a Director of the company which manufacture them, BECON
            have    designed      a   back   pack    for   the    thermal    lance       which        makes    field     work
            easier.   This was used recently in Armenia when BECON went out to help. BECON
            have also hired a portable satellite dish which they have taken to Armenia
            and    Mexico    to   assist     in     "patching"    communications           and    co-ordinating           the
            emergency response from this country.


            BECON have       a mobile Major         Incident     Control     Unit       and several          4wd vehicles
            equipped with radio communication equipment and extendable masts for use in
            difficult       terrain.    Assistance      has     been given       to S.Yorks           and Derbys.       Fire
            Services in patching comms.               during an incident up on the moors where fire
            service comms could not cope,


                  asked how BECON       financed      these operations,____[stated                 that BECON was a
            purely voluntary organisation dependent on donations from the public and the
            goodwill of their members,


    5.      In    closing    it   was   agreed      that   at    some    point     in    the     future       BECON    could
            organise a presentation for the Emergency Planning Unit.                             It was also agreed
            that    communications       between      us   should       continue    on    an     ad    hoc     basis    with
            perhaps an annual 'round up' of the state of play,                          GP expressed an interest
            in round    table forum of all             the voluntary organisations and                          agreed    to
            mention this in our meetings with them,

In this area there is a team of self-disciplined and trained volunteers - BECON.
 Formed in 1983, the members have taken part in training courses in
communications, first aid, search and rescue, map reading and field skills.
     The first aid training and ambulance training was provided by St. John
Ambulance and South Yorkshire Fire Service provided a short appreciation
course.
     BECON was formed to assist in any civil emergency and to help the
community. Many community events have seen BECON members on duty
providing emergency cover at marathons, walks, the Lord Mayor’s Parade, Fire
and Rescue rallies and motor racing; in all, over 40 sporting and social events.
     AH BECON vehicles are 4-wheel drive and are equipped with first aid kits,
fire extinguishers and two-way radios licensed by the Home Office. Other
equipment comprises generators, field lighting, hazard warnings, public address
systems and marshalling equipment.
     Funds are raised by subscriptions, donations and sponsorship and are used
for purchasing and maintaining equipment and vehicles and for the
organisation’s expenses.
     Non-profit, non-political, BECON exists to serve the community with its

administration office,                  Sheffield          Pel.

Dear Sir

I acknowledge receipt of your letter of April concerning the tragedy at Hillsborough
Football Ground and have noted the points you raise. In the circumstances I do not, at
present, feel able to comment on these but I have passed your letter to Mr Geoffrey
Dear, Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police, who is conducting the police
enquiry into the events at Hillsborough.

Yours faithfully

                  at A t t e r c 1 iff Police Station.        I expected to work until approximately

                  8.00pm (2000)        that same evening.

                  At 8.30am    (0S30)     I attended at West Bar Police Station,                  for a briefing.

                  charge of me that day was Police Sergeant 84QyU)R^>wT, Serial                          13 .   Our

                  duties were to attend at the Midland Station and supervise the^

                  arrival of the Liverpool          fans from both service and special trains and

                  to escort them to the ground,              via PSV vehicles.         At this time I
                                                                              i5 1 {

                 ' At approximately 12.20pm (1220) we left the Midland Station on a PSV

                  the Lappings Ln entrance to the ground.                   Upon our arrival at

          approximately 12.43 pm £/f245> I saw several            thousand Liverpool

tf& j     su p p o r t e r s , stood aTfd sat outside the ground.     After all the fans had

 7 jT, disembarked from the PSV, we attended at the Po 1 i cjpSRoam , to await the

          arrival of the rest of our Serial
                                                      S' v £
                                                                       C
          At approximately 2.50 pm,         ( 1450) Sergeant            received a radio

          message,   requesting our attendance f i t     tjne Leppings Ln entrance.          Upon

          attending at the ground side of th^Hfarnsti les', I saw several                po 1 i ce

          o f f i c e r s , the ranks of which I do not know,     lpoking through the glass

          panel   in the gates.    They seemed to be debating whether or not to open

          the gates.    It was decided that due to the large number of fans

          outside,   this was not practicable.        As I made my way to the gate at

          the far left of the turnstile, Gate B,          I saw several      people sat on the

          floor and they appeared to be short of breath.               Several   people came up

          to me and stated that people would die outside the turnstiles unless

          we did something about      it.     I could see through the turnstiles that

          there were several thousand people outside,             pushing against the

          tyfnstiles.    We then went to the main gates a t the left of turnstiles

          B and to the best of my knowledge this was open by the steward, to let

          myself and Police Sergeant WRIGHT through.              As far as I am aware no

          other officers followed us through this gate and the gate was shut

          immediately after us.       As we walked round the corner,          I could see that

          the area up to the turnstiles and beyond the blue gates prior to the

          turnstiles was amassed with fans.          Myself and Sergeant WRIGHT appealed

          to the fans to move back and give the people near to the turnstiles

          room to move and breath.          We informed them that unless they did so

        ^ V t h e r e was a great chance that someone would be injured.           At this time

          there were several      police horses also in attendance.           As we were

          shouting to the fans,      someone behind me,        I d o n ’t know who,   shouted,

  J       Let the fans through this side gate .”          There was then a sudden surge

          as both fans from within the barriers to the turnstiles and those
                                                                                       PAGE           3
                                                                                       S3385

outside, moved towards the g a t e . v^Cf ter about             10 mi nutes this area

started to clear.          During the/push on the turnstiles several                 fans

climbed the wall to the left of the turnstiles and over the roof of

the turnstiles and into the ground.

Sergeant WRIGHT then shouted that we were recjM^sted on the pitch in

front of the West Stand.              We re-entered jiffe ground,     via the gates that

we had come out of and gathered the rest of our Serial and ran down

the right hand side of the               ground behind the South Stand.          At one

point our way forward was blocked by a gate, which needed                     to be opened

by a steward.         This took about S minutes.             We then ran down a tunnel

and onto the pitch,          in front o f J iiie West Stand.       As we attended in

front of this stand,             I saw U x & t several   supporters were already on the

pitch,    several of them ran up to me and said,                "Get in there,       there are

(.people dying in there."            We ran towards the stand and entered a pen to

the left of the centre stand.               We made our way towards the fencing

between these two.           I    could see that the volume of people was sp^ great

that   it was virtually           impossible to move. We started to           1 i p 'C people
                                                —    :—    /   -------
over the fg'fice and into the next pen, with the assista^y<e of some of

the s u p ^ r t e r s .   I cannot remember who else attended in that pen with

me.    I do not remember how             many people I assisted out of that pen,                but

I do know that on removing                some of them, I could not find any          signs of

a pulse,     or breathing.          I saw several    people collapse by the railings

and be crushed by the             people behind them.         I spent about   half an hour

in that pen,        taking people over the fence            and to a small    exit gate

that led onto the pitch, where I handed them to other police officers.

At this time I was spat at and verbally abused by fans who stated that

it was all our fault.              Some of the fans inside the pen in which I
                                                                                 /
attended,      appeared to have consumed large amounts of intoxi/cants.

Upon clearing the front end of the centre pen,                   I could s p e that there

was approximately twenty people layed,                   either unconseiqlis or dead on
                                                                                             PAGE         4
                                                                                             S3385

            the terrace.          These people were either removed via the gate in their

            pen,    or lifted over the fence and taken out through the gates in the

            pen I was       in.

            Upon ensuring that there was no injured fans left within that stand,                      I

            returned to the pit ch .         I was then aware that the fire brigade and

            ambulance services were          in at ten d ance.   I saw layed on the pitch

            several      b odi es, which were covered by items of clothing.        The

            Liverpool       supporters were tearing down advertising boards and using

            them as stretchers to convey the injured to the far end of the pitch.

            I made my way towards the centre of the pitch and joined Police

            Sergeant WRIGHT and several of our Serial.              Whilst stood with those

            officers,       several fans approached us and said,        "You couldn’t give a

            made their own way to the Midland Station, as only a few P S V ’s were

            used.      As we were no longer required to escort the fans, we were

              Traumatic                 asphyxia           is     an   uncommon           and      usually

One other patient with severe asphyxia was admitted through
t h e R H H A/fc. d e p a r t m e n t - T h e m e a n a g e w a s 1 9 . 6 y e a r s .
            Some          patients were                 unconscious           on      arrival,           some
fitting            and S o m e exhibiting extreme                       r e s t l e s s n e s s ,c o n f u s e d

called             "     encephalitic                manner".
          Unlike           other          hypoxic cerebral insults some                          patients

initial trauma,                    This late o nset was very                      misleading.              One

after admission.                     The screaming lasted for several                             minutes
f o l l o w e d by s t a t u s e p i l e p t i c u s a nd c o m a .               This pattern was
observed             in      another           patient          1    hour     30      minutes          after

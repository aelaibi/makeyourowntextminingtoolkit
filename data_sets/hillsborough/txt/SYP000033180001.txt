TICKETLESS SUPPORTERS

You will recall on the evening of Thursday, 22 June 1989 we discussed the
above subject in the light of the "conspiracy" theory proffered by the
South Yorkshire Police.

Over this last weekend I diverted my staff at Nechells from processing work
to reading 1,961 statements in order to obtain information about ticketless
supporters, and in particular to see whether there was a conspiracy to
force entry by any means at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.  This letter
records our findings.

We have found a total of thirteen persons who describe some kind of
pre-determined intention to enter the ground without tickets (their statements
are attached).  In addition we found that many other statements identify
significant numbers of supporters without tickets.  I refer you back to my
letter of 12 June 1989 in which I highlighted our survey of 1,699
Liverpool supporters' questionnaires which discovered at least 136
supporters without tickets.

It is our view that many Liverpool supporters arrived in Sheffield without
tickets.  It is our contention that the number could be in excess of
2,000. However, we do not believe that there was a major "conspiracy" as
such, rather a continuation of a well established practice by many
supporters to visit the ground for this particular match and purchase a
ticket.  Amongst these there will be a sizeable hard-core who will attempt
to enter the ground by fair means or foul, obviously looking for any
weakness in the system or the architecture which they can exploit to their
advantage. No doubt the Liverpool supporters' experiences at the
Hillsborough Ground last year would be fed back to their "intelligence"
                                                     Cont....


                                                                                       2

system and the word would quickly go around that "opportunities" were
likely to exist this year. This would more than likely lead to plans by
some to thwart the system but by how many is difficult to determine.   In
sum, it is our contention that there was probably a number of small-scale
conspiracies. However, overall it is unlikely to be one large-scale
conspiracy rather opportunism which collectively could be significant.
Experiences at other grounds recently would tend to support this
viewpoint, albeit the number involved at a semi-final will be greater than
at most league matches.

I also enclose a report which has been submitted to me by Inspector Sawers.
This refers to the witnesses Ferguson,        Marjoram,      l
                                                             and
In addition, there are witnesses       and          |
                                                    . Some of these are
referred to in the South Yorkshire Police submission and in addition we
have identified another.  Their statements are attached for information.

I trust this is of assistance to you in considering the likelihood of an
overall conspiracy theory.

          SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE THEME - LIVERPOOL
SUBJECT                                                           DATE        26 June 1989
          SUPPORTERS CONSPIRACY


          I refer to the above theme which has been actively pursued by South Yorkshire
          Police and which is the subject of a further submission by them. In addition,
          I refer to High Priority Actions 1591, 1592, 1593 and 1595.

          On your instructions further enquiries have been made and statements, where
          necessary, are attached hereto. A brief summary is as follows:-

          FERGUSON and        are work mates and MARJORAM a director of the company which
          employs them, and

                   FERGUSON was originally seen by South Yorkshire Police and a statement
                   obtained. FERGUSON had visited the White Hart Licensed House prior to
                   entering the Pheasant Licensed House. In the Pheasant he drank with
                         and was later joined by MARJORAM. FERGUSON states he and
                   spoke with two Liverpool Supporters but attaches nothing untoward in
                   anything which they said.

                         was originally seen by West Midlands Police and has been
                   re-interviewed by Inspector DAVENPORT and BS          A short
                   confirmatory statement was obtained.

                   It was suggested that South Yorkshire Police may have taken another
                   statement but ignored its contents on the basis that it did not
                   support their theory. This is not the case, South Yorkshire Police
                   called o n b u t , on the witness indicating he had already been
                   seen, the matter rested there and no conversation about his
                   statements’ contents took place.

                   MARJORAM was first seen by South Yorkshire and the essence of his
                   statement is that he thought the comments made by the two supporters
                   in FERGUSON and      \s company strange

                   "Dont worry about that ........... (the time being 2.45pm) .......
                   we know either a gate will be open or opened."

                   He does not however know anything which led him to believe that either
                   these two supporters did not have tickets or were part of any so
                   called ’conspiracy’.




                                                                                                        4
                   was dropped o f f by MARJORAM a t th e S ic e y H o te l p r io r t o MARJORAM
              meeting FERGUSON and                 is not material to this theme.

              The witnesses        and       ire social friends and fellow golfers.
              Prior to keeping a golfing appointment        called into the Sicey
              Hotel for a drink and listened to Liverpool Supporters talking.

                     was first seen by West Midlands Police when he volunteered
              himself at Hammerton Road Police Station and was seen by DS McCOMBIE
              and a statement obtained. He was seen 4 days later by South Yorkshire
              Police and a further statement obtained which does not materially
              differ from the first one.

              He has been spoken to on the telephone and can add nothing to either
              version.

                    had not previously been interviewed.        Jconfided in
              the contents of what he later told police and a short statement is
              included from

              Copies of the relevant licensee/staff questionnaires are attached.

Today Friday 23rd June 1989 I was shown by Detective Sergeant                                                of

the West Midlands Police Force a copy of a                         statement I made to the South

Yorkshire Police on 7th June 1989.                      I have     read this statement and it is

correct, I do not wish to add or amend anything in this statement.

However I would like to point out that on page 4 of my copy statement,

that the conversation with the 2 Liverpool men, the words used are what I

recall and not the actual words spoken.

At no time when I spoke to those two men did I get the impression that

these men intended to enter the ground by any other means than by lawful

entry into the ground.               These two men were mature persons and not football

hooligans.

I have signed and dated the copy statement I have read today.

          people         before       he a l l o w e d them access              to th^      premises.

          I was a ware           that a semi-final                football m a t c h was            being       played later

b        t hat     day at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Stad i u m and the White Hart               public house
                                                                                                                S47



         is    p o s i t i o n e d on the m a i n     road    leading    from Sheffield,         over    the

         Pennines,           to M a n c h e s t e r and the North West of the            country.        This

         public       house       is r e g u l a r l y frequented,      on m atch days,       by football

         su p p o r t e r s .

         I went       outside       the    public     house and     I would estimate          that about 80

         pe r s o n s were w i t h i n the bar area,             a mixture of football            supporters


i        and     local       people.

         I e a s i l y a s c e r t a i n e d that     the football       supporters wer e fro m Liverpool


I        as

         These
               I could tell

                     people were
                                      by their accents.

                                          behaving     in an orderly manner and there was no

         trouble.

         The      premises        were very full and          I was s u b s e q u e n t l y j o i n e d by my

         f r i end                           We had a couple         of drinks an d due          to the

         p r e mises       being    busy we deci d e d to visit the P h e a s a n t           public     house

         which       is s i t uated on S t a t i o n R o a d at Oug h t i b r i d g e a n d    is a short

         d i s t a n c e awa y from the White Hart               public house.         The    reason we chose

         that      public        house    is due to     it being     located on a quiet           side    road off

         the m a i n highway and we a s s u m e d that football                    s upporters may not have

         found       it.

                                 and myself a r r i v e d at the Pheasant            public    house at about

         1.15pm        (1315)      and we d i s c o v e r e d that these        premises were also          being

         used      by Liverpool           football     supporters.        The    premises     consist of H

         rooms,       the       loung bar w h i c h    is co m f o r t a b l y furnished and the         public

         bar w h i c h       is used for games etc.              Outs i d e the premises         there    is a

         t e r r a c e d / p a v e d area where       benches and seats are used by customers

         wishing        to      remain outside.         The    terra c e d area was      busy and       I quickly

         a s c e r t a i n e d that a large number             of the    people outside were Liverpool

         football          supporters.

         We    e n t e r e d the     premises    via the front          door and t u r ned      right    into the




                                                                                                         I**|^

     lounge       bar w h i c h was very busy and             contained a large number of people

     which     included the           regular       customers and Liverpool           football

     supporters.             The supporters were            in the m ain well        behaved although

     several       were      rather    noisey but nothing unpleasant.                  I believe that I

     o v e r h e a r d the    landlord       "Brian"     say that     several      of the supporters had

     b o o k e d a table at the           premises       for a meal and that          this was a regular

     o c c u r r e n c e whenever L i verpool were            playing at Sheffield.

               and myself were enjoying a drink and we struck                           up a

     c o n v e r s a t i o n w i t h 2 Liverpool       s u pporters who were         standing at the bar

     next     to us.                  and myself were w e a r i n g our w o r k i n g      clothes and it

     would     be obvious        that we had been work i n g on a building site as we

     were     covered        in cement       dust and other debris.             T hey a sked us what our

     o c c u p a t i o n s were and     it soon became ap*parent that they were also

     employed        in the building           industry.         The men are de s c r i b e d as follows:-

     1.      Male,   white about 3 0-35 years,                m e d i u m build,   5*7 tall,     light

Today Friday 23rd June 1989 I was shown by Detective Sergeant                                                of

the West Midlands Police Force a copy of my statement that I made to the

West Midlands Police on 3rd May 1989.                       I have read over this statement and

it is correct there is nothing I wish to add or amend in the statement.

In my opinion I am quite satisfied that both the men I have referred to in

my original statement did have tickets for the semi-final at Hillsborough

Football Ground on Saturday 15th April 1989. As they were both mature

person's and not what I would consider to be football hooligans.

I have signed and dated the copy of the original statement I read over

today.        Early in June 1989 two plain clothes police officers from South

Yorkshire Police Force visited my home.                        I informed them that I had

already made a statement to the West Midlands Police Force.                                   As such the

officers said that they would not need to take a statement from me and I

did not discuss anything about the incident in the Pheasant Pub on

Saturday 15th April 1989, with either of the officers.

                 I am a married man and I live at the above address together with my

                 wife             At about   1pm on Saturday,       15th of April   1989 I was   in the

                 Pheasant       public house, Oughterbridge Lane, Sheffield,         together with a

                 friend John Ferguson.         We were standing together at the bar having a

                 drink.     I would say that there were about fifty Liverpool             supporters

                 in the bar and John and I were stood talking to two in particular.                       I

                 would describe these two as follows;



                 1)     A white male,     about 6ft tall, medium build with dark coloured

                        hair.         He also had a moustache.       I would estimate him to be

                        about 30 years of age.        He spoke with a Liverpool accent.             I

                        cannot remember what he said his name was but he did say that he

                        was a pavier     (pavement    layer)   by trade and he came from the Magull

                        area of Liverpool.      The only detail      I remember of his clothing was


                                                                                                     12
                                                                             PAGE
                                                                             S68Q

     that he was wearing a     red jumper.



2)   A white male about 5*     6 tall with blonde hair, he had a               slight

     build and he also had     a moustache.      I would say    that he was about

     30 years old.    Again,   he spoke with a Liverpool        accent, I c a n ’t

     remember what his name was but remember that he said he was a

     joiner by trade.     I cannot   remember any details as to his clothing

     other than he was wearing a yellow jumper.



They were pleasant     lads and they told us that they had got their

tickets from their boss who had been invited to watch the game from a

box and had given them stand tickets,        that he no longer needed.

Whilst we were standing talking at the bar we were joined by Peter

MARJARAM and whilst we were all talking someone,          I c a n ’t remember who,

passed comment to the two lads at about 20 minutes to three p.m.

as they left,   that they would be late for the match,           however they

replied,   " I t ’s OK w e ’ll be able to walk    in the gate cos w e ’ve got

stand tickets".      I have no doubt that this was a totally innocent

comment and took     it to mean that they would have no problem entering

the ground because they        both had stand tickets and therefore        had their

seats already allocated to them.

Whilst they were     in the Pheasant   pub the two lads had about four or

five pints and a meal.       As for the other Liverpool        supporters they
     r                                     *
were all drinking however there was no rowdiness and they were all

well behaved non of them appeared drunk.

I would also add that I        have no affiliation or particular liking        for

any football    club and do not follow the sport.

Today Saturday 24th June 1989 I have been shown by Detective Sergeant

            of the West Midlands Police Force, a copy of a statement I made to

South Yorkshire Police Force on 7th June 1989.

I do not wish to add or amend my statement.                           However I would like to point

out that in my copy statement on page 3                        where I             mention thetwo Liverpool

Supporters speaking to me this is                      shown in direct speech as "Don't worry

about that we know either a gate will be open or opened.”                                  This is not

correct, the two Liverpool supporters said words to that effect, and they

were not the words spoken.

I did not get the impression that                      these two men               intended toenter the

ground without a ticket, although                      I did not see               their tickets and they did

not mention tickets to me.                  The inference I got from the comment they

 passed was that they had knowledge of the ground and they knew a quick way

 into the ground.

Continuation ofstatementof Peter Kevin Marjoram



These two men were not what I would call football hooligans, they were

respectable, mature men.

I have signed and dated the copy statement I was shown by Detective

Sergeant

However, I still feel that the comments made by the 2 Liverpool Supporters

which indicated that at 2.50pm they would be able to gain a quick access

into the ground despite the large crowd was a puzzling remark since I have

attended football matches at Hillsborough.

I saw and heard nothing which indicated to me that these Liverpool

supporters were part of a conspiracy to enter the ground without tickets.

                                                                                           I finished work



i             drove        to                                               to pick up some furniture



 i            for a neighbour.                After   collecting this, myself and                      travelled

              along Halifax Road towards an address at Piper                       Road, Longley,        where


 i            we were to drop the furniture off.

              At this time we were                 in a Nissan Pick-up truck       belonging tothe

 i            company.



 i
              As we approached the junction of Doe Royd Lane,                        on our left,       I saw

              that the pelican crossing at that junction has turned to "red" as


 i            there were people at the crossing waiting to cross.

               the crossing in the nearside lane, and the two elderly
                                                                                            I            up at

        pedestrians began to cross from left to right in front of us.

        Halifa:: Road at this point,         t"Re road is a dual     carriageway road with

        two lanes on either side.          As the two     pedestrians passed in front of

        the van I became aware of a car approaching the crossing from behind

        in the offside     lane.    1 could see the vehicle clearly in the wing

        mirror and it was travelling at high speed with the driver apparently


 I      unaware that the lights had changed to red against him.

        was within 50 yds of the crossing when it began to brake suddenly.
                                                                               The vehicle



I       There was no screaching of tyres but the vehicle dipped considerably



I
        onto the front suspension and came to an abrupt halt at the side of

        my van in the offise       lane.    At one point    I was extremely worried


I       that    it would not be able to stop in time and put out my hand to try

        and attract the attention of the two pedestrians shouting to them to

I       stop where they were.



I
        After the vehicle had stopped they managed to cross the carriageway

        and I looked down from the cab into the vehicle.                It was a dark grey


I       coloured family saloon either an Es cort or Montego and contained 5

        mates,    2 in the front and three       in the   rear.    They all appeared to be

|       dressed smartly     in casual      clothing with no apparent football      favours

        or clothing on them.       However     I did see what appeared to be red

I       scarves    in the vehicle.      All the occupants except for the driver were


■       drinking what appeared to be Heineken lager from green Heineken

        cans.     The driver was slightly obscurred from my view by the roof of

I       the vehi c l e .

        As soon as I looked down the front seat passenger seemed to take

a       offence and began shouting numerous swear words at me.                I could not


i       hear what he was saying due to the window being

        easy to lip read words such as "Fuck off".
                                                                      closed but it was

                                                                  I began to wind my window

        down to say something to him but the lights changed to green and the

        vehicle set off at speed pulling away from us quite quickly.                I jwas
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S48

very annoyed with the occupants of the vehicle and it was obvious to

me that they had been drinking heavily and displayed an aggressive

attitude towards myself and

I continued our journey,      dropping L            |at the Sicey Hotel Public

House,    Sicey Avenue, Shiregreen.       I then returned to Oughtibridge

where    I then called into the Pheasant Public House on Jaw Bone Hill.

On my arrival    there   I saw numerous       people both inside and outside of

the pub.     These   people were clearly not       regulars at the pub and due

to their accents      I took it that they were Liverpool supporters on

route to the Semi Final at Hillsborough.             It was 2.35pm (1435) when I

arrived at the Pheasant public house and I would estimate that there

were E5 Liverpool     supporters present.

I entered the bar of the pub and saw two colleagues drinking at the

bar, John Ferguson and                    .     1 joined them and John bought me

a pint.     I then became aware of two men behind me who were drinking

shorts.    From their accents      it was obvious they were Liverpudlians

and I began to talk and joke with them.             The time was now 2.45pm

(1445) and I said to them something to the effect that they were

leaving    late to get to the ground for the 3pm (1500) kick off.

One of the two men then said to me            "Don't worry about that, we know
    *

either a gate will be open or opened".            At this,   both men laughed to

each other.     This statement struck me as being very strange:           I was

puzzled as to how they could be so sure that they would find a gate

or gates open at such a late time.            Neither men made any mention of a

ticket or showed me a ticket.        I have attended numerous football

matches at Hillsborough and other grounds and the statement from the

man made me wonder how he could be so sure that they would find a

gate open at that     late time.    After my initial thoughts on the matter

I dismissed it from my mind and continued drinking with my

colleagues.     The two men then left the pub at 2.45pm          (        As they

           Following the news reports of the disaster and circumstances of it,

I          the statement made by the Liverpudlians

           the day before     came to mind again.
                                                          in the Pheasant Public House

I          very strange statement from a supporter attending a match at such a


I          late time.      It became apparent from the news that a gate at the

           ground had been opened to allow late comers into the ground and I

I          conjectured that the statement made by the man and the opening of the



I
           gate was connected.      It was for this   reason I contacted the Police

           and reported what this man had said to me prior to attending the match.

At 12.45am the same date 1 left work with Peter MARJORAM in a Nissan

Cabstar pick-up motor vehicle, we went into Sheffield, and together with

Peter 1 moved some furniture.                   After we had done this Peter dropped me off

at the Sicey Hotel, Sheffield at about 1.30pm, Peter did not come in the

Sicey Hotel for a drink he just gave me a lift there.

In the Sicey Hotel there were a number of Liverpool Supporters but I did

not speak to them or hear what they were saying other than one who said he

had taken the wrong turn off the motorway.

The Liverpool supporters left the Sicey Hotel at about 2.30pm.                                     1 left

there at about 3pm.               1 did not go to the semi-final at Hillsborough.                              1

1 have been a keen football supporter for many years and used to be a

season ticket holder at Hillsborough along with my wife.                                  1 ceased going

to live football matches because of the increased use of foul language and

violence.

On Saturday the 15th of April 1989 it was my intention to meet a friend of

mine                     , 1 don’t know his address, for a game of golf at Concord

Municipal Golf Course in Sheffield.                      Our intention was to meet at the

course at 1pm.

Having knowledge that the F A Cup semi-final was being played at

Hillsborough 1 decided to leave my house early to avoid any traffic

congestion and delays.

I left my home at about 11.45am and drove In my car towards the golf

course.      1 was surprised how little traffic there was.                     1 saw one or two

supporters about but certainly no crowds at this time.

As I was early I decided to go for a quick drink before meeting

    ^       I stopped at the Sicey, at the top of Sicey Ave, Firth Park.                                  I

parked my car on the car park.               There were one or two cars parked but

nothing out of the ordinary.

1 went into the pub and ordered half a pint of lager.                        The pub is

basically one big room and 1 chose a seat not far from where three men

were sitting.            There were perhaps 15 people in the pub at this time.

From where 1 sat 1 could inadvertently overhear the conversation that the

3 men were having.            It became apparent to me that 2 of the men were

Liverpudlians and 1 had a Midlands accent, more Nottingham than

Birmingham.         1 listened to their conversation for about 7 or 8 minutes and

during this time 1 heard them discuss how they were going to get into the

ground without tickets.             They appeared to know Sheffield well as they said

that the place to cause trouble would be outside Leppings Lane because of

its confined entrance.            They said something along the lines of "We'll meet

the boys in Leppings Lane, if enough start pushing then the police will

open the gates."            They mentioned that they had managed to do this before.

1 also heard them say w e ’ll create havoc.                   1 also heard mention of them

wanting to get behind the goal.                They each had a full pint in front of

them, although 1 am unable to say what they drank before 1 got there.

At some stage 1 got the impression that they realised that 1 was

listening. 1 felt rather uncomfortable so drank up and left.

I then went and played golf.

I finished playing golf at about 4.30pm and then heard on the car radio

the news of the tragedy at Hillsborough.                        I mentioned to                           my

earlier encounter in the pub and he said that really I should go to the

police.

I thought everything over and thought that my evidence seemed

insignificant until I heard about the trauma that Superintendent MARSHALL

had suffered as a result of the gates being opened.

It is my opinion that the creating of the crush outside the turnstiles and

the subsequent opening of the gates was orchestrated by the Liverpool

supporters or I should say the minority.

The 3 men in the pub were all white.                      The 2 Liverpudlians were in their

early 20*s and the other man was aged about 35.                              I would not recognise

them again.         G Taylor

a                  the FA Cup Semi Final was being played at the ground on that day I

passed there about       11.50am    (1+50) and saw very few football

supporters and traffic was light.           I saw that the Police had blocked

off the side roads to protect residents*          parking,   and I saw,       I think,

about 50 policemen in that area.

Having time in hand before meeting my friends,           I stopped at the

"Sicey" on Sicey Avenue to pass time until          I met them.    I went into

the pub and ordered a half pint of lager, and sat down in the bar

loung.

I sat just to the right of the main entrance.            There were

approximately fifteen people in the pub.           The room has   "bays* around

its circumference and I sat at the end of one of the            'bays* nearest

the entrance, with my back to the next          *bay*.   Sitting behind me were

three men, who were already there when I arrived.

After    a few minutes    I became aware of their conversation.         I cannot

now remember the exact words,         but I gathered first of all that they

were football supporters,          intending to go to the semi-final at

Hi 11sbo rough.

As   I went to sit down I had noticed that these three men were as

follows: —

1.     Mid thirties,   black or dark brown hair,     cut slightly longer than

normal,    with a dark moustache.       He was wearing black leather hip

length coat,      dark trousers.

2.     Mid twenties,   light sandy hair,     cut very short,   but not a crew

cut,    clean shaven, wearing red sweater,       crew neck and a pink shirt

collar worn outside,       light grey trousers.

3.     Mid twenties,   hair light brown and cut ear length, wearing a

tweed sports jacket.        I cannot describe this man as well as the

others as he sat farthest away from me.

As I listened to this conversation,          I heai^d this older man (no.        1)      !

talking t6 the others,       saying that they should not worry about not                 .
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S45

having tickets.      They would meet up with "the others" outside

Leppings Lane entrance.       They would organise as many people as

possible to cause whatever trouble they could.            If enough trouble was

caused the gates would have to be opened.            I gathered that this had

happened before, and this man seemed confident that this action could

be forced.

The sandy haired man      (no. 2) asked how the "others" would know to

meet up at the right time.         (No.   1) The other man said if they got

there for about 2.15pm (1415) he knew most of the other lads and they

could quickly be got organised.           He said "We've got to get as close

to the turnstiles as possible."           He said when the gate was opened,

they would force their way through to "the back of the goal".

At this point one of the three men noticed I was listening, and they

glared at me in an unfriendly way. I hurriedly drank           the remainder

of my      drink and left the pub. The       time would then be about 12.20pm

(1220 ).

I was      in the pub for about ten to fifteen minutes.       I was able to see

these      men as I walked from the bar      to my seat, and as I stood up to

1 eave .

I knpw that these men were Liverpool           supporters because nos. 2 and 3

had Liverpool accents.       No.    1 had an East Midlands/Nottinghamshire

accident.      They spoke of the Leppings Lane end arrangements as though

they were well aware that this was their team's end of the ground.

I did not place too much importance on the conversation I had heard,

and went to play golf.       On my way home in the car I heard on the

radio that there had been an incident at the semi-final, and

thereafter the conversation became more significant to me.            The

course of the public hearings of the enquiry currently being

conducted by Justice Taylor,         prompted me to tell this to the Police, t

I must     say that I gained the impression that the Police were being
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S45

              unfairly M a m e d   for this courre of events.

              On the day after the Hillsborough tragedy,        I discussed with a golfing

              friend,                 what    1 had heard in the pub on the previous day.

             He suggested I tell the Police about         it, but I did not do so

              immediately.

                                                                         G. TAYLOR SIGNED

I am a married man and live at the above address with my wife and

I have been friends with Garry TAYLOR of                                                                   Eor

about 10 years.

We are regular golfing partners and have the occasional drink together.

On Saturday the 15th of April 1989 I worked from 3.30am until 11.30am.                                             I

had arranged to meet Gary TAYLOR at the Concord Municipal Golf Centre.                                              I

think we had agreed to meet for about 1pm.                          I got there at about 12.30pm

to 12.45pm.         Garry was not there when I arrived but turned up a few

minutes later.            I recall him saying that he was a bit early and that he

had called into the Sicey Public House.

I remember commenting that if I had known then I would have joined him.

We played a round of golf finishing at about 4.30pm.

Continuation ofstatementof



I was aware of the fact that the FA Cup Semi Final was being played at

Hillsborough and knew that there was a strong likelihood of traffic delays

and congestion.          I drove the back route back to my house to avoid delay

and Garry TAYLOR followed me in his car.

It was only when I listened to the car radio that 1 became aware of the

disaster at the Hillsborough football ground.

It was a couple of days later that Garry mentioned                         tome    about what hehad

heard being discussed in the Sicey pub.                    He said that he had overheard a

conversation between some Liverpool fans saying that they didn’t have any

tickets, that they were meeting up with other fans and they knew how to

get into the ground without a ticket.

At the time Garry told me this it was at the time that the press were

blaming the police for what had gone on.

Over the next couple of weeks I could tell that this was playing on

Garry’s mind.         He wanted to tell his story to the Judicial Inquiry but I

could understand his reluctance to do so bearing in mind the poor state of

his wife’s health.

On Saturday 15th April 1989, the day of the semi-final, I opened the pub

as normal at 11am.             I went outside to see to the tables when I came back

my barmaids were already serving two fans of a group of about 12.                                       I found

out they were part of a mini bus group and they were young lads and I

didn’t like the appearance of them, so I told them they’d have to leave

and tried to explain why one immediately began swearing at me and I said

to the group, "if you’d have left him you might have been served."                                        I

stood my ground and eventually they left.                         From then on I stood on the

door monitoring the numbers going in the pub and also refusing entry to

some.      I only really let middle aged groups in.                         I let one mini bus with

about 12 young lads on in but the arranger was                                                   the boxer

and they were very well behaved in all, I had about 50 fans in the pub

including the mini-bus group.               There were no problems or damage caused and

I was pleased with their behaviour and my takings for a Saturday doubled.

After the match a mini-bus called at the pub to use the telephones.                                     The

bus was organised by the Farmers Arms, Liverpool (Tel L i v e r p o o l I ) .

I ’m not really interested in the extra money I consider this as my home

and I like an orderly pub without my locals being put off coming in.

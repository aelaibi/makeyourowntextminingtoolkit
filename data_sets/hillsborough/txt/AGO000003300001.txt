        HILLSBOROUGH (DUCKENFIELD)

        Your ann o tatio n on the CPS Sensitive Case List asked for more
        inform ation ab o u t th e D uckenfield judicial review.

        B eneath th is note is the subm ission w hich I p u t u p on 16 December
         1998 outlining the substantive issue. The p resen t position as regards
        judicial review is th a t the solicitors have asserted th eir intention to bring
        judicial review proceedings. T hat h a s not, however, tran slated into
        action an d they could soon be tim e barred. The tim e lim it for the
        application is “a s soon as practicable” an d in any event n o t m ore th a n 3
        m o n th s after the decision com plained of. I have spoken to C hris Newell
        a t CPS h ead q u arters. His u n d erstan d in g is th a t the S outh Yorkshire
        police au th o rity are now reconsidering a t least som e asp ects of the
        funding available to the officers an d th is m ay have a bearing on the fact
        th a t no application h a s been m ade.

You have a m eeting tom orrow (T hursday 17 D ecem ber 1998) a t the
H ouse a t 4pm w ith C hris Newell (Director of C asew ork E valuation a t CPS
h ead q u arters). He will be accom panied by Robin Booth (A ssistant Chief
Crown Prosecutor, C entral Casework). The pu rp o se of th e m eeting will
be to d isc u ss the m atters raised in C hris Newell’s letter to me of 3
D ecem ber a b o u t the private prosecution being b ro u g h t by the
H illsborough Fam ilies S upport G roup ag ain st two form er police officers
(Chief S u p erin ten d en t D uckenfield a n d S u p e rin te n d e n t M urray) who
were responsible for policing operations a t H illsborough on the occasion
of the d isa ste r w hich occurred a t th e s ta rt of th e FA C up sem i-final
m atch betw een Liverpool an d N ottingham F orest in April 1989. the
charges are m an slau g h ter (both) an d attem p tin g to pervert the course of
public ju stice (Duckenfield only). The CPS h a s a sta tu to ry right u n d e r
Section 6(2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 to intervene an d
a ssu m e responsibility for the co n d u ct of th e proceedings. Those acting
on behalf of th e defence have m ade re p re se n ta tio n s to the CPS to the
effect th a t they should intervene a n d discontinue; those who are
responsible for the prosecution firmly re sist th a t proposal.

The new DPP h a s declared in terest in th e m a tte r b ecau se of connection
w ith one of th e defendants (I believe he m ay have been retained). Chris
Newell h a s been asked to take th e decision. He is m inded n o t to
intervene b u t w ishes to co n su lt you on th a t point.

The issu e s are fully set o u t an d explored in a very helpful letter from
C hris Newell w hich is im m ediately b en eath th is note a t Flag 1. You m ay
w ish to focus your atten tio n on reading th a t, together w ith the bound
volum e entitled “The H illsborough R eport 1998” w hich su m m arises the
whole history of th e case, together w ith th e a sse ssm e n ts an d reaso n s for
th e various step s tak en a t different stages. I do n o t suggest th a t you
read all th e rep resen tatio n s m ade by th e different p arties w hich are

w ith th a t docum ent. It is im p o rtan t th a t th e CPS decision in th is case
should accord w ith th a t policy.
The issu e of private p rosecutions generally ra ise s im p o rtan t issu es of
principle w ith widely differing views being held.             Som e consider it
inappropriate th a t th e m ost intrusive power of th e sta te should be
capable of being invoked a t the b eh est of individual citizens, often
approaching th e m a tte r on a highly p a rtisa n b asis. The con trary view
(recently publicly esp o u sed by the Law Comm ission) is th a t th e right to
initiate a private prosecution is a n im p o rtan t co n stitu tio n al safeguards
ag ain st a n im proper refusal by th e proper au th o rities to act. My own
suspicion is th a t th is issu e m ay well assu m e g reater significance in the
n o t too d ista n t fu tu re given the increasing read in ess of individuals and
p ressu re groups to reso rt to private prosecution. There is a su b stan tial
risk th a t private prosecu tio n s on a significant scale will u n d erm in e the
ability of public p ro secu to rs to p u rsu e sensible a n d m oderate policies
b ecause p a rtisa n individuals m ay so easily u n d erm in e th eir decision.

Be th a t a s it m ay, CPS policy is b ased on the prem ise th a t th e right of
private prosecution is en sh rin ed in sta tu te an d th e u se of the statu to ry
power to intervene for th e p u rp o ses of d iscontinuing should be used
sparingly. It is not appropriate to utilise th e pow er to im pose th e policies
a n d s ta n d a rd s of the CPS on private prosecutors. O therw ise, th e right to
bring a private prosecution becom es m eaningless. T h u s, th e CPS will
generally intervene ag ain st th e will of th e parties only in circum stances
w here the evidence is clearly insufficient to found a case, or clearly
ag ain st the public interest. In p articu lar, th e CPS do n o t apply to private
p rosecutors th e “reasonable prospects of conviction” test. Applying th is
approach to the p re se n t case, th e CPS have concluded th a t, although the
evidence does n o t afford a realistic prospect of conviction ag ain st either
D uckenfield or M urray in relation to the 3 ch arg es of m an slau g h ter
(common to both), they can n o t go so far as to say th a t th ere is no case a t
all an d accordingly they w ould not intervene on evidential grounds.
Given the serio u sn ess of an y offence of hom icide, they w ould not
intervene to discontinue on public in terest grounds. By co n trast, they
are satisfied th a t th e charge of attem pting to pervert th e course of ju stice
ag ain st D uckenfield is evidentially unfounded. N onetheless, they have
concluded th a t it w ould be w rong to effect a p artial intervention simply to
discontinue one charge.

I agree w ith th e CPS having regard to th eir existing policy. In particular,
I am quite su re th a t p artial intervention, even if technically possible,
would serve no useful purpose. It w ould com plicate th e proceedings, be
m isunderstood an d probably ridiculed an d sen d a signal th a t, by
im plication, th e CPS positively supported th e proceedings for
m anslaughter.

My reading of th e p ap ers h a s identified 2 issu e s w hich I have raised with
C hris Newell. One is now resolved. They are:

(i)    The prosecution case (as su m m arised a t Flag C) is expressed to rely
       heavily on th e evidence of the 2 officers to th e Taylor Inquiry. It
       stru c k m e th a t th is w as a situ atio n w here w itnesses w ould, h ad
       they contem plated the possibility of crim inal proceedings, have
       invoked th e privilege ag ain st self-incrim ination or so u g h t som e form
       of u n d ertak in g th a t w hat they said w ould n o t be u se d in evidence
       ag ain st them . I u n d e rs ta n d th a t th a t w as n o t done. There is on the
       face of it no b a r to the u se of th a t evidence in crim inal proceedings.
       B u t it m ay well be th a t som e point will be ta k e n by th e defence on
       fairn ess - particularly if Lord Taylor did n o t ad m in ister any w arning
       to th e individuals.

(ii)   Those responsible for the prosecution place em p h asis on the fact
       th a t th e H ouse of Lords in the relatively recen t case of Adomoko
       clarified th e law of m an slau g h ter m aking it clear th a t concepts of
       reck lessn ess should no longer be regarded a s relevant: the te st is
       now one of gross negligence. The law w as far from clear w hen the
       issu e w as considered by counsel (including Lord W illiams of Mostyn)
       in 1990. I w ould have been concerned if th e p re se n t prosecution
       were being founded on su b stan tiv e law of m a n sla u g h te r w hich w as
       significantly different (and m ore extensive) th a n th a t prevailing in
        1990 w hen th e decision n o t to prosecute w as first taken. It would
       give rise to a n elem ent of retrospection a n d possible ECHR
       im plications. B u t it is clear from the CPS background note (Flag A,
       paragraph 8.7) th a t counsel approached the evidence on the basis
       th a t th e gross negligence te st (in addition to th a t of “recklessness”)
       w as sufficient to estab lish th e offence of m an slau g h ter. T hus,
       alth o u g h the H ouse of Lords h a s clarified th e law, th e 1990 review
       proceeded on su b stan tially th e sam e su b stan tiv e law a s is presently
       applicable. It is therefore sim ply a case of a different view now being
       tak en of th e evidence.

I have m u ch sym pathy for the points m ade by th e defence th a t it is very
h a rs h for th e d efen d an ts now to face proceedings in circu m stan ces where
they have been th ro u g h a public inquiry, a crim inal investigation
followed by a decision n o t to prosecute, a n in q u est a n d judicial review of
the in q u est followed by a review by Lord Ju s tic e Stew art-Sm ith w hich
concluded th a t there w as no reaso n to fault th e decision to in stitu te no
proceedings a n d th a t the so called fresh evidence did n o t add to the
S W /1612/10                                 3
position. (The la tte r claim is hotly contested by th e p ro secu to rs in his
case who also allege th a t they now have even m ore evidence eg. the
re su lt of p ap ers disclosed to them by th e Home Office.) However, the
right to bring a private prosecution is en sh rin ed in s ta tu te a n d th e co u rt
h a s in recen t y ears developed a wide discretion to stay proceedings if
they are u n fair an d co n stitu te a n ab u se of process. T hus, I am firmly of
th e view th a t any unw elcom e tren d in relation to private prosecutions
should n o t be controlled by executive action b u t by th e u se by th e court
of its own wide discretion.

The m a tte r h a s now becom e pressing, largely b ecause of p ressu re of
w ork u p o n m yself - for w hich I apologise. I am confident in advising you
th a t the app ro ach adopted by th e CPS is so u n d a n d th a t you should
acquiese in the ap p ro ach proposed in C hris Newell’s letter. N onetheless,
the im portance an d sensitivity of th e issue suggested to me th a t it
m erited a t least som e discu ssio n an d for th a t reaso n I have arran g ed the
m eeting for tomorrow.

HOME SECRETARY'S ADDRESS TO THE AGM OF THE FEDERATED RANKS OF THE
METROPOLITAN POLICE: WEDNESDAY 18 OCTOBER


I attach an outline of the speech the Home Secretary might give
to the Metropolitan Police Federated Ranks.

2.   The outline suggests that, rather than dwelling upon the
record of (the) past year(s) - which gains few accolades from
this audience - the Home Secretary should cover the "futures"
issues raised at ^the ACPO and Superintendents1 Association
conferences. This would have the merit both of avoiding
controversy on whether the police have or have not done well in
recent years (this meeting has traditionally taken the line that
whatever has been given is no more than they deserve, and
probably less), and of demonstrating that the Federation is to be
included in the debate on the future of the service.

3.   Subject to the Home Secretary's views, I shall prepare a
first draft of the speech for next Friday, which can then be
adjusted in the light of the discussion between the Home
Secretary and the Chairman and Secretary of the Met Branch on
9 October.

    SPEECH TO METROPOLITAN POLICE FEDERATED RANKS      :   OUTLINE

Review of. past year      crime trends (generally down, but
                          violent up)
                          Notting Hill Carnival
                          Marchioness
                          wrapping cases
                          Hillsborough - irrespective of blame,
                          illustrates the burdens placed upon
                          officers

Resources                 record number of officers
                          ? difficulties caused by this year's
                          rent allowance increase (no reference to
                          proposals for next year)
                          measuring demands and performance

So much for past and present.   Should like now to concentrate on
future.   Reference to speeches to Superintendents' Association
and ACPO. Federated Ranks must be included too:       this is first
opportunity.


Role of police           recognise calls for Royal Commission,
                         doubt it would achieve much
                         welcome Federation's involvement in JCC
                         study of policing
                         society has become more complex, but
                         role of constable remains essentially
                         the same
                         recognise concerns about privatisation,
                          "specials", etc:   where work does not
                         require constables' skills, have to
                         consider using other, less expensive
                          less trained staff. Reserve officers
                          for real police jobs,
                         no question of privatising mainstream
                         police functions.
Higher police
     training        concern about higher management, career
                     structures.   Share desire to avoid
                     "butterfly" syndrome.   Senior officers
                     must be sufficiently experienced in
                     police work
                     service must offer training and career
                     paths for officers of different
                     abilities


Organisation of

                     need for national intelligence unit
                     better co-ordination of operational
                     matters.

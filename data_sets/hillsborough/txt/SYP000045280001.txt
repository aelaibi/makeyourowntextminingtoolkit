    Dear Mr Jones,

    Further to my visit in July last when I agreed to let you have copies of any
    statements which came to me in which there was direct reference to any of the
    deceased I enclose a copy statement from Mr Ball which is fairly full.

    I note from the statement that he has already made a statement in shorter form
    to the Police at the time but it may be that there is something in the
    more detailed statement which may be of assistance.

    All good w i s h e s .

    Yours sincerely,




    MISS E M STEEL

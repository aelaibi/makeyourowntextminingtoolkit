POLICE CONSTABLE 1079



At    9.15    a.m.       Saturday      15 April       1989,     I    arrived    at   Sheffield      Wednesday

Football Club, Hillsborough to perform uniform duties in connection with the

semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham.                            I had been pre-warned that I

was   on     Serial       1,    which is a duty performed on                the running      track of the

pitch, under the supervision of Police Sergeant Chapman ('F' Division Plain

Clothes)      and Inspector Darling.                  I had performed this duty on a number of

previous occasions and was familiar with the overall plan and general 'set

up' at Hillsborough.

Due to the large number of officers on duty that day, I got a warm drink and

took my place in the North Stand in preparation for the briefing.                                   I quickly

identified         other       members     of   my    Serial    and    Police     Sergeant    Chapman      was

checking people off.

At 9-^5 a.m. all officers were briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield

and a number of other senior officers, followed by an Intelligence briefing

by Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.                     After the briefing we were all supplied

with a light packed meal and instructed that all officers should be on their

points by no later than 11.15 a.m. a point that was emphasised.

At 11.00 a.m.            I took up position on the pitch midway between the player's

tunnel and the 'E' Stand and Spion Kop.                        I don't recall the exact time but I

remember thinking that the spectators were entering early and I took this as

a good       sign      that     the   turnstiles      were     open early,      rather     than   the   often

hurried hunt up of turnstile operators                         to open up and get people off the

streets.           I    remained      in   this      position       doing   a   general    patrol    between

player's tunnel and               'E' Stand.         During that time I saw several VIP guests

arrive       and       talked    generally      with     the    cameraman/sports          personalities/TV

people.

Between     1.20 p.m. and approximately 1.45 p.m. I had a cooked meal in the

gymnasium behind the North Stand.

At   1.^5     p.m.      approximately,           I went          back    out ontothe        pitch   and    I was

immediately      aware       that    there was already a good number of people                              in the

ground and the day's work had begun.

At   2.00   p.m.        a    Steward       pointed     out        to me a group        of    3 or   4 Liverpool

supporters that were seated in the front of the South Stand.                                        I knew that

with it being a capacity crowd that there was no chance of transferring them

into another part of the ground so I decided                                to speak to them and found

that they were          from Northern Ireland and seemed decent lads.                           I advised them

to take off their Liverpool scarves and told them very firmly that should

Liverpool      score,       not   for    them     to   jump        up    cheering      as    this   would    cause

problems and I would have to eject them.                           I continued walking up and down my

beat and as such striking up several short conversations with people on the

first   few    rows.         This    was     a   policy          that   Chief    Superintendent           Mole   had

encouraged      that    I    think      he    rightly       believed       set   the    atmosphere         on what

should have been an enjoyable pleasure activity for the fans.                                        I remember

asking one young man who told me he was from London what he had paid for his

ticket, he said £50.00 and I believed him, although I said something to him

like,   "You must       be mad".             I quickly           spotted a good number of Liverpool

supporters     in the South Stand and I tried to get round them all, advising

them about cheering.              They all seemed to understand, but it was at the back

of my mind that this could cause problems, but I knew that cross transfer

was impossible.

At 2.30 p.m.         I remember looking at my watch to see how the numbers were

going, I was surprised to see both the Kop and South Stand apparently full,

but Liverpool accommodation only half full.                             The centre pen on Leppings Lane

was three quarters full (plus) but lots of room in the stands and wings.

Just after 2.30 p.m. I noticed that the upper level of the elevated terrace

(NW) was getting quite full and they had started with the pushing wave.                                            I
thought    how     stupid    they    were    and    how easily   it was    for   someone      to get

seriously hurt.        It's a problem that we have with all the big clubs that

visit us, but fortunately a problem we have managed to overcome with our own

supporters.        It started when the new Kop was opened and at that time I was

employed on Video Camera duties in the Police Control.                     We spent a long time

trying to identify the culprits that were starting the wave, and we dealt

with    it by putting        several       officers at the back, which resulted              in many

ejections and arrests.            We seemed to have cracked that problem within a few

home games and the same went for obscene chanting.                   We seemed to be lucky as

far as racist chants go, even though we have had black players, but we have

always had a policy of            'firm but fair'.

Just after that time (still                just after2.30 p.m.) I remember thinking             that

the    Liverpool    train    must     be    late    or   something, because      of    the   lack of

numbers in the Liverpool end.               I walked down to Police Constable Holmes, who

I saw had    a radio.        He said thatthere had been loads of bother outside the

ground, I    think he said that they had wrecked a pub somewhere.

By this time the supporters were baiting one another from one end to the

other and the atmosphere wasn't good, some people seemed particularly bitter

when chanting.        I said to quite a few, "Do that again and you're out."                       I

considered taking one out as an example to see if it would settle them down,

but every    time I had strong words with one , his mates would                       plead with me

that they    would look after him.                 I had to speak very firmly to some Notts

lads in the South Stand,             the noise was so great now that I was having to

shout at the top of my voice.                 They were using obscene chants and baiting

the Liverpool fans.          Some were starting to put their legs over the wall as

if to get     to the Liverpool             end and I thought that if these             identify the

Liverpool supporters         in     this stand there will be some big problems.                  The

atmosphere was getting tense               in all areas now and I thought that the game

had better get startedsoon or we will                    have a problem.    It was then it went

through my mind       that        there should be some        pre-match entertainment on         the
                                                                                                           £ '-III.

pitch.        All these people encapsulated here and nothing for them to do.                           I

was surprised that the big advertising people didn't lay something on, but I

thought       that the pitch quality was more              important to the game.         I wasn't

sure, but I feel as I always have that if you allow the crowd in early you

need to entertain them.

At 3.00 p.m. sometime about kick off time (it could have been just before) I

saw Liverpool fans walking on the running track behind West Stand goal and

across    to the North Stand seating.                  They were jumping over the wall, but

they then started to come back.                I immediately thought that there was going

to be a pitch invasion.               I hadn't a radio so I couldn't monitor what was

going off.           I saw more of them behind the goal but there was quite a few

Police Officers there, no one seemed to be hurrying with anything, I just

couldn't       work   out what      was   going   off.     I remember     feeling     quite   angry,

thinking, "What the bloody hell is going off, get them arrested or get them

back in the terraces".              I thought shall I go up and see what's the matter,

but by this time the crowd behind me                   had seen the fans invading the         pitch.

The Notts fans were seething and all                   I could hear was, "We'll never         getback

into fucking Europe",           "Those cunts again, fucking Heysel again."               The Notts

fans    were    shouting      to me   directly    now:     "Stop   the   bastards."     They were

pointing to the goal.           None of us, including the fans, had any idea what was

going off.       I thought if I move from here these fans will be across the wall

and then we have got the Birmingham situation all over again, but I think

that this one has got the potential                    to be a lot worse.      I knew I       wasonly

one man, but I seemed to be holding                    them back, I was pleading with         thefans

to sit down and calm down.                Somewhere in the middle of this I saw a senior

officer run onto the pitch and stop the match.                     I thought it will take ages

to get this lot sorted out.                 I remember feeling the most frightened I have

ever felt in my Police Service.                I envisaged several thousand people coming

out    onto    the    pitch   and   there    being one     almighty massive     public disorder

situation which would clearly lead to the loss of life.                        I thought it was
only     a    matter    of    time     before    they     were   coming   over    the   wall.    A   few

Liverpool supporters ran down my side of the running track baiting my stand.

I went between them and persuaded them to turn back, it was going against

the grain not to have arrested them but I thought if I do, my stand will be

over.        I probably used foul language in my attempt to turn them back.                             It

seems    petty     now   but     I   have   this    thought      of curbing      my   language   when    I

remember seeing a sound boom from one of the T.V. cameras.

A Sergeant and Police Constable walked past me from the Leppings Lane end

and I asked,        "What's going off up at the top end?"                     One of them said,         "I

don't know but there's loads of bobbies up there."                          I wish now that I had

relied on my instincts and gone and looked for myself.                            I have this awful

feeling that I may have been able to have helped.                         I have this feeling that

I am one of the officers that the press have mentioned 'standing about doing

nothing'.

I remember seeing            the players        looking    confused and hanging around on the

pitch.        One of the linesmen or the referee round them up and steered them

into     the tunnel.         I remember one of them examining some scratches on his

arm,     I    thought    that    one      of the supporters must          have   attacked   him.         I

reflected what animals we were dealing with.

At   3-05 p.m./3.10 p.m.             approximately,        I saw several fans coming over the

Leppings Lane end fences and start to walk across the pitch, one or two make

a run.        I can’t understand why the Police Constables aren't stopping them

moving       forward.    My     first    idea of the problem (gross understatement) was

when'an ambulance rushes                onto the pitch and         pulls up behind the goal.             I

then     see people climbing onto the top of it, which was only confirming                              my

view of the animals we were dealing with.                        Shortly after that I saw someone

being carried on one of the advertising boards across to the ramp near to

the 0 gate.        Several bobbies were now coming onto the pitch and in a very

orderly file walking along the track of the North Stand.

Still my thoughts are focused intently on a massive pitch invasion and have
we enough officers         to deal        with it.    Several officers are now coming                  onto

the pitch, but they are all               going up to the far end.            Ithink they want more

even    spreading.         Some    fans     rush     down    towards    me    shouting,       "Murdering

bastards, you've killed my fucking brother."                         I say something like, "What

are you talking about." and I am told then that there must be a dozen people

dead.     Someone shouts to clear the running track for the ambulances.                                The

photographers have dumped all their gear on the track and I start to pick it

up to make way for the ambulance, but the first one drives straight across

the pitch, so I just throw the rest to the side, thinking how stupid I was

thinking about these blokes' equipment when it now looked as if life really

had been lost.

Several groups were now coming forward towards the Notts fans, baiting them,

shouting at       Police Officers,          "Murdering Bastards, Murdering Bastards".                     I

pleaded with them to turn back, most: did, but I have never seen such anger

on such a large scale before.                I tried to appeal to the Notts fans, telling

them that the situation was very serious, people had lost their lives.                                 All

I can remember is people shouting back,                     "The bastards deserve to die, good

fucking riddance."         One Liverpool supporter ran right up to the goal (Spion

Kop end), he had no shirt on, a supporters scarf around his wrist, I think

he had a flat cap on.             My crowd were shouting to me directly, "Get him, get

him.      You'd   better    fucking get him before we                    do."    I wasglad no Police

Officer    ran    onto    the     pitch    and   chased     him, that's      just    what     the     crowd

wanted.      When    he    was    caught     there was      a massive        cheer   from    the    crowd.

Liverpool     supporters         were     now    rushing     round     the    ground,       pulling     off

advertising boards and this was really winding the crowd up.                                 I tried to

explain, I thought it would calm them down.                      I again heard something like,

"Another fucking Heysel, them cunts."

The Notts supporters            saw the Liverpool supporters swing on the goal cross

bar, it looked as if they were trying to smash it.                           Then they saw the nets

being taken down.         We all, including me, thought that they were being stolen

but it seemed so unimportant now, but the Notts supporters were insensed.                                          I

heard,       "They all ought to fucking die".                       Many shout, "We'll never get back

in Europe".           What      time    will       the   game      start?".     I couldn't believe              that

people were asking such pathetic questions.

Some Police Officers started to form a cordon across the pitch, it was very

thin at first, a bit one sided.                          I joined it on the left flank but more

officers       joined      it    and    it    started         to   look like    the   real       thing.        Chief

Inspector Price            appeared from somewhere on my left and he got the cordon

shaped up,       looking something like,                 and we started to move forwad sweeping

the Liverpool supporters back to their own half, who were by then intent on

causing serious bother with the Notts supporters.                                 We were careful not to

link up       just    in    case    we had         to defend        ourselves    against     the     supporters

rushing at us.          The Liverpool supporters (some of them) I could see were in

shock    and had      lost all          control,         they werebaiting       the   crowd and didn't

appreciate the overwhelming numbers that could descend upon them.                                         A group

of Police officers moved up into South Stand to remove some Notts supporters

who were       shouting         abuse   at    Liverpool fans.            All    that I could smell was

alcohol,       people      were     wet      and    sweating         heavily    clearly      a     lot    of    the

supporters were drunk and intent on violence.                             A lot of the ones in shock

were sitting on the floor, they looked harmless and we left them.                                          People

were rushing about with buckets of water, giving people a drink from paper

cups.

By this time I had got close to the goal and I could see the size of the

problem, bodies were laid about everywhere but someone seemed to be helping

everyone, Doctors, Police Constables or ambulance with each.                                      I could hear

the Public       Address System but                it was         impossible   to hear what was coming

over,    the noise was immense.                Our cordon broke up as an announcement went

over    to    clear   the       ground,      I can't be sure            I heard    this or someone just

passed it along.

Chief Inspector Price sent two or three Police Constables to find drinking
                                                  -   8   -




water     for    the    Police      Officers.         I       remember   him     saying    these    Police

Constables      are     in shock as well,         they         are   going to need water soon and

plenty of it.          How right he was.

I can't remember the scene at the fence too well at all, even though I was

there for some time.             All I can remember is people were vindictive to the

Police.     People started to leave the ground slowly, their heads half turned

back like ghouls wanting to have that last look.                          My thoughts weren't very

charitable      towards     them.      I was taking the opportunity to snatch a drink

myself now as I looked around to see if I could help anywhere.                             I spotted my

own Inspector from the Training Department,                          Inspector Purdy.       He had lost

his cap, he looked dishevelled, he was tired out, I could see that.                                I asked

him how he w a s , as he did m e .

I heard the radio shouting for officers to clear Leppings Lane, there was

fighting    outside.        Inspector Purdy quickly got three                    serials    together,    I

don't think that          the officers belonged to that serial, theyjust formed in

to help.        They were instructed to move                  the    Liverpool    fans    back out into

Halifax Road.          I stayed with Inspector Purdy trying to cear the fans out of

the back of Leppings Lane terracing.

They were bitter          and very angry towards us.                 I remember one       saying to us,

"I'm a Liverpool          PC, you want to learn about crowd control."                      I didn't say

anything to him I just tried to avoid him, I put it down to shock.                             Although

I did think what idiot would go and stand in that lot on a day off, he can't

be right in the first place.

We met     one Police Constable,          tall,       slim bloke with a black moustache                 (I

don't know him).          He was openly crying, really distraught, all he would say

was,    "Why wouldn't they move back?"                A Doctor came up to us and said this

man was in shock, he shouldn't be left alone, can't someone stop with him.

The Doctor was in a similar state himself, but he was still managing to keep

going.     A Police Officer joined the distraught Police Constable and we saw

them walk back in the direction of the gymnasium.                          I was in something of a

daze myself by this time and I made my way back to the gymnasium.

I heard radio messages to the effect that there was fighting in Hillsborough

Park but many units responded and no further assistance was ordered.                                I went

back to the North Stand to re-group, as we anticipated being used for many

other duties that day.

I can    recall    sitting   around       for   quite             some   time   in the North Stand and

eventually      being    briefed,     I    think             by     Chief   Inspector    Beal.      Chief

Superintendent Mole came across the pitch towards us and I think I heard him

say to get these men off home,             they have done their bit for today.                      I was

only    too glad   to go,    but    because      I was very familiar with the                     football

ground and its duties I went round to the gymnasium to see if I could help,

but    things   looked    very   organised       and              considering    the   enormity    of   the

situation I considered it looked a very professional set up.                             I retired from

duty at approximately 6.45 p.m.

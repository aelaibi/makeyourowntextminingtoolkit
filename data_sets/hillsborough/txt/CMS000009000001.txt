        Dear

        Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan which has been
        passed to this Department in view of our responsibilities for
        the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay
        in replying to you.

        Z enclose a list of all relevant legislation and guidance on
        Safety of Sports Grounds dating from the Wheatley Report of
        1972.  They are available from Her Majesty's Stationery Office
        bookshops.  Your nearest HMSO is at 49 High Holborn, London
        WC1V 6HB.

        1 hope this information is of use to you.

                                                                              Yours sincerely

 PITCH INVASIONS - SATURDAY 29 FEBRUARY 1992


 The pitch' invasions which took place at Birmingham and West
 Ham on Saturday were unfortunate examples of the type of
 hooligan jsehaviour that the police and the clubs have worked
 with considerable success to prevent.

 Such behaviour spoils the enjoyment of the match for the vast
 majority of supporters, endangers the safety of the crowd and
 does nothing but harm to the game's reputation.

 I understand that the Police will be examining videoevidence
 of the pitch invasion at the Birmingham match andexpect to
 make further arrests.

 Under the Football (Offences) Act 1991 it is an offence to go
 onto the playing area without lawful authority or reasonable
 excuse. The courts have powers to prevent those convicted of
 this offence from attending further matches at home and
 abroad.

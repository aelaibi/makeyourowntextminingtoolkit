              I am a married man and live at that above address.                   On Saturday 15

              April     1989/^1
                              went to Hillsborough Football ground in Sheffield to
                                                                           O f T
              see Livej^pool play Nottingham Forest.  I have always been a Liverpool

              supporter, and I travelled                 the match with my father

                            in his car.                bought my £6, Leppings Ln ticket from
n    53<a
              Anfield.       We didn't stoi/ anywhere en route to Sheffield,              but there was
                 CA=T                                    J                ,, ,
              a traffic tail back oftF the motorway at Hyde near Glossup which

              delayed us f or/abotatr 45 minutes.            We arrived in Sheffield at about S.

              30pm (1430),/and parked about a myle from the ground in a side street.



              We a r r i v e / at the ground at 2\X5pm (1445), and there was just a mass
5 . 0 . a.
    i- (      of pe\^l/ at the Leppings Ln^end,              the   crowd was growing all the

              time.     I saw one Policeman o^fhorseback who was in the crowd, and there

                      were     two Policemen standing in Leppings Ln,       but I saw no stewards.

                      At first we had trouble finding that turnstiles,          there were no

                      direction signs so we asked a Policeman and he told us to join the

                      crowd at the/entrance, and we had trouble entering the ground, as

                      there w a a 4    crush outside.    I didn't enter through a turnstile,       I went       ,

                         through gate C, the folding blue gate that was open from the

                             de, but I didn't see anyone open a gate.        Nobody asked to see my

                      ticket, when we wenjrthr ough the gate,       but I've thrown it a w a y .

                      Inside the grounjjfv I saw the tunnel, with 'Leppings Ln standing'            over

                      i t , I went do^m the tunnel and there was a crush in the t u n n e l , but I

                      saw no Police,       or stewards at all, and at the end of the tunnel        I went
                      Im.
                      left    i n i / Pen 4.   It was about two minutes to three at the time,       the

                      players were warming up on the pitch.         I was with my father at this

                      time, and at this time I was actually in a crush in the pen, and there

                      were people trying to get into the ground behind us.           I actually did

                      although he was above me, which may make that a little more than it

                      should be, he was heavily built with dark short hair,          he was wearing a

                      to push him off the barrier,        but it was futile,   because of the crush

                      shoulders.      I let go of him, and he flopped over the barrier,         I turned

                      to my father, and the person he was holding was much in the same state.,

                      We got out of the pen, at that and I can only say the man I tried to

                      help, was dead.       The person next to the one I tried to help, was the

                      one that my father tried to help,         I would say that he was in his mid

                      fifties,    wearing   a red Liverpool top, deeply tanned,    grey hair,

                      slightly balding      at the front.   I was aware of a young lad next to       him ,

                      with the barrier      across his chest,    he looked up at my father and said

                      Help me" I don't      know what happened to him,    they may have been

                      together.      I could possibly identify the person I helped, and the man

                      next to him,    in the red shirt.



                      We left the around at about 3. lOpr&Zt 1510),      of our own accord.      There

A                -    was bad Police organisation oiy^he outside of the g round, there were

C Q M M f r J T no directions given, a n J tb^re was no stewards             inside the ground.

                      Also due to the traffic congestion getting to the ground, all the fans

             a       . arrived at the same time at the ground.



     X       \        When I was helping this man, who was being crushed,         I remember     looking

                      up, and I could see above me in the seating area,         standing at the

                      bottom of the aisle was a high ranking police officer, he was wearing

                      a flat cap, with a chequered band, and a radio on his lapel.              He was

                      looking directly down at us and had his arms folded,         people were

                      shouting up at him, some with outstreatched arms,         to help them, and

                      get them out of the pen,      but he just stood there, and did nothing to

                      help.   When    the match was stopped, myself and my father were sat on a

                      wall, and a Policeman ran onto the pitch, and was signalling to a box,

                      in the corner,    of the terracing at the Lepping Ln end,      but I couldn't

                      say what he was saying.

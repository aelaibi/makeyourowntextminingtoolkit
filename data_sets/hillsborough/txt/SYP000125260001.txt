  DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

  (2) MINOR INCIDENTS WHERE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS RAN DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE

  PITCH AND SHOUTED ABUSE AT FOREST FANS IN SPION KOP.   THIS WAS AT A TIME

 WHEN FANS AT OTHER END HAD BEEN KILLED/INJURED + FOREST FANS IN SPION

| KOP WERE UNAWARE.

  G53

  DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

  AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?
                                                                               PAGE        8
                                                                               QSN51

 THE PUBLIC BROADCAST SYSTEM WAS VERY POOR.        NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT

 WAS HAPPENING.     AT FIRST IT APPEARED THAT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION UNTIL THE

 INJURED WERE BROUGHT DOWN TO THE FOREST END WHEN A BROADCAST WAS MADE IT COULD

 N0TBEHEARD-                                            CcJi-
 W HEN THE POLICE CAME ONTO THE PITCH THEY LINED THE LENGTH OF THE TOUCHLINE.

 ACCESS FOR AMBULANCE WAS BLOCKED BY THE LARGE LIVERPOOL CROWDS ON THE PITCH
               —               — --
 AROUND THE DEAD/INJURED.        THE GROWD_ SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEARED TO THE PLAYERS

 ENTRANCE SIDE AND AID GIVEN BY THOSE TRAINED IN 1ST A ID.       SIMILARLY NO ONE

 ORGANISED SPACE WHERE THE INJURED WERE BEING TAKEN AT THE SPION KOP END.           THIS

 AGAIN BLOCKED ACCESS AND EXIT TO AMBULANCES.

 BOX TO STOP THE MATCH.       I BELIEVE THIS OFFICER WAS OF SUPERINTENDENT

 RANK AND THE OFFICER WHO RAN ONTO THE PITCH AND STOPPED THE GAME.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I DON’T FEEL THAT INCIDENTS PRIOR TO THE MATCH IE TRAFFIC DELAYS ETC WERE

 RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCIDENT.     I BELIEVE IT WAS THE PUSH OF SUPPORTERS THAT

 CAUSED IT.     THAT CAME TO/fHE GROUND JUST PRIOR TO THE START OF THE MATCH.

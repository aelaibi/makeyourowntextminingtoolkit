         Additional police rssc ou rce s from central London
   arrived during this period and the remainder o-f the match
   and s u b s e q u e n t ial dispersal were relatively peaceful.




                                                                          j

          arrestsa At or near the -football ground. Ten of these
          arrests were inside th® ground and were all away
          supporters. O-f the remaining arrests only 4 were home

      Kturnst.il es 'as can be seen -from appendix C . All the damage
       \occurred in areas occupied by Birmingham City -fans.

          Background to the Match

12                Du.rina the pr esent 1988/89 season, CF'FC has progressed
          to the ‘P l a y - O f f s ' -for promotion to the -first d i v i s i o n .
          Their su ppo rte rs are boisterous and in good spirits, but
          not disorderly. B irmingham, by contrast tare to be re leg ated
          to the third division, and this match was to oe
          ap p ea rance ~i"n the second d iv i sion. The ou tcome o-f the match
          w* s ~ no co ns eq ue nc e in terms of league position or future
          prospe cts -for Birmingham. Ther© was however a slim chance
          that CPFC might have earned direct promotion to the -first
          division, de pen di ng on tho outcome o-f ths match, and the
          r wswl t Or the Ma nchester City game to b* played on the same
          day.

          Pre-match    Intelligence and Information

 13           CPFC and B i r m in gh am City FC met during the 1987/88
          season. The total g ate was 8809 o-f which &00 were away
          support. There were no arrests, and only 9 ejectments, (5
          home 4 away) but b eca us e o-f a previous his tory o-f disorder
          by Birmingham -fans, the fixture this season was manned by 4
          Inspectors 17 S erg ea nts and 140 Constables, the second
          highest level of manning.

           Pol ice indi cated that the,. II kely nu«W9«rK;:.Pf
           tp „travpl. would be 200 - 600, and the hooligan element*-*®
           consist*** of 30 p«rsQfm.
      O p. 17tii April 1989 further information from West
Midl and s Police indicated that the attendance fay Birmingham
fans would be       about 4(200, many in fancy dress. Normally
only 300 - 400 fans travel away with the clu.b. The
Bi r mi ng ham home match total gate h a s =only averaged about
5EG0 ( ie« home and away support > fi copy of a poster being
displayed in Birmingham, calling for all fans to attend a
"Football Fancy Dress Party" was also received.

           On the 25th of April 1989 further information from
the West Midlands Pol i ce indicated that between two and
three thousand tr avelling support known as the ''Birmingham
Z u l u s ” may travel to London overnight on the 12th May 1939.
Many with the intention of causing damage to Brixton
Under gro und Station. The information was passed to Brixton
Police Station but it was assessed as unl ik e ly to occur.

       This additional information coupled with the request
for the "Fancy Dress" support indicated that the o v e r a l 1
a way support may reach 6,000. The information was
u nco nfirmed and in any event this number is easily
ac com mod at ed in the Compou nds set aside for away support.

      Liaison with Crystal Palace Football Club secretary Mr
Alan Leather was re gu l ar ly maintained up to the match date
by Chief Inspector Per ry (Operations) and his dedicated
football liaison officer. There was no additional crowd
information gained f rom the club or other source not
alr eady covered in this report,

       It was known that the vast majority of Birmingham
sup po rte rs would travel by coach or train. Qn 11.05.89 we
were informed that 8 Birm ing ha m coaches would be coming.
Early on 12.05.89 the number was increased to 15, and later
in the day to 23 coaches. A total of 29 known coaches
attended the vicinity, and a further unknown number set
down further away from the stadium, primarily in the
vici ni ty of licensed premises. Of the 29 known coaches,
only 12 attended the coach marshalling point at Purley Way,
Purley^for escort by police to the stadium. In consequence,
a large number of supporters, travelling on foot, were late
arriving at the st adi um many of them having spent much of
the afternoon drinking.

      Due to industrial action in connection with overtime
 working, which p a rt ic ul ar ly affected Sa turday services on
 British Rail, times of arrival were unpredictable.
Pp„u cg_S_tateQy

      Following di scussions with Crystal Palace Football
Club, it was agreed that Bir mingham supporters were to be
ac om mod At sd in Compound 3 (standing) and Blocks R-, S, ?< T
in the Arthur Waite Stand. This allocation would cater -for
the away support that could be anticipated.

     Poli ce strategy -for this match, based on the
assessment that a large but primarily good rvatured crowd
would attend accompanied by a small hostile element, was to
identify the latter and keep them under close supervision,
dealing with them by way o-f ejectment or arrest as
necessary.

      It was agreed with CPFC that, at the end o-f the match,
CPFC were to be allowed to come onto the pitch and stand in
-front o-f the Directors Box to applaud their team. Police
intention was co nse qu ent ly to allow CPFC fans onto the
pitch but to prevent Bi rmingham -fans -from doinci likewise.
Plans were made to strengthen the policing in -front of the
Birm ing ham compound to prevent their incursion onto the
pitch, which it was believed could lead to a clash between
rival fans.

      The strategy also included the maintenance of a
ste rile area between CPFC and Birmingham supporters in the
seated area of the Arthur Waite Stand ( Block U >, and a
similar sterile area at the botto m narrow end of Compound 3
(Bi rmi n g h a m ) „

Pre-hatch Briefing

     Police units were assembled prior to the match at
Whitehorse Manor School, Charnwood Road, S.E.25 which is
about 500 metres from the football stadium.

     Chief Superintendent S.A. HUBBARD was in attendance at
the briefing  and in overall command (Gold Control).

     All officers were briefed by the deputy match
commander Chief Inspector PERRY and at their designated
posts immediately following the briefing.

     The 85 Club Stewards employed at the match were
briefed on the stra teg y and the latest information
following the main briefing, by the sergeant in charge of
the Forward Reception Point (situated at the rear of
Compound 2). Particular instructions were given to those
employed in and around Compound 3.
          In view of the delay s in the arrival fans at local
stations, officers on duty at the main local station
(Norwood Junction), who were also to be re-deployed inside
the ground shortly after the commencement of the'match,
were directed to remain at that station- It was also
necessary, due to the number of fans still travelling
towards the ground on foot, to keep all mobile units
pat rolling outside the ground. Mounted Branch officers were
also still deployed outside the ground after the
c o m m e n c e m e n t , both escorting fans from Norwood Junction
Railway Station and preservi ng order on the turnstile
queues.

     At about 2.53pm a fight occurred in Park Road between
rival supporters. A Bi rm ing ha m fan was rendered temporarily
unconscious. First Aid was rendered and an ambulance
directed to the scene by St. Johns Ambulance service. One
arrest was made. The victim regained cons cio usn es s and
declined further medical aid.

            Kick off was on time at 3pm. A large vociferous and
boister ou s crowd of about -3,100 Birmingham fans was present
in Compound             the torrace ttllocatwd to thSffl ^ GSnflri f Y

est im a t e s . ttt the time of kick-off, Or uups of Birminofiam
fans were still waiting at the turnstiles at Compound 3, or
making their way to the ground.

      Sho rtly after 3pm. Compound 3 ( Birming ham ) appeared
to be reaching capa ci ty ( 3331 > but there was still a
large crowd outside, with more fans still arriving. The
sterile area at the front of Compound 3 was given away t«2
siidbls those late comers (many genuine fans) to be
ac commodated without being crushed. Although there was
amp la room, the middle uf Litis cnmoouna was packed tightly
by the row dy element, mliu felled to need polic e and
stewards advice, and it was feared that a downward movement
may rw^ult in some crush injuries.

     The Inspector in charge of the turnstile serial was
directed to transfer the waiting fans from the Compound 3
turnstiles to the tu rnstiles for the seated area allocated
to Birmingh am ( R, S, ?< T ) in the Arthur Waite Stand. A
foot duty serial was re -deployed from Norwood Junction to
assist on the turnstiles. Mounted units also assisted.
      A request was made by Police to the CPFC stadium
manager ° n the club radio -for additional turnstiles serving
-•lock* R, S,   T to be opened, since only 3 of the 8
availab le turnstiles were operating. The Birmingham
supporters outside who had. ant ic ipa ted paying £5.00
enter Compound 3 were aggriev«d by having to pay £3.00 to
enter the seated area. At one point, the turnstiles were
rushed with fans entering the ground without payment.

      Eventually, the majority of Birmingham fans entered
the ground. In order to release the bulk of manpower
engaged outside the ground, for re-deployment inside,
appr oxi mat el y 50 were allowed through the main gate into
-he rear of Compound 3 without payment. Further coaches
arrived at 3.2Spm and other Bir mi ngh am fans were still
making their way to the ground as late as 3.49pm.

       At about 3 . 10pm. in the Arthur Waite seated area, CPFC
fans from Block V and Bi rm ing ha m fans from Blocks R, S, 3/ T
®ntf ^ ed Block u    a n ^ a fight took place. This was brief and
,ighting was stopped by Police deployed in Block U.
Additional Police units were deployed to Block U to support
the of ficers there.

     ^i"'o r ^ Y before 3.11pm crowd pressure in Compound 3
(Birmingham) caused concern for the safety of some of the
younger fans assembled at the front. The compound has a
^ 9" high steel barrier fitted with a 2' gap to enable
people to get on to the football pitch. The inspector "at
the location fearful a f crushing injuries should the rowdy
eiament surge forward began removing yo ur *t ars from the
Compound to the safety of the perimeter track.

     At -i.llpm Crystal Palace scored a goal and the feared
surge took place in Compound 3, Although there were minor
injuries, the majority,of su ppo rt ers succeeded in their
intention^to invade the pitch. Units deployed in front of
Compound 3 and adjacent frontage of the Arthur Waite
enclosure were insufficient to prevent the incursion onto
the pitch and were temp ora ri ly overwhelmed.

     The Bi rm ing ha m support moved across the pitch to the
front of the Arthur Waite Enclos ure to the location of the
Crystal Palace non -members support. Between the pitch and
the enclosu re a.re low advertising hoardings and many
children and young fans positioned here were faced with
these ho stile agg res si ve away fans. They were u n a b l e _to
immediately retreat into the Arthur Waite Enclosure and
they too ran onto the pitch.
     Beth r'olice and Stewards recognised tha* th<=>sf» f^ns
had had to move onto the pitch or face injury and therefore
no s.-rort were made to intervene or restrain at this point
By now rhe game h* d stopped and the pi avers and officials
left the pitch.

     So™.e   t h ~ Ei rmi ngham fans then climbed over into th*=
Arthur Waite enclos ur a and began fighting with Crystal
Palace fans. Others remained at the barrier ( recently
lowered after Hi llsborough > where they were        by rpF1"
supporters. A number o-f CPFC supporters got over the"
barrier onto the pitch and fighting between fans ensued.

     Virtually all the injuries sustained by Police and
supporters occurred during the initial invasion and
subsequent fighting. Ten arrests were made.

       First Aid was rendered by St. Johns personnel and
their am bulances were used to convey the injured to Mayday
Hospital. Further ambulances were requested from the London
Ambulance Service (L.A.S.) by St. Johns in a subsequent
message at 3..39pm. which intimated that persons were
trapped and that a, major accident situation had
de vel oped.(This in fact was not the case). As a result of
this message and another ( timed at 3.58pm ) routed through
the L.A.3. a Fire Brigade rescue vehicle attended the
ground. A total of 14 persons were co nveyed to Mayday
Hospital. A Police ca su al ty reporting team was dispatched
to the hospital.

     Mounted units were called into the ground where they
crossed the pitch to drive supporters back into Compound 3
and the Arthur Waite enclosure.

     When the match stopped Chief Superintendent HUBBARD
went immediately to liaise with the Club Chairman Mr R
NQADES she arranged a Personal message from the Chairman to
encourage the fans to return to their compoun ds and also
for both club Managers to appear on the pitch and appeal to
their fans.

     As a result of these measures the fighting stopped but
it took another 10 minutes to clear the pitch."in all. the
game was interrupted for about 25 minutes. Play resumed at
about 3.37pm.

     Immediately following the start of the pitch invasion,
New Scotland Yard was contacted and a request made for
additional Police units from the Central London Reserve to
attend Selhurst Park. They began arriving whilst play was
still suspended and were deployed inside the stadium to
support the serial at the front of Compound 3 and the
Arthur Waite enclosure.
          Further re ini or cem ent s continued to arrive after the
     resumption of play, and were used to reinforce the units at
     the edge of the pitch, and in the sterile are* C Block U >
     cf the Arthur Waite Stand seated area.

            Following the resumption of play, the atmosphere was
     still tense. During the invasion of the pitch, a l a r g e
     number of Birmingham fans had infiltrated the Arthur Waite
     enc l os ur e adjacent to Compound 3 and many of these climbed
     or were pulled up by other Birmingham supporters into the
     seated blocks R, S, and T and a sterile area was formed
     between them and the CPFC fans in the remainder of the
     enclosure.

           ^t some time prior to 4.20pm, a small wicket gate
     between the? top of Compound 3 and the stairs leading down
^    to the adjoining section of the Arthur Waite enclosure was
P    forced by Birmingham fans and an unknown but large number
     of them entered the Arthur Waite enclosure in front of the
     seated blocks R, S, T . The wicket gate was r e —secured by
     stadium staff, and is to be bricked up permanently.

60        At 4.32pm a number of seats were broken in Block R, S,
       T < Birmingham ) and the debris thrown at Police and CPFC
     supporters. A CPFC supporter was injured.

61         The sterile areas and the front of the Arthur Waite
     and Compound 3 was hea vily reinforced by Police. At the end
     o-F the match, mounted units were again brought forward to
     support the officers on foot. As planned, CPFC fans were
     allowed onto the pitch and were cleared by stewards.

62         The ground cleared quickly of CPFC supporters, but
     Bir mingham fans did not move from their positions until
     about 3 - 10 minutes after the final whistle. Outside the
     ground, a v e r y heavy cordon of Police had been established
     at the junction ou tside Compound 3 to ensure segregation of
     supporters leaving the ground. The dispersal was peaceful.

63          By the end of the game, it is estimated that the
     Bir mi ngh am supporters in the Arthur Waite Stand and
     en cl osu re numbered ap p ro xi ma te ly 2,000 with approximate!y
     3,500 in Compound 3. and a further 500 in other parts of
     the stadium, making an estimated overall total of 6,000.
64       Immediately -following the dispersal Chief
     Superintendent HU BBARD held a de-brief W i t h the Club
     Officials and later that evening with all the -serial
     commande rs at South Norwood Police Station.'

     Con cl us io ns

65        None of the fence s at Selhurst Park are higher than
     3'9" it is theref ore impossible without excessive police
     presence to prevent determined efforts to invade the pitch.
     It is clear that on Satu rda y 13th May 19S7 some Birmingham
     followers had that sole intention.

Barrier Modification   ( Fosfc Hi IIgborouoh   )

     Alth oug h a number of mo difications to barriers were
made after Hillsbo rou gh the only two of co nsequence were to
the Arthur Waite enclosure, where the barrier along the
front of the enclo su re was lowered by 15" to a new height
of 3'9", making access to (and from) the pitch considerably
easier. The second m od i fi cat io n was the removal of two
strands of barbed wire, supported by angled metal
stanchions, along the entire frontage of the Arthur Waits
seated area. This allowed Birmingham supporters who had
infiltrated the CPFC home non-members en clo sur e to climb or
be pulled up into the seated area reserved for Birmingham.

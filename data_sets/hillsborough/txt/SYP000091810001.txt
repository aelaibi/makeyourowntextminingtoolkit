              On S at u r d a y    15       il    1989    (150489)    I went     to the F.A.        Cup Semi Final

              Football                  b et we en Liverpool     and Notts        Forest.      I am a Liverpool

              suppo r              I got my ticket          from a friend.            It was a £6 standing

              ticket     for Leppings            Lane.     I tr av el le d to the game with           10 other      lads

              most    of who       I know their f i j ^ ^ f ?ame and nothing              else.      The   only one      I

              really know          is                          If—" (He has been seen).

              We all     t ra v el l ed    in a Mini Bus.        We     stopped on the M ot o r w a y for our

              breakfast.

              we got to S h e f f i e l d at about           1300 - 1400 hrs.           (1300)-(1400)       We   parked

              the van about             hadf an hour walk from the              ground.      We had a qu/fck drink

              in a local                , and then made       our way to the match,

              On the way \7p M>he ground                 I saw fans     drinking      from   cans             stp ^ e t s

              but    it was       nothing    unusual.        1 do not        remember   seeing man            ice

    O f fi ce rs     on the way to the ground.

    We a r r i v e d at the ground at about                    1                      hrs     (1445)--( 1450) .

    There were n o queues                 .just a mass        of    people.        I joined     in the    crowd

    a nd was       be i ng crushed as         I m oved towards            the.turmit i 1 e s y 7 1 saw a few

    Police Off ic ers             on horse    back trying           to corwjpol/theyz^rowd.              I did not

    see any Police O ff icers                on foot or any Stewards.

    I did not see any               people    climbing         over    the walls          to get    in the ground,

    I was       grad ually moving           forward until            I got to the turnstile.                 As    I

    went    into the turnstile               I went       to hand my ticket               in and the turnstile

    o perator        said    I     was at the wrong turnstile and should go to the                                next

    one.        There was no way           I could go back out.                   I was    being     squashed

    ag ai ns t     the turnstile.            1 told him            I could not go back.              He then       let

    me    in,    did not take my ticket and                    there was some             one straight       behind

    me so he must            have    been    letting everyone              in.

    As    I went through the               turnstile and           into   the      ground    I was    caught- up in

    a big       c/owd and had no choice                 but to go with them.                 1 went down the

    tunnjft / / e n     t hough at the time               I   did not      know      I had gone down a

    went    towards         the    terraces       I could see the           pitch and        I was    propelled

    straight         down the       terrace       in Pen 3 a n d / s t o p & e d at the         position      I have

    m a r k e d as    1 on the       grid.        The m a t g K h a g j j / s \    kicked off and        I was

    crushed a nd        could not move.

    A fter a few minutes              people       started being sick and falling                     down    in the

    crowd.         I was     being    pushed about and               I could feel          people u n d er ne at h my

    feet.        There was         nothing    I could do to help them.                     At one    time there

    was a surge and               people    fell     down     I lost my balance and was                falling

    until       I grabbed hold of someone and stopped m y s e 1f f a l 1 i n g .                          I know

    that    if I had fallen down                  I w ould not have           got up again.           I could not

        out a nd after           a while the          pressure       eased a bit.             I saw a man       lying on

        the   floor and          he said to me             ’Get my kid o u t 5 .           His kid was       partially

        lying on top of him but his                        leg was    trapped by other              people     lying on

        top of it.         I tried to          pull        him but    I could not.             Then some       other

        people    pulled him up and he was                     crying       but    seemed all        righyt.

        A few m inu te s         later      I got out of the           gate and ont,£ [Vhe piAch.

        I saw a girl        that      had     come     in the van wit h Ime. /She was                     crying because

        she   could not find her boyfriei>d.                         I went/to          lapk for him.           I could

        not see him so           I h e l p e d to      g^tVry people (to/tn/ othet>-^nd of the g round

        on the a d v e r t is in g     hoardings,

        I made a few journeys wit h p / o p l e .                     The       one that     sticks      in my mind was
                                  /
        a m an   in his middle 4-Q*s                         was about 6 foot             tall       He had          bee r

        belly.      He had short            ha i/I          < qpi. ng grey.            He might     have    had a

        moustache/
M^u-S
        I cannot     remember what             he was wearing,              but he had a hairy              c hest.

        Wh en we got to the            other end of the ground with this man we                                put him

        on the    floor and a P o l i c e m a n             came    over and started to give him heart

        m a s s a g e . He tried for a few minutes and then a s ke d                             if he was a

        relative     of mine and            1 said no.             He then said he was              dead.      He then

        flung    his hat down and we both burst                        into tears.

        After    I had     carried the           last one          down there was a line                        l ce

        a cr os s the     pitch.       I went         back    to the Leppings Lane                end                  ound

        and e ve nt u al l y found all               the    people who          came    into t i ^ / g r o u n d wij

        We all    sat down and wa it ed until                      about    170Q hrs        (1700)      w he n we    left

        the   ground.

        We went     out t hrough the N orth Stand.                         We    could not find the            van

        because     the    driver      had gone            to get    petrol       and    could not       get back      to

        w he re we where.

        We sat and w a it e d and the van                    came    back about 7 pm             (1900)     and we then

        t r a v e ll e d back.

             I did not witness          anything    I w ould   consider    to be a criminal       offence.

             There were        ryot enough Police O ff ic er s    in the ground to     cope w i t h this

             tr ag ed y and the ones       that were there were        very badly organised.

             I think        that   the Liverpool    s upporters   should have    been given the       larg

             H op end of the ground.

             I did not need to go to hospital              or to the      doctors.   The   only    injury

             had was a cut on my hand.

              B efore making my statement                  of fact       relating        to the    incident       on 15

              April     1989 I wish to say that                  I have     performed duty at S e m i - F i n a l s at

              Hillsborough           since    1966 and       in that year          I. did duty at all          the World

              Cup matches           in the    stadium.        For    eight years I worked                in the    police

               room at all          first    team games avid         S e m i - F i n a l s (1966 to      1974/75).

              On S a t u r d a y    15 April       1989 I reported         for     duty at 9. 0 0 a m at the

               gymnasium       in the H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground.         All Specials were             responsible

               to   Inspector Sewell           of    ’F * Division.          After       the general       briefing,

              S pecials      duties were a l located as A p p endix                  *R*    of the Operational

              Order,     and were          taken up between          11.00am and 11.20am.

              As a Senior Super v i s o r            I covered       sections. A, D, E arid F, that                    is   the

               n o r thern area -- Halifax Road and M i d d l e w o o d Road                     including Harries

              Road.

              C o m m a n d a n t Mar t i n was     responsible        for .Langsett Road,            N e e p s e n d and

              Penisto ne Road             to the    south of the ground.

               In the     course      of    carrying       out these duties          I    came    into    contact with

               supporters          of both Clubs.          But    by far     the    larger       number    came from

              Liverpool.            The    q u e stion first asked          by the major i t y was          ' W h e r e ’s the

               nearest     p u b * , w ith the early a r r ivals             this was       no different          to    last

               year.      In for a few d r i n k s and on to the                   ground by £.30.            I would say
                                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                                          R250

that this happened with a lot of                       supporters         this year,,       in-fact by 2.50

P e n istone Roa d was almost                 deserted.

At about       1»45 I was        on M i d d l e w o o d R oad with SDQ Lomax and we saw

Liverpool        supporters        queueing       outside a beer-off wait i n g                  to buy    cans

of beer,       then sitting         on bonnets         of    cars drinking          before       replenishing

supplies,       a l t h o u g h at this time we did not                  see anyone who was             drunk.

We heard       radio     t r a n smissions       of trouble        in a public        house       in Wadsley

Lane.

1415 we       returned to P e nistone Roa d via Leppings Lane and at that                                      time

L appings Lane was            fairly busy but            the    crowd a p p eared to be orderly

aro u n d the turnstiles.

The m ain problem at             the P e nistone R oad end was                from vehicles          that

should have          parked     in the        official car       park.     The gates were           closed

at    1400 hours.         Some were           direc t e d to the     car park at the             rear     of the

gymnasium.

Just after 3.0 0 p m          I received a radio message                   requesting all           officers

a v ailable     to the Leppings               Lane   end of the      ground as       s pectators          were

invading       the    pitch.       As   I     entered the playing          area the        players        were

leaving the field.'              On arrival          at the     fence at the L e p pings Lane                  end

I helped two or three young                     people      over   the    fence,,     Then       I climbed

onto    the wall       and    called to the           s u pporters at the           rear    of N o » 3

enclosure        to ease      back so as to relieve                the    pressure     on the       people at

the    front.        This was      totally       ignored and         infact    pressure          increased

and the       crowd a g a i n - s u r g e d    forward.        A gain    I requested them to ease

back and       I was     told by one man             in the     crowd that a man was               dead    in

front    of him.         This was       in the a rea of the              damaged     barrier.           This was

the. first       intimation        I had of the seriou s n e s s            of the situation,              i

helped a sergeant             to lift         two or three         casualties       through the         gate

and they were          passed to other            officers who were waiting                  to    carry them

onto    the    pitch.        I don't        know who     the officers were.                The    sergeant
                                                                                                       PAGb.        3
                                                                                                       R25Q

then a s k e d me to mobilise more                   police    officers      to    carry    casulaties,,

Of f icers     standing        about    on the       pitch were      e ncouraged to move            over to

the track        in the vicinity of the gates onto                        the terrace.

T hen the      fans who were           not    injured decided         to    charge across        the    pitch

toward the Kop.               A line of officers            were    in position across           the width

of the       pitch and the Liverpool                 fans were      persuaded to move          off     the

pitch.        Some     started      fighting        among   themselves.           1 broke    up one such

fight      between two youths who                 had been drinking.

'.[ was    requested to take as many S p e c i a l s as                   possible    to the area

behind the West S t a n d by Chief                   Inspector      Sumner    of    ’F*    Division.         About

10 Specials wit h some               regular        officers     formed a barrier across               the

tarmac area from the gate                    in    the central     wall    to the    stairs     from the

West Stand.            Some    supporters          were   leaving    the ground at          this time        and

one or two were           critical       of the       police     for opening        the gate.        At this

time      two Liverpool         supporters          possibly members         or officials        of the

S u p p o r t e r s Club said they would assist with the movement                            of fans.

When      the a n n o u n c e m e n t was made       over   the P.A.       system that       some    fans had

been      injured and         requesting          fans to stay where they were               to a l l o w for

movement       of    casualties,        this       was a signal      for the West Stand to

empty.        Quite a lot of abuse                 was hurled a      the thin blue          line but

nobody flinched and the two Liverpool                          men did a good job.             When the

crowd      cleared we stood down awaiting                     further      instructions. During              this

time we a s s i s t e d with the             flow     of ambul a n c e s into.the main drive at

L e p p i n g s Lane    end who were          to move the        bodies     laid out       in that area.

After a s s isting wit h the movement                     of Fire Service          vehicles    we all

returned       to the N orth Stand to                 await    further instructions.

The mood       of the fans          generally         was   good,    the belligerance          came from a

lot of the younger              people who          had quite      obviously been drinking.

Mot aware        of actions         of stewards.

I did not        recall       any   breakdown of          communications.

In my opinion as now more                    supporters are travelling           by their own

transport        rather        than train or coach,          such matches       should    be held on

Sunday.        This     does away with the drink                problem and     certainly      goes a

long way to al l e v i a t i n g        the traffic        problem,

I wish to make an observ a t i o n                of the    police action and this             is not a

criticism.          It a p p e a r e d to me that        some s u p e r visory officers with

serials moved           into action as          individuals       leaving the officers          of

their     team not        knowing what         to do,    this   has   lead to some       of the      press

comments.

              Before making my statement                   of fact       relating          to the    incident       on 13

              April      1989 I wish to say that                 I have      performed        duty at S e m i - F i n a l s at

              Hillsborough         since      1966 and       in that year            I did duty at all           the World

              O n S a t urday     15 April       1989 I reported for                 duty at 9 . 0 0 a m at the

              gymnasium       in the H i l l s bo r o u g h Ground.                All   Specials were        responsible

              to     Inspector Sewell           of     *F * Division.         After        the general      briefing,

              Specials      duties were all o c a t e d as Appendix                       *R * of the O perational

              Order,      and were        taken up between             11.00am and 11,20am„

              As a Senior S u p e r v i s o r          I covered       sections          A, D, E and F, that          is      the

              northern area - Halifax Road and M id d l e w o o d Road                             including Herri.es

              R oa d .

              C omma n d a n t Ma r t i n was        responsible        for Langsett Road,              N e e p s e n d and

              P enistone Roa d to the south of the ground.

              In the      course     of    carrying       out    these     duties         I came    into    contact with

              s upporters       of both Clubs.             But    by far the             larger    number    came    from

              Liverpool.         The      q u e stion first asked by the m a j ority was                      "Where's         the

              nearest      pub',     with the early arrivals                   this was no different                to last

              year.       In for a. few drinks and on to the ground by 2, 30 „                                  1 w ould say

that this        h a p pened with a lot of supporters                       this year,      infact        by 2 .50

P e nistone Road was almost                    deserted.

At about        1.. 45    I was      on M i d d l e w o o d Road with SDQ Lomax and we                   saw

Liverpool        supporters           queueing     outside a beer-off waiting                    to buy        cans

of beer,        then sitting           on bonnets       of    cars    drinking      before       replenishing

supplies,        a l t h o u g h at this        time we did not see anyone                 who was        drunk.

We heard        radio      t r a n smissions      of trouble         in a public         house       in Wads l e y

Lane..

1415 we        returned to P e nistone Road via Leppings Lane and at that                                          time

Leppings Lane was               fairly busy but           the    crowd a p p e a r e d    to be orderly

ar o u n d    the turnstiles,,

The main        problem at           the Penistone Roa d end was from vehicles                           that

should have           parked      in the       official car park.            The gates were             closed

at    1400 hours,,          Some were          directed to the           car park at the         rear         of the

gymnasium.

Just after 3. 0 0 p m           I received a radio message                   requesting all            officers

available        to the Leppi n g s            Lane   end of the ground as s p ectators                       were

invading        the      pitch.       As   1   entered       the playing     area the       players           were

leaving        the field,,           On arrival       at the     fence at      the L e p p i n g s Lane            end

I helped two             or three young          people      over    the fence.          Then    I. climbed

onto     the wall        and    called to the supporters                   at the   rear    of No.        3

enclosure        to ease        back so as to          relieve       the    pressure      on the       people at

the    front.         This was        totally     ignored and         infact    pressure         increased

and the        crowd a gain surged forward.                     A gain     I requested them to ease

back and        1 was      told by one man            in the     crowd that a man was                 dead     in

front        of him.       This was        in the area of the damaged barrier.                          "Ihis was

the    first     i n timation         I had of the        seriousness         of the situation.                I

helped a sergeant               to    lift two     or three         casualties      through          the gate

and they were             passed to other          officers who were waiting                    to    carry them

onto     the    pitch.         1 d o n ’t know who        the officers were.               The       sergeant
                                                                                                          PAGE         3
                                                                                                          R250

then asked me         to m o b ilise more           police      officers     to    carry    casulaties.

Officers       standing about          on the       pitch were         e n couraged    to move      over to

the    track    in the vicinity of the gates                     onto    the terrace.

The n the fans who were               not injured decided to              charge      across the          pitch

toward the Hop.            A line of             officers    were in position across the width

of the     pitch and the Liverpool                  fans were      persuaded to move            off the

pitch.      Some    started         fighting among         themselves.            I broke    up one such

fight    between two youths who                  had been drinking.

I was    requested to take as                    many S p e cials as     possible to the area

behind the West SStand by Chief                     Inspector Sumner        of    9F 9 Di v i s i o n .    About

10 Specials with some                regular       officers      formed a barrier across                  the

tarmac area from the                gate    in    the central     wall     to the     stairs     from the

West Stand.         Some     supporters           were   leaving       the ground at this time                  and

one or two were          critical          of the    police      for    opening     the gate.        At this

time two Liverpool            supporters           possibly members          or officials         of the

Suppo r te r s Clu b      said t hey w o u 1d ass i s t wi th t he mo vement                  of fans.

W hen the a n n o u n c e m e n t   was made over         the P.A.        system    that     some    fans had

been    injured and        requesting            fans to stay where          they were       to a llow for

m ovement      of   casualties,        this       was a signal         for the West Stand to

empty.      Quite a lot of abuse                  was hurled a         the thin blue        line but

nobody flinched and the two Liverpool                           men did a good job.             Whe n the

crowd    cleared we stood down awaiting                      further      instructions.         During          this

time we a s s i s t e d with         the flow of a m bulances             into the mai n drive at

Leppings Lane         end who were           to move      the    bodies     laid out       in that area.

After a s sisting wit h the movement                     of Firs Service           vehicles we all

r e t ur n e d to t he    N o r th S t a n d to awa i t fu r t h e r i n s tructi o ns »

The mood of the           fans      generally was        good,    the     belligerance        came from           a

lot of the younger            people who had quite                obviously been drinking.

Not aware       of actions          of stewards,,

I did not       recall any          breakdown of         communications.                                   ^

In my opinion as now more                     supporters      are   travelling       by their       own

transport         rather       than train or         coach,    such matches         should be held on

Sunday.         This      does away with the drink               problem and        certainly goes a

long way to a l l e v i a t i n g         the   traffic     problem™

I wish to make an ob s e r v a t i o n of the                 police ac t i o n and this           is not a

criticism.            It a p p e a r e d to me     that some su p e r v i s o r y officers with

serials moved             into action as         individuals        leaving      the officers        of

their    team not           knowing what        to do,    this has       lead to some        of the       press

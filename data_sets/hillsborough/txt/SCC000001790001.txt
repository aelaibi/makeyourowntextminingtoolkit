           Dear Sir

           Hillsborough Disaster


           Thank you for letting us have a copy of the news release together
           with the series of helpful documents set out in the Index that
           you have kindly provided.

           We have taken the liberty of writing to the Secretary to the Inquiry
           to notify him of our interest although we imagine that you will
           have done likewise.

           We have sp©ken to Mr Richard Maxwell QC and his tentative view is
           that there is no need for him to attend the Inquiry on the opening
           day.  He is having a word direct with Mr Murphy to confirm that
           that is a satisfactory arrangement.

           We have passed to Mr Murphy the papers that you have provided
           under the cover of a short Brief asking him to attend at the
           Legal and Administration Department to meet with Mr Gregory and
           Mrs Bashforth at 10.30 am on Friday the 28th April.

            Yours faithfully

            Dear Sir

            SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD

            I believe that you contacted my Chief Superintendent Baker this morning
            in order to seek clarification about the contents of my letter to
            Mr G Mackrell, Club Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, on
            29 April 1989* Your concern was the identification of various areas
            which appeared unsafe. The statement in my letter to this effect was
            based on comments made by Dr Nicholson, Research Director, at the Health
            and Safety Executive, Services Division, Broad Lane, Sheffield, who, no
            doubt, will be able to help you more precisely. However, I wish to
            point out that it is your responsibility and that of the Club to
            ensure that all areas of the ground are safe and neither myself nor
            Dr Nicholson can be held liable for providing you with an exhaustive
            list of potential safety problems.

            I do hope this is of assistance to you.

            Yours faithfully

                                                    Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975

                               I am aware that as a result of the Hillsborough tragedy the
                        conditions attached to the Safety Certificates at the two football
                        grounds in Sheffield are to be reviewed.   The Courts Committees
                        in South Yorkshire have recently met to discuss the implications of
                        the Hillsborough events, and in particular, the possibility that the
                        removal of fencing within grounds may lead to an increase in hooliganism
                        and offending inside football grounds.     Clearly an increase in
                        offending has implications as far as the court is concerned and
                        contingency plans with regard to sentencing policy and planning of
                        courts need to be put in hand.

                               In view of this I would be    grateful    if I could be given an
                        early indication of any policy changes that you intend to introduce
                        in respect of the Safety Certificates in question.


                                                           Yours sincerely,

  Dear Mr. Webster,

  Now that the evidence has finished being heard at Lord justice Taylor's inquiry,
  Assistant Chief constable Jones of West Midlands Police has advised me that the
  ground is likely to be released back into my custody within the next few days.

  I would, therefore, welcome a meeting of the working party in order to discuss
  how the ground should operate for the commencement of the season, prior to the
  interim report of Lord justice Taylor being published.

  I look forward to hearing from you as soon as convenient.

  Yours sincerely,

          Hillsborough - Inquiry by DPP


          Thank you for your letter of the 24th August.

          I will be happy to represent any Council Officer or
          Council Member whom the Police may wish to interview
          as part of their criminal investigation.  I think
          the only matter of relevance that you need to know
          at the moment is that I will be on holiday from the
          7th to 21st September.

          I agree with you that it is unlikely that proceedings
          will be taken against Council Officers and even more
          unlikely that they will be taken against Council Members.
          However, I think it is a very prudent move to have any
          such individuals represented.

          Yours sincerely

Bear Mr Webster

Safety at Sports Grounds

I refer to your letter dated 21 August 1989 which we have already discussed
on the telephone and, as I mentioned, it would be impracticable to invite a
representative from the Local Authority to every meeting which is held
between the Police and the Football Clubs.  Some of these meetings are
arranged at an hours notice and the discussion may only last for 10 minutes
or so.

You will remember that I mentioned a meeting to be held between the Police
and the Local Authorities in South Yorkshire on 18 September at which the
points you make in your letter could be considered further.

Yours sincerely

 14 September 1989


 Dear Mr Podmore

 Mr Morris, the Chairman of the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal,
 has written to the Lord Mayor raising the question whether
 steps should be taken to cease fund raising in view of the
 amount that has been contributed to the fund.  As our three
 authorities, together with Liverpool Football Club, sponsored
 the appeal the decision to close the fund ought to be made
 by us.  For this purpose do you think a meeting ought to be
 arranged and if so, would it be perhaps appropriate for this
 to be called by the Lord Mayor of Sheffield?

 Yours sincerely

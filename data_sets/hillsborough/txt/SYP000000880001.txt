there were about              three Police O f f icers                on trie ticket- barrier who                   told

us all       to move        back    to the        other    end of the Station,,

As we m oved          back    to another           exit     some       of us star t e d         togo t h r o u g h

early for me to go                 into      the ground        so    I went     for a walk        round       to see

if I could see any of my mates,                           I saw a good few of them                    but   they

were all       getting        on buses and             going     to the C i t y Centre,               I was    just-

walk i n g    round     looking         for       a shop or a          Chippy        to get     s o mething      to       eat,

1 found a shop and                  got a         tin of Coke          to drink,,

It was all           good humour          that     day,    1 walked          round    the ground and           talked

to some Forest S u p p o r t e r s and even                    the Police,           I did not        see anyone

who was       drunk or an y o n e            causing any a g g r a vation,

on the         track    side and        they were         just w a l k i n g    round,,

I took up a position                   i n P e n 3 rou g h 1y about          eight     feet away            from the

m ain     fence.        The    time was          st.il 3. about                 , the re was         plenty of

room to move about                   I w ould     say    it was about          two thirds          full.

I wa l k e d     back    through the             tunnel    in order          to use     the    toilets        and     to

hear      the Liverpool              Supporters         singing and          dancing       inside    the      ground

and those         outside       the     ground were            joining       in to.

After        I had my tea            I star t e d to walk         back       down the       tunnel         I was    abou

three        quarters     of the way             down the       tunnel       in fact       I had    nearly

reached         the    terracing        at    this      time    both teams were             on the         pitch.         I

knew that         they were           on the      pitch by the         sound     from the          crowd,

It w a s        at    this     point        t h at     the      crowd suddenly            moved        f o r w a r d , the     only

thing       I can          remember         is    the      roar    from      the   crowd and            being      pushed       and

shoved          everywhere            and    people          saying      to me     do y o u      think we w i l l             get

collapsing             through         being         pushed and          shoved.          I think         I must      have      been

near       to    collapsing            when       two      big    fellas       they     l o o k e d as      though      they

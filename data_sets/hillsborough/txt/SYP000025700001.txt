Dear Sir,
                             Hillsborough Enquiry
In the light of the critisism directed at your officers from
Liverpool    Supporters   I feel I should point out the behaviour
of these fans in this area and on the M63 Motorway on the
morning of the semi-final.
From 10.30am on the morning of the match they were:-
1) Abandoning their cars in the central lane to urinate on
   the grass verges.
2) Consuming vast quantities of drink,including the drivers.
3) Discarding the empties through car windows.
4) Running from car to car to replenish their stocks.
5) Shouting obscene abuse at any unfortunate lady who
   happened to be on the Motorway.
At the end of the motorway near my house they stopped at our
local off license to re-stock and to urinate in adjacent
gardens.
Whilst I would not suggest that the innocent victems of
Hillsborough were drunk I would think that there were many in
the crowd who were not in a fit state to handle the nightmare
that was to follow, plus the fact that at 1.30 fans were still
passing our house with no hope of arriving at Sheffield in good
time to gain admittance.
Yours sincerely,

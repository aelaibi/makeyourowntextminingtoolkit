/ r              were wearing                 scarves,             others              Liverpool          sh irts.           They       were          also

             chanting               Liverpool               songs.                They       were     not      causing        any       problems.




             We      continued                along         Marl cl i f fe              Rd,    crossed           Middlewood             Rd    into        Leppings

             Ln.          There          was     a    number            of        people       around,           but    I    was       quite          surprised              at

             the      s m a 11       numbers.



      /y     Wh e n       we       arrived           at    Leppings                Ln    entrance           we    stood       inside          the       main

             entrance               gates        waiting               for                    to    a r r i ve    wi t h     our       t i ckets




             While         wax 1 1 n g         for                           I    overheard          a    mounted           Policeman             asking        the

             fans         m illing            around          to       farm        a    queue       and     go    into       the       ground.           He     also

             approached                  us    and        asked         us        if    we    were       waiting        for       someone.              We     said          we

             were         and       he    left        us      to       it.




             Once         1 4 Q0     hours           arrived,                it   A ot       busier       outside           the    tu rn stiles.                I

                   w ou l d say there was approx                  two to three         hundred     people        outside    the

                            a rr i v e d at about          1405 hours,          We    obtained          r tickets,        chatted

                   Once    t -h ro ^h the       turnstile,          I knew the        d i r e c t i o n to go.    I bought a

                   pro/ran/ie and went             d i r e ct ly to the stairs            leading       to the West S tand

                            ig.      B e t w e e n the    tur ns t y l e s and the       stairs     I saw a small          number

&    j    ^    ‘          arts also       several        S t e w /r ds and Policemen.



                   Once    u p s tairs     there was        two S t e wards      who     directed       us to our seats

                   w h i c h were     four     rows from front and almost                   behind goal,          Row 4,

                   numbers        80.81.82,      as      i n dicated on map shown to me by POL PC

                   (/Ie f N o             )(Ex No                 >„



                   Once    in our       seats,     nothing        u n t oward h a p p e n e d   until    after     kick    off.



                   All    of the Stands           in the ground that              I could see were             full    except     for

                   the    sta nding a rea         to my      left



                   I saw the         k i ck off take        p l a c e and                                es    later    I noticed

                   a f ew s up p o r t e r s    c 1 iinbi ng f rom ti>          ens    below     onto    the     pitch.     I

                   thought      at    first     they we re^-J y? n ,      invading       the    pitch or there were a few

                   too m any and they w o u l d be m oved                   to the stand         on my    left.



                   Then    there      see m e d to be a continuous                stream o f /people           going    onto     the

                   pitch,     also a number              of fans were        coining fj^crn the         standing are a up

                   j,n t o the seating          area.       The     people who jirere coming             from the standing

                                                                                                                       £52106

        are a were         saying,       "There are          people      dead down there."               Several       minor

        d is ag re e m e n t s    took    place,       but     I didn't          take any     notice     or get

        involved,          due to having my young                   nephew wit h me.



        I then noticed             people       pulling        down the a d v e r t i s e m e n t     boards   and at

        this stage          the Notts         Forest      fans      starte^rto          chant.      I don't    recall

        what    was a c t ua ll y        chanted but           it effused quite a number                 of Liverpool

        fans a l r e a d y on the             pitch to       ^urqe      f o r w a r d towards      the S p i o n Kop end,

        This     caused a large               group          P o l i c e me n    to form a cordon         right across

        the w id t h       of the         t ch / just        past the           halfway    line.      The Liverpool

        fans    then m o v e d bac        w    to their        own end.



        I co n t i n u e d to talk to                        to keep him d i s t r a c t e d from what was

        happening,          although          I myself       did not know at              this    stage what was

        happening.           I was       unsure at this             stage whet h e r        the match would

        continue,          or whet h e r       to stay or go home.



        F r om where        I was    I could see             large        crowds on the       pitch,     I noticed          lots
   a.
        of    people       giving    heart massage and                    trying to assist          injured.       I    also

        saw    lots    of    people       being       st r e t c h e r e d awa y    in all    directions       out      of the

        pitch.



        There a pp e a r e d to be             less    people       on the        pitch and at this         stage       I

        noti c e d several          bodies       lying       down wit h         their     faces    covered.       I

        b e l i ev ed them to be dead.                   One    of these          bodies    I noticed      in particular

        was    I think was a white a dult male,                          he had a red and ye l l o w scarf

        covering       his       face.

/ V-h

        I b e l i e v e _______ also          seen this         body 1 and        he a sked      if we   could go home.

        I s poke      to                 an d we      decided to         1eave      to go h o m e .
                                                                                                 PAG E    5
                                                                                                 SSI 06



As we w a l k e d out, of the      gang w a y area there were P o l i c e m e n a d v ising

people    to make      their way       out.     We exited       the   same   route as we entered

and w al k e d back     to my s i s t e r '5 ’house.



                                        been stop p e d a n d    I was    talking    to              he

                           le toilets.          I took     him to the entrance            of the men's

                         to the        right   of a snack       bar.     1 not i ced about three

                iple helping      t h emselves      to crisps and drinks.             These youths

          der   teenagers,       I cannot describe           any of them.



I w o u l d also    like to add        that at    intervals after m a t c h had been

stopped,     there was      several       announcements         requesting       people    to    leave

the   pitch.       This a nn o y e d me     because     there was       so many    people trying

to help     injured and       there was        so man y    people      on the    pitch there was

n o w h e r e f o r t h em t o g o .



As we were walking          home along L e p pings Ln at               traffic    lights,       I saw a

m a n who a p p e ar ed to be very drunk,             shouting,        "Murderous Basta r d s . "

I can say from what           they were        saying     they were      blaming    the Police.



I just    ignored him and         continued to my sister's address.

me were         in serious       trouble    the sheer        volume     of their       presence         in pens

consider are            vital    to the judicial          inquiry.

             I a t t e n d e d the   c o r r e s p o n d i n g # ? i K t u r e last year,     the w hole P ol ic e
                                                             ---------------------
             operation        last year wasyfar           superior         than the o p e r at i on      1 w i t n e s s e d on

             the   15th April,          198jSr (150489),          I think the           imbalance      of tickets      was

             a nother       factor ajio that was a res pons ibi 1 ity of the football

             asso c iat i o n ,



             Finally        I consider a lack of c o m m u n ic a ti o n b et w ee n P o li c e Officers,

             club Ste wa rd s and the football                   club    itself was         vital   factor this

             manifested        itself    by a p p e a r i n g    that the P ol ic e O f f i c er s       not d ir e ct l y

             i nvolved       in front    of the      pens were          c o m p le t el y   ignorant    of what was

             happeni n g .


                                                        ((Aa j < ^ 6 * & * Q
             I also thi nk a l a ck of P ol ic e Ofj^Tcers and S te w ar d s at the head of t h e

             tunnel     was    important,       had thejr been there they                    could have     p re v en t ed

             people     rushing      through,      I jfl so feel a lack of k n ow le dg e                h a m p e re d the

             P o l i c e Operations.

Thank you for your letter of 15 October. I attach copies of the three ‘missing’ pages 41,56
and 102 from our print of Mr Phillips’s report.


I will speak to the police about the videos. But I would be surprised if the position were not
as they described it, that you would need the permission of the copyright owners.

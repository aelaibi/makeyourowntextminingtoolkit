Dear Mr Johnston
WEST MIDLANDS POLICE HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY                           ; i: ~
Before commencing his leave Steven Walker asked me to prepare an account of
the West Midlands Police involvement in the enquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster with a view to assisting in the formulation of a submission, on
behalf of the Police Authority, to Counsel for advice on the question of
funding responsibilities.
I enclose a draft of my recollections for your consideration and would
welcome any comment you may care to offer on its suitability for the purpose.
Early comment would be appreciated as I commence two weeks leave on Saturday
5 August.                                                       .
Yours sincerely

                                  DRAFT

Following the events of Saturday 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Football
Ground it is within my knowledge that the Chief..Constable, Mr P Wright OBE,
on Sunday 16 April 1989, decided that an independent enquiry into the
policing arrangements for the FA Cup Semi-final was necessary in view of the
implications of the tragedy in respect of the liability of the South
Yorkshire Police.     On that day Mr Wright publicly announced the Home
Secretary's approval to the appointment of Mr G Dear, Chief Constable West
Midlands Police, to undertake the enquiry.
On Monday 17 April 1989, the Home Secretary announced the intention to hold a
public enquiry dealing with the deaths of spectators at Hillsborough Football
Ground on 15 April and announced the appointment of Lord Justice Taylor to
preside at the Public Enquiry.
On that day I was appointed by Mr Peter Wright, Chief Constable, to be the
official Liaison Officer between the South Yorkshire Police and Lord Justice
Taylor in respect of the arrangements for the impending Public Enquiry and
between the South Yorkshire Police and the West Midlands Police Enquiry Team
in respect of their enquiries within the South Yorkshire Police area.
On Tuesday 18 April 1989 Lord Justice Taylor visited Sheffield and, at a
Press Conference held at Police Headquarters that day, he announced the terms
of reference for his Inquiry and also announced that Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief
Constable, West Midlands Police, would be undertaking the necessary enquiries
and reporting direct to himself. The announcement was fully recorded by the
media.   Present at that press conference were Mr Geoffrey Dear and Mr -J M
Jones, Assistant Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police.
On Wednesday 19 April Mr J M Jones again visited Sheffield in company with
Chief Superintendents Pemberton and Foster and Superintendent Taylor of the
West Midlands Police, They visited Hammerton Road Police Station, the base
for the Major Incident Enquiry Team appointed by South Yorkshire Police on 15
April to co-ordinate all enquiries into the incident, and informed members of
that team that the West Midlands Police would be taking over all aspects of
the enquiry.    The South Yorkshire team were instructed to not pursue any
further enquiries into the incident but to continue to update the Holmes
Computer System, being used for recording details of the event and subsequent
enquiries, with information already obtained up to that date.
                       *


On Thursday 20 April 1989 Superintendent Taylor of the West Midlands Enquiry
Team assumed control of the incident on behalf of West Midlands Police and,
at Hammerton Road Police Station, took control of the South Yorkshire Police
Incident Room Staff, suspending all enquiries by South Yorkshire Police
Officers. On the same day West Midlands Police officers took control of the
Hillsborough Football Ground Security and access to the ground was restricted
by those officers.
On Saturday 22 April, on the instructions of the West Midlands Police, the
updating of the Holmes Major Incident Computer System by South Yorkshire
Police personnel under the supervision of Superintendent Taylor was ceased
and the computer data base, relating to all South Yorkshire Police actions
and enquiries in respect of the Hillsborough tragedy, was dumped to tape and
the tapes handed over to officers of the West Midlands Police Enquiry team.
On Monday 24 April all documentation gathered by South Yorkshire Police
Incident Room staff and relating to enquiries into the Hillsborough incident,
including all exhibits (clothing and property taken from the deceased etc.),
all audio and video tapes recorded by South Yorkshire Police during the
incident at the football ground, and all records relating to deceased persons
were handed over to officers of the West Midlands Police Enquiry Team.
Subsequently, on 24 April 1989 a team of West Midlands Police Officers, under
the command of Mr J M Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, were accommodated at
Furnival House, Furnival Gate, Sheffield, and commenced enquiries amongst all
witnesses and interested parties, into the events of the ill-fated FA Cup
Semi-Final.   Similar enquiry teams of West Midlands Officers were based in
Liverpool and Nottingham and the West Midlands Enquiry is controlled from
Neechells Police Station at Birmingham where the HOLMES Major Incident
Computer System was and remains based.
No interviews of potential witnesses or of any person connected in any way
with the events of the Semi-final day were conducted by South Yorkshire
Police officers after Wednesday 19 April 1989 Other than those enquiries
necessary amongst uniform and Civilian staff of the South Yorkshire Police in
order to prepare a record of events for the purpose of briefing Counsel
representing the Chief Constable.     Any potential witnesses coming to the
notice of the South Yorkshire Police, were re-directed to the West Midlands
Enquiry Team.                                       ....

During the first few days of their enquiry in Sheffield, West Midlands
Officers requested additional information from the South Yorkshire Police
including a number of policy documents, files and working papers relevant to
the planning of football match policing and discussions with the Local
Authority, the Club and other agencies regarding the implementation of
football ground safety procedures and the Safety Certification required by
legislation.   Those requests were for original documents where relevant to
preserve the primary evidence rule should the material be ultimately required
in an evidential context.    Certain items of this material remain in the
possession of the West Midlands Police at the time of writing.
It is significant to note that the documentation etc. 'seized' by the West
Midlands officers was, in many instances, directly relevant to the needs of
the Force in formulating a submission to Counsel appointed to represent the
Chief Constable. Requests directed to the West Midlands Police for return of
documentation, video film etc. for internal South Yorkshire use were subject
to scrutiny and approval by Treasury Solicitors acting on behalf of Counsel
to the Public Enquiry. A copy of a letter, dated 4 May 1989, received from
Mr J M Jones is appended in illustration of that fact.
Further, it was made known informally by the senior officers in charge of the
Sheffield element of the West Midlands Enquiry, that contact between West
Midlands Police and South Yorkshire Police Officers should remain on a formal
basis to preserve the independence of their enquiry.
During ensuing weeks requests were regularly, indeed daily in most instances,
received from West Midlands Senior Officers for the provision of information
from South Yorkshire Police Officers. The majority of those requests were
directed to myself and were in relation to evidence which could be offered to
t h e P u b l i c E n q u i r y by South Yorkshire Officers who were present at
Hillsborough. The involvement of Lord Justice Taylor in directing the course
of enquiries is illustrated in a letter, dated 29 April 1989, received from
Mr J M Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, West Midlands Police, a copy of
which I attach. The collection of evidence from South Yorkshire Officers by
the West Midlands Officers has taken largely the form indicated in that
letter, i.e. by inviting officers to submit their recollection of the
incident in an informal format. At the time of writing, 989 statements of
recollection have been provided to West Midlands Police, representing the
great majority of officers who were on duty at the Hillsborough Football
Ground on the day and others who were deployed to associated duties. All
requests for those statements have been made through me and the statements
obtained have all been returned to the West Midlands Enquiry Headquarters
through my office.
Throughout the enquiry to date the South Yorkshire Police have played no
active part in contributing to the evidence gathering role of the West
Midlands Police other than by responding to requests for information and
directives issued by the West Midlands Police officers in charge of the
enquiry.   Neither has the South Yorkshire Police had any control over the
administrative or logistical arrangements for the West Midlands Police
Enquiry, save for initial negotiations for the provision of Furnival House,
Sheffield, as a base for the enquiry in Sheffield and the provision of some
element of the furnishing of those offices from South Yorkshire Police
stocks.
I am aware that the West Midlands Police have provided for their enquiry
officers transport, in the form of contract hire cars; communications in the
form of BT rented pager units, and accommodation at major hotels in the
Sheffield area.
Apart from initial assistance offered in arranging hotel accommodation during
the first week of the enquiry South Yorkshire Police has had no control over
these arrangements which have contributed in large measure to the costs of
the enquiry.    Similar arrangements were made by West Midlands Police for
their officers based in Liverpool and Nottingham.
Whilst during the early stages of their enquiry I am informed that the West
Midlands Police deployed in the region of 400 personnel to the enquiry, some
150 in Sheffield, this number has been gradually reduced over    the   weeks, but
I am informed that, at the time of writing, 63 personnel are still deployed
in total.   On Monday 3 July 1989 the West Midlands Team vacated Furnival
House and at that time some 15 personnel had been based there.        At the
present time 6 West Midlands officers are deployed to enquiry duties in
Liverpool and Sheffield on a rotating basis, with 2 or 3 officers in
Sheffield at any one time, working from offices provided in the Medico Legal
Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield, the officer of H.M. Cornoner.          The
remaining 57 personnel are based in Birmingham.

Dear Peter
Please find enclosed the four albums of photographs you requested from PC
Greenaway.   With regard to the West Midlands composite albums I am led to
believe that they were assembled by the Treasury Solicitores from photographs
provided both by ourselves and the West Midlands Police. The West Midlands
therefore do not appear to have copies but are enquiring from Bob Whalley at
the Home Office about availability from Treasury Solicitors. I will keep you
informed.
Yours sincerely

 D e a r Mr Wri ght

 LORD        J U S T iOL T A Y L O R ’S INQUIRY INTO THE HIU.SBQBOUGH DISASTER

 I have no w been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
 from a selected number of your officers their’ recollections in writing, of
 what happened at Hillsborough on 15th April 1989. The criterion for
 selection is based on an examination of your operation order which identifies
 those police officers who were likely to be at Leppings Lane end, b e t a
 inside and outside the ground. Counsel are keen to obtain a
 cross-section of accounts well before 15th May 1989 when the Hearings d gin,

 I would like to make arrangements with your liaison officer to receive as
 many written submissions 83 possible. There will be no need for my officers
 to see yours personally, although a proof of continuity will be neccssary
 but I would hope this could be easily achieved through your liaison officer,

 I am also aware that some of your           : icers are still off d u t y sick, which
 might preset ,t prat leal difficult}:..         I would      e to stress that
 C o u n s e l ’s request through roe is not i n t e n d e d a d d to a n y d i s t r e s s that
 some may be suffering. Consequently, 1 leave i t t o your discretion to
 manage this aspect as you see fit. The Police Federation will also have
 an interest and may be contemplating obtaining legal advice on an individual
 or collective basi 3 , or both. To save time, therefore, I have taken the
 liberty of copying this letter to them for their information.

 Th e Invitation to submit writt-   ’ecollections follows the same criteria as
 for the senior officers before; x:, that there will be no interviews, lust
 requests to which the officer will be free to decide what he or       wishes
 to do. In supplying any written submission the officer will       :
 keep a copy.

 I hope this is of assistance to you.     If there is anything f u r u > _     j
 need to know please do not hesitate to contact me. In or -
 and in anticipation of your support, I have asked my Supe> - '            Taylor
 at Furniva.1 House to contact Chief Superintendent Don Dentoi,              .
 m o rning of Monday 8t h May 1989 to discuss arrangements.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S INQUIRY - REQUESTS FOR COPY INFORMATION ETC

            We have received a number of applications for copies of documents,
            videos, photographs etc, in our possession. The Chief Constable is
            not empowered to release anything without the approval of Counsel who
            have now been appointed by Lord Justice Taylor. In future, therefore,
            in order to avoid delays you may feel it appropriate for any requests to
            be channelled through your Solicitors directly to the Treasury
            Solicitors acting on behalf of Counsel. Treasury Solicitors can be
            contacted through Dr D Brummell at the Home Office, Queen Anne's Gate,
            28 Broadway, London SW1H 9JS, telephone number 01-210-3109.

            Your current requests for copy information have now been brought to the
            attention of D r Brummell and, no doubt, he will be in touch with your
            Solicitors in the near future.

    LORD J U ST I C E TA YL O R ' S INQUIRY INTO T H E HILL S B O RO U G H D I SASTER
                                                                                   i



    I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
    from a selected number of police officers their recollections, in writing,
    of what happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. The reason for my
    request is that I understand that a number of your officers performed duty
    on a mutual aid basis. Counsel are keen to obtain a cross section of
    accounts as soon as possible.

    I would like to make       arrangements as soon as convenient, through a Liaison
    Officer whom you may       care to appoint, to receive these written submissions
    as soon as possible.        There will be no need for my officers to see yours
    personally, although       a proof of continuity will be necessary, but I would
    hope that this could       easily be achieved through your Liaison Officer.

    The invitation to submit written recollections is based on criteria that I
    have already, adopted with South Yorkshire Police officers. That is,
    there will be no interviews Just simple requests to which the officer will
   •be free to decide what he or she wishes to say. When supplying any written
    submission the officer will be free to keep a copy.   I have also oeen asked
    by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, if a copy of
   any submission can be made available; I have no objections nor have Counsel
   appointed by Lord.Justice Taylor.

   In this respect copies of any written submissions can be forwarded direct
   by you to Mr Wright at his Sheffield Police Headquarters.

   It would be helpful if I could arrange for one of my senior officers to
   contact your Liaison Officer in the next few days.

   Attached to this letter is the list of officers who I understand were
   seconded from your Force.

            Forwarded under separate cover is a copy letter w hich I have just

           I am most concerned that when I make an undertaking with you or your
           senior officers that it is observed. It would appear yesterday in the
           hearings that that agreement was compromised as a result of the way in
           which Counsel interviewed one of your officers. It may be, of course,
           that Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police have already agreed with
           M r Andrew Collins QC that the initial submissions could be referred to
           in the hearing. However, I am not at this time privy to such an
           agreement. No doubt, in due course, when Treasury Solicitors reply to my
           letter all will become clear. In the meantime I wi sh to assure you that
           I have always intended to maintain the integrity of our earlier
           agreement.

            SOUTH YORKSHIRE P O L IC E RECOLLECTIONS

           You will recall in the early stages, because of the slowness of the
           supply of written recollections from South Yorkshire Police Officers, it
           was agreed that we would take from them their initial submissions which
           would be later superseded by their signed final versions, after they had
           been checked by their appropriate legal advice. I personally made an
           u ndertaking with the C hief Constable of S outh Yorkshire Police that only
           the final versions would be the ones used in the Public Inquiry and this
           was after discussion with you.

           I am concerned that yesterday an officer was referred to his initial
           s ubmission which contained opinion that had subsequently been removed
           from his final account.     Given the undertaking I made to South Yorkshire
           Police I would hope that this would not happen in the future because it
           was only on that understanding that         we received their information as
           early as we did.

           I have formalised this in writing because this effects our personal
           integrity in the matter. I have copied this letter to the Chief
           C o nstable of South Yorkshire Police for his information.

                      SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE RECOLLECTIONS

    Thank you for your letter of today's date, which we have already discussed.

    Hie main difference between the initial and final versions of the South
Yorkshire Police Officers' statements is that any expressions of opinion were
(as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward) removed from the final
version. As I understand it, Andrew Collins' view is that there is absolutely
no reason for excluding such expressions of opinion when they touch on matters
relevant to the Public Inquiry and that, in the circumstances, there is no
objection in principle to written statements containing such opinions being
submitted to the Inquiry.

      Clearly, in view of the personal undertaking which you have given to the
X M e f Constable of South Yorkshire, Andrew Collins agrees that it would not be
J^propriate to use the original statement for the purposes of the Inquiry when
 this has been superseded by a subsequent statement. However-, what I understand
may have happened in the case of the Officer who gave his evidence yesterday is
 that the original unamended statement was circulated because of the need to
circulate statements to all parties as much in advance of the calling of the
relevant witnesses as possible and because at the time of circulation of the
relevant batch of witness statements the revised, final version of the
statement in question had not yet been received. I understand that in total
there are three cases where this has been necessary: P.C.s Best, Huckstepp and
Illingworth. However, in such cases only the final, revised version of the
statement was given to the press.

    I trust that this problem will not recur in the future.

    I have not copied this letter to the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
Police, but am naturally happy for you to do so.

From:* Chief Superintendent PEMBERTON                 Station:

To:   Mr JONES                                        Date:      17 May 1989


SUBJECT:   COMMUNICATIONS




I refer to your request in which you want a brief report for the attention
of Andrew Collins QC, with regard to "radio logs". There were two methods
of logs used by the South Yorkshire force on Saturday 15 April 1989.
Appendix "A" refers to an extended incident log which was created
throughout the whole force commander control system. This connects any
station with a commander control availability to make an entry on the
extended incident log which related to the semi final policing. The
incident log was created by Superintendent MURRAY under the following
terms of reference.

Semi final - Liverpool versus Notts Forest,

This incident created a recording of all information/incidents relating to
the above fixture.   Groups to note its existence and use are required.
There is an entry timed at 0828 from Superintendent MURRAY indicating that
this message is to be left open as instructed and all messages to do with
the semi final to be entered on this message. The document then is a
printout of the computerised entries made on the f o r c e commander control.
I draw to your attention to one entry dated 1444. This is an entry
inserted at that time from FI Hamilton Road Police Station by Pc BARNES.
 (A statement from this officer is being obtained).    The message recorded
.states "From Superintendent MARSHALL FI, request contact ground to tanoy a
request for people not to push at Leppings Lane entrance". Passed to
Police Sergeant GODARD, ground control.   It is believed that difficulties
in radio communication on the ground control led to Superintendent
MARSHALL changing his radio channel to contact his local police station
for they in turn to contact the ground control by telephone means.

Appendix "B" refers to a second log. This is a ground control log created
again by Superintendent MURRAY and referred to in his statement. As the
ground control commander he identified a weakness through a post match
briefing through the lack of a log during the 1988 semi final.   It was his
intention for this year to create a log which he did and which starts 0800
control operative PS 616 and PC 1035. The log then relates to various
incidents throughout the morning and concludes at 1421 hours.   It is
believed that there is only one tape recording of any radio messages and
that related to the force control room and this Is beiiig transcribed at
this moment but is believed not to possess too much important evidence.
Neither the local sub divisional radio nor the ground control radio were
tape recorded and there are no sound recordings of the messages in that
box.

Actions are well-advanced to obtain statements from the persons involved
in the ground control and should be on hand by Friday at the latest.

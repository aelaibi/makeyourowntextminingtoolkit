Dear Mr Kelly

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

As part of his Inquiry, Lord Justice Taylor is now looking more
widely at issues of crowd control and safety at sports events.
An aspect of particular interest is that of identity cards, and
more especially the type of membership scheme envisaged in the
current Football Spectators Bill.

Lord Justice Taylor is aware, from formal submissions already
received, of the reservations felt both by yourselves and the
Football League as to the merits of such a scheme. He recognises
that striking a balance between catering for the needs of the
responsible majority and dealing with the problem of an unruly
minority is not easy, and is anxious to hear in more detail of
alternative ideas for tackling these problems.  It would be
helpful to know whether you could let Lord Justice Taylor have
written comments about this in advance of any meeting with you
which he might want to arrange.

I am writing in similar terms to the Football League and the
Football Supporters' Association.

                                        Yours sincerely




                                  ’    R M WHALLEY

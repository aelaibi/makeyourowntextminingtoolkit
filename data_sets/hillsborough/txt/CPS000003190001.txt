RE: HILLSBOROUGH

Attached is an update on the latest hearing. Full details o f the disclosure order are
awaited. It has been agreed by the HFSG and the police that I will supervise the
HFSG access to the archive held by the police. This is because neither trust each
other and I am in the unusual position o f being seen as sufficiently neutral.

I hope this sufficient for you for the moment.

George

Mr Croston,

Your email to the Director of 22 July 1999 refers.

I understand there was a PDH in this case on Friday - 3 September. Can you please let me know (by the end of
the week) what happened on Friday.

Thanks.

1.    T/C call to Ann Adlington to ascertain the outcome o f the hearing on 3
September before Hooper J.

       •   6 June 2000: A six week trial will start.
       •   20 December 1999: A three day hearing for (l)argum ent by Clegg QC (on
           behalf o f both Ds) re the admissibility o f the Ds' evidence to the Taylor
           Inquiry and (2) for the defence to consider making an approach to the
           Treasury Solicitor prior to an application to the Attorney General for a
           Nolle Prosequi on counts 4 and 5 (PCOJ and M isconduct in a Public
           Office based on the 'disgraceful lie').
       •   I f the counts 4 and 5 are thrown out because there is no supporting
           evidence in the committal papers, then the HFSG will consider a
           Voluntary Bill with additional evidence.
       •   4 January 2000: the defence will mount a full Abuse o f Process argument
           on all aspects o f the case at a five day hearing.
       •   The HFSG inform me that the South Yorkshire Police have tried to argue
           that a large number o f the documents in the archive are not relevant and
           therefore should not be disclosed. I f true, this would be contrary to my
            advice, that was accepted by ACC Daines, that all non-sensitive material
            should be disclosed regardless o f relevancy, and that sensitive material
           would be separately considered by me.
       •   A t the last hearing the police were said to be asking for a high
           reimbursement for the cost o f disclosure. I am informed that Hooper J has
            ordered that the prosecutor be given full access to all the relevant
            categories with disclosure by photo copying to be done free o f charge.
            The Judge will wish to see a schedule o f all the material said to be not
           relevant. I am awaiting an agreed copy o f the disclosure order.
       •    Hooper J saw all the parties in chambers and asked if there were any
            objections w ith him continuing to preside over the proceedings. There
            were no objections.

I note from correspondence that the private prosecutor has sought to reinstate the charge we discontinued. It is
mentioned in correspondence as being included in 'the indictment'. I have asked for a copy of the indictment for
information.
W e will need to consider whether to take any action and, if so, what that action should be. I shall ask George to
consider this on his return. I should add that we have not received any request for action (yet).

At the first meeting with the AG there was talk of offering an amicus. The
hearing is on 3 September. I now have a submission from HFSG on disclosure
issues more generally (the usual complaints about confidence in the S Yorks
police disclosing the contents of the archive). They invite us to be
present/represented. My initial view is that we should not be there, but
this will depend on whether.we are to instruct counsel as amicus. What is
the position on amicus, please?

We offered the Judge an amicus, but he declined. I see no reason for us to
be represented on 3 September - we have no locus, as far as I can see, and
any dispute must surely be between the HFSG and the S Yorks Police. Why
should we be drawn into it, just because we have advised the latter?

My view exactly. What I did not want to do was to say we would not be there
on 3 Sep only to find that an offered amicus had been accepted1

                       (Prosecution Bundle, Annexe 11, p. 11?), Ct was rejected.


             15,       Tlio latest position i* found in the prosecution letter o f 17'1 August 1999
                       (Annexe B, p. 20) and the Assistant Chief Constable's reply of 2<5|UAugust 1999
                       (Annexe B, p. 12), Notwithstanding tho broad terms of the prosecution request,
                       access to [terns i - 9 l3 offered. Access to privileged material is denied.


             17.      It is highly deairabU that the duty of confidentiality implicit on receipt of Archive
                       material h spelt out and acknowledged. This is # privat. prosecution bought by
                      the HP SO. The nature and scope o f the undertaking and the Identities o f those
                      who are bound by it should be certain,


             I S.     Subject to any material being exhibited at trinl or otherwise passing into the
                      custody afih e Court, all Archive tutorial should be reiumed at the conclusion of
                      tho prosecution.

                      That will placc a coat burden on the Chief Constable which is estimated at £30 per
                      hour + VAT inclusive of photocopying
                      CPS has already dccidcd that taxpayers- money should not be exponded ot* this
                     prosecution. The Chief Constable’, s o u rc e s are ftutded by the taxpayer,


         20.         The Chief Constable is not obliged to allow the extent of access which h is in fact
                     been offered. He should not he ordered to give more or to reUx the conditions
                     suggested unless the prosecution can satisfy the legal ctlteri* for production,


         21.         Any Order of the Court will of c ourse be obeyed.
                     in addition, any comments or observations o f the Court will be afforded great
                     weight.

 Dear M r Enzor,

 R v Duckenfield amiMurray

 Thank you for your letter o f 31 **August the contents o f which are noted. As requested in
 your letter o f 1 September, I enclose for your information a copy o f the indictment, which
 was lodged with the court on 27* August.

 Counts 4 and 5 were put on the indictment after careful thought and a reassessment o f the
 evidence in the light o f the magistrate’s committal. The Crown believes that they are justified
 by even the limited evidence we relied on at the lower court, in addition to the evidence o f

 representations as you saw fit at that time.

        Dear Ms Adlington

        Thank you for your letter o f 31 August 1999 addressed to Mr. Croston. I have now
        received the annexes. Mr. Croston is away from the office at the moment.

        I note with interest that the charge which was discontinued by the Crown Prosecution
        Service now appears in the Indictment. I would be grateful if you would let me have
        a copy o f the Indictment for my information. I would also be grateful if you would let
        me know whether the Indictment has been lodged?

        So far as paragraph 8 is concerned, the Crown Prosecution Service does not intend to
        attend the hearing on 3 September 1999 nor does it intend to be represented at the
        hearing.

        A copy o f this letter goes to Mr. Daines.


        Yours sincerely,

        Dear Ms Adlington

        R E:     A D LIN G TO N v D U C K EN FIELD AND M URRA Y


        Thank you for your letter o f 27 August 1999. Mr. Croston is away from the office at
        the moment.

        I am not prepared to voluntarily disclose either the W est M idlands Police Report or
        the Advice o f Gareth W illiams QC and Peter Birts QC. I refer in particular to Mr.
        Croston’s letter o f 15 June 1999 which contained the reasons. Those are still current.

        In the second paragraph o f your letter you suggest that privilege has been waived.
        Privilege has not been waived by the Crown Prosecution Service and Mr. Daines quite
        clearly says that he is not at liberty to disclose the documents himself. I am not sure I
        understand how you came to the conclusion that privilege had been waived.

        I have also received faxed copy o f your letter o f 31 August 1999 enclosing the
        “matters to be raised by the Crown”. The annexures were not o f course, enclosed.

        At this stage I am unable to comment in detail on the document. The only matter
        which I wish to raise at this stage is in relation to paragraph 5.13. As has been stated
        in previous correspondence, the CPS does not consider that it should advise the South
        Yorkshire Police about its custody o f the Hillsborough archive. The CPS would not
        wish to take over control o f it.

        I am sending a copy o f this letter to Mr. Daines.

        Yours sincerely,

  R v D U CK EN FIELD AND M URRAY

  I am instructed to w n te to you on behalf o f the Crown Prosecution Service. The South Yorkshire
  Police have sought advice from the C row n Prosecution S ervice about the disclosure o f a
  docum ent in their possession which related to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster and which may
 therefore have a bearing on the current prosecution o f M essrs D u ckenfield and M urray brought
 by the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group (“ the prosecutor”). M essrs D uckenfield and Murray
 have been com m itted to stand trial at the C row n Court at Leeds. I understand that the matter is
 listed for a hearing before you on 3 S eptem ber 1999, for issues o f disclosure to be considered.

 The prosecutor has sought disclosure from the South Yorkshire Police o f all docum ents in their
 possession w hich are relevant to the prosecution. The d ocum ent about w hich the South
 Yorkshire Police have sought advice is a report dated 12 April 19990, signed byl
 and a letter dated 23 July 1990, from Sir John W oodcock, then H M C h ie f Inspector o f
 C onstabulary, to M r R ichard Wells, then C h ief Constable o f the South Y orkshire Police. I
 enclose copies o f those two documents.

The report by |          |vas draw n to the attention o f the then D irector o f Public Prosecutions
in 1990, who subsequently sought the advice o f Leading Counsel as to the effect o f its content.
T he advice w as given by you, then a m em ber o f the Bar, in an O pinion dated 27 July 1990. I
enclose a copy o f your Opinion.

The C row n Prosecution Service has considered the report by ]           Hand the letter from Sir
John W oodcock intends to advise the South Yorkshire Police that they should be disclosed to the
prosecutor. B ecause the present Director o f Public Prosecutions form erly acted for Mr
D uckenfield, he has taken no part in this decision. Follow ing the usual practice o f the Crown
Prosecution Service, they also intend to advise the South Y orkshire Police that the documents
should be disclosed to both the prosecutor and the defendants at the same time. This advice will
extend to the report by             land the letter from Sir John W o odcock alone. There is no
suggestion by Crow n Prosecution Service that either your O pinion, or any o f the associated
correspondence, should be disclosed to either the prosecutor or the defendants.
   I have been instructed to write to both the prosecutor and the defendants, inform ing them o f the
  existence o f --------------- 1report and Sir John W oodcock's letter enclosing a copy o f each. The
  C row n Prosecution Service also wishes me to draw to the attention o f both the prosecutor and
  the defendants that I have w ritten to you in the terms o f this letter; and preferably, to send to
  those concerned a copy o f this letter.

 I sh ould be pleased to instruct Counsel to appear before you on 3 S eptem ber to provide such
 assistance as you w ould wish. I have not yet instructed C ounsel in that capacity and should be
 grateful to know your reaction to the proposal before doing so. The C row n Prosecution Service
 is anxious that I should write to both the prosecutor and the defendants as soon as possible, and
 certainly before 3 September, but did not want to do so w ithout first draw ing the matter to vour
 attention.


I should w elcom e any com m ents that you might care to m ake on the suggestion that I should
instruct Counsel to appear before you on 3 Septem ber; and on the letter that I intend to write to
the prosecutor and the defendants in advance o f that date.      I should add that the Crown
Prosecution Service will ensure that           ISir Geoffrey Dear, Sir Clive W hitm ore and Sir
John W o odcock are all inform ed or toe disclosure o f the two docum ents in advance o f that
disclosure taking place.

A D LIN G TO N v D U CK EN FIELD AND M URRAY

I am instructed by the Crown Prosecution Service in connection w ith certain aspects o f the
disclosure o f documents held by the CPS and the South Yorkshire Police to the parties to the
private prosecution currently proceeding against M r Duckenfield and M r Murray, arising from
the circumstances surrounding the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.

I write to give you notice that the CPS and the South Yorkshire Constabulary have taken the
decision to disclose, in the interests o f justice, a copy o f the report made by          In
April 1990 recording a conversation that he said had taken place between you and Lord Justice
Taylor in April 1989, immediately following the Inquiry's visit to the Stadium.

The CPS and South Yorkshire Police also intend to disclose in the interests o f justice a copy o f
a letter dated 23 July 1990 sent by Sir John Woodcock to the then C hief Constable o f the South
Yorkshire Police, recording a meeting held on 20 July 1990 between yourself and Sir John
Woodcock, then HM Chief Inspector o f Constabulary, in which the                       Report was
outlined to you and you were invited to respond. That letter also records Lord Justice Taylor's
responses to the allegations in a separate meeting on the same day.

I enclose copies o f the two documents for your information.

Disclosure will be made to both the private prosecutor and to solicitors for the two defendants
in time for a pre trial hearing due to be held on 3 September 1999.

                SUBJECT:     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - 15 APRIL 1989


                    I have to report that on Tuesday, 18 April 1989. having been
                    cancelled from a ________________________________ at
                                     I was deputed to work a duty of 9-00 am to !?,UU pm
                    driving the black Staff Granada motor vehicle. My initial duty was
                    to attend at the Police Headquarters, Sheffield, and to be at the
                    disposal of Lord Justice Taylor and the officers from West Midlands
                    who were coming up to conduct enquiries into the Hillsborough
                    Disaster.

                    Together with the other Staff car, I attended at the Midland Train
                    Station to collect Lord Justice Taylor, and conveyed him' to the
                    Police Headquarters for a meeting with the Chief Constable.  Later
                    that date, I again transported Lord Justice Taylor to Hillsborough
                    Football Ground in the black Staff Granada.   I waited outside the
                    stadium for his return, together with the other Staff cars and
                    after he had received a conducted tour of the Leppings Lane end at
                    Hillsborough Football Ground, he returned to the vehicle, briefly
                    speaking to the press that were gathered outside, prior to again
                    sitting in the rear of the car.

                    At this time he was joined by Mr Dear, the then Chief Constable of
                    West Midlands Police, both men being seated in the rear of the
                    Staff car.  Prior to the vehicle setting off back to Headquarters,
                    Lord Justice Taylor and Mr Dear started a conversation, which I
                    clearly heard, Lord Justice Taylor saying to Mr Dear, "I SUPPOSE
                    YOU REALISE THAT TO GIVE THIS INQUIRY ANY CREDIBILITY WE HAVE TO
                     APPORTION THE MAJORITY OF THE BLAME ON THE POLICE?"        Mr Dear
                    acknowledged this by saying, "I SUPPOSE WE DO.” I then drove them
                    around to Leppings Lane where Lord Justice Taylor alighted from the
                    vehicle for a short time to look at the turnstiles, before
                    returning to the vehicle - after which both gentlemen were returned
                    to Headquarters.   The general conversation throughout this journey
                    revolving around the logistics of setting up the Inquiry and where
                    they were going to site their offices to run the Inquiry from.

                    During the course of my duties that day, I also transported the ACC
                    of West Midlands, Mr Jones, to Hammerton Road Police Station, where
                    the Incident Room was.

                    On concluding duty at 6.00 pm that night, I returned home and
                    discussed the conversation I had overheard with my wife,
                                     and although angry at the time about the comment
                    that was said, I decided there was little point in submitting a
                    report about this matter for what good is it - a mer e          word
                    against an eminent Judge and a Chief Constable - and I believe that
                    little   good  would  have come    out    from me   disclosing this
                    conversation prior to any Inquiry that was being made.        I was
                    however so annoyed that to left off steam I did mention it to my
                    close work colleagues for although     I realised an official report
                    would have no ultimate benefit, what I needed wasclose friends to
                    realise what an injustice was likely to be done.

However, having discussed this matter recently with Superintendent
Bettison, I feel it only right that the record be put straight.  I
still believe that no one will take my word against the other two
gentlemen but pass the information for your consideration.

I have been asked to treat this matter in the strictest confidence and
I will do so.

NOTE FOR FILE:


DISCLOSURE


Was contacted by Peter Metcalf this date concerning the above, who said
that on reflection he thought it would be wrong and perhaps even dangerous
for me or South Yorkshire Police to "consume its own smoke" regarding the
disclosure.

His view is that this matter ought to be considered by someone other than
the South Yorkshire Police as it may indicate possible criminal offences,
for example, ’conspiracy to pervert the course of justice' or 'misuse of
public office'.

Mr Metcalf suggested that one way forward would be through Mr Wells who
has been uninvolved in Hillsborough, then possibly through the Chief HMI
to another Chief Constable, who may take Counsel’s opinion or deal with
the matter as he sees fit.

I told him that I regarded his comments above as absolutely confidential
to me as Acting Chief Constable as his client and he agreed this was so.

Th a nk you very m u c h for coining to see me today about                       this
matter on w h i c h you ha v e sought ray advice.


I hav e considered the repor t by                     It ^is dated w      12 April
1990 but relates to an i n c i d e nt w h i c h occurred on 18 April
1989. I assume that ,                   [who was ^
                                                 driving^ the Staff
                                                                  «-a j.j. car,had
                                                                              ,uau
no opportunity to make any note of the fragment of conversation
at the time. Wh e n did he first m a k e any w r i t t e n note ? Plainly
it is vital to assess h o w ac c u r a t e l y             h ea r d and
remembered the precise words u s e d ,since a small d i ff erence in
what was h e a r d or r e c a l l e d may be crucial to the i nterpretation
of what was said.


On the a ss u mption that                 ~| h e a r d and r e c alled the words
spoken a c c urately and that they expressed an improper intention
(and on the further a s s u m p t i o n that two very senior public
figures w o ul d hav e e xpressed such an intention in front of a
third party who was a So u t h Y o r k s h ir e police driver) the
q uestion arises whe t h er there is any prima facie evidence of a
c r iminal offence. I do not b e l i e v e that there is.I think that a
conspiracy to pervert the course of public justice must relate
to the course of actual or p o t e n t i a l civil or c r iminal
p r o c e e d i n g s ,and not to the con d u c t of a n o n - s t a t u t o r y inquiry
set up by the Home S e c r e t a r y . T h e r e is no evidence h e r e of any
bribery of a p u blic o f fi c i a l (see A r c h b o l d ,43rd e dition,volume
2 at p a r a . 24-47) nor w ou l d there appear to have been misconduct
by an officer of j u s t i c e ,since L ord Justice Taylo r was not
appointed by the Home Secr e ta r y to act as a judge in civil or
c riminal procee di n g s    ( i b i d . p a r a .24-49).
It is therefore a m a t t er for you to dec ide w h a t further action
you should take. P l a in l y it w o u l d be open to y o u to consult Sir
John Wo o dcock or Sir Clive W h i t m o r e at the H o m e Office. If you
wished to show this letter to Sir John or Sir Clive,I would
have no objection whatever.

 Dear Sir,

W e refer to r e c e n t t e l e p h o n e d i s c u s s i o n s and,                       h a v i n g r e v i e w e d the
authorities, w e h a v e the f o l l o w i n g comments:


          1.       The c o m m o n law o f f e n c e of c o n s p i r a c y was a b o l i s h e d
                    by t h e C r i m i n a l L a w A c t 1977, sav e s p e c i f i c a l l y in

                    th e c o m m i s s i o n of an i n d i v i d u a l c r i m i n a l offence.

          3.       In our view, the c o n d u c t u n d e r c o n s i d e r a t i o n w o u l d

                   As has been p o i n t e d out, t h e i n q u i r y to be

         Vs

Thank you, again, for your letter of 9 July.  I understand clearly what
you say and can now confirm that there was no original note made of the
conversation in question.

Would you be kind enough to run your professional eye across the attached
letter provided by our solicitors?

The last paragraph suggests that, with a view to the matters being seen
to be thoroughly examined, you might seek Counsel's opinion on the angle
now introduced, which I perceive to be fresh.   This thought is offered,
I'm sure, only in the spirit of canvassing the widest of independent
view.

I am due shortly to go back to |   _____________ | originating the report and
would   like  to  do   so  with   the   maximum     possible   collateral for
open-handedness. I do hope that this final enquiry will not prove the
last straw on the burden of your office.         I anticipate publicity when
I have seen          and we should be seen to have tried our best.




                     &

1.      I hav e b e e n            a s k e d to         advise w h e t h e r           certain       evide n c e in a
report d a t e d 1 2 t h April                    1990 could s u p p o r t a p r o s e c u t i o n for any
criminal          offence.             I     shall       proceed            on   the     assumption            that     the
writer       of    the       report          has       recorded          that      evidence          with      complete
accuracy.


2.      I    hav e       considered                whether            the    evidence           could      support        a
prosecution             for    an o f f e n c e          of p e r v e r t i n g        the co u r s e     of     justice
or c o n s p i r a c y       to com m i t          s uch an offence.                   Perverting         the course
of    justice           is    a        common          law     offe n c e        and    has        been   accurately
described          as    contempt                 of   court          u nder     another           name   (Archbold,
Criminal P l e a d i n g E v i d e n c e and Practice,                             43rd Ed., para.               24-39.)
It has b e e n e s t a b l i s h e d b e y o n d any d oubt that the law of conte m p t
does    not       apply       to       commissions               or    committees             of    enqu i r y    of    the

enquiry u nder the T r i b u n a l s of E n q u i r y                            (Evidence) Act 1921:                   see

at 501       (C.A.).              It    follows          that the e v i d e n c e             c o u l d not support

to   commit         such          an        offence.          The      offence          has     been      defined        as
follows:
        "It is an i n d i c t a b l e offence at c o m m o n law for a publ ic

            i n t e r e s t so as to call for c o n d e m n a t i o n a n d p u n i s h m e n t . "

    o f f e n c e too narrowly).


    4.     In R.      v.    Whitaker            [1914]      1 K.B.         1283     (C.C.A.),             a    public
    o f f i c e r is d e s c r i b e d as:
            "an       officer who d i s c h a r g e s any d u t y in the d i s c h a r g e of
            w h i c h the p u b l i c are interested, m o r e c l e a r l y if he is paid
            out of a fund p r o v i d e d       by the public. If the taxes go to
            s u p p l y his paym e n t and the p u b l i c h a v e an i n t erest in the
            d u t i e s he discharges, he is a p u b l i c o f f i c e r . ” (At p. 1296)
    In       that case           a    regimental           colonel was           held         to    be     a    publ ic
    officer.        In D y t h a m (above),              a po l i c e o f f i c e r was c o n c e d e d to be
    a      public      officer.            In R.       v. L l e w e l l y n - J o n e s [1968]        1 Q.B.         429
    (C.A.     C.D.)     the r e g i s t r a r of          a county court                was     conceded         to be
    a public       officer.           In    the    light      of     these       authorities              and    other
    a u t h o r i t i e s to be found in Russell on Cr i m e 12t h Ed., 361 et seq.

    b o t h p e r s o n s are pu b l i c officers.                 However,        it m a y well be that,
    for    reasons      of pu b l i c        policy,        a person          in   the        position          of   the
    first       speaker         mentioned         in      the      report        is i m m u n e       from       being

    (subject to any i m m u n i t y from prosec u t i o n ) .                      S u c h a p e r s o n would,

       I enclose a bundle o f papers comprising:

        •       letter from Chief Constable South Yorkshire Police to the then D PP of
                4 August 1990;

                Minute from Acting Chief Constable dated 9 May 1990;

                Minute from                 o f 12 April 1990;

                Letter from D PP to C hief Constable dated 9 July 1990;

                Letter from Chief Constable to DPP dated 23 July 1990;

                Letter from Hammond Suddards dated 18 July 1990;

                Counsel’s opinion dated 27 July 1990.

        The issue is whether we should place the minute of 12 April 1990 on a schedule
        for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

        Few people here know about the papers - they have been kept separately in the
        safe. As far as I know, they have not been referred to in the past and form no
        part o f any decision making, recent or otherwise. I would not like to say for
        definite whether the material was seen by counsel who advised in 1990, but I
        doubt it.

        I can not see that the information (assuming it to be were true), would have any
        impact on the case.

        I suggest, as we discussed, that we are open with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and
        that we say we have the item and, if necessary, copy it to him. We will need to
        explain how the minute came into our possession. We will need to consider
        whether any o f the accompanying documentation needs to be mentioned. I think
        it is so unlikely to have any impact on the case that we do not need to bring it
        to the scrutiny’s attention.

     1.    I attach a bundle of papers which upon reading will become self explanatory. Chris
            Enzor’s note sets out the position clearly.

     2.    My own reaction is that we should be open with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and write
           separately indicating the nature of the material in our possession and its import.

     3.    I agree with Chris that the information, even if it were true, would have very little
            impact on the case.

     4.     Before, however, I advise the D irector I would be grateful if you could give an
            indication of the relationship between the CPS and the scrutiny for the purposes of
            disclosure. The nature of M r Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith’s scrutiny is informal but he
            will be talking to witnesses albeit in private.

     5.     Although the decision will obviously be ours at the end of the day,        would be
            grateful for any advice on disclosure. My w orry is that if we do not ther__________
            may (if he is still around) decide to break silence and we will be left holding the
            baby.

     6.     Obviously these papers must have an extremely limited circulation.

Further to the D irector’s letter of 30 July 1 9 9 7 ,1 enclose two schedules showing the material
held by the CPS.

As the Director indicated, the material falls into two distinct parts, the material relevant to
the 1990 decision not to prosecute and that relevant to the recent 1997 decision not to
prosecute.

The schedules are comprehensive and list all the material held at the CPS or viewed by the
CPS. All the material we hold is currently at United House in York. Rather than reproduce
in our own schedules all the lists contained in the W est Midlands Police Report, I have
attached a copy of the master index of witnesses and documents as an appendix to the
schedule of pre August 1990 material.

You will no doubt wish to discuss access to the material. There is one further item which
is not covered on the 1990 schedule, about which the Chief Crown Prosecutor will be writing
to you separately.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely

       D ear Sir

       R E : T H E H IL LSB O R O U G H SCRU TIN Y

       I am writing in connection with recent correspondence detailing schedules of material
       currently held or viewed by the CPS.

       As indicated, I am in possession o f a police report dated 22 April 1990 and associated
       documents stemming from the remarks allegedly overheard by I                   made in
       conversation between the late Lord Chief Justice and a Chief Constable.

       The report does not relate to evidential material pertinent to the Hillsborough disaster.

       I have taken the opportunity to discuss the m atter with the D irector (who is currently away
       from the office) who would,, of course, be happy to discuss the matter with you.
       A lternatively, the material is available for inspection at this office o r can be forwarded at
       your convenience. I look forward to hearing from you.

       Yours faithfully

            M R G E O F F R E Y D EA R IN 1989

    Points fo r Discussion

            A conversation between the above two persons was overheard by                  who was
            their driver on 18 April 1989, three days after the disaster.

                         made a report dated 12 April 1990, which went to the C hief Constable o f
           South                                                     |iad discussed the conversation
           w ith his wife                                ana an undisclosed number o f close work
           colleagues. A the time he was angry at the injustice but decided that he would not be
           listened to. He then discussed the m atter with Supt. BETTINSON (presumably in 1990)
           and felt that the record should be put straight.

           A police file note o f 9 M ay 1990 records a conversation between the ACC and Peter
           M etcalf (Hammond Suddards solicitors), with the latter suggesting that as criminal
           offences could be involved it should go to Richard WELLS, who had not been involved
           in the disaster.

    4.     On 4 July 1990, Richard WELLS wrote to the DPP, Allan GREEN, enclosing a copy o f
           the report, desiring that "truth is served" and requesting advice.

    5.     On 9 July 1990 the DPP wrote back to RW, expressing the view that he did not think
           that there was prim a facie evidence o f a criminal offence. The offences that he
           considered were conspiracy to PCOJ, bribery o f a public official and misconduct by an
           officer o f justice.

    6.     On 18 July 1990, Hammond Suddards wrote to RW with their review o f the law. They
           reluctantly agreed w ith the conclusions o f the DPP, but considered that if there was such
           an offence as "effecting a public m ischief it was committed here, where there was
           deliberate prejudgement o f the conclusions o f the Inquiry. They suggested obtaining an
           opinion from leading counsel.

7.         On 23 July 1990 this letter was passed to the DPP by RW.
Anthony Hooper QC (as he then was) provided an opinion dated 27 July 1990. He
advised that, on the basis that the conversation was accurately recorded, there was
insufficient evidence to support a prosecution for a conspiracy to PCOJ, or for
misconduct in a public office.

There is no further correspondence on the subject until 23 July 1997 when M r Enzor
flagged up the m atter to Miss Sharpling (CCP Central Casework) as part o f disclosure
to the Hillsborough Scrutiny. In the end Miss Sharpling wrote to Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith on 7 August 1997 w ith the details o f the information held and offering him an
inspection o f the material. There is no record o f a reply on the file. Matthew Pyne at the
Home Office holds all the Scrutiny documents. He has informed me by telephone that
Dru's letter is on file, however he has not found either a copy reply or a file note on the
point. He will do a further search.

K ey Issues:-

•   Ian DAINES, the ACC at South Yorkshire Police who is in charge o f the
    Hillsborough Archive, is concerned about disclosure o f these sensitive papers in his
    possession. He is asking for the advice o f the Director. Quite rightly he wants to
     ensure that the police act fully in accordance with their duty o f disclosure under the
     common law.
•   The first main issue to consider is whether or not to disclose the details o f the
     conversation. Is it relevant? I f it is, is it so sensitive that PII applies? Do the police
    or we have a duty o f disclosure?
•   M edia interest: this matter does not yet appear to have been brought to the attention
    o f the press. Those officially aware o f the conversation are the South Yorkshire
    Police, the CPS, the now M r Justice Hooper, the police solicitors Hammond
     Suddards, and presumably the Hillsborough Scrutiny team. A leak from those
     sources should not be expected. The complainant,                          spoke to his wife
     and a number o f colleagues. There is a possibility that, when the trial begins and
    receives the likely national coverage, the memories o f police officers may be jogged
     and occasion press reports o f “an establishment cover-up”.
     There is no reason to reconsider the 1990 decision that there was insufficient
     evidence o f any criminal offence.
     Relevance: whether or not the material is relevant to any o f the issues in the private
    prosecution.
     Duty o f disclosure. See the 1992 Guidelines re disclosure to third parties. The
     Crown Court can grant the HFSG a summons requiring the police to produce
     relevant statements and exhibits so as to permit the private prosecutor to comply
     with the general responsibilities o f a prosecutor. There is no reason why that should
     not apply to Us as well. Under the present policy it must be that we w ould have a
     duty to disclose relevant material, or make a PII application to the court.
    If either the material is now seen as relevant and/or we wish an independent view on
     disclosure, then there are a number o f avenues to consider. We could first obtain
     advice from Treasury Counsel; and then, if required, the police, by themselves or
    jointly with the CPS, could make an ex parte PII application, with or without notice,
     to the trial judge.
     Does PII apply? Is there a need to maintain the confidentiality o f the information
     because disclosure would be damaging to the public interest? I f there is to be a PII
          application to the trial judge in accordance with the normal procedure, should it be
          type I, II or III?
      •   At this stage it should be noted that the Circuit presiding judge has reserved the case
          to him self He is M r Justice Anthony HOOPER.
      •   An advantage o f an early PII application to the trial judge is that it deals w ith three
          m ain issues. The first o f disclosure, the second that the trial judge has already been
          involved in giving an opinion on the material in question and the last to show (if the
          m edia make a meal o f it) that the CPS and the SYP have behaved properly and in
          accordance w ith the interests o f justice.
      •   The next hearing at the Crown Court on 3 September 1999 is to hear argument on
          disclosure.

               note    FOR FILE:


               DISCLOSURE



              Was contacted by Peter Metcalf this date concerning the above, who said
              that on reflection he thought it would be wrong and perhaps even dangerous
              for me or South Yorkshire Police to “consume its own smoke" regarding the
              disclosure.

              His view is that this matter ought to be considered by someone other than
              the South Yorkshire Police as it may indicate possible criminal offences,
              for example, 'conspiracy to pervert the course of justice* or 'misuse of
              public office'.

              Mr Metcalf suggested that one way forward would be through Mr Wells who
              has been uninvolved in Hillsborough, then possibly through the Chief HMI
              to another Chief Constable, who may take Counsel's opinion or deal with
              the matter as he sees fit.

              I told him that I regarded his comments above as absolutely confidential
              to me as Acting Chief Constable as his client and he agreed this was so.

               Thank you, again, for your letter of 9 July.  I understand clearly what
               you say and can now confirm that there was no original note made of
               conversation in question.

               Would you be kind enough to run your professional eye across the attached
               letter provided by our solicitors?

               The last paragraph suggests that, with a view to the matters being seen
               to be thoroughly examined, you might seek Counsel's opinion on the angle
               now introduced, which I perceive to be fresh. This thought is offered,
               I'm sure, only in the spirit of canvassing the widest of independent
               view.

               1 am due shortly to go back to                originating the report and
               would like to do so with the maximum .possible collateral for
               open-handedness. I do hope that this final enquiry will not prove the
               last straw on the burden of your office-     I anticipate publicity when
               I have seen         and we should be seen to have tried our best.

     Thank you for bringing to my notice the details of the
report submitted by                         touching upon remarks
alleged to have been made in his presence by the Rt Hon Lord
Justice Taylor to Geoffrey Dear {then Chief Constable of the West
Midlands Police) on "lath April 1990 at Hillsborough.
     As agreed, Sir Clive Whitmore, Permanent Under Secretary of
State at the Home Office, and myself saw Lord Justice Taylor by
appointment at 9.30am on Friday, 20th July 1990, at the Royal
Courts of Justice in London.     Sir Clive outlined the details
contained in the report which Lord Justice Taylor immediately
rejected and described as nonsense. Understandably he could not
recall^the details of what was discussed but was perfectly clear
             had been no comment as alleged by

     At 4.30pm the same day I Baw Mr Geoffrey Dear, H.M.
Inspector of Constabulary, in bis Worcester Office.         After
outlining the allegations, he stated that he could not recall
details of the conversation that took place but was emphatic that
had there been any suggestion of bias, either then or later, he
would have remembered and would have objected to it. He further
emphasised that at all times Lord Justice Taylor was scrupulously
faxr, absolutely correct and quite unequivocal in his pursuit of
the truth. .

     ^ feel that this matter cannot be taken any further.
However, it is worth mentioning that although Lord Justice Taylor
carried out t£e Inquiry "alone, ~ he ‘ did have the benefit of
advisers, one of whom waB Mr Brian JohnBon, the Chief Constable
of Lancashire.

     I trust this information wi?J                                           e+-   WA11       4 wnl   < ff/i

         Bradford BD1 3LR




         It   was good to speak to               youon the telephone yesterday morning about
         the latest    developments               in the confidential report we have been
         discussing.

         I now enclose a letter to me from Sir John Woodcock dated 23 July 1990,
         in    which he describes what happened when the detail of thereport from
                   was presented     toLordJustice Taylor and, similarly,to Geoffrey
         Dear.   I also enclose, as promised, the opinion of Counsel sought by
         the Director of Public Prosecutions at your suggestion, and you will see
         that, in Anthony Hooper's view, the conduct alleged would amount to an
         offence if it were seen by a court as an agreement to conduct an
         investigation in a biased way. The opinion goes on to say that the words
         reported, even if accurately remembered, would not amourt to such an
         agreement and prosecution, therefore, is not viable.

         My next stage is to have            seen to let him know the full extent
         of what we have done on his behalf. The last line of                report
         indicates that he respects the confidence of the circumstances and I
         will see that this is reinforced when he is seen, though in a way which
         encourages him to confidence of his own volition; I have discussed with
         you already my fear that an arbitrarily imposed 'gag* will only add insult
         to injury. Much of what j            reported is now out and about since
         his discussion with colleagues (which he also reports) and I think that
         this development will be too much for one man to hold unto himself.

                 —V.^                                                ^                      .

            FILE NOTE TO DEPUTY CHIEF CONSTABLE                                      2 August 1990


            You have been following with me my pursuit of            report dated
            12 April 1990 to the point where          should now be seen and told
            the outcome.
                                                                         and when
            Unfortunately,          ] is on annual leave
            he comes back I shall be away. I do not think that this matter should
            be held until my return and we are agreed that you will see him in my
            place as soon after his resumption as possible.

             The following are the points which I think you should make to

             1.     From the moment that, encouraged by Superintendent Bettison, he made
                    his written report, the substance of that report was taken seriously.
                    Notwithstanding            own doubts that he would not be believed
                    (because of his junior rank) you and I have acted on the assumption
                    that his report was an accurate and honest recollection of a
                    conversation which took place.

             2.     You felt that   the gravity of the allegation warranted my personal
                    knowledge and intervention as the new Chief Constable as soon as
                    practicable after my taking up office, and that you did so.

             3.     We discussed             | report and agreed that it needed action.
                     In the first instance, it was to be one of the subjects covered in
                    a Senior Command discussion of the various aspects of the Hillsborough
                    aftermath.   In the event, that discussion has not yet been able to
                    take place and so I took action in respect of _________ report outside
                     the framework of any general Hillsborough deliberations.

             4. On 2 July I telephoned Peter Metcalf of Hammond suddard, and Sir
                 John Woodcock the HMC1C, to discuss the merits of what I intended
                 to do with           | report, namely to send it to the Director of
                 Public Prosecutions. Both parties agreed.

              5.    I sent a copy        of the report in confidence for the personal attention
                    of the DPP in        advance of a private meeting with him on 9 July 1990,
                    by which time        he would have had time to absorb the contents and to
                    have formed an       opinion.

              6.    When I met the Director, it was his professional view that no criminal
                    offence was disclosed.   In a letter to me, dated the same day, he
                    confirmed that opinion in writing, saying in effect that it was now
                    a matter for me.

              7.     After further conversations with Peter Metcalf and, as a courtesy,
                     with our own HMI Mr Sampson, I determined to. see Sir John woodcock
                     and did so on 18 July.    Sir John's view on hearing the detail of
                     the report and of the Director ■s opinion was that we should both
                     consult Sir Clive Whitmore, the Permanent Under-Secretary of State
                     at the Home Office, since Lord Justice Taylor had been appointed
                     by the Home Secretary.

               8.    In discussion with Sir John and Sir Clive that same day, and on two
                     occasions, it was determined - and 1 agreed - that the best approach
                     would be for Sir John (representing an independent police approach)
12-AUG. ’ 9 9 (THU! 1 4 : 3 6   S. Y. P. CHIEF DEPT          T E L 01 1 4 2 5 2 3 4 8 1   8481   P. 008



                  and Sir Clive (representing the Home Secretary 's concern) to see
                  Lord Justice Taylor in order to acquaint him with]      report.

            9. On 20 July 1990 Sir Clive and Sir John saw Lord Justice Taylor.
                Sir J o h n reports, in a letter dated 23 July 1990 t o me, that Lord
                Justice Taylor immediately rejected the detail of the report and
                described it as nonsense.

            1 0 , On  the same day Sir John, alone, saw Geoffrey Dear.    Mr Dear's
                  response was that he could not recall details of the conversation
                  that had taken place, but that he was emphatic that had there been
                  any suggestion of bias, then or later, he would have remembered it
                  and would have objected to it.

             11. While this process was in train, Peter Metcalf had suggested that
                 there might be one more angle to explore in respect of possible
                 criminality, and he wrote me a letter dated 18 July 1990 suggesting
                 that I explore with the DPP the further possibility of an offence
                 of effecting a public mischief.

             12. I wrote, as a consequence of Peter Metcalf's letter, on 23 July 1990
                 to the Director of Public Prosecutions asking him to consider this
                 further suggestion and to ask if he would seek independent Counsel s
                 opinion on the point of law. This was now, of course, after the
                 Judge and Geoffrey Dear had been seen.       It meant that, had the
                 Director or the independent Counsel come back with an acknowledgement
                 that a criminal offence could have been committed, then I would have
                 had to have caused Lord Justice Taylor and Geoffrey Dear to be seen
                 and a statement taken under caution.

             13. in the event, independent Counsel in the person of Anthony Hooper
                 QC reviewed the facts as reported and concluded that they, as
                 reported, fell short of a criminal offence.

             14. My remaining actions have been confined to telling parties involved
                 of this final opinionand to having __________ seen in order that he
                 may know the amount of energy we have     put into following up his
                 report, and the outcome.

             15. That outcome is not altogether satisfactory; a blunt denial of
                 something equally strongly asserted seldom brings satisfaction to
                 either party.   I can honestly, and with the best interests of the
                 Force at heart, see no obvious further avenue to explore.

             16. I would like you to thank _________ for having the courage to make
                 the report.   I see no evident reason why he should have done so had
                 it not been the truth as he heard it.

              17. Short o f further, unexpected light being shed on the in c o n c lu s iv e
                  result - in which case I will happily take up the cudgels again -
                  I think, with regret, that we must regard the matter as closed.

         NOTE FOR FILE;




          With reference to your 'Note for File1 of 2 August 1990 concerning the
          earlier revelations from             in respect of Lord Justice Taylor and
          Mr Geoffrey Dear, as requested I saw          this date.

          I informed him in some detail of the action taken since the submission of
          his report and of the outcome•

          I told him you applauded him for bringing this information to light and
          saw it as a responsible and, in some ways, courageous act on his part.

                    was extremely grateful for the action taken.               He agrees there
          appears now nothing further which can done.

          He told me that when the purported comments were made the car was stationery
          and he is absolutely clear that his version of the conversation is correct.

Letter from Treasury Solicitor to:




The Hon. M r Justice Hooper
Royal Courts o f Justice




R v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY


I am instructed to write to you on behalf o f the Crown Prosecution Service. The South
Yorkshire Police have sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service about the disclosure
o f two documents in their possession which relate to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster and
which may therefore have a bearing on the current prosecution o f M essrs Duckenfield and
Murray brought by the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“the prosecutor”).            M essrs
Duckenfield and M urray have been committed to stand trial at the Crown Court at Leeds. I
understand that the matter is listed for hearing before you on 3 September 1999, for issues o f
disclosure to be considered.


The prosecutor has sought disclosure from the South Yorkshire Police o f all documents in
their possession w hich are relevant to the prosecution. The documents about which the South
Yorkshire Police have sought advice are a report dated 12 April 1990, signed by
        and a letter dated 23 July 1990, from Sir John W oodcock, then HM Chief
Inspector o f Constabulary, to Mr Richard W ells, then C hief Constable o f the South
Yorkshire Police. I enclose copies o f those two documents.


The report by                  was drawn to the attention o f the then D irector o f Public
Prosecutions in 1990, who subsequently sought the advice o f leading counsel as to the effect
o f its content. The advice was given by you, then a member o f the Bar, in an Opinion dated
27 July 1990. I enclose a copy o f your Opinion.
#   The Crown Prosecution Service has considered the report by                  and the letter from
    Sir John W oodcock and intends to advise the South Yorkshire Police that they should be
    disclosed to the prosecutor. Because the present Director o f Public Prosecutions formerly
    acted for M r Duckenfield, he has taken no part in this decision. Following the usual practice
    o f the Crown Prosecution Service, they also intend to advise the South Yorkshire Police that
    the documents should be disclosed to both the prosecutor and the defendants at the same
    time. This advice will extend to the report by                   and the letter from Sir John
    W oodcock alone. There is no suggestion by the Crown Prosecution Service that either your
    Opinion, or any o f the associated correspondence, should be disclosed to either the prosecutor
    or the defendants.


    I have been instructed to write to both the prosecutor and the defendants, informing them o f
    the existence o              Report and Sir John W oodcock’s letter and enclosing a copy o f
    each. The Crown Prosecution Service also wishes me to draw to the attention o f both the
    prosecutor and the defendants that I have written to you in the terms o f this letter; and
    preferably, to send to those concerned a copy o f this letter.


    I should be pleased to instruct counsel to appear before you on 3 September to provide such
    assistance as you would wish. I have not yet instructed counsel in that capacity and should be
    grateful to know your reaction to the proposal before doing so.         The Crown Prosecution
    Service is anxious that I should write to both the prosecutor and the defendants as soon as
    possible, and certainly before 3 September, but did not want to do so without first drawing the
    matter to your attention.


    I should welcome any comments that you might care to make on the suggestion that I should
    instruct counsel to appear before you on 3 September; and on the letter that I intend to w rite to
    the prosecutor and the defendants in advance o f that date. I should add that the Crown
    Prosecution Service will ensure that                   Sir Geoffrey Dear, Sir Clive W hitmore
    and Sir John Woodcock are all informed o f the disclosure o f the two documents in
    advance of that disclosure taking place.

             R    V   DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

             I thought I would write to you concerning the two outstanding issues raising from the disclosure
             decision you have taken in this case. The draft letter you provided to me on Thursday evening
             is ready to be sent.

             The two main points that we discussed were:

             1              W hether the account o f the interviews with Lord Taylor and Geoffrey Dear conducted
                            by Sir John Woodcock and/or Sir Clive Whitmore should be disclosed in addition to tfce
                            initial report of           At the time o f your original decision to disclose the report,
                            you were unaware o f these interviews.

             2              Whether it is legally necessary or, in handling terms, appropriate to inform Sir Geoffrey
                            Dear o f your decision.

             As to 1 , 1 suggest that the letter from Sir John W oodcock recording the interviews should be
             disclosed. The contents complete the picture in a way which is important if the court is to assess
             the true value o f the information provided by          should either party decide to rely on it.

             As to 2, my advice is that the conversations recorded in Sir John's letter dated 13 July 1990 were
             held in confidence. For this reason, Sir Geof&ey Dear ought in principle to be informed o f y o u
             intention to disclose that letter (if you agree with my advice under 1 above) and given tte
             opportunity to object if he wishes to do so. I f he did, you would need to consider whether that
             objection should be overridden in the public interest.

             I enclose the judgment in Woolgar v C hief Constable o f Sussex and UKCC (CA, 26 May 1999),
             which helpfully sets out the legal position. The fact that these documents are to be disclosed to
             ensure the proper administration o f justice would in principle fall within the exceptional
             circumstances that justify disclosure. Subject to your views, I do not consider the facts that these
             were not interviews trader caution or that they were not conducted as part o f an "ordinary" police
             investigation are significant in the context o f establishing the principles that ought to apply to
             the disclosure o f the interviews to a third party.

 #
            Like you, I doubt that Sir Geoffrey would object to the disclosure o f his response if the initial
            report is to be disclosed. I recognise that you wish to take this matter forward quickly and do
            not think that you would need to do more than give reasonable notice o f your intentions (say 48
            hours). We could consider writing to M r Justice Hooper regarding the initial report at the same
            time as writing to Sir Geoffrey Dear.

            I hope this is helpful.

   4   Lord Justice Kennedy;

        1.        This is an appeal from a decision of Asrill J who on 3rd September 1993

        dismissed the appellant’s application for an order that the Chief Constable b;

        restrained from disclosing to UKCC the contents of an interview between the appellant

        and the police which took place at Worthing Police Station on 6th December 1997.

   B
       2.         Background Farte.

                  The background facts are simple and not contentious. The appellant is ,i

        registered nurse, and in 1997 she was matron of a nursing home at Worthing. After

        the death on 23rd November 1997 of a patient in her care allegations were mad ;

        which led to her being arrested and interviewed by the police on 6th December 1997.

       The officer concerned was Detective Sergeant Julie Buchan, and it is clear from her
   D
        affidavit that the allegation with which she was particularly concerned was one                   of

        over-administration of diamorphine, but she was also aware of other allegations which

        were matters of concern to the Registration and Inspection Unit of the West Sussex
   E
        Health Authority.



                  At the conclusion of her investigation Detective Sergeant Buchan notified th.i

        appellant and also the owner of the nursing home and the RIU that the evidence did

        not meet the evidential test required for criminal charges, and the matter was then

        referred by the RIU to UKCC which is the regulatory body for nursing, midwifery

        and health visiting. It is a disciplinary body, with power to remove nurses from dw

        register if that is necessary to protect patients. The allegations which UKCC had to

        investigate were more wide-ranging than those which had been considered by th-;
   H
        police. Other patients were involved, and in addition to allegations of misuse of drug s

                                                       2

            there were allegations of other forms of maltreatment. UKCC began to investigate h

            April 1998, and on 24th June 1998 the appellant was officially informed of what was

        afoot.



        3.           U.K.C.C.’s normal procedure.


   B
                     UKCC receives over one thousand complaints per annum, and where the police

        have been involved the practice is to contact the police for relevant information. That

        obviously can save re-interviewing, and may expand the area of enquiry. It is not th;

        practice to interview the professional under investigation at the investigative stage.



        4.           Progress of Investigation.
   D


                     The police practice was to seek authority from those who had given statements

        to the police, and if authority was given to disclose the statements. By early July

        authority had been obtained from most of the witnesses by Detective Sergeant Buchan,

        but the Royal College of Nursing, on behalf of the appellant, in a letter dated 3rd July

            1998, indicated that her agreement to disclosure would not be forthcoming. On 13th

        August 1998 Detective Sergeant Buchan replied saying that on 25th August 1998 she

            proposed to break the seal on the master tape recording of the appellant’s interview

            of 6th December 1997, to copy it, and to re-seal it. The RCN representative was

            offered the opportunity to be present, and was told that after copying the police

            solicitor would listen to the tape and decide whether it should be disclosed to UKCC.

                    On 18th August 1998 the regional solicitor for the RCN replied, objecting id

          any disclosure to the nursing regulatory body, and questioning whether the proper

          authority had been obtained from the Chief Officer of police for breaking the sea].

          In a letter of 19th August 1998 to the Chief Constable the regional solicitor advised

          him of her intention to seek an injunction to prevent the course of action proposed by

          Detective Sergeant Buchan. Part of that letter reads -



                    “We place on record our concern that DS Buchan is pursuing this approach to
                    a confidential conversation our client had with the police in connection with th;
                    death of a patient. She has been told that no action is being taken by the police
                    against her, and at no time was she informed in her interview that the purpose
                    of taping was anyhow connected with any investigation except by the police.
                    The conversation our client had with your officers was undertaken on that
                    basis, and we are really worried that you have officers who believe that suci
                    tapes can be sent to any other body, particularly after our client had express! /
                    informed your officers that she would not consent voluntarily to sue i
                    disclosure.”

                    The police advised the RCN solicitor that they intended to proceed as indicated

      by Detective Sergeant Buchan, The regional solicitor also approached UKCC as to

      why disclosure was being sought when the appellant’s consent had been refused.

      UKCC refused to be drawn, saying that it was a matter for the appellant and thd

      police.



      5.            These Proceedings.



                    On 21st August 1998 the appellant commenced these proceedings. In he:

%                 “The UKCC has not, so far as I am aware, made any representations to the
- ^               Sussex police to the effect that there is any specific reason why the disclosure
                  of the tape/transcript of the interview would be in the public interest. Further,
                  the allegations contained in the letter from the UKCC to the plaintiff dated 24th
                  June 1998 do not include any allegation in respect of the death of any patient
                  and thus the interview does not appear relevant to any UKCC investigation:..
                  Moreover, the UKCC has its own means of carrying out investigations, which
                  are described in Statutory Instruments 1993 number 893, the Nurses, Midwives
                  and Health Visitors (Professional Conduct) Rules 1993 Approval Order 199“-.
                  There is no express statutory power permitting the UKCC to obtain transcripts
                  of police interviews.”
   B
                  By the time that the matter was considered by the judge there was also before

        him an affidavit of Detective Sergeant Buchan and an affidavit from Paul Duncan

        Trott, solicitor to the Sussex Police.
   C


                  On 18th February 1999 this court gave leave for UKCC to be joined as a party

        to the appeal, and before us there are two other affidavits which were not before the
   D
        judge, namely an affidavit of Katrina Wingfield, solicitor to UKCC, and a second

        affidavit of Helen Caulfield.



        6.        The Issue.



                  Undoubtedly when someone is arrested and interviewed by the police what hs

        or she says is confidential. Plainly it may be used in the course of a criminal trial if

        charges are brought arising out of that investigation, but if it is not so used the person

        interviewed is entitled to believe that, generally speaking, his or her confidence wi:l

        be respected. If authority be required for that proposition, it can be found in Taylcr

        v Serious Fraud Office (1998) 4 All H R 801 but, as all of the authorities cited to us

        indicate, there are exceptional circumstances which justify the disclosure by the police,
   H
        otherwise than in the course of a criminal trial, of what has been said by a suspec t


                                                         'r tw itft,       Official Court Reporters

     during the course of an interview, in circumstances where the suspect, or former

      suspect, does not consent to such disclosure. The question which arises in this eas<j

      is whether, if the regulatory body of the profession to which the suspect belongs is

      investigating serious allegations and makes a formal request to the police for

      disclosure of what was said in interview, the public interest in the proper working of

      the regulatory body is or may be such as to justify disclosure of the material sought.

      If the answer to that question is in the affirmative how, as a matter of procedure,

      should contentious issues in relation to disclosure be resolved?



      7.        Authorities.



                Mr Wadsworth Q.C., for the appellant, submits that it is right to start from th;
 D
      position that, as Millett L.J. said in the Court of Appeal in Taylor v Serious Fraud

      Office (1997) 4 All E R 877 at 904 -



                “Members of the public who volunteer information to the police are entitled to
                expect that it will be used only for the purpose of the investigation and
                subsequent criminal proceedings. Their expectations should be respected.”


                Mr Wadsworth further submits that over the years and partly no doubt as a

      result of European influence, it is possible to see the public interest in maintaining that

      initial confidentiality being ever more closely guarded. Whether the police havs

      obtained information from an informer, a witness, or a suspect who has not been

      charged, if the police do not themselves prefer charges what has been said to the

      police should, save in exceptional circumstances, not be passed on.
 H              Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights indicates that to protec t

                private and family life, where such information has been obtained in confidence theie
O   ' +
                should be no disclosure “except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary

                in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or economic

                well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection

                of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” Mr

                Horan, for the Chief Constable, and Lord Lester Q.C. for UKCC, invite us to noie
          B
                the reference in Article 8 to the protection of health, and the reference to the

                protection of the rights and freedoms of others.



                         In McVeigh v UK (1992) 25 DR 15 the European Court considered the officid

                retention of photographs and fingerprints obtained during an anti-terrorist check in

              Liverpool. Its conclusion was that because terrorism posed such a threat to public
          D
              safety, retention for the time being could be regarded as necessary. The inference,

              Mr Wadsworth submits, is that but for the exceptional threat, records would have had

              to be destroyed, as the Austrian Government conceded that photographs of
          E
              demonstrators should be destroyed in FriedI v Austria (1995) A-305-B Com Rep .

              Under English law the position now is that records such as fingerprints and

              photographs obtained during the course of an investigation are destroyed unless the
          F
              suspect is convicted or cautioned. A taped interview does not suffer a similar fate.

              One sealed copy is retained and paragraph 6.3 of Code E to the Police and Criminal

              Evidence Act 1984 provides that -



                         “Where no criminal proceedings result it is the responsibility of the chief
                         officer of police to establish arrangements for the breaking of the seal on the
                         master tape, where this becomes necessary.”
          H




                                                                    Official Coun Reporters

                     Obviously the rule contemplates the possibility that breaking of the seal may

            become necessary, but that possibility can arise in circumstances other than those with
    A
            which we are concerned. In 1986 the Home Office issued a circular to police forct.-s

            giving guidance on the disclosure of previous convictions and related information.

            This was recognised to be an area where the duty to maintain confidence cou';d

            conflict with, for example, a public interest in safeguarding children, and paragraph

            2 of the circular begins -

    C
                     uThe general principle governing disclosure remains that police information
                     should not be disclosed unless there are important considerations of public
                     interest to justify departure from the general rule of confidentiality. The three
                     areas in which exceptions are made are the protection of vulnerable members
                     of society; the need to ensure probity in the administration of law, and national
                     security. ” "       '           ~ ""

                     The respondents invite us to note the reference to “vulnerable members of

            society”.
    E

                     Paragraph 7 of the circular reads -



                     “On occasions the police may have information outside the scope of this
                     circular which gives cause for serious concern that a person subject to checking
                     or reporting is unsuited to hold a position of trust. Such information may be
                     passed on to the employer or professional body on the authority only of an
                     officer of ACPO rank. Cases of doubt should be referred to the Home Office. ”

                     Mr Wadsworth points to the procedures to be followed before material of the

            kind contemplated in paragraph 7 can be disclosed even to those who would seem to

            have a clear interest in receiving it.

                The first of the English authorities we were invited to consider is Beloff v

      Prestdram Ltd n 973) 1 All E R 241, and Mr Wadsworth submits that it should now

      be read in the light of later authorities. It concerned a breach of copyright, and

      UngoedJThomas J when dealing with the submission that public interest might justify

      disclosure, cited from Lord Denning M R’s judgment in Initial Services Ltd v Putieri I

      (1968) 1 QB 396, where Lord Denning said at 405 that the exception which justified
 B
      disclosure “should extend to crimes, frauds and misdeeds, both those actually

      committed as well as those in contemplation, provided always - and this is essential -

       that the disclosure is justified in the public interest.” Ungoed Thomas J then looked

      at later cases and continued at 260f -



                “The defence of public interest clearly covers and, in the authorities does not
                extend beyond, disclosure, which as Lord Denning MR emphasised must be
                disclosure justified in the public interest, of matters carried out cr
                contemplated, in breach of the country’s security or in breach of law including
                statutory duty, fraud, or otherwise destructive of the country or its people,
                including matters medically dangerous to the public; and doubdess other
                misdeeds of similar gravity. ”

                Here again the respondents invite our attention to “matters medically dangerous

      to the public. ”



                In Attorney General v Guardian Newspapers Ltd (No 2) 1990 1AC 109 (the

      Spycatcher case) the claim was for an injunction to restrain future publication of

      information derived from a former member of the Security Services. At 268 H Lord

      Griffiths said -



                “The courts have      always refused to uphold the right of confidence when
 H              to do so would be to cover up wrongdoing. In Gartside v Outram (1857) 26
                L.J. Ch 113, it was said that there could be no confidence in iniquity. This

                  approach has been developed in the modern authorities to include cases in
                  which it is in the public interest that the confidential information should be
                  disclosed: see Initial Services Ltd v Putterill, Beloff v Presdam Ltd and Lien
                  Laboratories Ltd v Evans. This involves the judge in balancing the public
                  interest in upholding the right to confidence, which is based on the moral
                  principles of loyalty and fair dealing, against some other public interest thut
                  would be served by the publication of the confidential material. Even if the
                  balance comes down in favour of publication, it does not follow that publication
                  should be to the world through the media. In certain circumstances the public
                  interest may be better served by a limited form of publication perhaps to the
                  police or to some other authority who can follow up a suspicion that wrong
   B              doing may lurk beneath the cloak of confidence. Those authorities will be
                  under a duty not to abuse the confidential information and to use it only for the
                  purpose of their inquiry. If it turns out that the suspicions are without
                  foundation the confidence can then still be protected.”

                  At 282 E Lord Goff said -



                  “Although the basis of the law’s protection of confidence is that there is a
                  public interest that confidences should be preserved and protected by the law,
                  nevertheless that public interest may be outweighed by some other
   D              countervailing public interest which favours disclosure. This limitation may
                  apply.... to all types of confidential information. It is this limiting principle
                  which may require a court to carry out a balancing operation, weighing the
                  public interest in maintaining confidence against a countervailing public intere: t
                  favouring disclosure.”

                  In both speeches there is recognised the possibility of countervailing public

        interests, and of the need to balance one against the other.



   F              In Re a Company (1989) Ch 477 Scott J considered an application by a

        company to restrain an ex-employee from disclosing confidential information or

        documents to the Financial Investment Management and Brokers Regulatory Authority

        (FIMBRA). At 481 the judge said -



                  “If this were a case in which there were any question or threat of general
                  disclosure by the defendant of confidential information concerning the way in

.   '1                         but it is not general disclosure that the defendant has in mind. He has in mind
                               only disclosure to FIMBRA, the regulatory authority, and, in relation to a
                               particular case that he has identified in his affidavit, the Inland Revenue. 1 ask
                               myself whether an employee of a company carrying on the business of giving

                               under the regulatory umbrella provided by FIMBRA owes a duty of
                               confidentiality which extends to barring disclosure of information to FIMBRA. ”

                               The judge recognised the possibility that the defendant was activated by malice,

                     and continued at 482B -
            B


                               “But if that is so, then I ask myself what harm will be done. FIMBRA may
                               decide that the allegations are not worth investigating. In that case no harm
                               will have been done, Or FIMBRA may decide that an investigation is
                               necessary. In that case, if the allegations turn out to be baseless, nothing wi.l
                               follow the investigation. And if harm is caused by the investigation itself, ;t
                               is harm which is implicit in the regulatory role of FIMBRA. It may be thut
                               what is put before FIMBRA includes some confidential information. But th a
                               information would, as it seems to me, be information which FIMBRA could at
                               any time obtain by the spot checks that it is entitled to carry out.”

                               The judge expressly declined to carry out any investigation into the allegation?,

                     saying at 483B -



                               “It is for FIMBRA on receiving whatever information the defendant puts before
                               it to decide whether there is a matter for investigation. If there is not then I
                               cannot see that any harm has been done to the plaintiff. If there is         then it is
                               right for FIMBRA rather than the court to investigate.”

                               Obviously the respondents place considerable reliance upon the decision in Re

                     a Company, but Mr Wadsworth submits that it is a very different type of case. There

                     was no element of public interest immunity, only a conflict between the rights of the

                     em ployer and the rig h ts o f the reg u lato r. M r W adsw orth subm its th at if U K C C wai;i

          moment at which the matter could be properly tested. That, he submits, is the course

         envisaged by this court in Marcel v Commissioner of Police (1992) 2 All E R 72

         where the issue was whether the police were entitled to disclose seized documents to

         a third party for use in civil litigation.               Voluntary disclosure was not approved.

         Dillon L.J. at 81 cited with approval what had been said by Sir Nicholas Browre-

         Wilkinson V-C at first instance, namely -



                    In my judgment, subject to any express statutory provision in other Acts, the
                  police are authorised to seize, retain and use documents only for public
                  puiposes related to the investigation and prosecution of crime and the return of
                  stolen property to the true owner................ if communication to others is
                  necessary for the purpose of police investigation and prosecution, it is
                  authorised. It may also be (though I do not decide) that there are other publ .c
                  authorities to which the documents can properly be disclosed, for example i.o
                  City and regulatory authorities or to the security services.”
   D              Mr Wadsworth also placed some reliance on the decision if this coun in Lortrho

                  Fayed (No.4) [1994] Q.B. 775 which concerned discovery of documents held

        by the defendant prepared with reference to tax liability, which were of the same kind
   E
        as documents held by the Inland Revenue. Counsel argued that as the state must not,

        backed by com pulsory pow ers, obtain inform ation from the citizen fo r one purpose

        and use that information for another, the information in the hands of the taxpayer need

       not be produced. The argument failed, but Mr Wadsworth relies on the principle.

       His difficulty is that, as the authorities show, the principle cannot be regarded as

       absolute.

   G              Lord Lester invited o u r attention to the ECHR decision in M .S . v Sw eden

       (1997) 3 B.H.R.C. 248. The applicant in that case had sustained a back injury anc

       objected to disclosure of medical records, which contained confidential information,
  H to the Social Insurance Office for the purpose of assessing her compensation claim.




                                                                      Official Court Reporters

            The coun recognised that the object of disclosure was a proper one - to enable the

            office to determine whether the conditions for granting compensation had been met.

            It also recognised the “fundamental importance” of protecting personal data,

            guaranteed by Article S of the Convention.                   What it then did was to “examine

            whether, m the light of the case as a whole, the reasons adduced to justify :he

        } interference were relevant and sufficient and whether the measure was propomonue

           to the legitimate aim pursued.”                      The court noted that the information was

           “communicated by one public institution to another in the context of an assessment of

          Whether she satisfied the legal conditions for obtaining a benefit which she herself had

          requested.” Under the relevant law it was a condition of imparting the information

          that the office had requested it, and the office was under a duty to treat it as

    D confidential, so paragraph 44 of the judgment reads:-



                     The Court considers that there were relevant and sufficient reasons for
                    the communication of the applicant’s medical records by the clinic to the
    E               ottice and that the measure was not disproportionate to the legitimate
                    aim pursued. Accordingly, it concludes that there has been no violation
                    or the applicant’s right to respect for her private life, as guaranteed by
                    Article 8 of the convention."



   F
                    Mr Wadsworth invited us to distinguish that case on the basis that the applicant,

         by applying for compensation, waived her right to retain the confidentiality of her
         medical records.

                       After referring               10    two authorities, the Lord Chief Justice continued at 410F:-

                      limited disclosure as is judged necessary to achieve that puipose."

                      It is worth noting in passing that there is no suggestion that it is necessary for

            the police to seek court approval for making a disclosure.

            Buxton J. said at 415B:-

                          Mr Wadsworth submitted that in deciding how to reconcile conflicting publi:

                interests we might derive some assistance from the approach taken to cases in the

             Family Division. It is clear from Ifljfe A fa minor) 2] August 1998 that a coun order

            is required before the General Medical Council can be given access to documents helc

            on the coun file, but that is hardly surprising having regard to the location of the
            material.




     H                iB JftL D999] 1 W.L.R. 299 concerned the duty which section 17 and section

                     those found guilty in care or other family proceedings of sexual abuse. The statutory
    - k
                     duty was held not to apply “where the man has been neither cautioned or convicted

                     of any sexual abuse, a fortiori where he has been acquitted of offences against the

                    very children with which the family court was directly concerned”. That omission,

                    it was suggested, cannot have been inadvertent: “it must reflect a conscious decis on

              B     that disclosure of information should be regarded as exceptional in cases of this

                    nature (per Butler-Sloss L.J. at 305). Save for that last observation, which reinforces

                    the general respect for confidentiality, I cannot derive any real assistance from the

                   family cases. R eL, in particular, is a decision in relation to statutory construction of

                   a statute with which we are not concerned, but it is worth noting that even in that case

                   Butler Sloss L.J., at 303 F, pointed out that "there are no pending investigations,

          D e.ther by the police or any other agency in respect of which the information sought :o
                   be disclosed might assist.” As Lord Lester submitted, express allowance was beirg

                   made for the situation which we have to consider.

          E

                         Finally there is the decision of the House of Lords in Tavlm- v Srrin,,*

                  fiffice. I have already cited from the judgment of Millett L.J. in the Coun of Appeal.

                  The case was concerned with whether those involved in investigating fraud, including

                  witnesses, could be sued for defamation. In the House of Lords it was held tha:

                  material disclosed by the prosecution to a defendant in criminal proceedings was

      G
                  subject to an implied undertaking that such material would not be used for any purpose

                  other than the defence in the instant case.                 The House of Lords also held that

              Witnesses, potential witnesses, and those who take part in a criminal investigation with

      H a view to a prosecution or possible prosecution, are immune from suit. At S13j Lord

                     In the course of his submissions Lord Lester took us through the statutory

        B     pow ers and duties ° f U.K.C.C. as set out in the Nurses Midwives and Health Visitors

              Act 1997, which includes the duty to maintain a register of qualified nurses (section

              7) and to determine circumstances in which a person may be removed from he

             register (section 10 (!)(*)). Paragraph 1(b) of schedule 2 gives power to require

             witnesses to attend for the puiposes of proceedings under section 10 before the council

             or a committee, and the proceedings are further governed by the Nurses Midwives and

    D        Health Visitors (Professional Conduct) Rules 1993 Approval Order 1993 (S.I. 392).

             A practitioner may be removed from the register if she has been guilty of misconduct

             (rule 2(l)(a)), the question of misconduct having been investigated and referred to ti e

    E       Conduct Committee where misconduct has been proved to that committee’s satisfaction

            (rule2(2)). Before the matter reaches the Conduct Committee it is considered by a

            Preliminary Proceedings Committee which also considers any written response whici

            the practitioner may offer to the allegations, and it is only if the P.P.C. so decides that

            disciplinary proceedings are formally commenced (rules 7, 8 & 9). The point to be

            noted is that this is a staged procedure, and the stage in the procedure with which thi:

            case is concerned is the initial investigatory stage.

n r           answered questions when interviewed by the police she did so in the reasonable b, lief

              that what she said would go no further unless it was used by the police for the

          A | purposes of criminal proceedings. The caution administered to her so indicated, and

             m order to safeguard the free flow of information to the police it is essential that those

             who give information should be able to have confidence that what they say will not
             be used for some collateral purpose.



                     However, in my judgment, where a regulatory body such as U.K.C.C.,

             operating in the fieid of public health and safety, seeks access to confidential material

            in the possession of the police, being material which the police are reasonably

            persuaded is of some relevance to the subject matter of an enquiry being

      d     by the regulatory body, then a countervailing public interest is shown to exist whici,

            as in this case, entitles the police to release the material to the regulatory body on the

            basis that save in so far as it may be used by the regulatory body for the purposes of

      E Its own enquiry, the confidentiality which already attaches to the material will be
           maintained. As Mr Horan said in paragraph 14 of his skeleton argument:-



                              I T 3            regulated nursing profession is necessary in
                   the interest of the medical welfare of the country, to keep the public
                                “ PrT ° I the nghts and freedoms of those vulnerable
                   individuals in need of nursing care. A necessary part of such regulation
                   ',    e .ns“nn* of the free flow of the best available information to those
                   charged by statute with the responsibility to regulate."

                   Putting the matter in Convention terms Lord Lester submitted, and I would

          accept, that disclosure is “necessary in a democratic society in the interests of ...

          public safety ... or ... for the protection of health or morals, or for the protect!on
   H of the rights and freedoms of others."




                                                               Official Court Reporters

i                            Even rf there is no request from the regulatory body, it seems to me that il the
    *
                  police come into possession of confidential information which, in their reasonable

                  view, m the interests of public health or safely, should be considered by a professional

                  or regulatory body, then the police are free to pass that information to the relevant
                  regulatory body fo r its consideration.


            B

                            Obviously in each case a balance has to be struck between competing public

                 interests, and at least arguably in some cases the reasonableness of the police vi,;w

                 may be open to challenge. If they reft.se to disclose, the regulatory body can, if

                 aware of the existence of the information, make an appropriate application to tlie

                 court. In order to safeguard the interests of the individual, it is, in my judgment,

        D desirable that where the police are minded to disclose, they should, as in this cas:,
                inform the person affected of what they propose to do in such time as to enable thlt

                person, ,f so advised, to seek assistance from the coun. In some eases that may not

                be practicable or desirable, but in most cases that seems to me to be the course that

                should be followed.               In any event, in my judgment, the primary decision as t5

                disclosure should be made by the police who have die custody of the relevant material,
                and not by the court.



                          I would therefore dismiss this appeal.




            Lord Justice Otton : I agree.

                          1)

          H IL L SB O R O U G H

          Since discussing this m atter w ith the Attorney General and you on Tuesday, I have spoken to
          Assistant C hief Constable Daines o f the South Yorkshire Police and then to Sue Ross o f the
          Treasury Solicitor’s Department.

          M r Daines was pleased with m y immediate indication that in m y view the                  Report
          should be disclosed to the prosecutor and to the defendants. H e was firm ly o f the same
          opinion. I explained that, in our view (and I did indicate to him in strict confidence that I had
          consulted the Attorney General), it would be sensible for all concerned (that is, for the South
          Yorkshire Police and for the Crown Prosecution Service) if the handling o f the disclosure
          were conducted on behalf o f both parties by the Treasury Solicitor. M r D aines agreed at once
          that that w ould be advisable and is therefore content for me to proceed accordingly. Once I
          had secured his agreement, I then consulted Sue Ross, who now acts on our behalf.

          It became apparent during m y conversation w ith M r Daines that neither I, nor - as far as I can
          tell - anyone else within the CPS, had seen all the relevant material in his possession. He
          then faxed to me his complete set o f papers and I am enclosing w ith this letter to you copies
          o f the further documents, so that you have a com plete file.

          The further documents are copies of:

                1.    M r D aines’ letter to m e o f 12.8.99.

                2.    A cting C hief Constable’s Note For File o f 9.5.90, w ith manuscript
                      comments not on the copy already supplied to you.
      3.    Page I o f C hief Constable’s letter to DPP o f 4.7.90, w ith manuscript
            comments not on the copy already supplied to you.

      4.    Hammond Suddards’ covering letter to C hief Constable o f 18.7.90.

      5.    C hief Constable’s letter to DPP o f 23.7.90, w ith m anuscript comment not on
            the copy already supplied to you.

      6.   H M CIC’s letter to C hief Constable o f 23.7.90.

      7.    C hief Constable’s letter to Hammond Suddards o f 2.8.90.

      8.    C hief Constable’s File Note to D eputy C hief Constable o f 2.8.90.

      9.    Deputy C hief Constable’s Note For File to C hief Constable o f 16.8.90.

Documents 6 to 9 are the interesting ones: in particular, Document 6. You will see from this
that the C hief Constable acted on the advice contained in the final paragraph o f A llan G reen’s
letter to him o f 9 July 1990 and drew the m atter to the attention o f Sir John W oodcock and Sir
Clive W hitmore. Sir John and Sir Clive subsequently saw Lord Justice Taylor; and Sir John
on his own saw Geoffrey Dear. In short, both Lord Justice Taylor and Geoffrey D ear denied
the comments attributed to them by

Documents 7 to 9 describe the subsequent handling within the South Yorkshire Police.

I have drawn these further documents to Sue R oss’ attention and have asked her to consider
w hether w e should not also disclose document 6 to the parties in the criminal proceedings.
M y view is that we should: it completes the picture. The             ilone would present an
incomplete - and possibly m isleading - picture.

There may be an issue as to whether Sir Geoffrey should be formally consulted before
disclosure is made o f a document that records an interview (albeit an informal interview) with
him. Sue Ross is looking into that. O f course, to consult him about document 6 would
necessarily alert him to the fact that we were going to disclose the                 itself. W e
covered this particular point in our meeting w ith the Attorney; but i mime m at the position
m ight have changed, since we now know that Sir Geoffrey has previously been m ade aware
o f the allegation (and has quite possibly seen the             and has rejected it.

I wonder, in these circumstances, w hether there would now be any objection to inform ing Sir
Geoffrey o f our intention to disclose the                   w ith or w ithout document 6 and
w hether or not Sue Ross advises that he sh<                 d about the latter. I am inclined to
think that there would not be, but I should welcom e any comments that you or the Attorney
m ight care to make. I should add, o f course, that I would also welcome any comments on the
question o f disclosing document 6 to the parties. M y view, as I have said, is that it should be
disclosed.

I have rung M r Justice H ooper’s clerk, whose answerphone says that “w e” are on vacation
until 16 August. I have done no more, but am accordingly hopeful that Sue Ross w ill be able
to contact the Judge by letter next week. Clearly, depending on our final decisions in relation
to document 6 and Sir Geoffrey, the letter as presently drafted m ay need amendment.

    I am copying this letter, without enclosures, to Sue Ross.

        I write following our telephone conversation this morning. I am very grateful to the
        Attorney General for agreeing to see me at such short notice.

        I attach a bundle o f papers which concludes w ith a recent internal discussion paper by
        George Croston, one o f m y Prosecution Team Leaders, who has responsibility for
        dealing w ith Hillsborough. It was under cover o f this discussion paper that the
                was drawn to m y attention last Thursday, 5 August. The                   itself is
        the first document in the bundle and it is this document alone, I believe, that gives rise
        to the current issue about disclosure.

        The sensitivities are clear. Counsel who originally advised the then D irector is now
        the judge currently dealing with the private prosecution. I have not discussed the
        m atter w ith David Calvert-Smith, because he was previously instructed to represent
        M r Duckenfield in relation to the private prosecution.

         I have little doubt in m y mind that the                   Should be disclosed to the
         prosecutor and that the prosecutor should in turn m ^ io se it to the defendants. I
         should be happy to expand on this in consultation w ith the Attorney.

         I am m ore troubled by the handling - in relation both to the judge, who m ay w ell have
         forgotten about his earlier involvement w ith this matter, and to Sir Geoffrey Dear,
         who (as far as I know) has no knowledge o f the                  m d has therefore never
         had the opportunity to comment on it.

         I am sorry that time does not allow me to write at any greater length. I am anxious to
         bring these papers w ith me when I accompany the Director to see the Attorney this
         afternoon. I trust that there is enough here to enable you to b rief the A ttorney
#
    adequately, but o f course I shall be happy to speak to you again as soon as you have
    had a chance to read the papers.

 R v D U CK EN FIELD AND M URRAY

I am instructed to write to you on b e h a lf o f the Crow n Prosecution Service. The South Yorkshire
P olice have sought advice from the C row n Prosecution Service about the disclosure o f a
docum ent in their possession w hich related to the H illsborough Stadium disaster and which m ay
therefore have a bearing on the current prosecution o f M essrs D uckenfield and M urray brought
by the H illsborough Fam ily Support Group (“the prosecutor”). M essrs D uckenfield and M urray
have been com m itted to stand trial at the C row n C ourt at Leeds. I u n derstand that the m atter is
listed for a hearing before you on 3 S eptem ber 1999, for issues o f disclosure to be considered.

The prosecutor has sought disclosure from the South Y orkshire P olice o f all docum ents in their
p o ssession w hich are relevant to the prosecution. T he docum ent about w hich the South
Yorkshire Police have sought advice is a report dated 12 April 19990, signed by
and a letter dated 23 July 1990, from Sir John W oodcock, then H M C h ie f Inspector o f
C o nstabulary , to M r R ichard W ells, then C h ie f C onstable o f the South Y orkshire Police. I
enclose copies o f those two docum ents.

The report by___________ vas draw n to the attention o f the then D irecto r o f P ublic Prosecutions
in 1990, who subsequently sought the advice o f Leading C ounsel as to the effect o f its content.
The advice w as given by you, then a m em ber o f the Bar, in an O p inion dated 27 July 1990. I
enclose a copy o f your O pinion.

T he C row n Prosecution Service has considered the report b y __________ |and the letter from Sir
John W oodcock intends to advise the South Yorkshire Police that they should be disclosed to the
prosecutor. B ecause the present D irector o f Public P rosecutions form erly acted for M r
D uckenfield, he has taken no p art in this decision. F ollow ing the usual practice o f the Crow n
P rosecution Service, they also intend to advise the South Y orkshire P olice that the docum ents
should be disclosed to both the prosecutor and the defendants at the sam e time. This advice will
extend to the report by|__________ |and the letter from Sir John W oodcock alone. There is no
suggestion by C row n Prosecution Service that either your O pinion, or any o f the associated
correspondence, should be disclosed to either the prosecutor or the defendants.
 I have been instructed to write to both the prosecutor and the defendants, informing them o f the
 existence of|___________ [report and Sir John W oodcock's letter enclosing a copy o f each. The
 C row n P rosecution Service also w ishes m e to draw to the attention o f both the prosecutor and
 the defendants that I have w ritten to you in the term s o f this letter; and preferably, to send to
 those concerned a copy o f this letter.

I sh o u ld be pleased to instruct C ounsel to appear before you on 3 S eptem ber to provide such
assistance as you w ould w ish. I have not yet instructed C ounsel in that capacity and should be
grateful to know your reaction to the proposal before doing so. T he C row n Prosecution Service
is anxious that I should write to both the prosecutor and the defendants as soon as possible, and
certainly before 3 Septem ber, but did not want to do so w ithout first draw ing the m atter to your
attention.

I should w elcom e any com m ents that you m ight care to m ake on the suggestion that I should
instruct Counsel to appear before you on 3 Septem ber; and on the letter that I intend to write to
the p rosecutor and the defendants in advance o f that date.          I should add that the C row n
Prosecution Service will ensure that              , Sir G eoffrey D ear, Sir C live W hitm ore and Sir
John W o o d co ck are all inform ed o f the disclosure o f the two docum ents in advance o f that
disclosure taking place.

However,       having       discussed         th i s    matter         recently   with       Superintendent
Bettison,      I     feel    it    only      right      that     the    record    be   put    straight.      I
still    believe       that       no   one    will       take    my     word    against      the   other   two

      Thank y o u for brincring to my notice the details of the
 report submitted    by
              ---------           i                 touching upon remarks
 alleged to have been made m          his presence by the     Rt Hon Lord
 Justice Taylor to Geoffrey Dear (then Chief Constable of the West
 Midlands Police) " o n i s t h April 199 0' at Hillsborough.

      A s agreed, sir Clive Whitmore, Permanent Under Secretary of
 State at the Home Office, and myself saw Lord Justice Taylor by
 appointment at 9.30am on Friday, 20th July 1990, at the Royal
 Courts of Justice in London.      Sir Clive outlined the details
 contained in the report which Lord Justice Taylor immediately
 rejected and described as nonsense.   Understandably he could not
 recall the details of what was discussed but was perfectly clear
     — T-^Q-re h a d been no comment as alleged by     the


     At   4.30pm the same day I saw M r Geoffrey Dear, H.M.
Inspector of Constabulary, in his Worcester Office.          After
outlining the allegations, he stated that he could not recall
^ j     of the conversation that took place but was emphatic that
had there bee n any suggestion of bias, either then or later, he
would have remembered and would have objected to it.    He further
emphasised that at all times Lord Justice Taylor was scrupulously
fair, absolutely correct and quite unequivocal in his pursuit of
the truth.

„        ^         , that this matter cannot be taken any further.
H o w e v e r , it is worth mentioning that although Lord Justice Taylor
carried out the inquiry 'alone', ~ he did have the benefit of
advisers, one of whom was Mr Brian Johnson, the Chief Constable
of Lancashire.

R v D U C K EN FIELD AND M URRAY

I am instructed to write to you on behalf o f the Crown Prosecution Service. The South Y orkshire
Police have sought advice from the Crown Prosecution Service about the disclosure o f a
document in their possession which related to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster and which may
therefore have a bearing on the current prosecution o f Messrs Duckenfield and Murray brought
by the Hillsborough Family Support Group (“the prosecutor”). Messrs Duckenfield and Murray
have been committed to stand trial at the Crown Court at Leeds. I understand that the matter is
listed for a hearing before you on 3 September 1999, for issues o f disclosure to be considered.

The prosecutor has sought disclosure from the South Yorkshire Police o f all documents in their
possession which are relevant to the prosecution. The document about which the South
Yorkshire Police have sought advice is a report dated 12 April 19990, signed by
and a letter dated 23 July 1990, from Sir John W oodcock, then HM Chief Inspector of
Constabulary, to M r Richard Wells, then C hief Constable o f the South Yorkshire Police. I
enclose copies o f those two documents.

The report by            was drawn to the attention o f the then Director o f Public Prosecutions
in 1990, who subsequently sought the advice o f Leading Counsel as to the effect o f its content.
The advice was given by you, then a member o f the Bar, in an Opinion dated 27 July 1990. I
enclose a copy o f your Opinion.

The Crown Prosecution Service has considered the report b>__________and the letter from Sir
John Woodcock intends to advise the South Yorkshire Police that they should be disclosed to the
prosecutor. Because the present Director o f Public Prosecutions formerly acted for Mr
Duckenfield, he has taken no part in this decision. Following the usual practice o f the Crown
Prosecution Service, they also intend to advise the South Yorkshire Police that the documents
should be disclosed to both the prosecutor and the defendants at the same time. This advice will
extend to the report by             and the letter from Sir John W oodcock alone. There is no
suggestion by Crown Prosecution Service that either your Opinion, or any o f the associated
correspondence, should be disclosed to either the prosecutor or the defendants.
 I have been instructed to write to both the prosecutor and the defendants, informing them of the
ex isten ce of___________ report and Sir Jo h n W oodcock's letter enclosing a copy o f each. The
C row n P rosecution Service also w ishes m e to draw to the attention o f b o th the prosecutor and
the defendants that I have w ritten to y o u in the term s o f this letter; and preferably, to send to
those concerned a copy o f this letter.

I sh ould be pleased to instruct C ounsel to appear before y o u on 3 S ep tem b er to provide such
assistance as you w ould w ish. I have not yet instructed C ounsel in that capacity and should be
grateful to know your reaction to the proposal b efore doing so. T he C row n P rosecution Service
is anxious that I should w rite to both the prosecutor and the defendants as so o n as possible, and
certainly before 3 Septem ber, but did not w ant to do so w ithout first d raw in g the m atter to your
attention.

I sh ould w elcom e any com m ents that y o u m ight care to m ake on the su ggestion that I should
instruct C ounsel to appear before y o u on 3 Septem ber; and on the letter that I intend to w rite to
the p ro se c u to r and the defendants in advance o f that date.      I should add that the C row n
Prosecution S ervice w ill ensure that               Sir G eoffrey D ear, Sir C live W hitm ore and Sir
Jo h n W o o d co ck are all inform ed o f the disclosure o f the tw o d o cu m en ts in advance o f that
disclosure taking place.

However,       having       discussed         this    matter        recently   with       Superintendent
Bettison,      I     feel    it    only      right    that    the    record    be   put    straight.      I

                Thank y o u for bringing to m y notice the details of the
           report submitted by                            touching upon remarks
           alleged
           _  ..   to have been           in m s presence b y the   Rt Hon Lord
           Justice Taylor to Geoffrey Dear {then chief Constable of the West
           Midlands Police) on 1 3 t h April 1930' at Hillsborough.

                As agreed, Sir Clive Whitmore, Permanent Under Secretary of
           State at the Home Office, and myself saw Lord Justice Taylor by
           appointment at 9.30am on Friday, 20th Jul y 1990, at the Royal
           Courts of Justice in London.     Sir Clive outlined the details
           contained in the report which Lord Justice Taylor immediately
           rejected and described as nonsense.  Understandably he could not
           recall the details of what was discussed but was perfectly clear
                        u. —-a i_________    .              r        ----------------
                     e h a d been no comment as alleged by      the


                  At   4.30pm the same day I saw M r Geoffrey Dear, H.M.
           Inspector of Constabulary,          in his Worcester Office.      After
           outlining the allegations, he stated that he could not recall
           details of the conversation that t ook place but was emphatic that
           hat\ * h ®re b e e n any suggestion of bias, either then or later, he
           would have remembered and would h a v e objected to it.      He further
           emphasised that at all times Lord Justice Taylor was scrupulously
           fair, absolutely correct and quite unequivocal in hiB pursuit of
           the truth. .

                ^      . ^ at this matter cannot be taken any further.
          However, it is worth mentioning that although Lord Justice Taylor
          Cjr f    out       inquiry “alone, ' h e did have the benefit of
          advisers, one of whom waB Mr Brian Johnson, the Chief Constable
          of Lancashire.

               I trust this               information     will
          issue in question.

     R v D U C K EN FIELD AND M URRA Y

     Thank you for your letter o f 16 August 1999 and its enclosure. I have now discussed your
     letter w ith the Attorney General.

     The Attorney is firmly o f the view that the letter from Sir John W oodcock o f 23 July 1990
     should be disclosed to the parties to the prosecution at the same tim e as the report by____
              W hilst he agrees that Sir Geoffrey Dear should be informed o f the impending
     disclosure in advance, he does not believe that it is necessary to consult Sir Geoffrey. In his
     opinion, even if Sir Geoffrey were to object to the disclosure o f Sir John’s letter, the South
     Yorkshire Police (and the Crown Prosecution Service, since we have a copy o f the letter)
     would have no option but to disclose it, in the interests o f justice. As you say, Sir John’s
     letter completes the picture in an important respect. As things stand, o f course, w e are all
     agreed that it would be highly unlikely that Sir Geoffrey would object in any event.

     In reaching this decision (that is, to inform Sir Geoffrey in advance o f disclosure) I discussed
     specifically w ith the Attorney w hether there was anything improper in giving Sir Geoffrey
     this advance notice. W e are satisfied that there is not. The picture has clearly changed since
     we discovered that Sir Geoffrey was made aware o f the report in 1990.

     In the light o f my discussion w ith the Attorney, the draft letter to M r Justice Hooper clearly
     needs amendment. I am enclosing w ith this an amended draft for you to consider, on which I
     have shown m y amendments in bold.

     Subject to your comments on these amendments and to any further advice from you, I should
     be grateful if you would now w rite to M r Justice Hooper as agreed. I shall speak to you by
     telephone in the next couple o f days about how we go about informing                     Sir
     Geoffrey, Sir Clive and Sir John.

                               M atters to be raised by the Crown


1      Length o f trial The prosecution hesitates to estimate the length o f the trial, because it
       has yet to see the voluminous collections o f papers prepared by W est Midlands Police
       for the Inquiry in 1989 by Lord Taylor; for the Crown Prosecution Service in 1989-90;
       for the Coroner in 1989-91; and, with other forces, for the Police Complaints
       Authority in 1989-92. It has acted so far on the basis o f :


               (i)     the limited number o f statements made available by the Home Office to
                       the prosecution in 1997-8;
               (ii)    transcripts o f the Taylor Inquiry and inquests made available at the time
                       o f these inquiries;
               (iii)   edited and unedited statements o f South Yorkshire police put in the
                       House o f Common library at the insistence o f the Home Secretary in
                       April 1998 ;
               (iv)    the material made available in the last year by the Crown Prosecution
                        Service (who were given in 1990, for the purposes o f deciding whether
                       to bring prosecutions arising from the disaster, only about 11% o f the
                       total statements collected)


1.1     All the original and copy material is held by the South Yorkshire police, but, as
        appears below, there is doubt and uncertainty as to the extent o f disclosure which that
        force will make, and the terms on which it will be made.


1.2     However, the central part o f the prosecution case is likely to be the evidence o f
        witnesses w hose statements were served for committal, which are likely to be
        uncontroversial; photographic, video and other documentary evidence; and the
        admissions o f the defendants to the Taylor Inquiry and the Coroner’s Inquest.


 1.3    It is thought likely at this stage that the prosecution case will be complete in three to
        four weeks. The prosecution believes that the defence will probably call no evidence.



                                                 1
1.4   The prosecution believes that the issues in the case are likely to turn on the
      interpretation o f known events, rather than on disputed questions o f fact. This forecast
      is tentative because, in accordance with the observations made at the outset o f the
      abuse o f process hearing to the magistrate by leading counsel for M r Duckenfield,
      supported by leading counsel for M r M urray, the nature o f the defence did not emerge
      at the lower court. At the abuse o f process hearing and committal proceedings, the
      defendants declined to give evidence.


1.5   In assessing the length o f the trial, it should be borne in mind that, some months after a
      preliminary committal bundle had been served, it was estimated by leading counsel for
      M r Murray on 21st December 1998 at the Leeds M agistrates Court that the committal
      would take at least four weeks, apart from the abuse o f process hearing. In the event,
      the committal proceedings took less than three days, after an abuse o f process hearing
      which took less than five days.


2     The defence. In the interests o f trial management, it is submitted that the defendants
      should be invited to set out in general terms the nature o f their defence, as if this were
      a case to which section 5 (5) and (6) o f the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act
      1996 applied. (It has been agreed by all parties that, since there had been a police
      investigation in 1989-90, the provisions o f that Act did not apply; hence the “old-
      style” committal and disclosure procedures govern the case.)


3     Admissions. The defendants made admissions o f uncontroversial facts at committal
      under section 10 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1967, but insisted on purporting to limit
      the scope o f those admissions to the committal proceedings.


3.1   The prosecution has invited the solicitors for the defendants by letter o f 22nd July 1999
      to indicate before 3rd September that the same admissions will be made for trial, and, if
      not, to explain why. The prosecution wishes to know now whether it needs to incur
      the expense o f proving the subject-matter o f those admissions formally at the trial.
      Relevant correspondence between prosecution and defence since committal is Annex
      A.


3.2   In particular, it will be argued that the leave o f the court is needed by virtue o f section
      10 (4) o f the 1967 A ct to withdraw the admissions, notwithstanding the purported
      limitation on their effect.




                                                2
The admission in evidence o f the defendants’ evidence to previous inquiries. The
prosecution submits that the defendants should disclose at an early stage whether they
intend to object to the admission in evidence o f their evidence to the Taylor Inquiry
and the Inquest, interviews with W est Midlands Police? and should indicate in writing
the legal basis for any such objections. It is submitted that, should any such argument
be contemplated, the matter should be resolved at an early preliminary hearing. If the
evidence were to be excluded, the prosecution would need to prove some o f the basic
facts admitted in the course o f that evidence, to the extent that it were possible, by
other means.


Disclosure o f the Hillsborough archive. A bundle o f correspondence passing between
the prosecution and the South Yorkshire police is attached as Annex B. At present the
Chief Constable holds all the papers relating to the disaster that were collected for
other judicial and investigative bodies. The Crown needs to see them. It is submitted
that there is no lawful basis upon which the Chief Constable should be regarded as the
custodian o f the papers, capable o f deciding for himself whether, to whom, and under
what conditions those papers should be disclosed.


The Court will be asked to give guidance to the Chief Constable to make available all
material described in the letter o f Ann Adlington to M r Daines o f 20th August 1999, on
the same modest financial terms that the Crown Prosecution Service imposed when it
disclosed its material last January. The Court should particularly request disclosure o f
material in usable disc form as well as originals o f documents requested. It appears that
it will be unnecessary to conduct legal argument about the legal basis for disclosure;
the letter o f M r M etcalf o f 26th July 1999 indicates that the Chief Constable will act
upon a request from a court.


It had been hoped to have resolved this matter by agreement before 3rd September. The
most recent letter from M r Daines o f 26th August suggests, however, that this problem,
which was raised by the prosecution on 22nd July 1999, tw o days after committal, will
not be resolved for some time in the absence o f guidance and requests from the Court.
The only material that was disclosed by the South Yorkshire police to the prosecution
before the committal hearing consisted o f a few documents that the prosecution was
able to identify with the precision required by section 97 o f the Magistrates Court
1980, and one document that was “voluntarily disclosed” . They were produced to the
court only after a formal application for a witness summons, the issue o f which the
Chief Constable opposed in its entirety through lawyers at court on 10th May 1999.
 5.3    In spite o f the ostensibly open attitude displayed by the South Yorkshire police since
         committal, the prosecution fears procrastination and delay, in the light o f the unco­
         operative attitude shown by the force in the previous twelve months,. I f the trial is not
         to take place until summer 2000, it is vital that the long inspection process should
         begin in September 1999, before the administrative demands o f a pending trial become
         pressing.


 The conditions required by the South Yorkshire police


 5.4    The reference by M r Daines at the end o f his letter o f 26th August to assurances and an
        “administration charge” are set out in the letter o f M r M etcalf o f 30th December 1998
        (not “ September”).


5.5    These conditions are unacceptable. The “ conditions” numbered 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3
        cannot be insisted upon. The only bodies with standing even to seek any such
        conditions would be the bodies for whom the material was collected, namely, the
        Taylor Inquiry (Home Office); the CPS; the Coroner; and the Police Complaints
        Authority. It appears to be accepted by M r M etcalf in his letter o f 26th July 1999 that
        the archive is not held by South Yorkshire police by legal right.


5.6    The South Yorkshire police are not competent to request the conditions for the further
        reason that the common law implies limitations upon the use o f material obtained for
        the purposes o f criminal proceedings. These implied undertakings provide adequate
       protection for the rights o f others. See Taylor v. Serious F ra u d O ffice [1998] 3
       W.L.R. 1041 (HL).


5 .7   It is particularly offensive to seek to “require” a brief explanation o f the relevance o f
       documents to the charges for the following reasons:


               (i) the Chief Constable is not to be the judge o f the relevance o f documents to
               legal issues; nor should he or his lawyer claim be the arbiter o f the question o f
               what material should be disclosed to, and subsequently by, the Crown;


               (ii) the Chief Constable has supported the defendants in these criminal
               proceedings; although he has always admitted in civil proceedings that the
               conduct o f which the defendants are accused was negligent, and caused death,
               he has procured the funding o f their defence by the South Yorkshire Police
               Authority in full, and all associated costs and expenses, ■both for the criminal

                                                 4
               defence to these charges, and for any ancillary judicial review proceedings that
               the defendants may be advised to bring;


               (iii) M r Daines expressed the view in a police periodical, after the “ Scrutiny” o f
               Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1998, that any private prosecution was likely to
               “fall at the first hurdle” ;


               (iv) the prosecution has common law duties to disclose any material that may
               possibly be relevant to the defence (see R v. Keane (1994) 99 Cr. App. R. 1),
               and to disclose material in the possession o f “the total apparatus o f the
               Crown”(i? v. W a rd {\9 9 3) 96 Cr. App. 1.)


5.8     The charges o f £30.00 per hour, proposed by M r M etcalf to be levied for the purposes
        o f copying the material to the prosecution, are extortionate. To seek, in addition, to
        levy the same charge on the prosecution for copying the same material to the defence
        solicitors, who are in any event supported by the local police fund, is calculated to
        frustrate the prosecution and the criminal process. The prosecution is not supported
        by public funds. By contrast, the Crown Prosecution Service has copied all its “non­
        sensitive” material for the prosecution at a purely nominal cost, without conditions or
        resentment.


5.9     For information., correspondence passing between the Crown Prosecution Service and
        prosecution on this subject is attached as Annex C.


The earlier control o f the papers by South Yorkshire police


5 .10   The Court is asked to bear in mind in this m atter that the South Yorkshire police force,
        in its own interests, appears to have exercised a tight control over the papers in the
        case at critical stages in the history o f the investigations into the Hillsborough disaster.
        Attached are letters w ritten in relation to disclosure o f statements at the main Inquest
        between November 1990 and M arch 1991 in connection with requests o f Trevor Hicks
        and Sandra Stringer, bereaved parents (Annex D ). These letters, w ritten by very senior
        members o f the W est Midlands police, suggest that South Yorkshire police, who were
        an interested party at the Inquest, and w ho were engaged at the time in civil
        proceedings, controlled the process o f disclosing material to the bereaved families at
        the Inquest through their lawyers.


5 .11    The lawyers acting for South Yorkshire police at the time the W est Midlands police

                                                  5
        made these assertions were Hammond Suddards o f Leeds, and in particular, M r Peter
        Metcalf, who has advised the police about the prosecution s requests for disclosure
        since this prosecution was instituted in July 1998.


5.12    Attached are other letters showing that the South Yorkshire police, sometimes with
        the help o f the Coroner, controlled the disclosure o f material collected by or for other
        agencies after the inquest until the disclosure ordered by the Home Office in 1997
        (Annex E ). These matters were referred to in the witness statement o f Ann Adlington
        which constituted her evidence in chief at the abuse o f process hearing at the Leeds
        M agistrates Court on 8th July 1999. Although she was cross-examined extensively
        about other matters, her evidence in relation to this correspondence w as not
        challenged or investigated by the defence.


5.13    For all these reasons it is submitted that it is imperative that the prosecution achieves
        early and complete access to the archive; and welcomes the full co-operation o f the
        Crown Prosecution Service in this process as a neutral party. It is submitted that all
        the material should ideally be transferred to the control o f the Crown Prosecution
        Service, and that disclosure should thereafter be made as requested by the court.
        Otherwise, the court is asked to request full and unrestrained access to all the archive
        in the possession o f South Yorkshire police, at all normal working hours, and that the
        prosecution can take its own photocopier and computers to the archive, subject to the
        supervision o f the CPS.


5 .14    The defence have hitherto declined to support the Crown in its requests for disclosure
         o f the Hillsborough archive. It may be that both defendants have had access to it
         already. W inkworth Sherwood, who now represent M r Duckenfield, represented the
         legal interests o f the Chief Constable during the “ Scrutiny” o f Lord Justice Stuart-
         Smith, and have presumably had access to, and may retain copies of, m ost o f the
         relevant material. It is to be presumed that M r Duckenfield instructed them to defend
         him in the current proceedings with these matters in mind.


 5.15    M r Maiming o f W alker M orris represented M r M urray throughout the Inquest, where
         he undoubtedly had access, formally and informally, to extensive South Yorkshire
         police documents and information denied to those who represented the bereaved
         families.


 5.16    The defence is invited to support the prosecution position in relation to the
         Hillsborough archive.

                                                   6
Access to o rig in a l documents; the significance o f the edited statements


5.17    At the insistence o f the Home Secretary, all South Yorkshire police statements
        relevant to the disaster were placed in the House o f Commons library in April 1998.
        There are over 100 examples o f police statements, edited so as to remove assertions o f
        fact hostile to South Yorkshire police, m ost o f which could not have been shown to
        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1997, who reported only a few examples o f editing.
        Evidence is available suggesting that this editing process was conducted by South
        Yorkshire police officers under the advice or guidance o f M r Metcalf. Only the edited
        versions were sent to the CPS and Coroner in 1990 and 1991. The prosecution should
        be entitled to inspect all original documents and insist upon their transmission to the
        court where they are o f evidential relevance..


6      Disclosure. The prosecution disclosed all the witness statements and exhibits in its
        possession to the defence before committal, allowing full inspection at its Liverpool
        offices. The subject is dealt with in a letter from the prosecution to W inkworth
        Sherwood dated 27th August in Annex A.


7      The indictment. Counts 1, 2 and 3 reflect the charges on which the defendants were
        committed for trial. Counts 4 and 5 have been added as permitted by the proviso to
        section 2 (2) o f the Administration o f Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933. As
       a matter o f history, count 4 is based upon a charge alleged in the summons issued by
       the Leeds M agistrates Court in July 1998, but which the Crown Prosecution Service
       took over under section 6 (2) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985, and
       discontinued under section 23 (3), in April 1999. Count 5 is new.


7.1    It is submitted that M r Duckenfield told lies to representatives o f the Football
       Association, his superior officer M r Jackson and others about the circumstances in
       which the Gate C (and perhaps other gates) became open. Contemplating that an
       inquest or other forms o f judicial inquiry would be instituted, and knowing that
       inquiries were being made by persons which were relevant to such judicial inquiries,
       M r Duckenfield sought, at a time when it was apparent to him and many others that
       fatalities had been caused, to attribute the deaths to the actions o f Liverpool supporters
       in breaking open a gate or gates. R v. Vreones [1891] 1 Q.B. 360; R v. Selvage and
       M organ (1982) 73 Cr. App. R. 333




                                                 7
7.2   M r Duckenfield admitted telling these lies, and allowing others to believe them, when
      cross-examined at the Taylor Inquiry. A jury is entitled to believe that he told these
      lies, not in order to prevent supporters turning in anger on the police, but to deflect
      blame from himself at the inevitable judicial inquiry or inquiries.


7.3   The same facts support the lesser charge o f misconduct in public office; R v. Dytham
      (1979) 69 Cr. App. R. 387


8     Copies o f this argument and relevant annexes will be provided to the Crown
      Prosecution Service, and M r Daines, with an invitation to both to attend or be
       represented at the hearing on 3rd September.

27th August 1999

Dear M r Eastwood,

R v. Duckenfield and M urray

I trust you have received earlier this afternoon the copy o f the draft indictment we have
forwarded today to the Crown C ourt at Leeds. I should also tell you that in response to
requests for documents from the C ourt we have sent them copies o f the opening note,
prepared for committal; skeleton arguments presented on the abuse o f process issue by
prosecution and defendants; my witness statement forming part o f my evidence at the
M agistrates Court; and the Interim Taylor report.

Please let me have copies o f any documents you have lodged with the court.

I refer to paragraph numbers o f my letter to you o f 21st July and adopted by you in your
response o f 11th August.

Paragraphs 3 and 4. We raised this m atter because M r Clegg QC suggested in his argument
that we had improperly selected witnesses, but are content to act now on the basis that you
accept that it is a matter for us to lead evidence that the prosecution consider appropriate.
Nonetheless, we invite you again to set out the defence in general terms so that we can
conduct the selection process efficiently with regard to matters in dispute. You misunderstand
what we said in paragraph 4; w e need to know what the actual issues in the case between
prosecution and defence will be, and what legal issues are dispute, given M r Clegg’s public
oral and written acceptance o f the findings o f the Taylor Inquiry. However, M r Clegg told the
magistrate at the abuse o f process hearing that the defence would not emerge in the course o f
the proceedings before the magistrate. We invite you to take a more positive and helpful
approach now and to confirm that it is not disputed that the failure to close off the tunnel
when the Gates were opened was “ a blunder o f the first magnitude”

Paragraphs 7, 8 and 9. We are hoping that we shall be able to report positive news about the
matter o f the disclosure o f the South Yorkshire Hillsborough archive before next Friday.




           P hone 0151 23-6 1 5 1 3 . F a x 0151 23<S 1S3<5. E M all m fo ^ tfs g .a r g

I now deal with your requests.

Unused Material I refer to your letter o f 24th June. W e have a few other documents, such as
the Phillips report and the report o f Noel Bums, which you will know about, because they
were produced or referred to by the South Yorkshire police when you represented them in the
course o f the “ Scrutiny” . We presume your firm already has a copy o f these because your firm
represented the force during the “ Scrutiny”and had full access, obviously, to relevant
documents.

We do not propose to incur the costs o f copying all the Taylor and Inquest transcripts. In
order for M r Clegg to have made the suggestion that w e had been guilty o f improper selection
o f witnesses, and for him to have reported to the South Yorkshire Police Authority last
December that the DPP had seen all the evidence in 1990, he must have read all this material.
South Yorkshire police, whom you represented in the “ Scrutiny” m ust have had all this
material then.

The Taylor transcripts are all in the Public Record Office, and M r Isaacs received copies o f the
transcripts o f evidence at the Inquest every day. Further, the Taylor reports were available to
you when the CPS allowed inspection and copying facilities last January. We understand that
they are still so available.

The Memorial to the Attorney-General was circulated to you in the course o f the committal
proceedings. The submissions o f counsel prepared for the Home Secretary in March 1997
were made available to you by the Crown Prosecution Service and are in the House o f
Commons library, which we know you visited in July or August 1998.

If, however, you wish to insist that we should copy this material for you, please indicate what
rate per hour you propose to pay us for the copying process. We appreciate the costs may
vary according to whether your client is legally aided, paying for his own defence, or in receipt
o f all his costs and expenses from the South Yorkshire taxpayer.

We shall endeavour to give you a definitive list o f material in our current possession soon after
the hearing on 3rd September, but you will appreciate that we are receiving new factual
information from time to time as we prepare for the trial.

We invite you to be in a position to inform the court next Friday whether you will make the
admissions o f fact you made at the M agistrates Court, and, if not, to explain why. We raised
this matter with you on 22nd July.

On 3rd September 1999 we shall invite the court;

    Dear Sirs

    Adiington -v- Duckenfield and Murray
    We refer to your letters o f 21 and 22 July which we are naturally forwarding to Counsel for
    com m ent and consideration.

    It may be helpful if we made some prelim inary comments on your letters in advance o f that
    specific advice.

    Letter 21 July 1999

     Paragraph 2:          You will anticipate the plea on the basis o f the arguments put to the
                           magistrate at the committal hearing.

     Paragraph 3:          We find the invitation offered greatly surprising. For the avoidance o f
                           doubt it has been, and continues to be, the defence view that it is for the
                           prosecution to prepare their case, and to lead the evidence considered
                           appropriate to support the charges.

     Paragraph 4:          Having heard M r Jones QC outline the prosecution case at the com mittal,
                           we are once again surprised at the suggestion that the prosecution does not
                           “understand the issues” . Surely it is a m atter for the prosecution to
                           consider, against the background o f the relevant law, what evidence it
                           needs to lead in support o f the charges for w hich the defendants have been
                           committed. As M r Jones made clear at the committal, all steps taken in
                           regard to this prosecution have been taken w ith the benefit o f Leading
                           Counsel’s advice and we would have thought that the prosecution would
                           have a very clear view as to what evidence it needed to call.

     Paragraph 7:          A s indicated previously, it is the defence view that the prosecution must
                            m ake its own enquiries and obtain its ow n evidence. A ccordingly we
                            w ould be grateful if you could keep us advised o f your endeavours to
                            obtain the South Yorkshire Police archives, and specifically if it is

                      intended to make any application to the Court in this respect.

     Paragraph 8:     Once again this m ust be a m atter for the prosecution. We have already
                      indicated to you that w e may be able to help in the confirm ation o f
                      addresses for some o f the retired South Y orkshire Police officers. That
                      invitation lias been declined previously, but once again indicate we would
                      be happy to check w ith our client as to w hether any inform ation can be
                      obtained in regard to any police officers you w ould care to specify.

     Paragraph 9:      W e are not sure on w hat basis you suggest that “the prosecution and
                       defence have a com m on interest in the disclosure o f the archive” . If we
                       do w rite to South Y orkshire Police and Mr C roston on this issue, we are
                       happy to let you see correspondence. We m ust m ake clear how ever that it
                       is not our present intention to do so.

     Paragraph 10:     W e note your request for specific advice by Friday 20 August, and
                       confirm if there are any further comments after receiving Counsel’s
                       advice we will convey them to you without delay.

     Paragraph 11:     M atters related to the funding o f the defence are m atters for the defence.
                       We share the view expressed by M r Justice Cresswell at the judicial
                       review proceeding w hen HFSG, through M r Jones, w as encouraged Ho
                       reflect on the position and the role o f a prosecutor and the importance of
                       the position taken by a prosecutor. It would be m ost extraordinary in my
                       experience if any prosecutor attacked the funding o f the defence”. In
                       fairness, given the history o f H FSG ’s attempts to have South Yorkshire
                       Police Authority funding o f the defence w ithdrawn in this matter, we are
                       not sure what to make o f this “offer” . Is it the intention o f HFSG to make
                       representations to the Police Authority, and if so may we be advised o f
                       their nature?

      Letter 22 July 1999

      We note that you have written to M r M etcalfe o f Hammond Suddards and copied that on to
      M r Croston.

      Your attempts to obtain further docum entation to assist the prosecution m ust be a matter for
      you but naturally if you intend to make any formal application at the foreshadowed hearing
      before M r Justice Hooper on 3 September, regarding the obtaining o f further documentary
      evidence, we would be grateful if you could give us prior notice at the earliest opportunity.
      Wre would also be grateful if you could let us have copies o f any correspondence between
      yourselves, Ham m ond Suddards and M r Croston in regard to this issue.

      In addition to the above matters, the question o f disclosure o f m aterial held by the
      prosecution is clearly a matter requiring your urgent attention. To assist we offer the
      following comments:

      1)       We refer to our letter o f 24 June and outline o f documents. In that correspondence
               we requested a number o f documents and confirm ation that the schedule reflected
               the m aterial held by you. W e aw ait your clarification accordingly, in the context o f
               our entitlem ent to our schedule o f unused m aterial, and the copy documents
               requested.

  2)       W e presum e you will let us have copies o f documents 1 and 2 (the Taylor and
           inquest transcripts) referred to in the previous outline schedule. Please confirm.

  3)       A t the com m ittal hearing Counsel requested copies o f the following documents
           referred to in the statement o f A nn Adlington 30 June 1999:

           a)         paragraph 32, the “m em orial” ;

           b)         paragraph 46, 1997 submissions to the Home Secretary and DPP.

           We w ould be grateful for copies o f these documents in due course.

  Finally, subject to further discussion w ith Counsel, we anticipate the question o f the tim ing
  o f a further application for stay o f proceedings on the basis o f abuse o f process will be
  raised before M r Justice H ooper on 3 September. W e are very m indful o f the Listing
  O fficer’s letter o f 30 July which indicates His Lordship wishes to conduct a full plea and
  directions hearing to deal with as many pre-trial m atters as possible. Accordingly, if there
  are any further m atters relevant to the hearing that are raised once we have discussed same
  w ith Counsel, w e will advise you accordingly. Similarly, we would be grateful if there are
  any other m atters not raised in this correspondence, or in your correspondence, that you
  intend to raise before the Court, if we could be,advised in advance.

   We are naturally keen to continue liaison prior to the hearing to ensure that matters proceed
   smoothly and particularly where timetabling issues are discussed, the parties can put
   forward (insofar as possible) a joint approach. W ith this in mind we are asking C ounsel’s
   clerks to consider diary availability so that we can take account o f all possibilities when
   attending before the Judge.

   We look forw ard to hearing from you accordingly.

   Yours faithfully

    Dear M r Eastwood

    R v. Duckenfield and M u rray

    Further to our letter(s) o f yesterday, we enclose a copy o f a letter that we have sent to Mr
    M etcalf o f Hammond Suddards and copied to M r Croston. We would welcome your support.

    Since we expect M r Justice Hooper will wish to set a tight timetable, we invite you to respond
    promptly. You know the arguments. In addition to the matters I set out in writing yesterday, I
    would invite you to indicate by 6th August that you will make the same admissions at trial that
    you made for committal, and, if not, to explain why. We need to know at an early stage
    whether time and money are to be spent on matters that are not, in fact, in dispute.

    Yours sincerely,

Dear M r Eastwood


R v. D uckenfield and M u rray

1      Although the trial o f this matter is not imminent, the unusual circumstances o f its
       history require some fairly urgent decisions to be made by all parties, and we ask you
       to co-operate with the Crown in a number o f matters in order to identify the issues at
       trial, to reduce costs, and to simplify preparation.

2      We invite you first to indicate whether your client proposes to plead guilty or not
       guilty to the charge o f manslaughter. A plea o f guilty to manslaughter would, in the
       view o f the Crown, make it unnecessary to try misfeasance.

3      In the course o f the abuse o f process hearing, complaint was made by the defence,
       unsuccessfully, that the prosecution was in breach o f principles underlying the criminal
       justice system in its selection o f witnesses. As you know our approach was informed
       by the provision o f the common law that we needed to call only such evidence as
       would prove a prima facie case. In the quiet period over the next few weeks, we shall
       be considering what evidence should be called at trial in the light o f arguments
        presented in the last three weeks. We invite you to provide us with a list o f witnesses
       whom you say the prosecution “ought” to call on the manslaughter issue, with in each
        case, a short explanation o f the issue between prosecution and defence to which that
       witness is relevant, and the reason why justice requires that we call him.




          Phone 0151 236 1919. Fax 0151 236 1936. E Mail info@hfsg.org
        ljt Floor C entral Buildings 41 North John Street Liverpool L2 6RR
•
    4    In order for us to consider such requests, it will o f course be necessary for you to set
          out the general outline o f the defence, so that we can understand the issues, and make
          informed decisions as to whether we have a duty to call such evidence, so far as we
          regard the witness in question as a witness o f truth.

    5    It is also a matter o f great urgency that we should have foil access to the archive o f
          papers held by South Yorkshire police. We have repeatedly argued, in response to
          successive complaints by the defendants that the proceedings are unfair, oppressive,
          unjust, etc, that the South Yorkshire police are in control o f the papers as a result o f a
          manipulative legal fiction, and that each piece o f evidence belongs in fact to the body
          for whom the W est Midlands police collected or compiled it: Lord Taylor; the CPS;
          the Coroner; or the Police Complaints Authority.

    6    We have received no reply to this argument from the South Yorkshire police, nor from
         either defendant. You are familiar with it from our representations to the CPS last
         autumn, our representations to the South Yorkshire police authority, our skeleton
         argument to the Divisional Court in March, and our abuse o f process argument to the
         magistrate. You have failed for more tharra year now to support our application that
         the papers be made available for all parties in the criminal case, but you may now agree
         that the new Crown Court context o f the case requires a fresh approach.

    7    We therefore ask you now to support our application for the archive to be handed over
         to some neutral third party, so that prosecution and defence can have access to it for
         preparation for trial. Please support us by writing to M r Daines o f the South
         Yorkshire police, and by copying that letter to M r Croston o f the CPS, requesting him
         to issue guidance to the South Yorkshire police that they should hand the archive over.


    8    We also request you to join with us in our request to M r Daines for the present work
         or home addresses o f serving and retired officers o f the South Yorkshire police to be
         made available to prosecution or defence on demand. W e imagine you will have no
         objection to this, in view o f the suggestion made by defence counsel at committal that
         we “ought” to call certain officers who were on duty at the ground on the day o f the
         disaster.

    9    Please copy any letters you send to the South Yorkshire police and M r Croston to us.
          The prosecution and defence have a common interest in the disclosure o f the archive,
         and o f course your support would be valuable to us since the Chief Constable o f South
         Yorkshire actively supports the defence in this case.

    10   We invite you to deal with the matters set out in paragraphs 5 to 9 this week, and the
         other matters by Friday 20th August, so that w e can all prepare proper written
         arguments for the assistance o f M r Justice Hooper.
•
    11 ’   We understand that you have to make a renewed application for funding to the South
           Yorkshire Police Authority. W e trust that this will not cause a delay. I f necessary we
           would be prepared to write a letter to that authority, supporting a request by the
           defence that the application, whatever the outcome, be determined expeditiously.
           Please let us know whether we can assist in this respect.

    Yours sincerely

               D8ar Mrs Adlington

               ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

               I refer to your letter of 20 August 1999. I have discussed your letter with Mr George Croston,
               CPS, and Mr Peter Metcalfe, Hammond Suddards.

               If we are in possession of items 1 - 9 and I can find them then I am prepared to disclose them.
               In particular, I do not know whether we hold pocket books of officers containing notes of the
               events of 15 April 1989 (item 2 on your list). If we hold the pocket books, I will disclose the
               relevant pages. I will let you know as soon as the position is clear.

               I am not at liberty to disclose the opinions of Gareth Williams, QC. and Peter Birts, QC. They
               were commissioned by the DPP and it is for him to decide whether he wishes to disclose
               them. Similarly, I am not at liberty to disclose the West Midlands Police Report to the DPP.
               However, if Mr Croston wishes either document to be released and we have copies of them, I
               will release them to you.

               I will enquire whether it is possible to transfer HOLMES material onto a disc for your use (item
               12 on your list). I will need to check with the Home Office whether they wish me to release
               material in this manner, the HOLMES system is a Home Office system.

               You ask me to define what I mean by “supervised'' access. This is Mr Croston's phrase and
               perhaps you should clarify it with him. For my part, I see it in the following terms:

               You will come to our archive store. If you wish to be accompanied by legally qualified staff. I
               would ask to be told of their names before arrival. Material will be brought from the storeroom
               to another room and you will examine the material while my staff are in the room but they will
               not overhear your conversations. If you want a document to be copied, my staff will do that
               either immediately or as soon as practicable. Originals will be returned to the store.

               On 30 September 1998, my solicitor Peter Metcalfe (Hammond Suddards) wrote to you and at
               paragraphs 2.1, 2.2 and 3 he asked for assurances from you regarding confidentiality and
               payment of an administration charge. Please respond to these requests.

               Yours sincerely

Dear M r Daines,

R v. Duckenfield and M u rra y

Yesterday I received from you by fax a handwritten note apologising for two errors in a letter
you say you had written earlier.

I have not received that earlier letter perhaps because, as on at least one earlier occasion, you
sent it by second class post.

Please fax me a copy o f that letter this afternoon. I emphasised in my letters o f 12*, 20* and
26th August why this m atter is urgent.

Yours sincerely,




Ann Adlington

 Dear M r Daines

 R v. D uckenfield and M u rra y


 tW M r       ♦ y° Ur ! r ted 17 August’ which we received by fax . We are encouraged
 that M r Croston is to be involved m the process o f disclosure. I earnestly hope that it can
 begin soon so that a clearly defined procedure is established and operating in advance o f the
 hearing before M r Justice H ooper on 3rd September.

 I write on the basis that you have satisfied yourself that you are in a position, in law to
  isclose material prepared and collected, not only by the South Yorkshire police fo rk s own
 and external investigations, but also by the jy e s t Midlands police force, and any other outside
 police force that may have investigated the disaster, for the purposes o f:


         i6*t A p rin 9 7 9 C° mi™SSi0ned ^ thC ChiCf Constable o fth e South Yorkshire police on

(1)    The originals o f all signed edited and unedited reports and statements made by officers
       o f the South Yorkshire and any other police forces (eg N ottin ghamshire and
       Merseyside) relating to the disaster and its surrounding circumstances. It is necessaiy
       for us to see these because o f the scale o f the editing exercise, and because there is
       doubt surrounding the circumstances in which parts o f some statements came to be
       written. The best example o f this is, o f course, the confusion surrounding the
       statements o f Inspector Harry White. You will recall that another statement o f his
       came to light after a letter from D r Popper to M r Croston in June o f this year.

       For the avoidance o f doubt, this category includes all statements made by officers as to
       the lies told by David Duckenfield on 15th April 1989 about the circumstances in which
       the exit gates became open.

(2)   All pocket-books o f officers containing notes o f the events o f 15th April, whether made
      contemporaneously, or within days, or later, and all handwritten and typed “resumes”,
      or other similar notes, made by officers shortly after the incident. The
      Nottinghamshire officers, Brazener, who was called as a live witness at committal,
      Hoad, and Walton refer to them. ( See reports R 498, R 499, and R 450, where one o f
      these resumes is apparently attached.)

(3)   All original signed statements collected by the W est Midlands police from those who
      had been present at or in the vicinity o f the ground at the time o f the disaster.

(4)   All notes and tape recordings o f meetings held by South Yorkshire police officers in
      the days and weeks after the disaster at which assertions o f fact, admissible under
      section 24 o f the Criminal Justice Act 1988, were made about the disaster. (An
      example is the collection o f three sets o f briefing notes o f meetings held by or under
      the auspices o f the Chief Constable on 16th, 17th and 19th April, which were produced
      by you to the M agistrates Court on 24th June. I f the notes are a transcript o f a tape
      recording, w e wish to hear and have copies o f those tape recordings also)

(5)   All documents, photographs, plans, videotape and models, either prepared to show or
       demonstrate the lay-out o f the ground, or which record events at Hillsborough
       between 1 and 6 pm on 15th April 1989, in addition to those produced by the witness
       statement, and whether such things w ere prepared by police, Sheffield Wednesday
       football club, City Council or emergency services.

(6)   All tape recordings and transcripts o f tape recordings showing the content o f
       conversations taking place in or from the police control box between 1 pm and 6 pm
       on 15th April 1989, not being conversations recorded by the radio multi-channel
       system (which w e have already examined after you produced the tape on 24th May),
      whether made or produced by police officers or emergency services

(7)   All tape and video recordings q f accounts given by police officers or other witnesses in
      ' interview, whether or a o tu n d sf p^ution, relating to the disaster.
(8)    All indexes to witnesses, statements or exhibits produced for any o f the inquiries into
       the disaster.

(9)    All expert reports prepared for the South Yorkshire or W est Midlands police forces,
       whether for any o f the above inquiries, or for the contribution hearings o f autumn
        1990, apart from the Phillips report o f August 1990, a copy o f which you produced to
       us in October 1997. I f there are other versions o f the Phillips report, w e wish to see
       them.

(10)   A copy o f the W est Midlands Police R eport which was sent to the DPP and Coroner in
       1990. This cannot be considered sensitive (a) because a copy o f the Interim Report o f
       that force o f October 1989 is in the Public Record office, (b) because you have a copy,
       though the Report was prepared for the DPP, and (c) because the Coroner has a copy.

(11)   A copy o f the opinion signed by Gareth Williams QC ad Peter Birts QC which was sent
       to the DPP in 1990. This is no longer privileged because a copy has been sent to your
       force, although it was, o f course, your force that was primarily under investigation.
       Any surviving privilege was waived when it was produced to Lord Justice Stuart-
       Smith, who quoted from it in the report o f his “ Scrutiny”.

(12)   The electronically-recorded versions o f the above, where they exist, stored on the
       Holmes computer system. We have ascertained that the material can be copied
       electronically from that system into a disc form that w e can use. Such copying will
       relieve us o f the need to photocopy vast numbers o f documents, although we anticipate
       that there will remain a large number o f documents that w e shall need to copy after
       inspection.
                                             •ifc.V-




(13)   The charges, and list o f witnesses statements prepared for, the disciplinary proceedings
       brought against the tw o defendants, but abandoned after M r Duckenfield retired from
       the force.

We anticipate from your previous attitudes tow ards the prosecution that you will claim that
the items in (10) and (11) are “ sensitive”. I f so, please indicate why you consider them to be
sensitive, and what reason in law you offer to justify withholding them from the Crown.

It may be that the list above includes the whole, or practically the whole, o f the “ archive”.
We cannot be more specific, o f course, because w e do not know the identity o f all the
witnesses; a difficulty you will remember that hampered us in specifying material in the witness
summons. W e need to see this material not simply for our own purposes, but because we have
to disclose all material that may possibly be relevant to the defence. Unfortunately, w e do not
know what the defence will be, and the question which factual issues will be contested at trial
has not been made known.

In order to make our task, and yours, more manageable, w e have invited the defence to set out
the nature o f their defence, but they have not done so. They declined to do so for what
appeared to be tactical reasons at the committal. ^ —v.

                                                       ®
You will appreciate that the committal changes the responsibilities o f the prosecution. Given
(a) the powerful rejection by the court o f the allegations o f the defence that we were abusing
the process o f the court, and (b) the strength o f the prima facie case, it was not necessary for
us, consistent with the law, to do more in tw o days at the magistrates’ court than to call two
live witnesses, read a few uncontroversial statements, show the compilation video, and read
the defendants’ evidence to the Taylor Inquiry and Inquest.

Our public duties now that w e prosecute in the name o f the Crown are greater. We wish to
have as complete and full access to your material as if we were the Crown Prosecution Service
having the conduct, on indictment, o f a case in which your force had investigated and
instituted the proceedings.


I should be grateful if you could indicate what exactly you mean by “ supervised” access. We
shall wish to inspect and copy material in some privacy, not least because you have expressed
public support for the defendants, and have procured the costs o f their defence and expenses
from public funds.

The above list o f material is, I hope, complete so far as trial material is concerned. Other
material relevant simply to the abuse hearing may be requested later. I reserve the right to
seek other material for the trial, after discussions within the prosecution team. I consider it is
more important, however, to give you an early, and possibly incomplete list, than to delay. I
shall send a copy o f this to M r Croston, and seek to arrange an early meeting with him and M r
Hepworth as you suggest.

Yours sincerely,




Ann Adlington

                Dear Ms Adlington

                Adlington v Duckenfleld & Murray

                I refer to my letter of 11 August 1999 and to your reply of 12 August 1999. Now that Mr
                Cro. ton has returned from holiday, I have had the opportunity of discussing matters with
                him.

                I am prepared to allow supervised access to non-sensitive documents. Mr Croston has
                offered his services in assisting my staff in that supervision, There are some dates when e
                is on leave or otherwise engaged. My proposal is this;

                 1.        Please send me a schedule of material to which you seek access.

                 2.        Please arrange direct with Mr Croston and the Force Hillsborough Archivist, Mr Alan
                            Hepworth, dates on which the three of you can meet at Heeley (Sheffield) police
                            office for the purpose of releasing material.

                 The purpose of asking for a schedule of material is;

                  1.       To allow staff the time to locate the documents,

                 2.        To determine whether each document as sensitive or non-sensitive.

                  Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Daines,

R v. D uckenfield and M u rra y




Thank you for your letter o f 11th August. W e look forward to hearing from you again as a
matter o f urgency on this matter. Since Mr Croston has already given his advice and you have
been advised by your own lawyers, it is not clear why M r Croston’s absence on holiday
prevents the prosecution from being told now what disclosure the South Yorkshire police
intends to make.

 You may know that a preliminaiy hearing has been arranged before M r Justice Hooper at the
 Crown Court at Leeds for 3rd September at 2 pm. The prosecution wishes to raise the whole
question o f access to documentation before the judge at this hearing, and we therefore need to
know as soon as possible what you are intending to disclose. It is possible that we shall again
wish to serve a witness summons upon you, but it may be that this can be avoided. However,
it seems probable in the light o f the history o f the case that matters o f law will arise, and th a t*
these will affect you. The prosecution will ask for these to be resolved as soon as possible, so
that we can use the time profitably in the months before trial.

You may consider therefore that you ought to be legally represented on 3rd September.
Leading counsel for the Crown will circulate a skeleton argument beforehand o f legal matters
that he intends to raise. It would be helpful to know whether w e should correspond with you
or Mr M etcalf about this.

Yours sincerely,.

        Adlington v Duckenfield & Murray

        I have asked the Director Public Prosecutions for advice on disclosure to you of material that
        may be relevant to the prosecuting you are conducting. I have now received that advice. I
        have consulted my legal adviser and I am happy to accept the DPP’s advice. Mr George
        Croston, Prosecution Team Leader, offered the advice on behalf of the DPP. He is on leave
        this week. As soon as he returns, I will be able to write to you again making specific
        proposals.

        Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Adlington

 H illsborough : P riv ate Prosecutions

 It is difficult to understand from your letter exactly what you are requesting.

 The position is not helped by a rather indiscriminate use o f the word “you” which variously appears
 to mean former Chief Constables, the present Chief Constable, Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines,
 the South Yorkshire Police in general, my firm and/or myself personally.

It is also difficult to know what exactly you are saying about the Hillsborough archive. This term is
in any event a shorthand for a vast quantity o f material which has come to the South Yorkshire
Police through a variety o f sources, including the Taylor Inquiry, the mini Inquests, the civil
proceedings, the Main Inquest, the criminal investigation, the disciplinary proceedings and the
Hillsborough Scrutiny. It can hardly be disputed that this archive is in the physical possession o f the
South Yorkshire Police and access to it is therefore under the control o f the present Chief Constable.
I am not aware o f anybody having put forward arguments to the effect that South Yorkshire Police
“own” the information or are “principals” in relation to it. For understandable reasons there is a
dearth o f authority as to the ownership o f a criminal investigation file but it can hardly be doubted
that the normal home for such material would be with the Police Force for the area where the crime
is alleged to have taken place.

Be that as it may, in relation to the committal proceedings the Chief Constable sought guidance from
CPS in relation to documentation and complied with the guidance given.

 The Chief Constable also made clear that he would comply with any request or Order o f the Court in
 the relation to the production o f documentation and that also was done.

The Chief Constable also offered voluntary access to documentation from the archive subject only to
provision o f some comment as to its relevance, payment o f costs and a reservation o f any possible
issue o f legal professional privilege. It was indicated that the last issue was unlikely to present a
problem in relation to any evidential material. That offer was never taken up but was simply
described as extortionate.

The suggestion that the South Yorkshire Police have “failed to assist” the Prosecution is therefore
misconceived.

Turning to the points raised in your numbered paragraph 9 the answers are as follows:-

a)   The South Yorkshire Police do not advance any "contentions" about the archive. They are in
     physical possession o f it and they affirm that in dealing with it they are subject to the guidance
     o f the Director o f Public Prosecutions (through CPS) and to any guidance or directions o f the
     Court.

b)   As stated above the Chief Constable will deal with the archive subject to any guidance and
     directions referred to.

c)   You do not state what other co-operation is being sought.

Prior to receipt o f your fax the Chief Constable had already asked CPS to advise in relation to any
future request from the Prosecution for documentation and no doubt such guidance will be
forthcoming in the near future. The Chief Constable will then make any necessary future decision
about the archive in the light o f such guidance. There is therefore no need for the Chief Constable to
be represented at any Pre Trial Review hearing unless this is requested by the court.
                                           ■rtf'*-
Finally, although it does not appear to bear any relevance to the core o f your request I should say
that so far as I am aware neither I nor my firm advised the South Yorkshire Police about disclosure
o f material to bereaved families at the inquest in 1990 or the supply o f information to the CPS in
1989 or 1990. B oth the inquest and the CPS consideration were supported by the West Midlands
Police who certainly did not seek our advice as to the disclosure o f material. I would be very
surprised if (as you appear to suggest) the CPS, HM Coroner, the West Midlands Police or the PCA
sought the advice o f the South Yorkshire Police on this subject either.




Yours sincerely

Dear M r Metcalf,

R v. D uckenfield and M u rray

1      The defendants in this case w ere committed for trial on 20th July on charges o f
       manslaughter and misfeasance. The stipendiary magistrate, M r Nigel Cadbury, had
       heard five days o f argument, and sworn oral evidence from me, before rejecting the
       defence argument that the prosecution was an abuse o f process o f the court and
       oppressive. H e then rejected a defence argument that there was no case to answer
       after a mere three days o f evidence and argument.

2      We understand that the Presiding Judge o f the North-Eastern Circuit, M r Justice
       H ooper, wishes to hold a preliminary hearing soon, probably on 3rd September, but
       possibly on 20th August. We shall wish at that hearing to raise the important question
       o f access to the Hillsborough archive.

3      As you know, We have been arguing for nearly a year now that there is no lawful basis
       for South Yorkshire police to hold the papers. By virtue o f the fact that on 16th April
       1989 the Chief Constable o f the South Yorkshire police asked the Chief Constable o f
       the W est Midlands police to conduct an inquiry into the policing at the Hillsborough
       disaster, it appears that the fiction has been maintained that South Yorkshire police
       “own” the information, o f which, it has been said, they are “ principals” .

4      Therefore, it is apparently argued, the South Yorkshire police were the primary
       commissioners o f evidence and inquiry, and other investigative and legal bodies were
       subordinate. Accordingly, the South Yorkshire police has been able, upon your own
       advice, (a) to decline to disclose material to the bereaved families at the Inquest in
       1990, and (b) to deny it to the prosecution in 1998-9.




            Phone 0151 236 1919. Fax 0151 226 1926. E Mail info@ hfsg.org

For the same reason, the South Yorkshire police was, on your advice, able to
influence, in its own favour, the supply o f information and evidence to the CPS in
1989-90, when a decision whether to prosecute was under consideration, and, no
doubt, to influence the supply o f information to the Police Complaints Authority.

Although we have repeatedly deployed these arguments in the course o f the various
applications by the defendants to have the proceedings stayed or discontinued, and in
the course o f their applications for public funding, we have never heard an answer to
them. Neither have you offered any rebuttal or contradiction at all over the last twelve
months.

A conspicuous feature o f the case in the last twelve months had been the support that
the South Yorkshire police has given to the defendants. The Chief Constable has
urged the South Yorkshire Police Authority, successfully, that it should pay the entire
legal fees and out o f pocket expenses o f the defendants on the ground that they acted
“reasonably and in good faith” at the time o f the Hillsborough disaster, and that it was
necessary to do this to maintain the morale o f officers who have to take “ split-second”
decisions.

It is obviously absurd that the Crown, in whose name the prosecution will now be
conducted, is denied access to evidential material which is obviously relevant to the
case by a body which is actively supporting the defence. Furthermore, as you will
know, the prosecution has duties o f disclosure to the defence, namely, to disclose any
material in the possession o f organs o f the state that may arguably assist the defence,
subject to public interest immunity considerations and legal professional privilege.

We shall raise these matters with M r Justice Hooper at the first hearing. We invite you
meanwhile to explain in writing;

(a) the legal basis on which you contend that the papers belong to, or are possessed by,
the South Yorkshire police;         **-

(b) whether the Chief Constable is prepared to hand the archive over to a neutral third
party;

(c) what other steps the Chief Constable proposes to take to co-operate with the
Crown.

In the past you have failed to assist the prosecution. We believe that this refusal was
influenced by the mistaken view expressed by M r Daines in 1998, before the
summonses w ere issued, that any private prosecution was likely to “fall at the first
hurdle.” We invite him now to take this case seriously. Since the arguments are well
known to you, we suggest that we can reasonably expect a comprehensive reply by 6th
August.
11    In the light o f that reply, we shall prepare for the Crown Court bundles o f
       correspondence and compile a skeleton argument, and consider the legal options
       available to us should you refuse co-operation. N o doubt you will wish to attend the
       first hearing o f the case and be represented. We shall keep you informed o f the date.
       We shall send a copy o f this letter to the defendants and to M r Croston o f the CPS,
       from whom the Chief Constable may wish to seek advice under section 3 (2) (e) o f the
       Prosecution o f Offences Act 1985.

12    I look forward to your reply.




Yours sincerely,

Dear Ms Adlington

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD

l refer to your letter dated 2 July 1999 addressed to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines,
acknowledging receipt of the copies of 44 original statements made by some 24 witnesses in
respect of the Hillsborough Disaster, which l had forwarded to you on 28 June last. You also
asked Mr Daines to note that I had not supplied copy original statements from four former South
Yorkshire police officers and he in turn has asked me to search the HOLMES database and the
Hillsborough Archive to ascertain if I can locate these statements. This I have now done and I will
deal with each named individual in turn.

Anthony Gordon LANG (deceased) statement dated 30 June 1990. A search of the West
Midlands Police HOLMES database does not reveal the existence of a statement by LANG
bearing this date. A manual search of the Archive has also failed to reveal any further statements
other than the undated statement bearing the reference numbers R333 and S1074 and the
statement dated 1 June 1989 bearing the reference numbers R333A and S1074A, copies of which
I have forwarded to you. I do note however that at paragraph 20 of your letter dated 3 June 1999
to Mr George Croston of the CPS Casework Directorate you make specific reference to the
statement of PC LANG dated 30 June 1999 and I presume you have a copy of it. If there is any
reference number written on that copy and you could communicate it to me it may help me locate
the original. (Unfortunately I have not seen Appendix E to your letter).

William Cameron CRAWFORD unamended statement dated 28 April 1989. A search of the
Hillsborough Archive revealed a hand-written statement by Sergeant CRAWFORD, dated
28 April 1989, which had been given the same reference number, R170 as the typed statement, a
copy of which I forwarded to you earlier.

Robert Wallace CREASER (deceased) unamended statement dated 3 May 1989. I am unable
to find any original statement made by Chief Inspector CREASER that bears the date 3 May 1989.
I have however found an original typed undated statement signed by that officer that I believe may
be the one to which you are referring. Once again this statement has been given the same
reference number R252 as the typed, signed statement which I copied to you earlier. I will explain
the significance of the dates on the HOLMES statement printouts later in this letter.

Ms A Adlington



Harry WHITE unamended statement dated 2 May 1989. I am unable to find any original
statement made by Inspector WHITE that bears the date 2 May 1989, but in searching the archive
I have found an original, hand-written undated statement, which I believe may be the original of the
one to which you are referring. This statement again bears the same reference number R215,
(although it is not really visible on the photocopy) as the typed signed statement I forwarded to you
earlier.

I enclose for your information copies of the statements of Sergeant CRAWFORD, Chief Inspector
CREASER and Inspector WHITE to which I have referred above. I apologise for not finding these
statements during my first search of the archive, but by way of explanation I would point out that
when statements are first registered on HOLMES they are given a numerical reference number. A
second statement by the same individual gets the same numerical reference with the letter A
added. A third statement has the letter B added to the reference and so on. To identify
statements and locate them in the archive I firstly interrogate the HOLMES database by name to
identify the reference numbers of the statements made by an individual. I did not expect two
statements to bear the same number.

Moving now to the dates on the HOLMES statement printouts. The very first line on the printout
shows the date on which the printout was obtained. The date on the first page of a HOLMES
statement printout below name, age, address, occupation and telephone number of the person
making it is a blank to be filled in by the indexer first registering the statement on the HOLMES
system and normally the indexer would type in the date the statement was made, but if the box is
left blank the HOLMES system has a default date that automatically goes into that box, this being
the date the transaction is being carried out. To change it or delete it that date has to be
overtyped. I therefore believe that the dates on the copies of the statements of Robert CREASER
and Harry WHITE that are in your possession are the transaction dates for their entry on the
HOMES system not the original dates of the statements.

I hope you find the above information useful.

Yours sincerely

Dear M r Daines

Adlington v D uckenfield and M urray
Statement by James Lawton

Your letter was faxed to Ann Adlington today at Leeds M agistrates’ Court where Alun Jones
QC brought it, and the relevant correspondence, to the attention o f the Stipendiary Magistrate.
There has been a strong indication by the Stipendiary Magistrate that this statement must be
faxed no later than Monday morning. The Defence have also indicated their support for this
statement to be faxed.

Obviously the witness needs to refresh his memory and the Defence needs a copy in advance
for the purposes o f cross-examination. Can you, therefore, fax M r Law ton’s statement to this
office immediately.


Yours sincerely

         Dear Ms Adlington

         I refer to the fax, timed 17.37 on 15 July 1999, by Kathy Durham. Ms Durham that it is
         imperative that I forward Mr Lawton’s statement before he gives evidence on 19 July 1999. I
         must point out that Mr Lawton’s authorisation for the release of his statement came only a
         few days ago.

         I must again point out to you that I do have other duties and find it really difficult to respond to
         your requests which come with such urgency and at such short notice. You are well aware
         that Mr Hepworth (Hillsborough Disaster Archivist) works part time and it is my
         understanding that he will not be in the office until Tuesday of next week. I will ask him to
         look for Mr Lawton's statement as soon as he comes to work and to fax it to you with
         reasonable haste

         Yours sincerely

  In view o f the Stipendiary M agistrate’s ruling today at Leeds M agistrates’ Court, it is
  imperative that we receive by fax a copy o f James Law ton’s statement requested on 2 July. It
  is our intention to call him as a witness on Monday 19 July in the Committal proceedings. I
  understand that M r Hepworth is not going to be in the office until next week, and trust that
  this will not delay an immediate response.

        Dear Ms Adlington

        Thank you for your fax of 12.22 hours, 13 July 1999.

        You are asking for copies of the original statements of Lang, Crawford, Creaser, White and
        Steve Curry. You are also asking for Detective Sergeant Carr's report.

        I cannot comply with your request that the documents be at Leeds Magistrates Court at
        2.00 pm. Thursday 15 July 1999, that is only two days notice. Mr Hepworth and I have other
        commitments. The magistrate will rule on whether the case should proceed. If the
        magistrate allows the case to proceed, I will make arrangements for the statements to be
        forwarded to you subject to the condition in paragraph 2, last two lines of my fax of 6 July.

        On 2 July 1999, you asked for a copy of the statement of James Lawton. You undertook to
        forward Mr Lawton's authority for its release. I have just received his authority and I will ask
        Mr Hepworth to forward the statement to you.

A female answered “Discipline and Complaints Department” . She stated that M r Hepworth
had left and would not be back in the office until 20th July.

I explained the purpose o f my call to which she replied that she was confident that M r

Dear M r Daines

Adlington v D uckenfield and M urray

I thank you for today’s fax referring to your fax o f 6th July. Unfortunately, I was unable to
respond to your earlier fax as I was away from the office for the whole o f last week.

In response to my request for original statements please find enclosed copy letter from M r
Metcalfe dated 6th January 1999 in which he confirms that South Yorkshire Police would
produce original documentation if ordered by a Court o f competent jurisdiction. Although
such an order has not been made I confirm that production o f the originals is necessary to
allow the proceedings to continue efficiently.

For a statement to be tendered in evidence at committal proceedings as opposed to calling a
witness to give live evidence, an original statement must tendered which complies with Section
102 M agistrates’ Court Act 1980. I have been requesting the Defence for some time to
indicate which witness statements could be read out. In the absence o f any written indication
by the Defence, the M agistrate, on 26th April and 10th May, declined to order the production of
original statements on the grounds that where a witness gives live evidence, his previous
written statement is superseded by his deposition at committal.

I wrote to you on 4th June explaining that at that stage I needed to ascertain which o f our
witness statements complied with the requirements o f Section 102,

You responded by forwarding copies o f the original statements o f 24 o f the 25 witnesses, I
subsequently w rote on 2nd July requesting that you produce all original statements to the Court
including those o f Lang, Crawford, Creaser and White referred to in that letter, copies o f
which you had previously omitted to send. I further asked that you produce the original
statement o f Steve Curry,
As to the timing o f production I should be grateful if you would have them available for
production to the Court on Thursday 15th July at 2pm. At 11 am on that day the Stipendiary
will make a ruling on “abuse o f process” . Obviously we will not know until then whether
committal proceedings will in fact continue. I am sorry that I cannot give you a more definite
indication. As you will appreciate, such matters are beyond my control.

Please note that we also require you to produce the original o f DS C arr’s report as this will be
put in evidence under section 24 Criminal Justice Act 1988.

Finally, I still await copy statement o f M r Lawton requested on 2nd July.

I am conscious that you do have other duties besides dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium
Disaster. I f M r Hepworth has any queries relating to the above, he may speak to me directly.


Yours sincerely

            Dear Ms Adlington

            I refer to my fax of the afternoon of 5 July 1999. I have now received legal advice from my
            solicitor, Peter Metcalfs. His advice is that I have no legal obligation to produce original
            statements to the court. However, if their production is necessary to allow the proceedings
            to continue efficiently then I would not wish to be obstructive by not producing them. I must
            say that your request cam e as something of a surprise as you had not previously suggested
            that the original statements would be needed. I must also say that your request came to my
            attention on the morning of Monday 5 July 1999. by which time the committal proceedings
            had already begun, having been scheduled some months ago.

            I would ask you to explain why original statements are now needed when previously copies
            were sufficient. I would also ask you to explain what you m ean by producing the statements
            at court. Are you suggesting that I should be there in person? Are you suggesting that the
            statements should be handed to a named m ember of court staff? Are you suggesting that
            the statements be handed to you? If you^ere suggesting that the statements be handed to
            you, I would require your undertaking, as a solicitor, that the statements be kept in safe
            custody and returned immediately after the hearing unless, of course, the court orders that
            they remain at the court.

            Subject to a satisfactory response to the above I will be able to allow the original statements
            to be produced.

            In recent days I have received a number of faxes from you, the content of some overlaps
            with the content of others. I have tried my best to respond to each either directly or by
            asking Mr Hepworth to supply you with information. I do have many other duties, besides
            dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, and it would help me to reply to you properly
            if you could furnish m e with a consolidated schedule of outstanding requests that are
            relevant to the committal.

            Yours sincerely

ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD & MURRAY

I refer to your letter of 4 June 1999 to Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines and subsequent
correspondence regarding the provision of copies of the original statements of 24 named
individuals in the schedule to that letter.

Please find enclosed copies of the various statements made by 23 of the 24 persons named.
Number 19, Peter Carr, did not make any statement, nor officer’s report regarding the disaster.
The two reports he did produce were internal for the use of South Yorkshire Police.

You should also be aware that the statement of number 13, Glen Kirton, whilst typed, produced in
the sam e format as for other members of the FA and appearing to be an original is unsigned.

I have also copied the original statement of Susan Elizabeth Davies requested in your letter dated
2 4 June 1999 and this is numbered 2 5 on the attached schedule.

Please note that I have NO T copied any of these statements to either defendant.

         Dear Ms Adlington

         Adlington v Duckenfield and Murray

         I refer to      your
                        fax of 23 June 1999. I will ask Mr Hepworth to provide you with copies of the
         original signed statements to which you refer. I have spoken to him and he tells me that
         there are some difficulties. For example there are statements by more than one person in
         one of the names to which you refer. I will ask Mr Hepworth to contact you direct about
         these matters and to forward the statements to you. I note your assurance that you do not
         envisage the need to ask for any more statements for the committal proceedings.

         Mr Lang died on 5 Septem ber 1990, at Barnsley.                        Mr Creaser died on 3 June 1996, at
         Barnsley

         My solicitor, P eter Metcalfe, has forwarded to me your letter to him of 4 June 1999. Your
         letter to Mr Metcalfe included a copy of your letter to Mr Croston, Crown Prosecution Service.
         At paragraph 56, of your letter to Mr Croston you say that you have sent a copy of your letter
         to the Police Complaints Authority and to the former Coroner. Your letter quotes widely from
         the Chief Constable’s briefing notes. I produced that document to the court at Leeds as
         required by a witness summons. You have now furnished it to other people including the
         former Coroner who is no longer a public servant. I do not think you should have done that
         without the permission of the court. I do not propose to m ake an issue of this case but if
         there are further such cases I will be obliged to take the matter further.

          Yours sincerely

    Dear M r Daines

    Adlington v D uckenfield and M urray

    I refer to your letter o f 21st June in response to mine o f 4th June. As stated in my letter o f 4th
    June, it is imperative that I have at least copies o f the original signed statements so that I can
    fulfil my duty to the Court and to the defence. Computer generated copy statements o f all 24
    witnesses have been served on all parties. I will o f course serve all parties with any copies
    which you now provide.

    I confirm that at the moment I do not envisage that we will need any more statements for
    committal proceedings. That situation may o f course change after committal.

    In relation to the M r Lang and M r Creaser, I need to obtain copy death certificates for the
    committal proceedings. Their statements have been served as part o f the committal bundle
    and formal proof o f death will be necessary to render them admissible. I am sure that your
    Pensions department will have the dates and places o f death.


    Yours sincerely

   Dear Miss Adlington

   H illsborough

   Thank you for your letters o f 1st and 4th June 1999.

  In relation to j o u r letter o f 1st June the “schedule” referred to is a schedule o f the documents sent by
  bouth Yorkshire Police to

  Lord Justice Stuart Smith in October or November 1997 in response to the Judge’s request for
  i ormation about the background to the taking o f Statements from South Yorkshire Police Officers.


 The Officer who prepared the schedule apparently decided to allocate references to each document
 based on where it had been located. I am told that the notes o f the meeting o f 17th April were found
 in a box o f documents left behind by M r Bettison when he left the South Yorkshire Police. The
 Utticer therefore (I am told) marked the extract from these notes as “NB1” .

 When I w rote to Lord Justice Stuart Smith I had a copy o f the schedule o f documents but not copies
 ol the documents themselves and I made the assumption that the reference “N B1” indicated that this
 was a document prepared by M r Bettison. It seems that that was not the case and indeed, as you
 rightly observe, it seems that he was not even at the meeting which I understand also accords with
 his recollection.

As to whether the briefing notes are complete I saw these notes for the first time shortly before the
M agistrates Court Hearing on 24 May this year. They appear to be complete and M r Daines has

                                                         Hillsborough Family Support Group
told the Court that he has produced exactly what he found in the archive. Beyond that my
information is no better than yours.

As to your letter o f 4th June 1999 I have sent this on to M r Daines but I understand that he is on
leave until 21st June 1999 and I do not know to what extent he is in contact with his office. It would
be safest to assume that if there is to be response it will not arrive until the week commencing 21st
June.


Yours sincerely

Your Ref: PCM .SB.CHI.57-9

4 June 1999


Dear M r M etcalf

I enclose a copy o f a letter and annexes which I have sent to M r Croston at the CPS. I refer
you particularly to paragraph 56. The contents o f the letter affect you and the Assistant Chief
Constable, and bear upon custody o f the archive. I invite you to make any observations about
the contents o f the letter to M r Croston and copy them to me. M r Daines’ comments in
relation to the matters raised at paragraphs 44 and 45 would be helpful.

The substance o f the Representations o f2 4 th^ u g u s t and 24th September is contained in the
material we sent you between December and February last and which was relevant to the
funding issue and the discretion o f the Police Authority. It is therefore unnecessary for us to
enclose them unless you request a copy. I assume you do not wish to see the selection o f the
edited and unedited statements because, o f course, you are familiar with them.

 Yours sincerely

    Dear M iss Adlington

    H illsborough : O fficers A d d resses

    Further to my letter o f 25 M ay 1999 I have now discussed this matter with lan Daines.

    B y way o f background I should say that the addresses o f officers and former officers are held by way
    o f computer records.

    Serving officers are required to provide their address to the Chief Constable pursuant to Regulations
    which require the C h ief Constable to approve residence in a particular place.

    The addresses o f retired officers are held few-pension purposes.

    It follow s from the foregoing that any provision ot addresses without consent would amount to a
    breach o f the Data Protection Act.

    Having regard to this and other factors Mr Daines has decided that he will not provide the addresses
    requested without consent o f the officers and former officers concerned.

    Therefore the tw o options are those previous floated, namely that either Mr Daines will write to the
    officers and former officers named and ask them if they consent to their addresses being provided

     Thank you for your fax o f 25 May 1999, 1 will put your request to my clients but in view o f the
     legal complications surrounding the release o f addresses (or last known addresses) without consent I
     w ould be surprised if they w ere to alter their position. Given that no progress will be made while my
     clients are considering the position you may wish to consider whether it is worthwhile providing the
     letters suggested in my fax o f 24 May 1999 so that at least these can be sent out.

     I have no objection to your doing this without prejudice to your contention and you should be given
     the addresses in any event.               ,»■„

Dear Mr M etcalf

Further to your fax o f 24 M ay 1999 w e are unable to agree to the procedure you have
suggested. W e share your objective that the South Yorkshire police should not act as
intermediaries betw een us and the w itnesses. This w ould clearly be inappropriate, not least
because o f the position taken by the P olice Authority in regards to funding.

W e w ould invite you to provide the addresses o f the individual officers as requested.
Naturally these addresses w ould be treated in the strictest confidence once received. N o
doubt your client w ould not w ish to be seen to impede or control access to potential
witnesses.



Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Adlington

Hillsborough ; Officers Addresses

Further to my fax o f 21 M ay 1999 my clients have suggested that you may care to provide a letter
addressed to each officer (presumably in identical terms) inviting them to contact you direct if they
wish to do so thereby avoiding the need for our clients to act as intermediaries and also allowing
those officers or ex officers who wish to respond the ability to do so direct. Obviously your letter
should provide appropriate contact numbers and/or addresses and my clients will then forward it
with a letter indicating simply that this communication lias been received.

On the assumption that your letters will not.be controversial it may save time if these are sent direct
for the attention o f Ian Daines at Police Headquarters at Snig Hill in Sheffield but if you do take this
course o f action it might be helpful if you let me have a copy o f a sample letter (assuming they will
all be in the same terms) so that 1 am in a position to comment If asked to do so.

Yours sincerely

           This statement (consisting o                each signed by me) is true lo the best o f my knowledge and belief and 1
           make it knowing that, i f it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated anything
           which I know '                     ot believe to be true.

            Signature ....                                                               Date:   ..


           I am Ian Daines, Assistant C hief Constable, South Yorkshire Police. Am ongst my many other

           duties is a responsibility to assist the Chief Constable in the handling of m atters arising out of the

           Hillsborough Stadium D isaster o f 15 April 1989. I transferred from Northumbria Police to South

           Yorkshire Police on promotion to the rank of Assistant Chief Constable in July 1996. I had had no

           previous dealing with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster issues and took on this responsibility in 1997.



           The Chief Constable has an archive of m aterial relating to the disaster which is kept at Heeley

           Police Station, W indsor Road, Sheffield. The archive is kept in a room which measures

           approxim ately 17 fe e t square. It is stocked from floor to ceiling with Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

           material. This m aterial includes maps, sketches, photographs, questionnaires, statements, video

        tapes, transcripts o f Lord Justice Taylor’s Public Enquiry and of the 1991 Inquest, copies of the

        Taylor Report and m any other documents concerned with the disaster and its afterm ath. These

       documents have arrived in the archive from a num ber of different sources. Som e are generated

        by South Yorkshire Police staff, some w ere generated by the 1991 Inquest (and are held on behalf

       o f the Coroner). Som e w ere generated by the W est Midlands Police, who assisted Lord Justice

       Taylor in his Judicial Enquiry, and later prepared papers for the Director of Public Prosecutions.

       The archive contains perhaps as many as one million pieces of paper. The H O LM ES computer is

       used as an index to som e o f the material which is held in the archive.



       I cannot prove the authenticity of any document in the archive in the sense that I cannot say that

       the document is an accurate record of w hat it purports to record nor that it w as m ade by the

       person who is purported to have m ade it.

           The archive is an historical record of a tragedy. I am required to produce to the court a large

           num ber o f docum ents and I do so. I would ask that these documents are returned to me a t the

           conclusion of these proceedings so that I can preserve the integrity of the archive. Also I would

           ask that these docum ents are used only for the purpose of these proceedings as they relate to a

           traum atic event in the lives of many people,



           I have received a sum m ons from the Leeds Magistrates Court, dated 26 April 1999, which w as

           issued in connection with the prosecution by Ann Addlington of David Godfrey Duckenfield and

           Bernard Dean M urray. The summons requires me to produce a large num ber of documents to the

           court on the 2 4 M ay 1999. I have caused staff to look most carefully for the documents described

           in the summons. In som e cases they have found only copies. I will now go through the schedules

        of docum ents and each item individually. The summons requires me to produce documents as

        listed in Schedules 1 to 4. There is no Schedule 1 so I shall progress im m ediately to Schedule 2.



        I am required to produce a docum ent described as “Plan by witness Holdsworth”, number 36, I

        have located a photocopy of a plan of Sheffield W ednesday Football Club Hillsborough Ground. It

        bears the nam e R oger Holdsworth and a signature which could be that o f M r Holdsworth.



        I am required to produce a series of plans,:prepared by Brades for the Judicial Enquiry”, document

       numbers 91, 9 2, 93. 94 and 95. I produce plans which purport to be prepared by Ralph Brade and

       Associates, Consulting Engineers. The plans are in the form of transparencies as used by

       draughtsmen and engineers but they bear no signatures. I also produce paper copies o f these

       transparencies.




       I am required to produce documents “Prepared by the W est Midlands Police for the Judicial

       Enquiry”, these are docum ent numbers 96, 97, 99, 100, 101, 103 and 106.

       “Surveyed 27/4 /89 " and purports to be singed by D R Goodhall.

   In Schedule 3 , 1am required under Item 2, to produce a (tape) “extract identified in C I Malcolm

   Edmundson’s Report (R139), dated 29/4/89*. I have read his report and can find no reference to a

   tape extract.



   Item 3 to Schedule 3 relates to documents identified in an internal South Yorkshire Police Report

   compiled by DS Carr. Item 3.1 requires production of the Ground Control Log. The only such

   document Identified is the one already produced in accordance with Schedule 2, item 207, of the

   summons issued on 26 April 1999. Item 3.2 requires production of the Command and Control Log

   and I produce a photocopy of a computer print out of that log.



   At item 3.3; I am requested to produce copies of briefing notes identified as. CCB 16 April 1989,

   CCB 17 April 1989 and CCB 19 April 1989 from the Chief Constable’s Briefing with Operational

   Staff. I produce copies of notes of De-brief Meetings from the above dates, the Chief Constable

   being present at the first two, but not at the third. There are no signatures on these notes and no

   identified author.



   Items 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 require me to produce the briefing notes of

   Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, Superintendent Greenwood and Superintendent Marshall. I

   have previously been required to produce these via the summons of 26 April 1999, Schedule 2

   No.s 197 and 198 and Schedule 2 , N os 200 and 201 of this summons and have done so.



   At item 4 of this schedule I am required to produce a compilation video, ref. MRE1. I produce the

   master tape of this video compiled by the West Midlands Police and in U-Matic format, which will

   require a U-Matic player for it to be viewed. Nothing with this video identifies the person who

   compiled it.

   Dear M iss Adlington

   H illsborough : W itness S u m m on s

   Thank you for your fax o f 19th May.


   Y ou will now have received my fax relating to the tape playing equipment.

  In relation to costs I shall be grateful if you will confirm that you personally as the Prosecutor will be
  responsible for paying such costs, if any, as are found to be reasonable within the meaning o f Section
  97 in respect o f Mr Daines complying with the Witness Summons. Obviously, as with any Solicitor
  I would expect you to ensure that funds areavailable to you to meet such costs but it seem s to me ’
  that, as you are the Prosecutor, only you can give the necessary undertakiim.

  In relation to point 2 o f your letter my client is prepared 10 write to the Officers named (at their last
  known address in the case o f those w ho have retired) asking if they consent to have their addresses
  disclosed. I f consent is received they will be disclosed


  In relation to numbered points 3, 4 and 5 I should say firstly that the copy page referred to in point 4
  was not attached. M ore importantly I note that these points all relate to Witness Statements or
  transcripts o f interview rather than documents o f the type which w e have been concerned with in the
  present Witness Summons. I w as not present on 2 P' December but my understanding is that the
  Magistrate accepted our C ounsel’s point that som ebody's statement could not be a document which
  could be produced by another person under Section 24. If that point is to be revisited then it will no
  doubt need to be argued.

As to points 7 and 8 this is a matter which requires careful consideration. Much o f the input will
have been carried out by W est Midlands officers, presumably using their own equipment. The
HOLM ES system itself was not designed by South Yorkshire Police. M oreover one o f the
documents (the turnstile count) is clearly the product o f the SWFC computer. M y client is therefore
considering the position in relation to your request.

Yptrrs sincerely

       w e have in a com puterised form, unsigned, dated 3rd M ay 1989 with the reference
        R232. The statement w e have w as obviously prepared by an operator o f the word
        processing system from a handwritten or typed original. The undated statement o f Mr
       Duckenfield (R 230) is signed by him. W e will need to produce the original o f that
       document to the court. Please confirm to us that there will no difficulty in supplying it
       for the committal proceedings.                                                       °


6.     Mr Daines may think it w ould be sensible to bring the docum ents mentioned in
       paragraphs 3,4 and 5 above on M onday where if necessary, w e can serve a witness
       summons upon him, in order to save the cost and inconvenience o f a separate hearing.

7.     On the 10th M ay M iss Varty argued on behalf o f the C h ief Constable that a number o f
       computer generated docum ents that w e w ere seeking w ould only be admissible in
       evidence if section 69 o f the P olice and Criminal Evidence A ct 1984 was complied
       with. This is obviously a technical and formal matter, since no-one has ever suggested
       in previous enquiries that the H olm es computer system was defective. Accordingly
       w e shall seek to deal w ith this matter by a certificate drafted in accordance with °
       Schedule 3 paragraph 8 o f the 1984 Act. After w e have decided what documents will
       be presented to the court w e shall draft a certificate and ask the appropriate person to
       sign it.


8.     Please indicate w ho occupied “a responsible position in relation to the operation o f the
       computer in 1989", w h o should sign the certificate as required by paragraph 8(d). The
       more inconvenient w ay o f complying with section 69 is to call a witness live to give
       the necessary evidence. I f w e had to take such a course, it seem s to us that D S Carr
       w ould be the appropriate person to summon to court. W e should be grateful in due
       course to receive your comments.

Yours sincerely

     Dear M iss Adlington

     H illsborough : W itn e ss S u m m on s

     I am told that the machine required to play the Control Room tapes is an ICR40 International
     Communications Recorder/Reproducer. I understand that this would originally have been supplied
     by RACAL. The South Yorkshire Police no longer have this machine as the technology has since
     been superseded.

     I have communicated the above information to the M agistrates’ Clerk.

     Yours sincerely

      Dear Miss Adlington

      Hillsborough : Witness Summons


      ? o ! S k ^0U f°J y° Uu faf ° f 18 M ay 1999• 1 apolo^ise for the spelling error in the fax o f 14 May
      1999 and confirm that Mr Dam es has received the Witness Summons.

     I think you have misunderstood the rest o f my letter. I merely asked whether the failure to tender
     any conduct m oney w as an oversight or whether it was deliberate. I f the latter is the case then I was
     going to ask whether this w as because you contend that there is no requirement to tender conduct
     money to a police officer and, again, in that event, whether you have an authority for this
     proposition.                                                                                  3

     Perhaps w e can clarify this point before I take instructions.

     I f it was the case that you agree that conduct m oney should be tendered then clearly this would have
     to cover the cost o f the operation as a whole rather than merely the cost o f travelling from Sheffield
      o      eeds. There does not appear to be a lot o f authority on the point but you may care to look at
     the unreported case o f M orris & Others -v- Batik o f Am erica N ational Trust & Savings Association
     & Others [6 February 1997] and also at the case o f R -v- Burt Ex P Pres/m rg [I960] 1 ALL ER

 Dear Miss Adlington

 Hillsborough : Witness Summons

 Thank you for your fax of 23 May 1999 with enclosures.

 I can now confirm that Mr Davies has received the original Witness Summons issued on 10 May
 1999.

 He tells me however that no sum has been tendered in payment of the costs and expenses of
 production.

 Is this an oversight or is there no intention o f paying any expenses?

 Yours sincerely

 Witness Summons


   hank you tor your tax ot yesterday responding to my earlier one. I can confirm that at the
   aring on the 10 May, w e intend to apply for a witness summons relating to the items
excised from the list attached to the current summons. In relation to Schedule 1 forwarded to
you under cover o f my letter o f 12"’ March, I am unable yet to say which o f those statements
we will be seeking by way o f witness summons. This is dependent upon the Defence
indicating which statements may be read out at committal and which witnesses they require us
to call to give oral evidence.


In relation to Schedule 4 o f the current summons, you will note that the material listed here is
tnat referred to in paragraph 5 o f my letter o f 12"' March.


Finally I confirm that I am forwarding to Mr Daines the original summons issued on Monday
and endorsed by the Stipendiary Magistrate. I should be grateful if receipt could be
acknowledged.



Yours sincerely

Dear Sir


Further to my tax of yesterday, Mr M etcalf has suggested that once you have received a hard
copy of the summons, the sensible course would be for you, or him on your behalf to write
confirming receipt. Accordingly, I enclose the original summons signed by the Stipendiary
Magistrate on Monday 24"’ April.                                                        y

       yourself to be involved you must state who they are and confirm their legally qualified status.
       If the Defence wish to inspect documentation they will have to ask.

       What must^ be clearly understood is that there are cost implications in providing the
       documentation for inspection and the same charge as previously mentioned will apply in
       respect o f the sorting o f documents to and from the archive, the provision o f inspection
       facilities and the presence o f the documents’ officer to deal with any queries.

       Turning to the question o f production o f original documentation the first point to be made is
       that if a Court o f competent jurisdiction orders the production o f any documentation then
       such an Order will o f course be complied with.

       Subject to that I should say that the original CPS guidance was that it would be
       inappropriate for original statements to be removed from the main Hillsborough archive.
       Their suggestion was that if copy statements had been provided then it should be a simple
       matter for new originals to be prepared by the prosecution and used in Court proceedings.

       As to other evidence I have not inspected the archive but I believe that a very large number
       o f the items in it will themselves be copies rather than original items. Where however an item
       is clearly identified as original and is required for production at Court then subject to the
       Court agreeing to accept custody o f that item I would not anticipate this presenting any
       problem.

Yours sincerely

 1 note that you are concerned about the costs o f Thursday’s hearing. My understand™, o f the
 "    * 0 cost *             , he South Yorkshire Police Authority in this case leads me to believe
 that they are unlikely to leave you exposed.


? J rhfl° UQld p 0 in t 0ut that the South Yorkshire police appeared at the hearing on 2 1 st December
represented o ^ 'P ^ o n th^equeStf ^ ?• \ had a^Sumed that ^  were proposing to appear or be
represented on 7 on the same basis. An application for a witness summons is usually made ex
p e. You are not o f course, obliged to be present, and we are not obliged to inform you o f any
application we make for such a summons.                                              y         y

If you mstmct counsel, that is because you have chosen to appear voluntarily at the hearing and
you cannot expect us to meet you costs, nor, if you threaten us with applications for costT, can
you expect us to inform you o f our intentions in relation to summonses in future.


I look forward to your reply,

(B)    I do not know what undertakings could possibly be implied at common law. Unless it is your
       intention to misuse the material you should have no problem giving the required undertaking.

       The difference betw een prosecution and defence is that you are asking for the material
       whereas the defence is not. It is part o f the CPS guidance that material be copied to the
       defence if requested by and provided to the prosecution. Clearly an undertaking cannot be
       requested in circumstances where the CPS guidance requires that material be supplied,

(C)    I suggest that you raise this point if and when material which you request is refused on
       grounds o f lack o f materiality.

(D )   The proposed charge is a reasonable one. You ignore the fact that it will include the cost o f
       black and white A 4 photocopying (both to yourselves and the defence) You also ignore the
       fact that a documents officer cannot exist in a vacuum but requires office facilities and
       secretarial support. A s to the drafting o f invoices these will simply indicate the amount o f
       hours spent in each period. Under English law an explanation is required if VAT is not
       chargeable rather than if it is.

(E)    This has being dealt with under (B) above.

(F)    This has been dealt with under (B) above

(G)    Quite simply this is none o f your business.

I do not think the balance o f your letter requires comment save to note that we are in agreement that
the question o f voluntary disclosure is a separate matter from the Application for a Witness
Summons.

Turning to the latter w e have reserved Counsel to appear at Court on 7 January 1999 and w e do
need to know as soon as possible whether the hearing is to proceed. Obviously w e will be seeking
to recover costs if Counsel appears and the matter is then ad journed.

Yours sincerely

 3 1 December 1998

 Dear Mr Metcalf


 I have received your letter o f 3 0 lh December 1998 sent by facsimile.

 I had spoken to Mr Croston o f the CPS last w eek and to a different CPS lawyer yesterday,
 before receipt o f your letter. I have been told that the intention o f the CPS is to disclose the
 ™ te.r,!a l ‘" the‘r P ° ssession subject to any convincing objection in law that you might raise on
 behalf ot South Yorkshire police, but I am pleased to say that they will not be charging £30
per hour No doubt you have also been in touch with Mr Croston or his colleagues and been
told ot their attitude already. I had assumed from the terms o f your letter that you would not
be advancing any such objections but I am surprised to read in a letter from the CPS which I
received this morning that you are suggesting that the CPS should postpone their disclosure
pending the outcome o f judicial review proceedings. There is no sense in proposing the
voluntary disclosure o f material in possession o f South Yorkshire police and askin» the CPS
to withhold theirs.                                                                      *


 The reservation in the third paragraph o f your letter makes the prospect o f early disclosure by
 your clients more apparent than real in any event. It is not correct to say that judicial review
proceedings are being considered”. On 2 P 1December, leading counsel for Mr Murray and
junior counsel for Mr Duckenfield both told the court in unambiguous terms, in the presence
o     e prosecution and your counsel, that an application for judicial review would be made and
Mr Harrison QC told the court that he intended that it would be lodged in the first two weeks
ot January. He told the court this after Miss Varty had indicated that voluntary disclosure
would be withheld if such an application were to be made, and after prosecution counsel
protested at the potential delay in the disclosure process. (Miss Varty later appeared to adopt
a more amenable attitude when the Magistrate suggested that many o f the documents might be
disclosed by agreement betw een the parties so that the committal proceedings would be
conducted in an orderly and efficient way.)



                                                -I-

                                               (u £ )

•
    I am sure that, if the defence had changed their minds, or were now undecided as to whether
    to apply for judicial review, they would have told us, because they know that the CPS decided
    to delay a decision as to voluntary disclosure on the 2 1 s1 only by reason o f the declared
    intention o f the defence to challenge the CPS decision.

    The prosecution considers it wholly unreasonable o f the defendant to form, and act upon, a
    concluded decision to apply for judicial review, when they believe that the decision-maker may
    or will provide reasons for his decision within a short time. We must, however, accept the
    reality that attack upon the rationality o f the decision is to be made whatever the reasons, and
    whether reasons are supplied or not. I therefore ask you to tell me whether the Chief
    Constable will indeed “suspend” the process when the proceedings are “instituted” (by which I
    surmise you mean lodged with the Crown Office) or at least explain why you cannot tell me
    now. I am sure that your clients will agree that it would be pointless to spend time and incur
    expense in setting up a procedure, and in installing a “documents officer”, if the arrangements
    were to be put into abeyance within a few days. I hope that you will throw more light on this.

    I also request that you clarify the following matters:

    (A)    What is the “guidance” to which you refer in paragraph 1. I understand that the
           present position o f the CPS is that they have no guidance to offer because they have
           decided not to intervene. However, since last July the makers o f statements have
           requested copies o f their statements from South Yorkshire police, May we please see
           a copy o f the “guidance” to which you refer, which apparently you have been ignoring
           for the last six months. Why were the statements not disclosed if such guidance was
           given and the makers consented.

    (B)    What limitation is the proposed undertaking specified in para 2 .1 intended to add, if
           anything, to such undertakings as are implied in relation to disclosure by common law?
           We note that you are not suggesting that the Defence give similar undertakings.
           Please explain why not.

    (C)   In para 2.3, you suggest that your client will “require” a brief explanation o f the
           relevance o f the material to one or more o f the charges. Such a position implies that
           an individual decision on behalf o f your clients is contemplated in relation to each item,
           either to disclose or withhold. Do you propose to apply the test embodied in section
           97A of the Magistrates Court Act, or some looser standard? If the test is to be
           “materiality” you will understand that a court, after applying the same test, does not
           charge the prosecution for photocopying at a rate equivalent to a salary exceeding
           £50,000 a year, and then make a further charge at the same rate for supplying copies
           o f the same material to the defence. I suspect also that the application o f the
           “materiality” test would be rather less generous in your hands than the Court’s. If the
           proposed criterion is different, please set it out.

    (D)   The basis on which the exorbitant charge is to be levied is unclear. The HSFG could
          find a competent and trustworthy person to do the job for nothing except travel
          expenses, or at a commercial rate o f under £5 an hour. You may well be right to say
          that VAT is chargeable, but I should like to know on what basis, and how the hourly

                                                   -2 -
       rate has been calculated, so that the HFSG can inform itself properly before deciding
       whether to authorise this unusual expenditure. Please also inform me o f the detail in
       which the invoices will be drafted, so that we can be assured that the time and
       activities o f the documents officer will have been reliably set out.

(E)    You tell me that all material disclosed to us will also be disclosed to both defendants.
       Fortunately we can relieve you o f that responsibility. At all three hearing before the
       Leeds District Magistrates’ Court, the prosecution has raised the difficulties it has
       experienced in obtaining documents from the South Yorkshire police and CPS. On
       each occasion it has openly invited the defence to support its request to both these
       bodies that documents be disclosed. The prosecution has pointed out that the
       defendants might reasonably expect that such disclosure might assist their case.
       However, on each occasion, perhaps mindful of cost, the defence have declined to
       support the request. Instead they have argued that it is for the prosecution to disclose
       to them all relevant material in their possession.

       Miss Varty will be able to confirm this in relation to 21 s1 December, and Mr Manning
       will, we trust be prepared to confirm that this was also his expressed position at the
       earlier hearings. It is therefore wholly unnecessary for you to supply the defence with
       copies and to charge us for doing so.

       If this does not cause you to change your mind, please confirm that it is also proposed
       to supply the defence with any material that they may request, on what criteria, and
       whether it is intended that such material will also be copied to the prosecution at the
       expense o f the defence (ie the expense o f the South Yorkshire Police Authority). You
       do not say if you have written in similar terms to the defence solicitors, as opposed to
       merely sending them a copy o f your letter to us.

(F)    Please inform me, in any event, why you propose to charge us for the supply to the
       defence o f the same material as you send to us. Such an arrangement would make a
       mockery o f the “equality between prosecution and defence” which you refer to, and
       the impartiality which you have professed in earlier letters. Surely the defence should
       pay for their own copies.' The prosecution have obligations o f disclosure o f all relevant
       material to the defence, which it will abide by, and at a fraction o f the cost o f your
       expensive “documents officer” . Fortunately as I have said, the defence will look to us,
       and not to you to disclose.

(G)    Who is it proposed will be the “documents officer”? Will he have had any previous
       connections with the Hillsborough inquiries and an interest of his own to protect? We
       have already been alarmed to hear that the former custodian o f the archive, PC
       Greenway, has been suspended from duty on suspicion of serious misconduct, but was
       nevertheless invited by your clients to inspect documentation in the archive on the 18lh
       December.

There is a further objection to your proposal to charge us for copying material to the defence.
You know that the defendants are in receipt o f public money for their defence, namely, funds
from the South Yorkshire Police Authority. It is obvious from the fact that the defendants

                                               -3-




                                            ©
•
     have already announced a concluded decision to apply for judicial review, that the Authority is
     liberal with its money. It will obviously meet the reasonable copying o f the defence, and, on
     the basis o f recent experience, there is every reason to believe that the Authority will accept
     even your proposed rates o f charging, particularly when the money will be coming back to a
     body which it finances.

    When the prosecution applies in due course for its costs, it is unlikely that, upon conviction,
    the defendants would be ordered to pay the whole sum. In that event, or in the event of
    acquittal the prosecution would have to look to recover its costs from public funds, and will
    face taxation. The taxing authority is unlikely to regard the costs which you stipulate for a
    person who is essentially a photocopier as in any way reasonable. The proposal we make to
    finance the costs o f copying to the defence is undoubtedly more reasonable, and conducive to
    the saving o f public money.

    I agree with you that the question o f the issue o f witness summonses is separate, and that any
    agreement we may reach does not prejudice our right to apply for such summonses, or your
    right to object to them. However, it is possible that we may agree about disclosure, and so
    avoid the necessity o f the application on 7lh January. The prospect o f this will obviously be
    improved it you reply to this letter today. If the hearing o f the 7th is unnecessary we would
    wish to inform the Leeds Court, which has always been helpful to us, as early as possible. No
    doubt the Court will conclude its business today earlier than usual.

    We should tell you that the decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority to fond the
    defence is one that we have challenged. We suggest that it was made unlawfully and
    irrationally, as you have no doubt heard. We shall be making further formal representations to
    the Authority, and will be copying the file as a matter o f courtesy to the Chief Constable. If
    you have been advising either the Authority or the police in that matter, please let me know,
    so that I can serve the papers on you directly.

    Yours sincerely

 B Y F A X A N D POST

 Dear Ms Adlington

 H IL L SB O R O U G H STADIUM D ISA STER 1989
 PR IV A TE PR O SE C U T IO N S: RELEA SE O F D O C U M EN TA TIO N

 As you are aware my firm represents the Chief Constable in this matter.

 Now that the DPP has decided not to intervene in the prosecutions the South Yorkshire Police
 would like to progress the issue o f disclosure o f copies o f relevant material from the Hillsborough
 archive.

 It has been suggested that the decision o f the DPP may be the subject o f judicial review proceedings
 by the Defendants. The South Yorkshire Police do not propose to delay disclosure on the basis that
 such proceedings are being considered but will review the position if such proceedings are actually
 instituted and reserve the right to suspend disclosure pending the outcome in that event.

 I should make clear that this decision has no effect on our position in relation to the application for
 the issue o f a witness summons directed to the Assistant Chief Constable. That application is due to
 be considered again on 7 January 1999 and if it is proceeded with it will be resisted.

 Reverting to the matter o f disclosure the following points are relevant:

  1.                   A vast amount o f material has been requested. I must ask that you indicate your priorities so
                       as to enable attention to be directed first to the material which you consider most important.

                       We have considered carefully the guidance o f the CPS to the effect that the consent o f a
                       witness should be sought before a copy o f his or her statement is made available. We believe

                                                                 Hillsborough Family Support Group

       that in the circumstances o f this particular case that may be an unreasonable requirement and
       subject to the safeguards set out in the following three paragraphs the Police are prepared to
       supply material without that requirement being fulfilled. The safeguards are:

       2.1     The material supplied and any further copies taken will be used only bona-fide for the
               purposes o f the present prosecutions and not for any other purpose whatsoever.
               Aside from actual use in court it will be made available only to legal representatives
               o f the prosecution and, where necessary, to expert or other witnesses.

       2.2    At the conclusion o f the prosecution all such material and any copies taken will be
              returned to the South Yorkshire Police. The Chief Constable will be prepared to
              consider alternative proposals for safe custody o f the material provided that such
              proposals clearly continue to satisfy condition 2.1 above.

       2.3    In the case o f each item we shall require a brief explanation o f the relevance o f the
              material to one or more o f the charges.

               Item 2.1 and 2.2 must be supported by your written undertaking as a solicitor.

3.    There will be a substantial cost in providing this material. Rather than charge on an item by
      item basis the South Yorkshire Police propose to use the services o f a documents officer and
      to charge his time at £30.00 per hour plus VAT. For the avoidance o f doubt the time charge
      will apply for any work in connection with provision o f documents or dealing with any other
      requests raised by the prosecution whether dealt with in this letter or otherwise. That charge
      will include the cost o f all black and white A4 copying but an additional charge will be levied
      in respect o f the copying o f any videos, tapes, photographic prints or any other non-standard
      material including black and white photocopies o f non-A4 size. An account will be rendered
      to you every fortnight following commencement o f copying and this must be paid within 7
      days failing which provision o f material will be suspended. Given that the Hillsborough
      Family Support Group, who we believe are your Clients, do not appear to have a legal
      personality, we will require your personal solicitor’s undertaking that these charges will be
      met as outlined above.

4.    Express guidance from the CPS is that there must be equality between prosecution and
      defence so that all material supplied will be copied at the same time to the two Defence
      solicitors. This will be chargeable to you on the basis set out above.

5.    CPS guidance is that original statements should not be released from the archive. We are
      prepared to consider making appropriate arrangements for the inspection o f specific
      individual statements or other original material if good reasons are put forward.

There is no reason why this process should not now commence quite quickly once the terms above
have been accepted.

I look forward to hearing from you.

     Dear Ms Adlington
                                                                    Hillsborough Prosecutions

     Thank you for your fax o f today which I received at 5.35pm.

     I thought that numbered paragraph 6 of my letter made the position clear but for the avoidance of
     doubt the application for a witness summons against Mr.Daines will be opposed and he will be
     represented at the hearing by Miss Louise Varty o f counsel.

     I remain o f the opinion that the application is misconceived but I should make quite clear that in
     taking this view I do not in any way prejudge the separate issue o f whether material from the
     Hillsborough archive should be made available to the prosecution and, o f course, to the defence.
     This is a matter under consideration by the South Yorkshire Police now that the decision of the DPP
     has been made.

     Subject to my clients’ instructions I hope to be able to write to you further on this point early in the
     New Year but obviously the present application represents a distraction from that objective.

 Dear Sirs

 Adlineton -v- M urray, Adlington -v- Duckenfield

 Thank you for your letter of 8 December 1998. The ACC designated to deal with this matter by The
 Chief Constable is currently on leave and the points made below are merely matters which occur to
 us as o f potential significance:-

  1.           Unless there are some overriding considerations to the contrary we would anticipate that our
               clients would wish to comply with CPS guidance as well after as before any decision on
               intervention.

 2.            We do not think that the position is helped by an Application to issue a Witness Summons
               returnable on the first working day after the date on which the DPP decision is anticipated.

 3.            The Application has the air an attempt to “force” The Chief Constable into reaching a hasty
               decision. In view o f the possibility of such a Witness Summons setting an inappropriate
               precedent it seems to us likely that there will be a contest when there must be at least a
               reasonable possibility o f the matter otherwise being dealt with amicably,

 4.            We believe that the matters which will principally concern the Chief Constable will be
               fairness as between Prosecutor and Defendant and the question of cost: in a different context
               in your letter you make reference to protecting the interests of the Council Tax payers of
               South Yorkshire and you may rest assured that this is in the mind of The Chief Constable.

5.      It is possible that there will be some documentation in the schedules you have prepared
        which is arguably protected by public interest privilege. We rather doubt that will be the
        case but you should take that simply as an observation based on peaisal o f the schedules.

6.       If the DPP does not intervene in the prosecutions and you insist on proceeding with your
         Application on 21 December 1998 then we would expect you to deal with points raised by
        the cases o f R -v- Sheffield Justices ex p Wrigley [1988] RTR 78 and R -v- Greenwich
        Juvenile Court ex p Greenwich LBC [1977] 76 LGR 99. We also think that you will need to
        justify in relation to each statement why you believe this will be admissible without the maker
        being called. These points are not necessarily exhaustive.

With reference to the balance o f your letter we do not know what material is or not on the
HOLMES system and indeed we are not in a position to say whether any of the documents which
you identify do exist or are in the Hillsborough archive held by our clients.

We are not in a position to comment on the question of what arrangements could be made in respect
o f documentation although we are quite sure that our client would take exception to the reference to
a “neutral third party”. We are not sure what point you are making in your next paragraph. If the
Home Secretary has been providing you with documentation then he has neither started nor stopped
doing so on the basis o f our advice.

As to your pre-penultimate paragraph you kindly attached a copy o f your letter to Mr Daines but not
unfortunately the list which we presume was in turn attached to that letter. It is as well to make
clear that the address given to you for Mr White was that publicly available by examination o f the
Writ which he issued against the South Yorkshire Police and others in 1990 or 1991, Where an
address is not already a matter o f public record we would be surprised if our clients would be
prepared to supply this without the consent o f the officer concerned.

Your final paragraph is meaningless. If you have any specific and relevant point to make then we
suggest that you make it.

Yoursffaithfull

    Adlington v Murray. Adlington v Duckenfield

    You will recall that on 20th July last w e w rote to Ian Daines, Assistant Chief Constable, South
    Yorkshire Police, requesting the addresses o f serving and former officers o f South Yorkshire
    Police. In particular, we sought the address o f former Inspector Harry White. You
    responded, on 22nd July, on behalf o f M r Daines, declining our request pending the outcome o f
    the CPS review.

    You will be aware that the case is due back in Leeds Magistrates’ court on 7th December for
    directions. We intend to apply for a witness summons, directed to M r White, to produce
    certain documents which he has in his possession. Could you please supply his address for
    insertion in the Summons and subsequent service.

    We also intend to apply for a witness summons directed to M r Daines. Your attendance is not
    required although you may attend if you wish.


    Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Metcalf

We have written today to M r Croston at the Crown Prosecution Service in York. We enclose
a copy of our letter and o f the file.

Winkworth and Pemberton, from whom Mr Duckenfield now has the advantage o f receiving
appropriate professional advice, represented the South Yorkshire Police during the “Scrutiny”
of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. No doubt the reason that you did not advise the force last year
was because o f the prominent part your firm had played in giving advice in 1989-91, and no
doubt later in the various civil and other proceedings in which the force had interests. It was
probably thought that your firm, and you yourself, had been too close to events.

It is utterly inappropriate that you are involved now. The DPP will not make a decision on
this matter before October. We want to uncover further evidence to support the charges. We
believe that much o f that evidence has been suppressed. It is wrong that you should advise the
South Yorkshire Police to maintain exclusive custody o f the archive, when you and your firm
have been so deeply concerned in the way in which information and evidence has been
collected, edited and presented to outside tribunals, courts and law enforcement authorities
over the years. We are considering, with leading counsel, all legal options in respect o f your
and your firm’s conduct, and we contend, meanwhile, that you have a clear conflict of interest
in continuing to advise the South Yorkshire Police.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Sirs

 H illsborough D ocum entation

 Thank you for your letter o f 12 August 1998.

 We must advert directly to the final paragraph o f your letter. Neither we nor our clients accept that
 it is unreasonable” to obtain guidance from the DPP and, having obtained that guidance to follow
 it.

 That policy will continue to be applied impartially to prosecutor, Defendants and to any other party
 seeking information or documents until the CPS review is completed and the decision o f the DPP
 known.

 The other points made in your letter (which are not accepted) would in any event only become
 matters foM ^isideration if the prosecutions are to proceed.

Yours fait!

    Dear Sirs

    Adlington v M urray   Adlinaton v Duckenfkld
    The purpose of this letter is to request to you as a matter of urgency to make available the
    original papers and copies in the possession of your clients in relation to the Hillsborough
    disaster to both the prosecution and defence; alternatively, at the very least, to release them as
    soon as possible to some neutral third party.
    The HSFG is becoming increasingly concerned that all original papers are inthe custody of the
    South Yorkshire Police. Such papers as we have received from the Home Office in the 1
    year have led us to believe that the South Yorkshire Police adopted a deliberate policy of
    withholding material and not revealing fects as disclosed by its junior officers in their first
    statements after the disaster.
     We have received both edited and unedited versions of the statements of the South Yorkshire
     Police officers. The process of omitting material facts extending patently beyond that
     suggested in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report, and makes us suspect that he was misled in
     the course of his “Scrutiny”. We are in the process of preparing a detailed analysis.

     We have also received in the last year statements from spectators whose identities were


     witnesses were not called at the Inquest. We suspect the DPP was given an unbalanced
     account of the evidence.
     We invite you to explain by w hat legal process the W est M idlands Polk* enttusted d l t h .
     original papers, including copies o f the W est M idlands Police report * h! th e a to c e o f teadmg
     c o S on the subject o f prosecutions to a f o r« that w as under
     admitted negligence? W hy sh o u ld th e papers be m the possession o f the South Y orkshire
      Police at all?

We have seen a copy of a document called the “Phillips Report”. This is not the occasion to



    it?
    Assistant Chief Constable Daines has already expressed the opinion publically that ‘It is hard
    to imagine a private prosecution getting beyond the first hurdle . Is it     m e^e
    circumstances, that he should make, or be party to decisions about the disclosure to the
    prosecutor of the material in his possession at a time when the very existence of the
    prosecution is under challenge.
    We invite you to agree, without, of course, the slightest admission of impropriety, that the
    papers should no longer remain in the custody of the South Yorkshire Police. Justice must be
    seen to be done. The South Yorkshire Police have an obvious interest in the outcome of the
    prosecution, and there is at the very least a temptation to keep shrouded in secrecy relevant
    documentation, especially if it casts the force in a dubious light.
     Even if our suspicions are unfounded it is obviously in the interests of all parties to have
     simultaneous access to the archive. There may be material exculpating the defendants. We
     note that the South Yorkshire Police accepted publically the findings of Lord Taylor. It must,
     therefore, take the position, as Lord Taylor did, as a central finding that the failure to arrange
     for the diversion of the supporters from the central pens when the gates were opened was a
     blunder ofthe first m agnitude”, and the immediate cause of the disaster.
     We ask you to explain therefore how it is appropriate that South Yorkshire Police continue to
     hold the papers when it has associated itselfwithout reserve with an inquiry which has blamed
     at least one of the defendants, acting on its behalf, so comprehensively?
     We refer to our letter of 20* July to Mr Daines requesting the addresses of police officers with
     whomwe wish to speak. There is no possible bona fide reason why the DPP s review should
     prevent you from supplying this information. How can it be contrary to the interests ofjustice
     to give us these addresses so we can progress matters?
      The argument that you will no nothing until the DPP has made a decision to take over the ^
      prosecution is unreasonable in these circumstances. We invite you to reply positively to this
      letter before the end of the week, or we shall apply for a witness summons directed to Mr
      Daines requiring the production of all relevant documents. If there is another suitable person
      on whom the summons should be served, please let us know before 5 pm on Friday 14
      August.

 Dear Sir

 Hillsborough D ocum entation

 We have been asked by the South Yorkshire Police to reply to your letter o f 15 July 1998 addressed
 to P C Greenway.

 As you are aware Summonses have been issued in the Leeds Magistrates Court against David
 Duckenfield and Bernard Murray in connection with matters arising out o f the disaster.

 In connection with those Summonses requests for documentation and information have been
 received from a number o f persons.

 The Chief Constable sought guidance pursuant to Section 3(2)(e) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act
 1985 from the Director o f Public Prosecutions in relation to those requests.

 The response was that the Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing the question o f whether to
 intervene in the private prosecutions and that the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary
 disclosure o f documentation until that review was complete and a decision was made.

 The Chief Constable has accepted that guidance and accordingly will not respond to any requests for
 documentation or information until the CPS review has been completed and the decision o f the DPP
 is known.

    Dear Ms Adlington

    Hillsborouoh Stadium Disaster

    I refer to your recent requests of statements and information, some made direct to South
    Yorkshire Police and some made to Mr M PYNE, Home Office Policing Policy Unit.

    You began private prosecutions on 26 June 1998 for alleged offences concerned with the
    disaster. The Director of Public Prosecutions is reviewing the case. I am awaiting legal
    advice on whether I should release information.

    I will write to you again as soon as practicable.

    Yours sincerely

Dear Miss Coombes

 T H E H IL L SB O R O U G H D ISA STER

 I refer to your letter o f 20 July 1998 addressed to Mr Daines, Assistant Chief Constable and his
 response to you dated 22 July from which you will be aware that Mr Daines has asked us to act on
 behalf o f the Chief Constable.

 I note that you have taken over the conduct o f this matter from Messrs Watts Leather. I enclose
 copies o f our letters o f 6 and 21 July addressed to that firm.

 Regarding your request for access to documents and witnesses, our advice and instructions remain
 the same, ie we will await the outcome o f the CPS review before taking any action.

 Regarding charges for access to documents and/or interviews with serving police officers, or indeed
 any other services, again M r Daines has informed me that he will not make a final decision until he
 has DPP/CPS advice.

 I trust this clarifies the position.


                                                                                                        |B F e .E l V E P

       Dear M s A dlington

       R E : A D L IN G T O N v. D U C K E N F IE L D A N D M U R R A Y

       Further to our telephone conversation o f yesterday, I can confirm that the Crown
       Prosecution Service is n o w ready to give voluntary disclosure o f relevant docum ents
       in our p ossession having considered representations from the South Yorkshire police.

       This disclosure w ill be in accordance w ith the procedure noted in our letter o f 31
       D ecem ber 1998 to you and w hich w as copied to the solicitors for both defendants. It
       w ill be evenhanded as betw een the parties and w ill not include docum ents subject to
       legal privilege or public interest immunity.

       W e consider that it w ou ld be right and proper to make a charge for this voluntary
       disclosure based on the cost price o f the service provided to this office by our
       photocopying contractor. This w ould b^.& charge o f 1.9 pence per page. H ow ever,
       w e have decided that the first £50 o f charges to any party w ill be paid by us . A bill
       for the remaining amount, i f any, w ill be sent direct to that party from the contractor,
       Alphagraphics.

       I note your request in the last paragraph o f your letter o f 5 January 1999. I regret that
       I am unable to advise the C h ief Constable o f South Yorkshire on any matter unless a
       formal request has been m ade by him or those acting for him. That is not the case
       here.

       Please contact m e to arrange a date and tim e for your inspection o f our docum ents at
       this office. I understand that M onday 11 January 1999 m ay be suitable to you.

       Yours sincerely _            -

            RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

            I understand that you spoke to M r Booth on 30 December 1998 on the question of
            voluntary disclosure in this case. I thought it would be helpful if I w rote setting out
            the position o f the CPS.

            Given the enorm ous public interest in the case and the overriding need to ensure that
            there is a fair trial, the CPS is anxious to be as open and fair as possible. This means
            being fair to you th e prosecutor as w ell as the defendants. I am sending a copy o f this
            letter to the solicitors for the defendants.

            In our view, the course m ost likely to achieve fairness would be voluntary disclosure
            o f some o f the m aterial we hold. However, as you are aware, the South Yorkshire
            Police do not necessarily agree that voluntary disclosure is appropriate at this stage
            and they have, through their solicitors, suggested a delay until such tim e as the
            judicial review proceedings are concluded. Accordingly I have w ritten to them
            indicating the CPS view but also asking w hether there are any further reasons they
            can put forw ard w hich might influence our view. I have asked for a reply on or before
            6 January 1999 so that I can w rite to you before the hearing on 7 January 1999 with
            the CPS decision in principle.

            I refer to ‘som e’ o f the material. I know that there have been discussions about the
            m aterial held by the CPS. It is not our intention to disclose m aterial w hich attracts
            either legal professional privilege or public interest immunity. F or exam ple, w e will
            not voluntarily disclose copies o f counsel’s advice, our own internal mem oranda and
            opimons n o r correspondence w ith the police. In effect, the m aterial w e are proposing
            that w e will disclose w ill com prise copies o f witness statem ents and accompanying
            exhibits. O f course, disclosure w ill be even handed and w e intend that any material or
            facility we make available to you will also be made available to the solicitors for the
            defendants.

        You will be aw are that the m aterial w e hold does not com prise original w itness
        statements as, to the best o f my knowledge, they are held by the police.

        It appears fiom correspondence that you have already acquired a large am ount o f
        material as you have pointed out differences between versions o f the same w itness
        statement. To avoid unnecessary duplication, it would be very helpful if you could
        provide a list o f the m aterial you already hold so that we can see w hat further m aterial
        you require. Alternatively, you might like to indicate on a copy o f the schedule w e
        provided wfaat further material it is that you require.

            I will endeavour to make a decision before the next court hearing but w ill w rite again
            in any event.

Dear M r Newell

 Adlim’ton v Murray and Duckenticld.

 I write to you about tlie question o f disclosure o f the statements and exhibits in your
 possession in this case.

 We have repeatedly been told by the CPS in the course o f the review o f the last five and a half
 months that, if the CPS decided not to intervene and discontinue, there would be disclosure by
 the CPS o f the statements and exhibits in its possession.

 We have accepted this patiently, and we had every reason to believe that we would be given
 the proper opportunity to prepare our case. Indeed, this morning M r Croston told us at     .
 that we could come to York tomorrow to begin the inspection process.

 However, w e were then told that because the defendants have indicated that they would apply
 for Judicial Review o f your decision, you would have to consider the question ot voluntary
 disclosure and its timing again.

 We re-ard this as unacceptable     Everyone has known or believed that a decision adverse to
 the defendants would be the subject o f Judicial Review. It has never been your position that
 voluntary disclosure would await not only a decision not to discontinue, but the end ot any
 unsuccessful judicial review proceedings.

  The delay since the issue o f summonses is unacceptable. The Judicial Review proceedings are
  obviously speculative in character, and leave will be resisted by. us. and we hope the CPS, on
  the basis that the defendants have other remedies, namely, application to dismiss for abuse o

    process.


    There can be no justification for the postponement o f the disclosure o f this critical material on
    the grounds that one party might be granted leave to quash the decision not to take over
    proceedings which are pending in a lower court.


    I he magistrate has confirmed that the committal proceedings will begin on I9 ,h April.

    I look forward to an early reply.



    Yours sincerely

    Dear Ms Carlile,

    Thank you for your letter which was responded to by the Chief Constable's
    Staff Officer, on the 13th November 1991*

    As indicated in the Staff Officer's letter we were awaiting legal advice,
    and I have to inform you that that advice directs us not to release any
    information until such time as all discipline matters have been finalised.
    You will no doubt be aware that discipline matters are still pending against
    one officer in South Yorkshire, and until such time as the outcome of that
    matter is determined, I am unfortunately unable to release any material.

    I can once again assure you that the photograph has not been forgotten,
    and I will make every effort to release it as soon as I am in a position
    to do so. .

    Yours sincerely,




    Brian L Mole

Mrs S Stringer




Dear Mrs Stringer

Hillsborough Inquest

Thank you for your recent letter.  I was sorry to learn that the
solicitors acting for this office have not been in touch with you or your
legal advisers.  I have spoken to them again this morning, they have
confirmed that your request is being dealt with and that they will write
to you about this within the next few days.

Whilst I do not wish to appear unhelpful or impolite, I feel it is wrong
for me to be corresponding with you direct when there are solicitors on
both sides dealing with the case. I wonder therefore if I could ask you to
direct future correspondence through your solicitors until such time as
the Judicial Review is concluded.

Yours sincerely        J

         Dear Mr Heaven

         I refer to a letter received                from Mrs Stringer,         a .copy of      which    I hav
         attached for your information.

         The material Mrs Stringer lias requested was not                     introduced     at   the    incues
         and as such is not in the public domain.

         It is the policy of South Yorkshire Police not to release                                post   morte
         photographs and to date no such material has been released.

         Please be assured that I do not wish to be obstructive and am eager to assis
         in whatever way I possibly can.

         Yours sincerely

           Mr Philip Hammonc




          Dear Mr Hammond

          REQUEST FOR STATEMENTS

          Thank you for your letter of the 5 May 1992, I am sorry for the delay in
          replying but I think that this has been explained to you over the telephone
          by my staff.                                                       K

          Rule 57 of The Coroners Rules 1984 says that a Coroner, on application, shall
          supply to a properly interested person (which obviously includes you) a copy
          ot any report of a post-mortem examination, or  of any notes of evidence or
          of any document put in evidence at an Inquest.

          Iwas, therefore, able to supply you with a copy of the Post-Mortem Report
         without any difficulty.  However, it was necessary for me to ascertain
         whether the statements that you refer to were "any document put in evidence
         at an Inquest". So far as I can ascertain this is not the case, it may be
         that those witnesses gave evidence orally, but that is different to their
         statements becoming a document put in evidence.
                                          ’
                                          •jvV-
         However much I would like to assist you, I am afraid that this means that I
         do not personally have the power to release these statements to you.  So far
         as I can see the power rests with the Chief Constable on whosebehalf  the
         statements were taken.

         A number of relatives have requested statements from the Police and I gather
         that almost without exception the documents have been supplied. I cannot say
         whether this includes statements from Ambulance Service Personnel.

         I have, therefore, referred your request to Chief Superintendent Brian Mole
         who is the officer who is dealing with such requests.

         wiih 8 M ^ ? ly^ are °f the delay in d e a l i n 8 with your      request,I   havespoken
         with Mr Mole this morning and he has assured me that he         will telephone you
         this afternoon. I have given him the number I                    I




                                                                                  Cont/d.

I am sorry if your request seems to be going around the houses but I am
placed in a situation whereby I cannot release documents that do not belong
to me unless there is a specific legal power for me to do so.

If I can be of further assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.



Yours sincerely

          would wish to assist you if I can do so within the terms of the statute that
          goverr*,my position.

         I should say that I have considerable difficulty in accepting the points set
         out in the second paragraph of your letter. It is clear that the relevant
         statements were taken by or on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police for a
         number of purposes, but the prime purpose was for the criminal enquiry which
         resulted in papers being sent to the DPP.  I must maintain, therefore, that
         unless such statements fall within Rule 57 that they are the property of the
         Police and not mine to give away. Thfere is a specific legal precedent on
         this point.

         However, whilst we may disagree about the law involved, I remain sympathetic
         to your perfectly understandable request to have sight of the statements.  I
         have, therefore, had further talks with the Police and have agreed to release
         the documents on the basis that Rule 57 either might apply or might well have
         applied in the more normal circumstances of an individual Inquest.

         Accordingly, I enclose the statements that you have asked for. I hope that
         these will assist your family to come to terms with the tragedy which has
         befallen you.

         If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

            Hr & Mrs E Spearitt




            Dear Hr & Hrs Spearitt

            HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

            Further to our recent telephone conversation I am writing to advise you of
            the up to date situation on your request for sight of various statements.

            You are aware of the case of R v Hammersmith Coroner (exp Blair Peach) which
            makes it clear that statements given to a Coroner by the Police for the •
            purpose of an Inquest remain in the ownership of the Police. The Coroner has
            no power to let other parties have sight of these documents unless they
            subsequently fall under Rule 57 of The Coroners’ Rules. Rule 57 entitles an
            interested party to obtain from the Coroner a copy of "any document put in
            evidence at an Inquest". This.would normally mean a statement which was read
            out to the Court as an agreed piece of evidence in the absence of the person
            who made the statement.

            The power to release the statements requested therefore lies with the South
            Yorkshire Police and not with me. The Police have taken the view that they
            should not release statements witR'i3u£. the consent of the statement maker. I
            gather that in the vast majority of cases this permission has been given and
            thus legal difficulties have been avoided. Unfortunately the situation has
            not been so straight forward in Adam’s case.

            Dealing with each of the requests in turn:-

                 a)      The statements     of former Special Constable David Pearson do not fall
                         within Rule 57     but he has now given his consent for the release of the
                         statements and     these should have been posted to you last Friday direct
                         from the South     Yorkshire Police.

                 b)          In the main the statements of Pc Harratt do not fall within Rule 57.
                             This Officer gave oral evidence at the Inquest and it is quite plain
                             therefore that Rule 57 cannot apply. However, Pc Harratt’s statement
                             of the 4 October 1989 was put to him on a number of occasions during
                             his evidence and I take the view that either this statement was an
                             exhibit or that it should fall within Rule 57. Accordingly I enclose a
                             copy of that statement. Unfortunately it will not be of very much use
                             to you as this was the third statement taken from the Officer, the main
                             factual evidence being contained in the two earlier documents.

                                                                                          Cont/d....

                                       - 2 -



      At the present time Pc Harratt has not given his consent for the
      release of the other documents but I have to-day approached the Police
      again and asked that a Senior Officer speaks with Pc Harratt to see if
      there is any prospect of him giving consent. I will let you know the
      result of this immediately it is communicated to me.

 c)   The statements of Ambulance Personnel do not come within Rule 57. Each
      of the three people involved have refused permission for the release of
      their statements. I understand that this is a policy decision by all
      members of the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service rather
      than in any way related just to Adam’s case.   I have asked that this
      decision be re-considered but without success. I am not at all hopeful
      that any different result can be achieved but I have now been invited
      to speak again with the Solicitor representing the Ambulance Service
      and I will do this in the next two or three days. I.am not sure if any
      form of compromise can be worked out but as I am very sympathetic to
      your request I will certainly make efforts on your behalf.

I will continue with the various points mentioned above and will write.to you
again within the next ten days.


Yours sincerely

Dear Ms Carlile

Inquest into the death of your brother Paul

Thank you for your letter of 7th February. I am sorry for the delay in replying but I believe
you will already have received an acknowledgement indicating that I was away on holiday.

It is quite correct that the Coroner must hold papers relating to an Inquest for a minimum
of 15 years. The law relating to the inspection of such documents is contained in Rule 57
of the Coroners Rules 1984. This sets out that a Coroner shall supply to any “properly
interested person” (a phrase defined elsewhere in the rules, but which would include you)
a copy of any post-mortem report or any notes of evidence or of any document put in
evidence at an Inquest. There would normally be a charge for copying such documents
although this has generally been waived where applicable to the Hillsborough relatives.
Alternatively the Coroner may permit such a person to inspect such report, notes of
evidence or documents without charge at his office.

This means that the Coroner only has power to release either a post-mortem report, a
transcript of a case, or copies of statements that are actually read out as documentary
evidence. Any other documents that the Coroner is given sight of do not come under his
control and it is up to the owner or m aker of that document to authorise its release rather
than the Coroner. Saaiy it seem s tc me that the majority of statements in your brother’s
case probably fall within this latter category and I do not have the right to send copies of
them to you, however much I may wish to do so.

However, I am aware that you have been in correspondence with the Police and that they
have now sent you certain statements and may soon be in a position to send you others. I
understand that one witness (who in fact comes from Liverpool) has refused permission for
his statem ent to be released by the Police and thus I now need to review the transcript of

the Inquest in so far as it relates to your brother (obviously a very substantial task) to see
whether this statement might come within the definition of those that you are automatically
entitled to.

I would therefore be grateful for your continuing patience. I hope to be able to write to you
again within the next w eek or ten days. I can assure you that I am very sympathetic to
your request but I am sure you will realise that I am bound by the law and am unable to
hand out documents without regard to the legal position.

I will write to you again shortly.

 Mrs. A.E. Williams,




 Dear Mrs. Williams,

 Further to my letter of the 4th February I have now had the*
 opportunity of discussing your request with Dr. Popper.

 It is apparent that the situation is not as simple as your letter
 originally led me to believe.  The statements of Mr. Bruder and
 WPC Martin were not tendered in evidence at the Inquest as such,
 rather it was a case of the contents of the statements being referred
 to when either the Presenting Officer or the doctor were questioned.
 I do however accept that short extracts from Mr. Bruder's statement
 were quoted in this manner.

As a matter of general principle I should say that I might not
accept that Rule 57 of the Coroners Rules 1984 therefore applied
to these statements.   However, having spoken both wit h Dr. Popper
and Chief Superintendent Mole (who is now in charge of the paper
work retained by South Yorkshire Police) we feel that as you clearly
are still very anxious that an exception can be made in this case.
Accordingly I enclose copies of the statements of Mr. Bruder and
WPC Martin.  There is also a ph ot o c o p y of a for m completed by WPC
Martin and referred to in her statement.

So far as the photographs are concerned it is not within my ability
to let you have copies and I have referred this to     Chief
Superintendent Mole.   He informs me that he wi l l supply you with copie
of the photographs requested subject only t o :confirmation that the
copyright of those p hotographs lies with the police rather than with
individual news media.   Mr. Mole is in the process of organising
photographs etc. for a large number of relatives and I am sure he
will as^ you to be patient whilst he deals w i t h all requests.

I hope that prov ision of these documents will ul timately assist you
in coming to terms w i t h the terrible traaedy wh i c h has befallen
your life.


Yours sincerely.

                   (in) M r Daines expressed the view in a police periodical, after the “Scmtiny” of
                   Lord Justice Stum-Snuth in 1998, that any private prosecution was likely to
                   "fall at the first hurdle";


                   (iv) the prosecution has common law duties to disclose any material that may
                   possibly be relevant to the defence (see R v. K eane (1994) 99 Cr, App, R. 1)-
                   and to disclose material in the possession o f “the total apparatus ofthe
                   Crown”(.K v. W a rd (1993) 96 Cr. App. 1.)


 5.8      The charges o f £30.00 per hour, proposed by M r Metcalf to be levied for the purposes
         o f copying the material to the prosecution, are extortionate. To seek, in addition, to
         levy the same charge on the prosecution for copying the same material to the defence
         SO   tcitors, Who are in any event supported by the local police fund, is calculated to
         frustrate the prosecution and the criminal process. The prosecution is not supported
         by public funds. By contrast, the Crown Prosecution Service has copied all its “non-
         sensitive” material for the prosecution at a purely nominal cost, without conditions or

                made these assertions were Hammond Suddarts o f Leeds, and in particular M r Peter
                MetcalC who has advised the police about the prosecution's requests for disclosure
                since this prosecution was instituted in July 1998.

      5.12
                Attached are other letters showing that the South Yorkshire police, sometimes with
               the help ofthe Coroner, controlled the disclosure of material collected by or for other
               agencies after the inquest until the disclosure ordered bythe Home Office in 1997
               [A nnex E ) . These matters were referred to in the witness statement of Ann Adlington
               which constituted her cvidencc in diief at the abuse of process hearing at the Leeds
               Magistrates Court on 8* July 1999. Although she was cross-examined extensively
               about other matters, her evidence in relation to this correspondence was not
               challenged or investigated by the defence.

     5.13
               For all these reasons it is submitted that it is imperative that the prosecution achieves
              early and complete access to the archive; andwelcomes the full co-operation ofthe
              Crown Prosecution Service in this process as a neutral party. It is submitted that all
              the matenal should ideally be transferred to the control ofthe Crown Prosecution
              Service, and that disclosure should thereafter be made as requested by the court
              Otherwise, the court is asked to request full andunrestrained access to all the archive
              mthe possession of South Yorkshire police, at all nomial working hours, and that the
              prosecution can take its own photocopier and computers to the archive, subject to the
              supervision of the CPS.

    5.14
              The defence have hitherto declined to support the Crown in its requests for disclosure
             ofthe Hillsborough archive. It may be that both defendants have had access to it
             already. Winkworth Sherwood, who now represent MrDuckenfield, represented the
             legal interests ofthe ChiefConstable during the ‘'Scrutiny” of Lord Justice Stuart-
               m.th, and have presumably had access to, and may retain copies of, most ofthe
             relevant material. It is to be presumed that MrDuckenfield instructed themto defend
             himin the current proceedings with these matters in mind.

    5.15     M r Manning o f Walker Morris represented M r Munay throughout the Inquest where
             he undoubtedly had access, formally and infernally, to extensive South Yorkshire
             police documents and information denied to those who represented the bere.v*)

    7.2   M r Duckenfield admitted telling these lies, and allowing others to believe them, when
          cross-examined at the Taylor Inquiry. A jury is entitled to believe that he told these
          lies, not in order to prevent supporters turning in anger on the police, but to deflect
          blame from himselfat the inevitable judicial inquiry or inquiries.

                                     Matters to be raised bv the Crown


  1          I ,fingth n f    The prosecution hesitates to estimate the length of the trial, because it
            has yet to see the voluminous collections of papers prepared by West Midlands Police
            for the Inquiry in 1989 by Lord Taylor; for the Crown Prosecution Service in 1989-90;
            for the Coroner in 1989-91; and, with other forces, for the Police Complaints
            Authority in 1989-92. It has acted so far on the basis o f;


                     (i)      the limited number o f statements made available by the Home Office to
                              the prosecution in 1997-8;
                      (ii)    transcripts ofthe Taylor Inquiry and inquests made available at the time
                               o f these inquiries;
                      (iii)   edited and unedited statements o f South Yorkshire police put in the
                               House of Common library at the insistence ofthe Home Secretary in
                               April 1998;
                      (iv)    the material made available in the last year by the Crown Prosecution
                               Service (who were given in 1990, for the purposes o f deciding whether
                               to bring prosecutions arising from the disaster, only about 11% ofthe
                               total statements collected)


    1.1      All the original and copy material is held by the South Y orkshire police, but, as
             appears below, there is doubt and uncertainty as to the extent o f disclosure which that
             force w ill make, and the terms on which it will be made.


      1.2    However, the central part ofthe prosecution case is likely to be the evidence of
             witnesses whose statements were served for committal, which are likely to be
             uncontroversial; photographic, video and other documentary evidence; and the
             admissions ofthe defendants to the Taylor Inquiry and the Coroner’s Inquest.


      1.3    It is thought likely at this stage that the prosecution case will be complete in three to
              four weeks. The prosecution believes that the defence will probably call no evidence.



                                                         1


                                                                01/09 '99 WED 12:02         [TX/RX NO 5183]
H F S G                                   ®   +0151-236-1936               01/09    ' 9 9 12:05 0      :03




   1.4    The prosecution believes that the issues inthe case are likely to turn on the
          interpretation of known events, rather than on disputed questions of fact. This forecast
          is tentative because, in accordance with the observations made at the outset of the
          abuse of process hearing to the magistrate by leading counsel for Mr Duokenfield,
          supported by leading counsel for Mr Murray, the nature of the defence did not emerge
          at the lower court. At the abuse of process heating and committal proceedings, the
          defendants declined to give evidence.

   1.5    In assessing the length of the trial, it should be borne in mind that, some months after a
          preliminary committal bundle had been served, it was estimated by leading counsel for
          Mr Murray on 21"*December 1998 at the Leeds Magistrates Court that the committal
          would take at least four weeks, apart fromthe abuse of process hearing. In the event,
          the committal proceedings took less than three days, after an abuse of process healing
           which look less than five days.

   2      The defence. In the interests of trial management, it is submitted that the defendants
          should be invited to set out in general terms the nature of their defence, as if this were
          a case to which section 5 (5) and (6) of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act
          1996 applied. (It has been agreed by all parties that, since there had been a police
          investigation in 1989-90, the provisions of that Act did not apply, hence the “old-
          style” committal and disclosure procedures govern the case.)

   3      Admissions. The defendants made admissions of uncontroversial facts at committal
          under section 10 ofthe Criminal Justice Act 1967, but insisted on purporting to limit
          the scope ofthose admissions to the committal proceedings.

   3.1    The prosecution has invited the solicitors for the defendants by letter of 22ndJuly 1999
          ( p8 ) to indicate before 3rdSeptember that the same admissions will be made for trial,
          and, if not, to explain why. The prosecution wishes to know now whether it needs to
          incur the expense of proving the subject-matter of those admissions formally at the
          trial. Relevant correspondence between prosecution and defence since committal is
          Annex A,


   3.2    In particular, it will be argued that the leave ofthe court is needed by virtue of section
          10 (4) of the 1967 Act to withdrawthe admissions, notwithstanding the purported
          limitation on their effect.

   4      The admission in evidence of the defendants’ evidence to previous inquiries. The
          prosecution submits that the defendants should disclose at an early stage whether they
          intend to object to the admission in evidence of their evidence to the Taylor Inquiry
          and the Inquest, and interviews with West Midlands Police and should indicate in
          writing the legal basis for any such objections. It is submitted that, should any such
          argument be contemplated, the matter should be resolved at anearly preliminary
          hearing. If the evidence were to be excluded, the prosecution would need to prove
           some ofthe basic facts admitted inthe course of that evidence, to the extent that it
          were possible, by other means.

   5      Disclosure of the Hillsborough archive. A bundle of correspondence passing between
          the prosecution and the South Yorkshire police is attached as A nnex B . At present the
          ChiefConstable holds all the papers relating to the disaster that were collected for
          otherjudicial and investigative bodies. The Crown needs to see them. It is submitted
          that there is no lawful basis upon which the ChiefConstable should be regarded as the
           custodian ofthe papers, capable of deciding for himselfwhether, to whom, and under
           what conditions those papers should be disclosed.

    5.1   The Court will be asked to give guidance to the ChiefConstable to make available all
          material described inthe letter of Ann Adlington to Mr Daines of 20* August 1999,
          (pp 16 -19) on the same modest financial terms that the Crown Prosecution Service
          imposed when it disclosed its material last Januaiy. The Court should particularly
          request disclosure of material in usable disc form as well as originals of documents
          requested. It appears that it will be unnecessary to conduct legal argument about the
          legal basis for disclosure, the letter of Mr Metcalfof 2G81July 1999 (pp 23 - 24)
          indicates that the ChiefConstable will act upon a request froma court.

    5.2   It had been hoped to have resolved this matter by agreement before 3"1September. The
           most recent letter fromMr Daines of 26* August suggests, however, that this problem,
           which was raised by the prosecution on 22nd July 1999,( pp 25 - 27) two days after
           committal, will not be resolved for some time in the absence of guidance and requests
           from(lie Court. The only material that was disclosed by the South Yorkshire police to
           the prosecution before the committal hearing consisted of a few documents that the
           prosecution was able to identify with the precision required by section 97 ofthe
           Magistrates Court 1980, and one document that was “voluntarily disclosed”. They
           were produced to the court only after a formal application for a witness summons, the
           issue of which the ChiefConstable opposed in its entirety through lawyers at court on
           10thMay 1999.

                                                    3


                                                             01/09 '99 WED 12:02    [TX/RX NO 5183]

 5.3     In spite ofthe ostensibly open attitude displayed by the South Yorkshire police since
         committal, the prosecution fears procrastination and delay, in the light ofthe unco­
         operative attitude shown by the force inthe previous twelve months,. Tfthe trial is not
         to take place until summer 2000, it is vital that the long inspection proccss should
         begin in September 1999, before the administrative demands of a pending trial become
         pressing.

 The con d itio n s req u ired b y th e S o u th Yorkshire p o lic e


 5.4     The reference by Mr Daines at the end of his letter of 26®August to assurances and an
         “administration charge” are set out in the letter of Mr Metcalfof 30* Dcccmbcr 1998
         (not “September”). ( pp 119 -121)

 5.5     These conditions are unacceptable. The “conditions” numbered 2.1,2.2, and 2.3
         cannot be insisted upon. The only bodies with standing even to seek any such
          conditions would be the bodies for whomthe material was collcctcd, namely, the
          Taylor Inquiry (Hume Office), the CPS, the Coroner; and the Police Complaints
          Authority. It appears to be accepted by Mr Metcalfin his letter of 26* July 1999 that
         the archive is not held by South Yorkshire police by legal right.

 5.6     The South Yorkshire police are not competent to request the conditions for the further
          reason that the common law implies limitations upon the use of material obtained for
          the purposes of criminal proceedings. These implied undertakings provide adequate
          protection for the rights of others. See Taylor v. Serio u s F ra u d O ffice [1998] 3
          W.L.R. 1041 (HL).

 5.7     It is particularly offensive to seek to “require” a briefexplanation of the relevance of
          documents to the charges for the following reasons:

                   (i) the ChiefConstable is not to be thejudge of the relevance of documents to
                   legal issues; nor should he or his lawyer claimbe the arbiter of the question of
                   what material should be disclosed to, and subsequently by, the Crown;

                   (ii) the ChiefConstable has supported the defendants in these criminal
                   proceedings; although he has always admitted in civil proceedings that the
                   conduct of which the defendants are accused was negligent, and caused death,
                   he has procured the funding of their defence by the South Yorkshire Police
                   Authority in full, and all associated costs and expenses, both for the criminal
                                                           4

                                                                    01/09 '99 WED 12:02    [TX/RX NO 5183]
H F S G                                        9   + 0 1 5 1 -2 3 6 -1 9 3 6   01/09     '9 9 1 2:06 0   :06




                  defence to these charges, and for any ancillaryjudicial review proceedings that
                  the defendants may be advised to bring;

                  (iii) Mr Daines expressed the view in a police periodical, after the “Scrutiny” of
                  Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1998, that any private prosecution was likely to
                  “fell at the first hurdle”;

                   (iv) the prosecution has common lawduties to disclose any material that may
                   possibly be relevant to the defence (see R v. K eane (1994) 99 Cr. App. R. 1);
                   and to disclose material in the possession of “the total apparatus ofthe
                   Crown”( R v, W ard (1993) 96 Cr. App. 1.)

   5.8    The charges of £30.00 per hour, proposed by Mr Metcalfto be levied for the purposes
          of spying the material to the prosecution, are extortionate. To seek, in addition, to
          levy the       charge on the prosecution for copying the same material to the defence
          solicitors, who are in any event supported by the local police fund, is calculated to
          frustrate the prosecution and the criminal process. The prosecution is not supported
          by public funds. By contrast, the Crown Prosecution Servicc has copied all its “non­
          sensitive” material lbr the prosecution at a purely nominal cost, without conditions or
          resentment.

   5.9     For information, correspondence passing between the CrownProsecution S ervice and
           prosecution on this subject is attached as A nnex C.

   The earlier co n tro l o f th e p a p ers by South Yorkshire p o lice


   5.10    The Court is asked to bear in mind in this matterthat the South Yorkshire police force,
           in its own interests, appears to have exercised a tight control over the papers inthe
           case at critical stages inthe history of the investigations into the Hillsborough disaster.
           Attached are letters written in relation to disclosure of statements at the main Inquest
           between November 1990 and March 1991 ( pp 165 - 166) in connection with requests
           of Trevor Hicks and Sandra Stringer, bereaved parents (A nnex D ). These letters,
           written by very senior members of the West Midlands police, suggest that South
           Yorkshire police, who were an interested party at the Inquest, and who were engaged
           at the time in civil proceedings, controlled the process of disclosing material to the
           bereaved families at the Inquest through their lawyers.

    5.11 The lawyers acting for South Yorkshire police at the time the West Midlands police

          made these assertions were Hammond Suddards of Leeds, and in particular, Mr Peter
          Metcalf, who has advised the police about the prosecution’s requests for disclosure
          since this prosecution was instituted in July 1998.

  5.12 Attached are other letters showing that the South Yorkshire police, sometimes with
       the help of the Coroner, controlled the disclosure of material collected by or for other
       agencies after the inquest until the disclosure ordered by the Home Office in 1997
       (A nnex E ). These matters were referred to in the witness statement of Ann Adlington
       which constituted her evidence in chiefat the abuse of process hearing al the Leeds
       Magistrates Court on 8* July 1999. Although she was cross-examined extensively
        about other matters, her evidence in relation to this corrcspondcncc was not
        challenged or investigated by the defence.

  5.13 For all these reasons it is submitted that it is imperative that the prosecution achieves
       early flurt complete access to the archive; and welcomes the full co-operation ofthe
       Crown Prosecution Service in this process as a neutral party. It is submitted that all
       the material should ideally be transferred to the control ofthe Crown Prosecution
       Service, and that disclosure should thereafter be made as requested by the court.
       Otherwise, the court is asked to request full and unrestrainedaccess to all the archive
       in the possession of South Yorkshire police, at all normal working hours, and that the
       prosecution can take its own photocopier and computers to the archive, subject to the
        supervision of the CPS.

   5.14 The defence have hitherto declined to support the Crown in its requests for disclosure
        ofthe Hillsborough archive. It may be that both defendants have had access to it
        already. Winkworth Sherwood, who now represent Mr Duckenfield, represented the
        legal interests ofthe ChiefConstable duringthe “Scrutiny” ofLord Justice Stuart-
        Smith, and have presumablyhad access to, and may retain copics of, most of the
        relevant material. It is to be presumed thaLMr Duckenficld instructed themto defend
        himin the current proceedings with these matters in mind.

   5 .15 Mr Manning of Walker Morris represented Mr Murraythroughout the Inquest, where
         he undoubtedly had access, formally and informally, to extensive South Yorkshire
         police documents and information denied to those who represented the bereaved
         families.

   5.16 The defence is invited to support the prosecution position in relation to the
        Hillsborough archive.

   A ccess to o rig in a l docum ents; the sig n ifica n ce o f the e d ite d statem ents


   5.17 At the insistence of the Home Secretary, ait South Yorkshire police statements
        relevant to the disaster were placed in the House of Commons libraiy in April 1998,
        There are over 100 examples of police statements, edited so as to remove assertions of
        fact hostile to South Yorkshire police, most of which could not have been shown to
        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in 1997, who reported only a few examples of editing
        Evidence is available suggesting that this editing process was conducted by South
        Yorksliirc police officers under the advice or guidance of Mr MeLcalf. Only the edited
        versions were sent to the CPS and Coroner in 1990 and 1991. The prosecution should
        be entitled to inspect all original documents and insist upon their transmission to the
        courLwhere they are ufevidential relevance..

   6       Disclosure, The prosecution disclosed all the witness statements and exhibits in its
            possession to the defence before committal, allowing full inspection at its Liverpool
            offices. The subject is dealt with in a letter fromthe prosecution to Winkworth
            Sherwood dated 27* August inA nnex A. ( pp 2 - 4 )

   7       The,indictment. Counts 1,2 and 3 reflect the charges on which the defendants were
           committed for trial. Counts 4 and 5 have been added as permitted by the proviso to
           section 2 (2) ofthe Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933. As
           a matter of history, count 4 is based upon a charge alleged in the summons issued by
           the Leeds Magistrates Court in July 1998, but which the CrownProsecution Service
           took over under section 6 (2) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, and
           discontinued under scction 23 (3), in April 1999, Count 5 is new.

   7.1     It is submitted that Mr Duckenfield told lies to representatives of the Football
            Association, his superior officcr Mr Jackson and others about the circumstances in
           which the Gate C (and perhaps other gates) became open. Contemplating that an
           inquest or other forms ofjudicial inquiry would be instituted, and knowing that
           inquiries were being made by persons which were relevant to suchjudicial inquiries,
           Mr Duckcnficld sought, at a time when it was apparent to himand many others that
           fatalities had been caused, to attribute the deaths to the actions of Liverpool supporters
           inbreaking open a gate or gates. R v. V revnes [1891] 1 Q.B. 360; R v. Selvage a n d

    7.2   Mr Duckenfield admitted telling these lies, and allowing others to believe them, when
          cross-examined at the Taylor Inquiry. Ajury is entitled to believe that he told these
          lies, not in order to prevent supporters turning in anger on the police, but to deflect
          blame fromhimselfat the inevitablejudicial inquiry or inquiries.

    7.3   The same facts support the lesser charge of misconduct in public office; R   v, D ytham
          (1979) 69 Cr, App. R. 387

    8     Copies of this argument and relevant annexes will be provided to the Crown
          Prosecution Service, and Mr Daines, with an invitation to both to attend or be
          represented at the hearing on 3rdSeptember.

D ear M r Croston,

R v. D uckenfield and M u rray

W e have just received a letter from M r Daines, o f which I attach a copy. You will see that he
indicates that he will release copies o f the W est Midlands police report and the advice o f
Gareth Williams QC and Peter B irts QC if “we have copies o f them” .

I request you therefore to authorise their release. I f he has counsel’s opinion, privilege has
been waived. According to a report by M r Peter W right, Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire
to his police authority in January 1990, the DPP commissioned the W est Midlands police in
August 1989 to make a full criminal investigation, pursuant to which, I assume, the DPP asked
for counsel’s advice.

Given that M r Daines does not claim PII, I invite you to indicate that the W est Midlands
Police Report should be released.

Yours sincerely,




Ann Adlington
Solicitor

                 Dear Mrs Adlington

                 ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

                 I refer to your letter of 20 August 1999. I have discussed your letter with Mr George Croston,
                 CPS, and Mr Peter Metcalfe, Hammond Suddards.

                 If we are in possession of items 1 - 9 and I can find them then I am prepared to disclose them.
                 In particular, I do not know w hether we hold pocket books of officers containing notes of the
                 events of 15 April 1989 (item 2 on your list). If we hold the pocket books, I will disclose the
                 relevant pages. I will let you know as soon as the position is clear.

                 I am not at liberty to disclose the opinions of Gareth Williams, Q C, and Peter Birts, QC. They
                 were commissioned by the DPP and it is for him to decide whether he wishes to disclose
                 them. Similarly, I am not at liberty to disclose the W est Midlands Police Report to the DPP.
                 However, if Mr Croston wishes either document to be released and we have copies of them. I
                 will release them to you.

                 I will enquire whether it is possible to transfer H O LM E S material onto a disc for your use (item
                 12 on your list). I will need to check with the Hom e Office whether they wish me to release
                 material in this manner, the H O LM E S system is a Home Office system.

                 You ask me to define what I mean by “supervised" access. This is Mr Croston's phrase and
                 perhaps you should clarify it with him. For my part, I see it in the following terms:

                 You will come to our archive store. If you wish to be accompanied by legally qualified staff. I
                 would ask to be told of their names before arrival. Material will be brought from the storeroom
                 to another room and you will exam ine the material while my staff are in the room but they will
                 not overhear your conversations. If you want a document to be copied, my staff will do that
                 either immediately or as soon as practicable. Originals will be returned to the store.

                 On 30 September 1998, my solicitor Peter Metcalfe (Hammond Suddards) wrote to you and at
                 paragraphs 2.1, 2.2 and 3 he asked for assurances from you regarding confidentiality and
                 payment of an administration charge. Please respond to these requests.

                 Yours sincerely

                We     left            Liverpool           at   10.00arri.         On    r o ute       to S h e f f i e l d      we    did    not       stop.

                We     used            the M 6 2      motorway,          there      was       only        a ten m i n ut e        de^ay       due       to

                There           were          only    locals         in t h i s    pub,       no     other         Liverpool          supporters.                   We

fans        or a n y    unruly            behaviour.            we aj/rived at                    the        g r o u n d at      about

The     queues         at    the       turnstiles            it/ L e p p i n g s       Road         were          unbelievable?.

    There    were      thousands             of    peop/a       there       trying           to       get         in.

              a n d I ha d t i c:k e t s                          did      not.         We        stood           in L e p p i n g s     Road,

             t ried to purchase                    a ticket          but wit h          no success.                       All    three       of u

turnstiles.                                                                                  /

T here       we r e about             two    po 1 i cemen on each                pe f/Lmet e r gate , opening and

closing         the gates,                letting a . f e w          fans    in at a time.                             They were

struggling             to    close          them because             of the weight                    of the            people.          People

were        still      arriving a n d              joining        the throng                of      people.               There       were     no

As     I wal k e d      through             the    perimeter          gates,           I lost               contact w i t h _______ jars

             r they         were       carried          away    in the       cro wd.                I was          trying        to m a k e     my

way     towards         the       turnstiles.                I could        see        one        railing              in f r o n t    of    the

turnstile,             I assumed             there       were    more       so     t hat          people           could        line     up to

go     in    through         the       turnstiles.              The     crowd was                 t ha t      intense           that     I

could        not    reach         the       turnstiles,           instead          I got            carried             around        with     the

            I rea 1 ised             I was          standing             on    p e o p 1e t h o u g h          I could          not       see       them.           T'hey

            may    ha v e be e n dead.                        We     started          p u 1 1 ing       and      p u s h i ng at          the       f r a nt

            fence       trying            to       break        it.

            By    now     lots           of    f ans         and     police         officers            were        on    the       pitch       trying             to

            undo       the    fence,               to    get       people          out.        The      fence         earns off           and       the

            pressure          eased            from          behind.           1 saw         t h e r/z w e r e two w h i t e               lads          o n th e

            heart       massage               on    one       of / h e m ,          3 or 4         police           officers          jumped             down       on

            and met                            on the           pitch.             I got       out      through           the       ripped          fence.              W<-

            6 dead        p e o i/l e f r o m            the       pitch       on rr/4keshift              s t r e t c h e r s f, o the              g y m n as i urn«

            There       were         about          fifty          po 1 i c emeyfo by the               goals         trying         to    h e l/fr.          I have

            to    say    that            they were              bri 3.1. ia/t         and      really          trying          to    iiel/>-.        But       there

            was    a    line         of       police          on     the      centre         line       t h at      were disgusting.                          We    we r

            carrying          dead            bodies          towards          this         line,       they wo ul d            rpt       let       us    through

            They       would         not       move          and     let      us    through.              In one          instance          this          caused

            us    to    drop         a    lad       on       the     floor         because         we     bumped          into       the    line          of

            police.           The         lad w a s           already          d e a d a n y w a y , but              the      police       there             never-

            helped       us.

            We    left       the         ground          of     own accord.

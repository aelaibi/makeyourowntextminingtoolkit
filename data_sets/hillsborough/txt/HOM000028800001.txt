Thank you for your letter of 23 December, addressed to
Michael Howard, enclosing copies of correspondence received by the
Hillsborough Disaster Working Party.

As you will be aware, the Home Secretary has undertaken to consider
carefully the points which were made in the programme Hillsborough,
and the representations which have been made to him by the bereaved
families and by others.  He has emphasised that he would not take
the decision to reopen the inquiry lightly but would need to be
convinced that it would be in the public interest to do so and that
it would stand a chance of providing a better understanding than
there is at present of what happened on that terrible day.

In coming to his decision the Home Secretary will consider whether
there is any new evidence; he will also consider whether that
evidence appears to be of such significance that had it been put
before Lord Taylor or before the coroner, either the outcome of the
Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the jury would have been different.

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has undertaken to provide the
Home Secretary with a detailed report of all the points raised by
the programme.  The Home Secretary has promised that he will reach a
decision on any further action to be taken as soon as he has been
able to consider all the issues.

Thank you for your letter of 23 December,                                      addressed to Michael

Howard,      enclosing              copies      of     correspondence             received          by    the

Hillsborough Disaster Working Party.



As    you    will       be    aware,          the    Home     Secretary          has     undertaken        to

consider carefully the points which were made                                      in the programme

Hillsborough,           and        the   representations             which       have    been      made    to

him by the bereaved                  families         and by others.             He     has    emphasised

that    he    would          not     take      the     decision           to    reopen       the    inquiry

lightly but would need to be convinced that it would be in the

public      interest          to    do   so and that           it would          stand       a chance      of

providing      a    better          understanding            than        there    is    at    present      of

what happened on that terrible day.



In    coming       to    his       decision          the    Home     Secretary          will       consider

whether      there           is    any    new        evidence;           he    will     also       consider

whether      that       evidence         appears       to be        of    such    significance           that

had    it    been       put        before      Lord        Taylor        or    before    the       coroner,

either the outcome of the Taylor inquiry or the verdict of the

jury would have been different.



The    Chief       Constable             of     South       Yorkshire           has     undertaken         to

provide      the    Home          Secretary         with    a detailed           report       of   all    the

points raised by the programme.                            The Home Secretary has promised

that he will reach a decision on any further action to be taken

as soon as he has been able to consider all the issues.

Dear Michael

I attach a sample of the letters the Hillsborough
Families have received, which is self-explanatory.

I would welcome your comments.

            Why wasn’t I there?

THE NIGHTMARE OF WISHING YOU WERE DEAD
 Part One

 ‘Are we going then or what?’
 ‘Don’t know, can we really afford it?’
  Not really, but it would be good. Could you get the day off work9’
 |Only o k way to find out isn’t there! I’ll let you know tomorrow.' See you then.’


 Part Two

 ‘I can’t go.’
 ‘Why?’
 Think about it. A day off will cost us fifteen quid, then there’s the ticket and the
travelling expenses. I’m skint.’
 Me too. I was just waiting for you to back down first.’
 Crafty Sod. I’ll let the tickets go then.’

Part Three

 Gordon, can I go to the van and listen to the start of the match? I’ll only be ten
minutes.’
‘OK, bring back some eggs.’
’Great! LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL LIVERPOOL.’

Part Four

‘Where are the eggs?’
  Something’s happened.’
‘Go and get the eggs.’
‘But...’
‘Go on, have another listen if you like.’
 It s been stopped. Something to do with Liverpool fans fighting behind the goals,
oomeone s dead, a heart attack. I hope the lads are ok.’

Part Five

‘Are you ok?’
‘The radio says there are about five dead now. It wasn’t fighting after all. Apparently
there were too many people there.’
‘Come back to work.’

Part Six

‘Gregg, they say seventy-five are dead now.’
‘Oh God, I want to go home.’

Part Seven
‘Mum, it’s me. Have you heard the news? When are you coining home? Where is
everyone?’
‘Have you contacted the others?’
‘Norm’s mum is still waiting, and Gareth’s family are in America.’
‘Don’t worry son, they’ll be ok.’

Part Eight

‘But Chris, we should have been there. If we hadn’t have given he tickets away, we
could be dead!’
‘Calm down. Gareth and Norm are all right. Now we’ve got to help the people who
have been affected more than us.’
‘But we could have been dead.’

Dear Trevor

  OTHER EVIDENCE TO CONSIDER REGARDING POLICE NEGLIGENCE AT
                  HILLSBOROUGH ON 15/4/89.

Before I start I would just like to offer my deepest support arid sympathy to you,
your family and other families directly affected by events at Hillsborough stadium
on 15/4/89. As a life long Sheffield Wednesday supporter and current Safety
Steward at Hillsborough, I still feel scared by ‘Hillsborough’ but I cannot begin to
understand how the families directly affected still feel and still cope.

I am writing to point out some evidence that you may have over looked and
which you may choose to use one day in the near future to prove that those
police, who on the day of the disaster were given the responsibility of public
safety, were not Just one partly involved in an unfortunate accident but who
were criminally negligent and totally responsible for the 96 deaths. Any fool
can put their hand up and claim partial responsibility for the disaster, but it is
my belief that if justice is to be done, and we are to learn the real lessons post
Hillsborough, then another inquiiy should be held and Individuals should be
prosecuted, convicted and punished appropriately.

It is my belief that the police had enough information before 15/4/89 to be in a
position to foresee exactly what could happen outside the ground and what would
be the consequences if the outside gate was opened without opening the
perimeter pitch gates. People died because when the outside gate was opened
other vital steps were not taken inside the ground to divert fans away from the
tunnel and to relieve pressure inside the middle pen by opening pitch side gates
and trusting fans to sit orderly around the side of the pitch.

As the disaster was unfolding I was listening to the match (and its build up) sat
in my car in Wythenshaw libraiy car park. As I became aware of what was
happening at Hillsborough I remember saying to my wife ‘0 no, the gates, their
not opening the gates". I knew the stadium very well and I knew its potential
danger areas. I was at the 1981 FA cup semi-final between Spurs and Wolves.
On that day a large number of Spurs fans turned up late (I believe they were late
due to the arrival of a late train into Sheffield). On that day the fans were let
into the ground and a problem began to develop in the tunnel and at the front of
the middle pen. Because of the location of the tunnel, which is seen as you enter
the Leppings lane end, most fans head straight down it and into the middle pen
because they can see the pitch at the bottom of the tunnel. If they are late they
do not look to go around to the less congested pens on each side of the lower part
of the stand. On that day the police opened the perimeter gates at the start of the
match and fans were allowed to sit around the side of the pitch. If you look at
photos of the match you will see them. Some important and respected people in
football today were at that match and will remember some of the events of that
day eg, Glenn Hoddle, Andy Gray, Garth Crooks and Osvaldo Ardiles.

It is because of my knowledge of Hillsborough and of the histoiy of problems that
had developed at previous matches that allowed me to understand what was
happening on 15/4/89 even though I was not there. If I knew what was going
wrong 36 miles away then what I can't come to terms with is how could
officers, who should know about potential problems and how to deal with
them, not have know and even not have been competent enough to know
how to deal with them. People died because of the clear incompetence of one
party ie the police, nothing else. This now needs proving in the eyes of the law.
It was no accident!!!

Everything I have read or heard about the disaster since 1989 has been about the
day itself or events that have happened after the day. I haw read or heard
nothing about what happened at Hillsborough before the day, but surely evidence
of how the police had dealt with similar situations at the same ground is vital in
assessing how competent those who were in charge of public safety on the day of
the disaster were. The police have got away with it so far because groups and
individuals have not looked hard enough at similar events prior to to day of the
disaster. South Yorkshire police must have had information about how crowds
had been managed during previous big games at Hillsborough and they must have
had information about how the crowd was managed duringThe 1981 semi-final
when the same set of circumstances occurred at Hillsborough but on that day the
police reacted competently, opened the perimeter gates and trusted fans to sit
around the edge of the pitch. 1989 was eight years later, maybe the presents of
live TV and other events at football matches previously had hardened the
attitudes of the police. Maybe the recent miners strike had also helped to harden
South Yorkshire police’s attitude towards working class fens from around the
North. Would they have listened to the Liverpool fans earlier if the match had
not involoved Nottingham Forest, a team whose fans South Yorkshire Police felt
a certain political identity with? (This still continues to some extent today when
Wednesday play Forest). Non of these speculations are excuses we should accept
from any quarter in defence of police attitudes, it was the same stadium which
had not changed and there was no reason to believe that competent officers
should not have known how to handle potential problems competently. They
weren t competent, as a result people died, in any other situation this is at least


I encourage Hillsborough Families Support Group to get your lawyers to put
a case together which will prove that the police should have known what
might have happen to threaten public safety on 1 5/4 /89 and that they
should have known how to deal with it. In other words, to prove they were
incompetent on the day and it was NOT just an unfortunate accident due to
a set of circumstances which included other parties being negligent or
irresponsible. This evidence is as important if not more important than trying to
assess if the police lied or not. Proving lies can cloud the issue. Using facts
about events prior to 15/4/89 is less likely to be contested.

Please contact me if you need any more information about this untold part of the
Hillsborough* story.

My continuing support.


Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

        Having seen the programme on the Hillborough disaster,
recently screened on I.T.V. I have come to my own conclusion that
tne South Yorkshire Police appear to have some very serious
questions still to answer. I am concerned that there are many
issues that were not raised during the original inquest and I
 u y support your campaign for a new inquest and urge you to
continue to lobby your M.P. and the Home Secretary until positive
steps are taken to find the truth of what did actually happen on
that tragic day.
In closing I would be grateful if you would pass on my best
wishes to all the families involved and assure you that if I can
be of any assistance in the future please don't hesitate to
contact m e .




Yours Faithfully

6th December 1996

Dear Sirs.

I am writing after watching the Hillsborough programme on ITV last night. It brought
back a lot of memories for me, and helped my fiancee, who is from London and did not
know me at the time, but helped to pick up the pieces of my life afterwards.

In the aftermath of the disaster, I was taken to the Advice Centre by one of my friends
who found me lying on a train track in Ormskirk (I am from Anfield originally, but live
in Essex now via 18 years in Skem and 6 years in Hull).

I have enclosed for your attention a type of poem I wrote five or six years ago. It is only
short but to me it encapsulates my feelings whilst the disaster was actually unfolding. As
you will see, I was not actually there, but the disaster has re-shaped my life, and altered
so many of my attitudes.

I also wrote, whilst at University, a dissertation on the effect of the Taylor Report on the
stewarding and policing of football matches. I also had to write a resume of my life,
referring to appropriate theory (Freud etc.), the bulk of which revolved around the
disaster. I found that writing these articles helped me to get some way over my arief,
and, if you think it may be of worth, I am only too happy to send a copy of each for
others to read - you never know but what I went through could be a hejp to others, and I
think it is worth a go.

Please let me know if you would like me to send you further information.

Yours sincerely___________

Dear Sir/ Madam,


               lhe uecent drama-documentarY on the Hillsborough disaster I
felt compelled to check some niggling concerns of my own.

I was caught up in the disaster and was one of the first to be directed by
the Police through the open gates and the tunnel into the left pen
immediately behind the goal (pen 4 according to the police map) I enclose
testimony which I wrote down at 18:45 on the day of tte d i s S i i I n T

M ? a u i a s i o n c e “ °"Y "r i t U " 3 dlys U t e r ' 1 Sent 0,15          t° the West

On the 8th May, two police officers visited my home and recorded a formal
^  n^ ? n SK?te?e5 V i 1Ch 1 Signed- Mthough the Police officers were efficient
          ?    I   t ?Ve t0 reqU6St that part of the recorded statement be
UAa t L y       T    clear that I did not just walk through the open gate and
into the tunnel but was directed to do so by police officers on duty. I had
made this clear verbally but the recorded version omitted the reference to
directions by the police. I am not accusing the officers of a deliberate
attempt at misrepresentation; they may unconsciously have balked at writina
down evidence that reflected badly on their colleagues.

My first niggling concern is that I have no evidence that mystatementwas:
eqnsidered by the inquest or the Taylor inquiry. How can I check that my
statement was considered? Should I have received an acknowledgement? Can I
have copy of my statejnent?

I noted from the drama-documentary that some witnesses at the inquest were
unsophisticated people who may have been overawed by proceedings in court. I
was surprised not to be invited to give evidence to the Taylor inquiry. I*
realise that very many statements were made and that I had no special right
to be heard. However, I did think that I would have made a good witness.

I am a professional scientist and manager in the chemical industry. I have
the highest academic qualifications. [BA (Oxford), 1st class honours,
D.Phil]. In court, no-one could have implied that I had drunk any alcohol
before the match or misbehaved in any way whatsoever. I would have told the
inquiry how a professional person, steeped in a culture of safety from the
chemical industry, became caught up in the chaos outside the Leppings Lane
end and followed police directions into a death trap. No barrister could have
cast the least doubt on my evidence. Indeeed, I have now won two out of two
cases which I have brought to court (the most recent, a personal injury claim
for my daughter); in both cases I was cross-examined by the defence barrister
for a while until each realised that they would do better not to try to
dispute my evidence.

Basically, I am a bit frustrated that I did not get a chance to do my bit for
the innocent fans who died and concerned that maybe my statement was not even

6th December, 1996.

Dear Hillsborough Families and Survivors,

Like many people I am writing to you following the screening of the Hillsborough
docu-drama on 5th December. I feel a deep sense of grief, anger and outrage at what
occured in April 1989 - the manner in which it occured, and the shameful way in which
the survivors, and the victims' families and loved ones were treated afterwards.

I have spent many many hours watching football - mostly in the old days standing on
the terraces. I am sure like everyone who has ever attended a big match, I have
experienced a "surge" on the terraces, and a "crush" in the tunnel. It seems so
obvious now that a disaster like Hillsborough was just waiting to happen, and so I
must be one of the millions of fortunate ones because it didn't happen to me or anyone
I know and love.

What is it that happened in our country that made the police and the authorities view
spectators of our national sport as hooligans who needed to be caged. Where did the
switch happen so that what I used to call a "celebration" became an "pitch invasion".
How can they ever have thought of putting up fences with spikes on? How can they
have got it all so badly wrong?

You deserve our gratitude that it was you and yours who paid this terrible price and
possibly saved some of our lives along the way. But you also deserve justice and
compensation.

I do not know what routes remain open to you to pursue this justice. I only hope and
pray that you get it, and when you do that it affords you some peace in your lives.

Yours sincerely,
Hillsborough Disaster Working Party

Dear members of the working party,

Following the broadcast   of Jimmy McGovern's programme I feel
compelled to write with   my own experience of an F.A.Cup semi-final
at Hillsborough-  I was   supporting Wolves against Spurs in 1981
and was standing in the   opposite end of the ground to the Leppings
Lane End.

It was quite obvious to me that the Spurs fans were packed into
the Leppings Lane End. Throughout the game Spurs fans were
  imbing over the perimeter fence and watching the match from
# hind the advertising boards.  There was no attempt at a pitch
  invasion and no feeling of menace in the crowd.  It seemed a
simple reaction to an overcrowded section of the terracing.

I am wondering if any of the Spurs fans who were there on that
occasion have come forward with their experiences or if they could
be asked to do so. I am also wondering if fans of other clubs who
were allocated Leppings Lane for F.A. Cup semi-finals have had
similar experiences.

If the authorities involved in the planning of the Liverpool -
Forest match had been doing their job properly they should have
drawn on the experience of previous occasions.  It appears that as
was all too commonplace at the time the police were solely
concerned with crowd control and totally disregarded crowd safety.

I speak as one of millions who said on that day "there but for the
grace of God go I".  It was a terrible day that had been waiting
to happen because football fans had been systematically degraded
by the authorities.  The status of fans at grounds was little
better than that of animals;  to be herded,contained, forced into
pens and treated like mindless beasts.

I wish you every success in your campaign to bring justice to bear
on those responsible for the deaths of your loved ones. You speak
for every ordinary football fan in the country when you challenge
the authorities' view that it was the fans who were to blame.

It was the fans who bought tickets, paid for their own transport
and went to Hillsborough in the belief that they were going to
spend an afternoon watching a memorable game which should have
been organised and controlled to the highest standards. Those
people who were paid, and paid very well I've no doubt, to provide
the organisation and control clearly failed to do so. This
demonstrated more than incompetence but rather a criminal contempt
for the well-being and safety of ordinary football supporters.

Yours very sincerely

At    8.00      a.m.     on     Saturday,          15     April     1989,    I    had    commenced     duties     at

Hillsborough Football Ground                      for the semi        final match        between Liverpool       and

Nottingham       Forest.           I was        part    of Serial    13 under      the    command of Inspector

Bullas.       By 11.15 a.m. I had taken up my designated position in the West Stand

which was at the bottom of the steps on the stand, on the walkway in front of

row     number    one,       and     at    a    position    above     and   slightly      to   the   left   of   the

Leppings Lane entrance tunnel.

Having worked           at    this    location on numerous occasions                    in the past my initial

thoughts       were     that    the       terracing had begun to fill up extremely quickly.                        I

had   been     informed        that       the    gates    would be     opened     at    12 noon and the      first

trickle of supporters came into the stand and onto the terracing shortly after

12    noon.    Most      of    the        supporters      coming     onto   the    terracing     stayed     on   the

central       portion        leaving ample         room on the flanks.            With up to an hour before

the   start      of the match             the middle section of the terracing was considerably

full,    however I would not consider anything wrong with this or be in any way

unusual.       The crowd was quite noisy but generally in a good mood. With fifteen

minutes before the start of the game the central area had become quite compact

but yet again there was still large areas unused on the flanks.                                      By this time

I had been standing with Inspector Bullas for quite some time.

I had been approached by members of the Liverpool crowd who had told me on two

separate       occasions       that       there was a build up of people at the Leppings Lane

entrance and that              the turnstile operators were                 taking ten pounds in the hand

for   people      who    had       arrived without          tickets.        On one      occasion I had seen a

supporter who was in the stand who I had seen earlier in the terracing and had

gained entrance             to the stand by climbing up the barrier wall.                                     He was    taken

out of the stand and placed back in the terracing where he took up position at

the front.          He was not drunk but had obviously been drinking.

At approximately 2.55pm from my position looking onto the terracing I sensed

and could see an increased agitation in the crowd.                                       The supporters were being

increasingly          crushed       and       were       compact    right      to    the      front.     At    this     point

Inspector          Bullas    left    to       go    to    the   back    of    the    terraces        and see     what       the

problem was.          At    this point         the gates         on the       track were         not open but people

were attempting to climb the perimeter fence and also trying to climb the wall

in front of me to the West Stand.                          My initial reaction was to prevent this but

as I looked          down towards         the entrance             tunnel     I could see a large number of

fans pouring in from the back.                           By this time I could see the body of a person

being passed overhead towards the front of the crowd and I was being inundated

with cries from distressed people in the terracing and in the stand appealing

for me       to help them.           At this point I radioed to control saying that a large

number of people were down and injured.                                I heard over the air that the match

had been       delayed and very               shortly after           that    the    players emerged.                Lots       of

people were climbing and being assisted in to the West Stand and I assisted in

this.        I took hold of one man that was particularly seriously injured around

the    pelvic       region,    together            with    another      supporter        we     took    him    out    of    the

stand to the reception area at the back of the Leppings Lane entrances.                                                 After

leaving       the    injured    man       I    immediately         returned         to    the    stand    and    found          it

impossible          to make    my    way       to    the     front.      As    I    tried       to   force     past    I was

receiving lots of threats                  to my person and being called a murderer.                                  Because

of this I thought it prudent to stay at the back of the stand in the bar area.

In the bar area at the back of the stand I saw two injured people being tended

by Police       Officers.           After      consultation with              these      I went        to the reception

area    in    an    attempt     to    seek medical              help.        This   was    not       forthcoming,          so    I

returned to the bar area and with PC 1423 Newbould carried an injured woman to
                                           - 3 -

the reception area.

whilst in the bar area we received several calls                          of 'murderers'.

The first trip to the reception area I saw three                          bodies laid        outwith blankets

over    them   and    two       other   people       were    obviously    badly     injured who      had   blue

coloured faces and were being artificially resusitated by ambulance crew and

police officers.           I returned to the bar area for a third time and assisted PC

928 Parkin in carrying a third injured person to the rear.

At this     point a call went out that a man was going berserk in the West Stand.

I    went   back up        the    steps   to    be    met    in   the    bar   area   by   four     men.   They

confronted me shouting in a hysterical manner at me calling me a murderer and

saying that I was to blame for the incident.                        Their manner was such that I was

beginning to fear for my safety, but it had so maddened me that I shouted back

at the men telling them to make themselves useful and to stop hanging around.

This seemed to work and they left to go down the                          stairs.

Once in the stand again with Inspector Grace and                          part of his        serialwewent to

a young man by            the    stairway who was           in a very    distressed,       irate,    emotional

mood, by the look on his face he was no longer in control of himself and from

what people around him later said he had been lashing out and hitting everyone

and anyone     in sight.           He was eventually convinced he should leave the ground

and was escorted out by his friends.

At    this point      I    could    see   the    mayhem      on   the   pitch,    people around       me   were

showing     mixed          emotions, some            crying openly and others shouting                and abusing t

police or stewards or anyone in authority. I stayed in and around the back of

the West Stand until              it cleared and returned to the de-briefing point in the

North Stand.         Although I was aware that in the region of ten people had died,

I heard of countless              numbers of bodies being taken across                  the pitch and did

not learn of the true severity until later.

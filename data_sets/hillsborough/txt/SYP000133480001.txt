               Sheffield                via       the    M6,      M62        motorways.               We    were       held    up    on    a       few

               occasions                on    the       motorway             because        of    road          works    and    the       sheer          volume

               of     traffic,                This       put       us    back       by a b o u t       an       hour    on    the    journey             and   we
arrived          in S h e f f i e l d            outside          the       ground       at    about          2.40pm,

We    drove       past           the       ground          along       Leppings          Lane       and       went        to    find          a

parking          space.               The       crowds          outside          the    ground          were       normal           for    a       match

of    this       kind.

We    parked        the          car       on    a    small       car       park       past    where          t he      Liverpool                 Coaches

were       parked,           about          10       to    15 m i n u t e s       walk       from       the    ground.               We       then

walked       back        to          the    ground          some       of    the       others       went       ahead           of    us       because

it    was    near        to          kick-off             time.        This       left       just       myself          and     _______________

walking          together.                  We       had    tickets          for       the    North       Stand.               My    sons          and

three       of    the        others             had       tickets       for       the    W Stand          and        my      nephew        had          a

ticket       for        the          terraces.              There       were          plenty       of    Police           between             our

parking          position              and       the       ground.           They       were       at    road        junctions             on

either       side        of          the    road          and    were       stopping          traffic          from          going        into          the

side       roads,         ______ a n d           myself           arrived          outside          the       turnstiles             at       3,5pm,

There       was     a    line          of       Police          across       the       turnstiles             area        and       just          the       odd

fan    going        into             the    ground.              One    of t h e       Policeman             said       to     us    have           you

got    tickets,              I said,             ’Y e s     -    for    the       North       Stand’            He      directed              us to             a

blue       swing        type          gate       at       the    end    of of         the    row    of       turnstiles,                  A

Policewoman              and          a Policeman                by    the gate         opened          it    and       let     us    through,

closing          it a g a i n          behind             us.     We    saw       a    tunnel       ahead          of     us    and       walked

towards          it.         I       looked          through          the    tunnel          and    realised              that       we    were

behind       the        goal,              I would          see       that       the    players          were        on      the     pitch.                 I

could       also        see          people          standing          on    the       perimeter          of       the       pitch        between

the    goals        and          the       fencing          at    the       front       of    the       terraces.               We    only          had             a

quick       glance           and       I thought                that    the       game       had    been       stopped              because

people       had        gone          onto       the       pitch.           We    then       cams       back.,       through          a       gap       in

the    wall       between              the       rear       of    the       West       Stand       and       the     turnstiles.                    We

realised          that           we    were          in    the    wrong          section       to       get    to       the     North             Stand

so    we    went        to       a    stewards             hut    in    the       corner.           A    steward             came     out          and

after       we    explained                 to       him    that       we    had       tickets          for    the        North       Stand             he
opened       a    little             gate       and    let       us       go    through.                 At    this       stage             1 still             had

my    ticket          in    fact          and    had       not       produced             it    at       all       to    anybody,.                We    then

found       our       way       into       the    North          Stand          quite          easily          arid f o u n d           our       seats.

The    time       then          was       about       3 * 10pm        and       I    could          see       that       the    players                had

all    gone       off       the       pitch.           I could             see       lots       of       people          and    police             on       the

pitch       and       still          thought          that       their          had       probably             just       been          a    bit       of

crushing          and       that          the    people          had       been       brought             onto          the    pitch          to

releive          it.        The       central          area          of    the       terraces             did       look       extremely

crowded.              I could             see    people          at       the       back       of    the       pens       climbing                over          the

side       fencing          and       others          being          lifted          into       the       stands          above             them..

We    c o u l d n ’t       see       the    front          of    the       pens       because             there          were       a       lot    of

Police       and       fans          on    the    pitch          infront             of    the       fencing             which          obstructed

our    view.           I    could          see    however             that          some       fans       were          climbing             the       front

fencing          to    get       onto       the       pitch.              At    the       far       side       of       the    goal          area       from

where       we    were          I saw* a         couple          of       Police          helping             fans       out    of          the    pens

but    the       Police          on       our    side       of       the       goals       were          just       standing                there,              I

thought          that       the       Police          were       just          trying          to    regain             order       and       that          the

game       would       be       re-started,                 I saw          a    lad       lying          in    the       goal       mouth          who

appeared          to       be    hurt.           He    was       folding             his       arms       to       his    body          and       rolling

around       as       though          he    had       been       crushed.                 Over       the       next       10 m i n u t e s             more

and    more       people             came       onto       the       pitch       and       were          lying          down    on          the    pitch.

At    about       3,20          pm    I saw       an       ambulance                come       onto       the       pitch       from          the       far

corner       of       the       ground          between          the       North          Stand          and       the    Spion             Hop    and          go

over       towards          the       Leppings             Lane       end.           At    about          the       same       time          I saw          a

lad    lying          on    the       pitch       on       our       side       of    the       goalmouth                and    I saw             someone

put    a    coat       over          his    face.           This          was       when       I first             realised             that       there

were       fatalities.                    Someone          came       into          the    North          Stand          and    I heard                him

say     "T'neres           people          dead       in    there",                 I said          to    him       "How       do       you       know!"            He

replied          “ I ’ve        just       come       out       of    there".              It       was       clear       to    me          that       he

meant       that       he       had       been    in       the       pens       at    the       back          of    the       goals          at    the
                                                                                                                                                     PAGE               4


Lappings          Lane          end        of    the       ground-.             At    about          the    time       that          the    Ambulance

came    onto          the       pitch           I saw       that       people             were       being       carried             on w ha t

appeared          to       be       stretchers              across          the       pitch          towards          the       same       point              of

the    ground          from          where           the    ambulance                had       come,        I then          thought              about             my

nepheM,'               L        I knew           that       he    had       gone          into       the    terraces             at       Leppings

Lane    end       and       so       I decided              to    go       and       find       the       Police       Incident             Room              to

see    if _______p a d               been        involved.                 I went          down,          out    of    the       stand

and    saw    a       policeman                 in    the    passageway                   which       runs       along          the       back        of       the

stand.        He       directed                 me    along       the       back          of    the       stand       to    where          the

Incident          Room          was        located-              I walked             to       the    end       of    the       sta        arid t u r n e d

left    and       immediately                    saw       the    body          of    a    young          man    lying          on    the        floor

with    his       face          covered              with    a    coat,              I then          saw    further             on,       t,wo       rows

of    about       4    or       5    bodys,           and    with          there          heads       covered          and       quite           a    lot

of    injured          people.                  There       were       fans          attending             to    the       injured          giving

the    "kiss          of    life*           and       chest       massage             etc.           There       were       about          four           or

five    p o 1 i ce         officers              s t a n d i ng       in    a    group          do i ng     n o t h i ng        to    help*               I

looked       at       one       of    the        bodies          who       was       about          the    same       build          as                   and

uncovered             his       face        to       see    if    it       was       h i m.         Thankfully             it    was       not

I then       walked             along           the    lines          of    injured             people          to    see       if                   was       one

of    them    but          he       was     not       there,           I thought                that       I ought          to       do    something

to    help    because                some        were       moaning             and       were       not    getting             attended              to,.          I

went    over          to    a       policeman              and    asked          him       to       get    some       medical             help.               He

said    that          he    had        no       radio       and       I told          him       that       he    had       better          find

someone       who          had       then.            One    of       them       then          walked       away       presumably                    to       try

and    get    help.                 More        injured          people          were          being       carried          in,       some           on

makeshift             stretchers                 made       from       broken             down       advertising                boards           and          some

just    being          supported                 under       their          arms.              As    they       came       in    they       saw           the

dead    bodies             on       t he    floor          and    this          made       them       just       break          down       and

collapse          on       the       floor.            I then          said          to    a Policeman                "Can't          you        get

these      bodies           out        of       here."           He    said          that       there       was       nowhere             else        to       put

them-           One       of    the     injured             that      had        just       came          in    collapsed             on    the       floor

and    I went             to    him     and       helped          him       to    the       side          and       sat    him       up    by

the    wall.              He    was    asking              for    a   drink           of    water.              1 was          trying       to

comfort             and       reassure        h i m.         One      of     his       friends             asked          a Policeman               .if he

could       have          a    drink       for     the       lad      but        he    just       said          "wet       his       l i p s , 1'

He    then          walked          away     I then          went       to       a Police             van       to    see       if     I could         get

a    drink          for       the    lad     but       before          I got          there       I saw             another          young       lad

about       16 y r s           old    who      was unat ten ded.                      He    was       sitting             on    the        floor       and

just       shaking             I asked         him "Are           you       alright"              He       w o u l d n ’t       reply        ~ he      was

crying          and       in a       bad     state          of    shock.              I thought                I M/ould         try       and    get

a    blanket          to       cover       him     up.           I again          looked          towards             the       Police          van    and

saw    a    Policeman                get- o u t        of    it.        He       was       in    shirt          sleeves          and       was

wearing             leather          boots        and       breeches.                 I thought                that       he    must       have       been

a    mounted          Police          Officer,               The      Policeman                 walked          to    a    tea-van          and

poured          a    cup       of    tea     f r o m it.          I felt          very          angry          that       he    was        doing       this

when       so       many       injured         people            were       unattended,                    1 walked             over        to

him    and          knocked          the     cup       from       his       hand       and       said          " C a n ’t y o u       see       that

people          here          are    dying        and       want      your        help,"              He       sai d,      " I ’v e       pulled       more

people          out       of    situations,"                     At   the        same       time          he    grabbed          me       round       the

throat          with          his    right        hand       and       pushed          me       backwards,                 I went          back       onto

the    tea-urn                and    got     scolded             by   hot        water          down       the       back       of    my    legs.

Three       or       four       other        policemen                intervened                and       restrained             him.           Another

one    took          hold       of    me     and       I said         " H e ’s h a v i n g            a    cup       of    tea       while       people

are    dying,"                 He    said     OK       -    Just      go     away,"              I walked             back, a n d          attended

to    another             lad. w h o       was     sitting            crying           by       just       trying          to    reassure

him.        Someone             in    plain        clothes,             a    greysuit             came          with       a walkie-talkie.

He    said          that       he    was     a Police             Officer.                 I said          "Can       you       get       medical

help       for       this       lad    -     he    c a n ’t, f e e l         his       legs       and          is    very       distressed,"

The    Officer                spoke     to    the          lad    and       also       tried          to       reassure          him,           I then

walked          away          and    spoke        to       another          group          of    uniformed                Police          Officers;
                                                                                                                                                PAGE


        the    same          ones       I had          initially             spoken          to    about       moving       the    bodies.            1

        again       asked          if    the          bodies          could       be    moved       because       of    the       effect        they

        were       having          on    the          young          injured       fans       being       brought       in.        One       said     that

        they       were       using          the       Gymnasium.                 I then          assisted       other       fans       in    carrying

        the    dead          bodies          on       the       boards       over       to    the       entrance       to    the       Gym    which

        was    only          about.      4    or       5    yards       away.           I d i d n ’t s e e       any    of       the    Police

        helping          at       all,        I took             about       4    bodies          over    to    the    Gym       and    the     Place

        was    then          clear       of       dead          bodies.           More       Police       were    arriving             and    also        a

        couple          of    first          aid       people.              The    Police          cordoned       off       the    area       to

        prevent          other          people             coming       in a n d        all       the    injured       were       being       attended

        to.        There          appeared             to       be    some       sort    of       order    being       restored          to     the

        situation             and       I then             decided          to    go    back       to    the    Stand       to    see    if                   ]

        was    still          there.                  W h e n I got t her e             he    had       already       left,        I also          then

        made       my    way       out       of       the        stand and         left       the       ground    into       Leppings           Lane          at

        about       3.40pm.              Iw a l k e d           back        to    the    car      and     when    I. g o t       there       saw    that.

        my    sons       and       my    nephew                        and               were       already       there.           None       of    them

        had    been          hurt       at    all,

        1    did    not       need       any          treatment             for    my    legs       when       I had    been       scolded.

        They       were       red       for       a    day       or    two       thats       all.        I d o n ’t

        blame       the       officer             as       it    was    a    very       stressful          situation             and    different

        people          reacted          in       different             ways.

        I    feel       that       the       Police             action       at    the       incident          room    was       totally

        disorgani.sed»                   There             appeared          to    be    no       type    of    disaster          plan       of a c t i o n

        at    all.           Medical          facilities                were       non-existent.                 This       in m y      view

        resulted             in    there          being          more       fatalities

        than       there          would       have          been       with       better          organisation          and       proper        medical

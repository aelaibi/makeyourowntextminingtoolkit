    people        to    their        respective               se a t s ,      and     I have          no    criticism            of   their

    enquiries           with        other        officers           on     the      serial           and    discovered            they        had

    already         taken a meal.                     At    approximately                  2.35pm          (1425)     that        date        I

front    of me.           They       climbed          over       th e    perimeter              wall,       jumped          o n to       the

track    and    began          to    run    towards             the L e p p i n g s        Lane       terraces.              A

Liverpool       spectator             jumped              onto    the t r a c k ,     after          the        two     officers          ha d

left    and    began       shouting             "I        want    his n u m b e r " .           He   said         that      one     of the

officers       had      strcuk        him.           I did       not     se e    either          of       the     officers          strike

anyone    whilst          jumping          down           onto    th e tr a c k ,      I persauded                 th e     man     to get

back    into    the       N o r t h Stand,                and    grudgingly,               he    d i d so.



I again       looked       towards          the           Leppings Lane             terraces,             where         I   sa w

several       hundred          spectators             were       now     on     the     perimeter               track,       and

playing       area.        There          were       numerous           Police        Officers             at     the       front        of

the    terraces,          but       the    crowd was             such     that        I could             not     see       what     was

happening.           There          were    still          people        climbing           over          the     perimeter

fence,    and       I saw       that       now P o l i c e         Officers           were       assisting              them       to

climb    over.          People        were       climbing           from        the     rear         of    the     central          pen,

into    the    West       Stand,          and were          being        assisted           by       people        already          in

the West       Stand.



The    crowd    in the          North       Stand were              becoming            increasingly                  more

aggresive,          shouting          abuse          at    myself        and     other          officers           on       the

perimeter       track          and    shortly after                 this        we w e r e       reinforced                 by

approximately             SO    other       officers.               This        antagonised                th e    supporters

     even more             and    they       were        becoming             more       and more           aggressive.




     When      I again           looked        towards            the      Leppings            Lane        terrace,          I saw        that

     some      of     the       crowd were              almost        to      the       half     way       line       on    th e    pitch.

     The      players           and     officials            had      by      this       time     left          the    playing        area,

     and      there        were        now approximately                      100 - 2 0 0 P o l i c e             Officers           on the

     playing          area,        th e m a j o r i t y          of P o l i c e         officers           being       o c c u p i e d at        the

     Leppings          Lane        tej^races.               By    this        time       I saw        that       several           people        who

     were      obviouslyyinjured were                             birtg a s s i s t e d          by    spectators             and Police

     Officers,             tof t h e     perimeter               tr a c k .        It    very     soon          became       obvious         to me

 (J t h a t    somelfmng               was    s er io uls y wrong,                  this       opinion was                 reinforced            when

     I saw        cufople        being        carried across                   the       pi t c h ,    on       stretchers           and

     Ibrokgm b i l l b o a r d s .             They were              being          carried           towards         th e      Spion Hop            en d

     At     t hi s    point        I left          my    position and went                       towards          the       Leppings         Lane

     terrraces.                 I was        joined         by s e v e r a l        spectators              who       were     carrying an

     empty        billboard.                 I went         with      them         to    the     perimeter             track        in f r o n t       of

     the      Leppings           Lane        terraces,            just        to    the     rear       of       the    goa l .       The     scene

     was      absolutly            chaotic.              The      perimeter              fence        of    the       cental        pen

     adjacent          to       th e    emergency            gate       had        the    mesh        of    the       fence        pulled        out

     from      the     bottom,           a nd was           curled         upwards          and       outwards             towards        th e       top

     of     the      fence.T h er e          were       a    large         number         of P o l i c e        Officers            assisting

     people          out    of         the    central            pen,      b oth over            the    top       of    the        fence and

     from      the     emergency              g a te.        I could           see       what     appeared             to    be a

     substantial                number        of    people          lying          at    the     bottom          of    the     terrace           steps

     who      were     not       moving,           I remember              having         th e    impression                that     they were

     just      a tangle            of a r m s       and      legs.            We    took       th e    hoarding             boards        just        to

faces     of     these      people.              I checked         th e      first        3 or A- of             these          people

and     saw    that     they were               obviously        dead,           with     faces         d i s c o l o u r e d as           if

they     had     been a sp hy xia te d.                 Slightly            to     th e    r i g ht     of t h e s e           bodies,          I

saw a man           lying      face       down,        on th e     grass           he a p p e a r e d       to       be    in the

recovery         position.               r examined           him,      and        found      that         he    was       breathing,

his     eyes     were     open,          but     I was      unable          to     ge t   any      further            response             from

h im.      Together         with         several        other      supporters,                he w a s          carefully             lifted

onto     the     billboard           and        then    taken      to       th e    Spion Hop              end       of    the

ground.          There      he w a s       carefully             placed          on to      t he      grass          and       I placed

him     in th e      recovery            position.            I again            checked          him a n d          found          that    he

was     still       breathing            but     I was      unable          to     get    any      futher            response.              I

remained with             the       man    for     seveal         minutes           until         I was         approached                by a

man     in his       early       thirties          who      stated          he w a s a d o c t o r .                 He    made a

danger        and    that      he w o u l d       take      charge          of     him.




I then        returned         to    the L e p p i n g s         Lane       end      of    th e    ground            where          I saw a

Police        Officer       who      I do        not    know.          He    was        attempting              to    lift a y o u n g

man,     in h i s      early        twenties,           who      appeared            to    have a          leg       i njury a n d was

having        difficulty            walking.            I assisted               th e     officers          to       the       lift       the

ground,        where      we     sat      him     down      dn    the       perimeter             track.             There          were a

number        of a m b u l a n c e m e n ,       a n d St     John's         ambulance             men,         who       at    that       time

were,      occupied         with         th e    injured         persons.               Having        ascertained                   he w a s

not     in a n y     danger         I returned           towards            the     Leppings            Lane         end       of    the

ground.




When     I reached          the      half        way    line,      I saw           that      there         were       a    line       of

Police        Officers         extended across                   the    entire            width       of    the       pitch.              I was

told     b^Jhnspe^                               to    join        th e    line      of     officers           and    took     up a

position         near     to     the       South Stand and                    players        tunnel.            Up    until     this

time     I had     no t    seen any              senior           officers          either        on th e       pitch       of at      the

Leppings         Lane     end.



Whilst      at     this     location,             I saw           numerous          Liverpool           supporters           who      were

in a n      extremely           distressed             state.             some      were     so d r u n k       they     could        only

walk     with assistance.                     Most       of       the     supporters             were    shouting           a b u s e at

us,    which       under        the    circumstances                    was    understandable.




On    several       occasions,              we    had        to    intervene,              when    some        Nottingham

Forest       supporters           swated          in th e          South       Stand,        shouted           at    the L iv er p oo l

supporters          to    leave        th e      pitch.            The     Liverpool             supportes           were

responding          by    threatening                 th e    Nottingham Forest                    supporters            and

attempting          to    get     i n to      th e S o u t h           Stand.




I r e m a i n e d at      this        location           for       a    considerable              length        of    time     and

eventaully an announcement                             was        made     over      th e    public ad dre ss               system      to

the    effect       that        the    match          had     been        cancelled and             the        ground       should      be

evacuated          as    s oo n as         possible.




Due    to    the    circumstances,                    it w a s         some    time        before       th e    ground       cleared

and    I was       involved           in    clearing              people       from        the    pitch,        during       t h is

time     I found         tw o    or    three          members           of m y      serial,        whom        I had     not    seen

since       just    before        th e      incident.



When     the     ground         had    been       completely               cleared          of    supporters           we w e r e

instructed          to    standby           in the N o r t h              Stand      for a d e - b r i e f i n g .           Prior      to

going       to   th e    North        Stand,          I attended              at    th e    gymnasium,              where     I spoke

to P o l i c e     Constable           Buckley.               I asked          if    I could assist,                  but    was      told

 that    he w a s          unable          to a l l o w    anyone           into       the    gymnasium.             I then

 returned            to    the    North        Stand       where        I waited             with     other       officers.

Suring this                time       we    were     addressed              by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t      G r e e n w o od.     Also

whilst          at    this       location           I saw Chi ef             Superintendet              Nesbitt          and Chief

Superintendent                   Mol   r>-     It    was       particularly              reassuring             to   see    Mr Mole/,

who     had been my Divisional                            Commander            fora          Humber     of y e a r s ,      and had

only     transferred                  to B D i v i s i o n a p p r o x i m a t e l y            one w e e k      prior      to      the FA

Cup Semi             Final.




At a p p r o x i m a t e l y       5.30pm           (1730)       al l       officers          who     were      in th e N o r t h

Stand were                instructed           to    stand       down.           I then        took     no    futher        part      in

th e    incident.




I have          been a Poli ce               Officer           for    eight       a n d a half          years.          During        that

time     I have           attended           the     vast       majority           of    home       fixtures         of S h e f f i e l d

Wednesday.                During           this     period       I have         w o r k e d at       various         locations

within       the      ground,           and       have     a    good working              knowledge           pf     the    layout         of

the     ground,           and     the      various         duties        worked          both       inside       and    outside        the

ground.




For    the      past       three        and a half              years        I have       been a C om m u n i t y Constable

Football         Stadium.               MY    duties           for    all     that       period       has     been     on S e r i a l

locations            around       the        perimeter           track,         but     for     the    p a st     three     seasons

I have       been a l l o c a t e d           the    same        position          on     the    perimeter           track       in

front      of    th e      North        Stand,       at a        point       midway along              th e     length      of      the

Semi-Finals              he ld at         th e    ground.               These      have         normally          been without

serious         incidents            and       have      been well               policed.          On       the     last S em i - F i n a l

.-,which . i n v o l v e d . L i v e r p o o l        supporters             I noticed            that as           on    this

occasion,           a    large       percentage               of    the      crowd,         in the N o r t h             Stand,        were

obviously           under          the    influence            of       intoxicants,              w h i c h was          reflected        in

their       aggresive              behaviour           generally,                which     became worse                  when

decisions           on       the    field        of    play went            against             Liverpool.               Following        the

Semi-Final              in    1988 wh en          th e      ground         had     been         cleared,          there        wa s

 considerable                damage       to     be    seen        to     th e    seats         in the N o r t h          Stand.         In

addition          there        were       numerous            discarded            beer         cans    and       bottles         of

 spirits        found         beneath          seats        which         had     been      vacated          by L i v e r p o o l

 supporters.




 Following          th e      incident,           when        I was        assisting             injured          fa ns,       the

 attempts         of a l l         who    were        present           on t h e     pitch were              very much            hampered

 by m e m b e r s       of    the    press        who       were        present          taking        photographs              and

 making       video          recordings.



Following           th e      briefing           I did        not       either       before         or a f t e r         the    incident

 se e   Chief       Superintendent                    Duckenfield.                 His      presence          would         have       been

 re-assuring             to    the       officers           dealing          with        th e    incident.               In a d d i t i o n

 the    absence          of    any       senior        officers            at     t he    scene        of    th e    incident

 initially          obviously             made        the     situation            more         difficult           for     officers          <

 situation.




My      personal         experience              of    th e    radio         transmission,                  was     that       messages

 that     were      being          passed,        during           th e    incident             were    virtually

 unreadable,             because          of     the     crowd          noise      and      because          of     the

 distortionof                the    actual        transmissions.

            My    initial         reaction      following       th e   events     were    of    shock    and      horrer

             that     such an        incident       could occur.          I have       always    been    of      th e   opinion

             that     th e    policing       arrangements        at    Hillsborough were            of   the      b e s t of

            any     ground within South                Yorkshire,        having    worked       at all     of     the

             grounds         at   some   time.




             In m y    opinion        having      witnessed,       the    behaviour       of L i v e r p o o l    f an s    on

             this     and     other      occasions,         I beieve     that    the    consumption        kof

             intoxicants           by s p e c t a t o r s   attending     the    match must       be     considered          to

             be a m a j o r       factor     when     investigating        the    cause    of    the     disaster.




             I submit         this    report      for y o u r   information.

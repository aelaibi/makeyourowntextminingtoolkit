OTHER VARIATIONS
Police Officers . Public Holidays and Football Overtime i:7?3,900
The provision to be made for Public Holiday working by Police officers
is subject to substantial change from year to year dependent, firstly,
on the incidence of taster and secondly on the actual Public Holiday
days at Christmas and New Year. All officers of the federated ranks
are^ entitled to payment at double-time for duty worked on public
holidays. Where 26 December and/or 1 January fall on a Saturday or a
Sunday, these days also are regarded as public holidays for pay
purposes. Although the latter consideration does not apply in 1990/91,
both taster 1990 (13/15 April) and taster 1991 (29/31 March) fall to be
charged in the 1990/91 accounts. Easter 1989 fell within the 1988/89
financial year: thus there are 6 public holidays in 1989/90 and ten in
1 9 9 0/ 91.   The a d d i t i o n a l requirement, excluding inflation, is
£347,200.
Consequent upon the recommendation of Lord Justice Taylor in his
Interim Report on the Hillsborough Disaster, manning levels at football
m a t c h e s have been considerably increased.     The required budget
provision shows an increase of £376,700 before inflation but including
National Insurance, which represents about SO?-, of the 1989/90 base
figure.
Police Off icer - Cessation of Recruitment. Dec 89 to-March 90 £.509.800
EredTt                                                              ’- -
The effect of thc_ cessation of recruitment, recently imposed, is
expected to result in the actual strength of the Force at 31 March 1990
being 68 below authorised and target strengths. This is the 1990/91
saving which would result if recruitment t.o these posts were to take
place evenly throughout 1990/91.
Police Officers and Civilians - Annual Pay Increments £734,200
This is the calculated cost, including National Insurance and Pensions
of all annual pay increments.
M i c e Officers and Civilians - Other Variations in Pay end Allowances
1273,600 Credit                                                  *- - - -
This item takes account of all other staffing' variations and of
variations in allowances of all kinds. It includes the ongoing effect
of the restriction of the recruitment of civilian staff durinq the
latter part of 1989/90.
Police Pensions 1 Increase in Number of Retirements £1,337,300
Current year's experience and an analysis of the potential for future
retirement points to the need for increased provision which, in the
main, is made up of the following:-
                                                  Increase on 1989/90

Premises - Reassessment of Energy Costs, etc £114,200 Credit
Provisions for gas, electricity and solid fuel, etc., have been based
upon costs and consumptions in the previous two years. The figures
thus represent likely costs on the assumption of a not-too-harsh winter
and also take account of recent energy cost saving measures.
Transport -Maintenance and Running of Ageing F leet     £ 1IS,100
Thisi represents art    increase of 8.8S on the 1989/89 base budget
provision of £1,351,400 for the maintenance and running costs of the
vehicle fleet, including insurance repairs and insurance premiums. In
addition to anticipated increased maintenance costs, it provides fo r a
5% increase in petrol costs - substantially accounted for by higher
consumption - and an increase of £32,700 in insurance costs.
Computer Services - Doncaster MBC £87,300 Credit.
The: figure included in the Budget is that notified by Doncaster
Computer Services of their assessment of the costs of operating police
systems.
Agency - Greater Manchester Enquiry £120,000
The Authority has been informed previously of an enquiry currently
being undertaken by the Greater Manchester Police, the costs of which
will initially be met by South Yorkshire but may be partly rechargeable
to other Forces. The estimated cost 1s £240,000, to be met equally in
each of the financial years 1989/90 and 1990/91.
Agency - South Yorkshire Joint Secretariat £153,000
Based upon the South Yorkshire Joint Secretariat Budget for 1990/91 and
the allocation of that Budget over the various Joint Authorities and
Services.
Agency - Crime Squad Development £40,400
The approved budget for the Regional Crime Squad for 1990/91 includes
approved Developments in respect of wireless equipment, payments of
i n f o r m e r s , a n d "Crimestoppers". this sum represents the South
Yorkshire share of the cost of these developments.

1    The attached tables attempt to forecast the likely trend in budget levels
      for 1991/92 and 1992/93. The figures are not intended to be precise
      estimates; rather they represent an indication of the likely factors
      which will influence the overall size of the Police budget after 1990/91.
2    Although a figure is put against each item, in most cases the estimate
      isalso expressed as a range. The extent of the range is an indication of
      the margin of variability which applies to each item either because of its
      nature, or simply because the forecast is being made so far in advance.
3    In two cases - Hillsborough costs and non grant aided capital - it is
      impossible to put figures to the possible cost in 1991/92 onward.

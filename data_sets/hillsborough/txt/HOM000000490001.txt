              there       appeared            to be    lots      of    r o o m on       the. ’w i n g t e r r a c e s ’ of           Leppings

              Lane.            I think        I recall       seeing       spaces           in b o t h     the L e p p i n g s    Lane       and

              North       Stands.

              The       game     commenced        on    time      and     shortly           after       I noticed         that

              supporters            at   the     Leppings        Lane were            what        I thought         to be       spilling

              onto       the     track    at     the    back      of    the     goal.           Peter      Bea       ley h a d       just    hit

                                                                                                                              R2 0 8

 the    bar      and    I thought            that     it w a s      j ust    a surge          forward         of      supporters.

 I then         saw    Superintendent                Greenwood         run       onto      the p i t c h      and      speak       to

 the    referee         and     it w a s       when    this       happened         that       I began         to      think       that

 it w a s       more     than      an    overspill.            Normal        policy          is    that     if     the    referee

 needs      to be       contacted           a message          is     relayed        to me         through         police

 control         and    I in       turn would          contact         the       linesman          nearest         to me      to

 attract         the    r e f e r e e ’s a t t e n t i o n .

At     this      point       the    referee          brought        the     players          off but       he w i t h        his

 linesmen         stayed        w i t h me      at    the    bottom         of    the      tunnel.          In     the    n ext        few

 moments         all. he 11        s e e m e d .to b r e a k      loose.          Hundreds          of. L i v e r p o o l - . v

 obviously            been    dr i n k i n g .                                    : ■ .•       .

 I t o l d the ref e r e e M r . L e w i s to go to h i s d r e s s i n g r o o m a n d that I

 would      give       him    any news          as    I got       it a n d       this      he did.          I was        then      :

 point      which       I did.           There       Chief     Superintendent                 Duckenfield              explained

 to    them     the     seriousness             of    the    situation            but      that he- c o u l d n o t make-                        :

was    engaged          in k e e p i n g       them or der ly          etc.        Many       of    the    supporters              were

shouting          obscenities.                 At    one    point      BBC       TV were       going       to do an

interview with                Graham Kelly             in    the     tunnel        but       abandoned           it b e c a u s e      of

the    unruly          behaviour          of    the    L i v e r p o ol     supporters             near    the        tunnel.

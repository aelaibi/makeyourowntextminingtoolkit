                                                    A d d r ess:


       X arrived at the approach to the Leppin^s Hoad end of the Hillsborough
       Stadium at Ik. 2$ hours.     I was accompanied by sy                       "]aon and
       a young ujaa            Ve all had a valid ground ticket.               She icsediate
       approach to the turnstiles, a distance of some 10 yards, vas full of
       a jostling crowd of ticket holders trying to snake their way to the
       turnstiles.      There was no sentience of orderly cueues, with some kind
       of order trying to "be maintained by three mounted police officers.
       Despite the lack of organisation and frustration the cooc of the fans
       remained reasonably co-operative.       To emphasise this, one of the horses
       was ren' dose to se and accidentally almost knocked my spectacles off.
       The officer apologised and we exchanged smiles and x s wro^ed the norse s
       nose.

       The nearer one got *c the actual turnstiles the pusnxn^ and crushxn&
       became severe.      After approximately ten minutes all three of us were
       literally catapulted through the turnstiles.           Over the last ten yards
       one had no control whatsoever over our movements.


        Once through the turnstile all three of my party came together.                Vy son
        attempted to remmstrate with a police officer regarding the lack of
        organisation on the approach to the turnstile.             se vas warned by a
        steward standing alongside the officer to keep Quiet because other fans
        who had made similar protests had been forcibly ejected from the ground.


        We then moved away and v/ent to use the toilet siuuawed in fxonu             oj. us

   O    under the stand.      As we came out of the toilet ve were directly facing
        the rear of the turnstile area and were immediately avare of the
        opening of one of the gates alongside the turnstiles.                  The time was now
        just after 1U.U0 hours.      Anticipating the ensuing rush I took my
        cospanions to the right, aiming to take our place high up on the terracing
        to the left of the Lepping Hoad Stand facing the; playing area.                The
        previous year's experience had alerted me that this -was a sensible area
         to stand, both from a safety viewpoint and it also provided an excellent
         view.        I have a vivid mental picture, as we hurried past the now
         infamous tunnel leading to the ill-fated sections, of turning my head
         and noticing there was nobody to be seen, either spectator or official.

         The high tip area we entered was very fall*               no crash.    We

         positioned ourselves within feet of the blue boards.          Looking down from

         mr h i ^ vantage soot X could see the two middle.sens immediately behind

         the goal were jammed to capacity with a seething sass of people.        To my

         surprise, the pens on the left and right were half empty.          The area on

         the far right around the electronic scoreboard was also half empty.

         The time of this observation was 14.50 hrs.



         Tty attention then became diverted when the Liverpool team took to the

          field, followed a couple of minutes later by "he opposition.         At tne saae
   r'N
          time I was conscious of a few peoole entering our section benind ana

          alongside ms.      There was no larsre influx just before the kick-off vnere

          X was standing?.


          The esae had beer. ir. prepress for some five minutes with Liverpool pressing

          home an attack at the far end, with a comer followed by a shot which hit

          the woodwork.      T believe this shot to be significant because it meant

          a tremendous sure* down the pens behind the Liverpool soa! to try and see

          what was hapoening.     This is the rsornal reaction on the terracing at any

           football match.        Prcm my vantage point I was then immediately aware

           of fans trying to come over the metal fence behind the goal.         Some had

          been successful and were being led down the touchline by the police. Others

           were being stopped climbing out of the pens despite their obvious protests.

           At the same time a senior police officer ran from behind the Liverpool goal

           and approached, the referee.    He immediately stopped the game talcing both

           teams off the pitch.        By this time a few more fans had managed to

           escape from the pens.      One fan on the field of olay appeared to be

           pleading whilst he was being forcibly led to the side of the playing area.

           Behind the goal the two oens were a seething mass of people with little

           or no movement either backwards or forwards.        A few people were being

            r^sed from the back of the oens to the front.            The front of the pens
  next to the             fence   seemed   to*te'flat without the" usual'hohhing heads.'

  very wrong.   On reflection I have come to the conclusion that my alarm was

  confirmed due to a combination of medical exoerience combined with an                                  ;
                                                                                                                               -w.
  intimate knowledge of years of attendance at football matches on the

  terracing.


  I quickly realised that help would "be required on the pitch.                                 I informed my

  son what I was doing and because I was so close to the entrance to the

  terracing I had entered I quickly made my way down the stairs to find a

^^feteward to get me to the side of the pitch.                                   I quickly found a Steward who

  accented what I was telling him and he took me through a tunnel under the main

  stand where a Police Officer again accepted my explanation of being a trained

  nurse and let me on to the pitch.

  I raced to the area immediately behind the goal net.                                   The narrow gate belonging

  to the pen behind the net was open with police officers tiying to pull flaying

  bodies throu^i the narrow opening.                            Other officers appeared to be trying to

   instruct the fans to push back in the pens..                                  I helped officers pull people

   throu^i the gate.                 We were nulling any part of their body we could get hold

   of.           On reflection I realise now because their bodies were level with the

   bottom of the gate that they must have been lying on top of people because

   the gap between the bottom of the gate to the floor of the terracing was some

   three feet.


   The first casualties I helped pull through the gate were conscious, but very

   shocked.               I attended to them at the back of the goalmouth on the netting.

   Their recovery was comparatively quick and simple were moved away from the

   immediate area.                  Very quickly I was aware that we were pulling out

   unconscious bodies.                I can next recall working on a young man who once he

   was conscious seemed to have chest injuries.                                  I looked around the goalmouth -

   for a stretcher or something to remove him to a place for him to get treatment.

 a stretcher lying on the pitch with which I quickly returned to the injured man. ■           i.

 I literally ordered three police officers to help me lift the patient on to the '

 stretcher.   By this time he was complaining about the pain in his chest.                         We

 quickly made our way to the comer of .the field between the main stand and the

 Kop and took the young man behind the stand to the St. John’s Ambulance room.

 I then ran. back on to the field to the goalmouth.            In that short interval of

 time a lot more bodies were lying behind the goal.               People of all descriptions

^pre attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.                        On the right

 hand side of the goal net a young girl was being worked on by a man who stated

 he was a surgeon.      I moved to the body next in line and worked with a young

 police officer until the patient appeared to be starting to come round.                        I

 then moved on to the next person who was lying unconscious and unattended in

 the. goalmouth.     I was working alone in this instance giving both mouth to mouth

 and cardiac massage, an impossible and hopeless situation.                  The patient started

 vomiting to complicate the issue.        I was conscious of an elderly white haired

 St. Johnfs Ambulance man working alongside me.             I requested some swabs to clear

 an airway, all that was forthcoming was a dry sponge.                  By this time it was

 after 15.30 hours and we still had no equipment of any sort to work with.                      It

 was just after that that I was conscious of the first ambulances beginning to

 make their way on to the pitch.          Eventually I realised that I had lost the

 battle for this young man’s life.           I looked around but I could not see anymore

 unattended bodies.       By that time our ranks had been swelled by ambulance crews

 and firemen with some oxygen.

 I next left the field making my way behind the main stand to the gymnasium where

 I understood some of the injured were being taken.               ,Again I found another..scene .

 of chaos.     The only entrance to the gym was a door.of similar dimensions 7                                   -^

 to that found in any household room.            Directly ,outside this door was the ;                  -   ._

 St. John*s Ambulance Room.         . The space was becoming jammed full of people ‘•

 into two, half for the dead and the rest for the living, with tables set up

 to interview the relatives.                                 I began to work with the injured in the

 gymnasium at around 15.55 hours.                                 I was conscious of around three doctors in

 attendance, but when I arrived there'there was still no medical equipment of

 any sort.                       One doctor shouted across the gym for some drugs to treat an

 injured fan who was in obvious pain.                                       There was nothing available so I

 volunteered to go to the St. John’s Ambulance room.                                                            I was informed that

^^jhey were not allowed to carry any drugs.                                                      I rushed bade to the gym asking

  some Senior Police Officer on the way if they could obtain some equipment

  for us.                    Quickly three small plastic boxes arrived with medical equipment

  plus an emergency case with drugs in it.                                                    I began passing out the meagre

  items of equipment to the doctors present.                                                     There were still only roughly

  a dozen injured in the area.                                I prepared ten intravenous lines ready for the

  Medical Officer to set up, and we commandeered police officers to hold the

  I.V. packs because we had no stands to attach them to.                                                                  ?y then some

  semblance of order was being maintained in the part of the gymnasium given

  over to the injured.                           The other side of the gymnasium was rapidly filling

  with the p-A&SUiwp f j /£dead.                             One of the doctors present had taken one of the

  three stethoscopes available to enable him to declare them clin:                                                                             dead.


  I next tidied up the medical equipment as most of the injured were being                                                                                .
  rapidly removed to hospital.                                I then began to realise the full extent of

  the disaster for there were already over fifty bodies lying on the floor.

  My final act in this carnage was to comfort and stay with the husband of the

  young girl whom I had seen attended to behind the goal.                                                            At least I knew

  she had had the best of attention that had been available in the

   circumstances.                        I stayed with him whilst he gave the necessary details :

  to the police, and then a local vicar took over from me.                                                                                        1

   When I left the gymnasium, to’my amazement it was still only 16. 4 5 hours,

            The previous year I arrived at the same area of admission at 14.50 hours -

            with my daughter.     Before we reached the turnstiles at Leppings Lane

            we had to go througi a police filter system, whereby it was ascertained

             that we did have the appropriate match tickets.

             This year no such system was set up#



0.          Both years I was delayed because of travelling difficulties.        The

             appropriate Authorities had decided to initiate roadworks on the H62

             to commence around a week before each game.       Surely the matches could

             have been taken into consideration when setting up these roadworks.



    3   . When we came through the turnstiles for the 1988 game we were met by a

             line of stewards and police officers who gently but ftunly prevented us

              from entering the tunnel to the middle sections.       It had been decided

              that these sections were already full to capacity.

              rpj-Q_g year no such precaution was in opsration.



    4.        I can understand the Police Officers at the turnstiles wishing to open

              the gates to relieve pressure and avoid injuiy to life or limb, but

              in these days of ultra modem and sophisticated personal communications

              surely it could have been done in conjunction with- their central police

              control area at the side of the electronic scoreboard.



        5   . Very recent national publicity has assured us that surveillance cameras -
                                                                                                        ■■■>

     that the' fans genuinely needed help.   Working with and alongside

     the individual police officers in the immediate disaster area, I

     have tremendous praise and admiration for their efforts.   Overall

     at the scene, however, there appeared to he a lack of co-ordination

     and genuine leadership.



     For an extremely long time we were without any form of medical

      equipment of any description.    I still cannot understand why the

      local Health Authority's Major Medical Disaster Team was not called

      upon.   I understand that all Health Authorities in this country

      have a major disaster policy.   It is impossible to accurately

      estimate the difference this would have made in saving life.

      I do, however, believe that the Liverpool fans should have been

      given the chance.

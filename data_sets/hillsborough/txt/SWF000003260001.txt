            MR. HYTNER:       In this application, I appear for the P l a intiff
                 w i t h m y lear n e d fr i e n d Mr. King. The First Defen d a n t s -
A               the Football Club - are r e p r e s e n t e d by Mr. G l a s g o w and Mr.
                 Catchpole; the Second D e f e n d a n t s by Mr. W o o d w a r d and Mr.
                 Payne.

            MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE:                  The C hief C o nstable is the First Defendant.

           MR. HYTNER:                    Yes.

Â®         MR.       JUSTICE             ROSE:             W o u l d y o u like to start again?

           MR. HYTNER:            I think I must.     The First Def e n d a n t - the police
                - is r e p r e s e n t e d by Mr. W o o d w a r d and Mr. Payne; the Second
                D e f e n d a n t s - the Club - by Mr. G l a s g o w and Mr. Catchpole;
                the T hird D e f e n d a n t s - the City Council - b y Mr. Maxwell
                and Mr. Murray; and the Fourth D e f e n d a n t s - Dr. E a s t w o o d -
c              b y Mr. Fenwick, though as will appear, he is in the
                b a c k g r o u n d led by Mr. Tilson.

                               I take it that your L o r d s h i p k n o w s the background, and
                     a l t h o u g h this is a h e a r i n g in open court, it is not
                     n e c e s s a r y for me to go through the w h o l e of the b a c k g r o u n d
                     facts.

D         MR.       JUSTICE             ROSE:             C e r t a i n l y not.

           MR. HYTNER:                    Can I start w i t h all the m a t t e r s             that   I prop o s e   to
               raise?

           MR. J U S T I C E ROSE:                        Are y o u g oing to f rom the order m ade          b y Mr.
                Just i c e Steyn,                         or f r om some other document?

E         MR.       HYTNER:       In the order of the d i r e c t i o n s made. Can I deal
                    w i t h what I see at the mo m e n t as those m a t t e r s that are in
                    contention?

           MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                  Yes.

           MR.      HYTNER:           The first m a t t e r w h i c h ex e r c i s e s the P l a intiff
                    v e r y c o n s i d e r a b l y is the date of trial.             Can I mak e this
                    a b s o l u t e l y p l a i n b e c a u s e it m a y be that Mr. Maxw e l l has not
                    f ully taken this on board:                    there are four defendants.           The
                    h i s t o r y of the l i t i g a t i o n is simple.          The P l a intiff
                    i n i t i a l l y sued the c ity council, and the police and, the
                    statement of c l a i m was a c t u a l l y served.                We then came
                    be f o r e Mr. Justice Steyn - the club and the police - and it
                    was then i n d i c a t e d to us that Dr. E a s t w o o d and the council

                     defendants, and that there w e r e third p a r t y p r o c e e d i n g s
^                    going to be instituted.

                             M y Lord, the v i e w we took was that it w o u l d s i m p l i f y
                     the ple a d i n g s and w o u l d speed the l i t i g a t i o n if we then, as
                     it were, took b a c k our statement of c l a i m and r e - s e r v e d it
                     not in amen d e d form, but in original form, a d d i n g the two
                     further part i e s as p r i m a r y defendants, and so that the
g                   ple a d i n g s could go f r o m there.

                               E v e r y b o d y thought that that was a good idea, i n c l u d i n g
                     Mr. Justice Steyn.               But it m ust be a p p r e c i a t e d that w h e n
                     y o u see those pleadings, w h i c h on the face of them m ake it
                     appear as though the p r i m a r y case of the Pla i n t i f f is
                     against four d e f e n d a n t s cumulatively.           On the alternative,
                     that the thrust of the Plaint i f f ' s case is against the
c                   first two defendants, and wha t we w i s h is if the other                         two
                     d e f e n d a n t s are g o i n g to b l a m e the second two, we adapt the
                     allega t i o n s accordingly: that is our p o s i t i o n as against
                     the council and Dr. Eastwood.

                               In those circumstances, m y Lord, the v i e w that we took
                     was this: that w i t h o u t b e i n g o v e r - c o n f i d e n t or arrogant
                     about our case, l o o k i n g at the pleadings, thus                   l o o k i n g at
D                   the defence and what the defence say, it is if not
                     inconceivable, almost inconceivable, that the P l aintiff
                     wil l lose altogether; that is that they will not succeed
                     against one or mor e defendant.                We t h e refore hav e the
                     a d o p t e d a p p r o a c h fro m the outset that if there was one
                     defendant, and there w e r e no defence, we c ould go b y w a y of
                     Rule 111.           There is no pro c e d u r e if there is no defence.
                     We c ould then go for our damages to be seized m y Lord.
E
                                It is a chink in the p r o c e d u r e s of the court through
                      no fault of the court, but through the fault of Parliament
                      that w h e r e y o u hav e a Pla i n t i f f who has a case against one
                      of two or mor e defendants, there is no m eans of that
                      Pl a i n t i f f g e t t i n g his damages b y w a y of order 14, or b y w a y
                      of s u m m a r y judgment; and therefore, the v i e w taken by the
                      P l a i n t i f f was this: that it w o u l d be a scandal if in those
F                     c i r c u m s t a n c e s the p r o c e d u r e s of the court are not enabl i n g
                      the Pla i n t i f f to get this case on fa i r l y quickly.

                                My Lord, I have to say that w h e n this v i e w was
                      i n i t i a l l y put, there w e r e o nly two pot e n t i a l defendants,

                t h i n g s . The first is the date has b e e n m o v e d to June.

            MR.       JU ST I C E ROSE:                   By whom?

            MR.      H Y T N E R : I do not know,                    but it is n o w said that it is no
                     E a s t e r ; it is June
B
            MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                 By whom?

            MR.       HYTNER:              I think the Court.

            MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE: The Court has not said anything.                           We are
                     her e to consider today.

C           MR.       HYTNER:              I am grateful.

            MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                 The Court c e r t a i n l y never said that.

            MR.       HYTNER:        I am v e r y grateful and p l e a s e d to h ear that,
                      b e c a u s e so far as we are concerned, we w o u l d still press
                      for Easter.

D                          The two things, as I u n d e r s t a n d it, are n o w g oing to
                      be said: one b y the First Defendants, and one b y the Fourth
                      Defendants.

                           The Fourth Def e n d a n t w i s h e s the case to be put over to
                      next October.       I leave Mr. F e n w i c k to deal w i t h that, and I
                      leave Mr. G l a s g o w to put his case on that.        I antic i p a t e
                      that he will support me in m y a p p l i c a t i o n for a v e r y speedy
E                     trial.

                              My Lord, the nex t m a t t e r is rather mor e serious
                     be c a u s e it has b e e n ra i s e d this m o r n i n g for the first time
                     by Mr. Woodward.           I make no c o mplaint about him.         It is the
                     first time, no doubt, that he has b e e n able to raise it.
                     He does not want the case to be put off u ntil October. The
â                    South Y o r k s h i r e Police do not want the case on at all.
                     They w i s h to a p p l y for a stay of the proceedings.

                                My Lord, I m a k e no b ones about this.         One has to be
                      v e r y careful of u s i n g the term "the p o l i c e â b e c a u s e that is
                      a term w h i c h inclu d e s the police, for example, who did the
                      investigative             e n q u i r y on Hillsborough. The p o l i c e m e n and

            MR. HYTNER:          The South Y o r k s h i r e Police through their
                r e p resentative, m y Lord, if one reads the report of Lor d
                 Justice Taylor, it is p e r f e c t l y p l a i n that they hav e done

                               M y Lord, the s u b m i ssions that I make (and I anti c i p a t e
                     they are g oing to be sup p o r t e d b y Mr. Glasgow) are these,
                     f i r s t l y this is simply an e x t e n s i o n of the o b s t r u c t i v e
R                    attit u d e shown b y the same p a r t y throughout the enquiry.

                     collected; and in d e e d not only c o l l e c t e d b y the West

                      that it c ould n o w be said, unl e s s South Y o r k s h i r e Police
                     wil l say they failed to prod u c e r e l evant e v i dence to Lord

                               M y Lord, the s u b m i s s i o n that I make, and think w i t h
                      support, is this: that any i n v e s t i g a t i o n at the moment
                      b e i n g m a d e will be to int e r p r e t the facts a l r e a d y

             MR. HYTNER:          M y Lord, w hat we w o u l d consent to concede is this:
                 that if a n y t h i n g is g o i n g to be said, or might be said, in

                            M y Lord, going on, b e c a u s e I think it is only right I
                       should indic a t e that in our s u b m i s s i o n it is p o s s i b l e for a

                       careful not to elev a t e it, but we n o w ask for a direction.
                       The d i r e c t i o n that we seek follows his s u g g e s t i o n that the

                       findings has l i b e r t y to do so.    This is not civil
                       lititation, as it were, tried b y Lor d Justice Taylor in the
                       enquiry; but any p a r t y w h o disputes the findings of Lord
                       Ju stice Taylor mus t list these findings, and t h erefore each
                       p a r t y knows wha t is they are to be faced with.

                               M y Lord, in those circumstances, it is a n t i c i p a t e d
    3                 that in the test case; in the two test cases r e l a t i n g to
                       deaths in pens three and four, the P l a intiff w o u l d a c t u a l l y
                       h a v e to call v e r y little if any evidence.

              MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE: If I m a y i n terrupt there.    There was                a
                       s u g g e s t i o n there w o u l d be a third test case.

              MR. HYTNER:         I am sorry, there is g oing to be such a test case.
C                 There are d i f f i c u l t i e s in s e l e c t i n g the right one. My
                   Lord, it m a y be that the test cases in r e l a t i o n to those
                   i n j u r e d outs i d e the gr o u n d will not pla y m u c h part, as
                   fu rther i n v e s t i g a t i o n seems to suggest that there w e r e few
                   p e o p l e inju r e d outs i d e the gr o u n d or any thereafter injured
                   w i t h i n the gr o u n d v e r y seriously.

              MR. J U S T I C E ROSE:   If there is to be a third test, and if it
D                 has not b e e n selected, and if it follows that the ple a d i n g s
                   are not be f o r e me, it is d i fficult for me to give
                   d irec t i o n s as to w h e n that should be tried.

              MR.      HYTNER:           It was always h o p e d that w o u l d be tried
                       i m m e d i a t e l y f o l l o w i n g the test cases in r e l a t i o n   to the
                       d eaths inside the ground.

E           MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                No doubt.

              MR. HYTNER:          I concede u n t i l we h a v e s e l e c t e d the case and got
                   the ple a d i n g s b e f o r e you, v e r y little can be done, but what
                   I w o u l d say is that if there are test cases, a test case in
                   r e l a t i o n to i n j uries outside the ground, some evidence
                   w o u l d still hav e to be cal l e d b y the Plaintiff.

                       in r e l a t i o n to the three test cases today.

              MR. HYTNER:  I agree.  I am not ask i n g for any d i r e c t i o n s in
                  respect of a case that has not b e e n brought.

G           MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                V e r y wise.

              MR. HYTNER:          It w o u l d not get v e r y far; but in r e l a t i o n to the
                  two cases b e f o r e you, we a n t i c i p a t e that it w o u l d not be

    ^           MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE:                  Have I got the power      to give such a
                         direction?

                MR. HYTNER:    I am not sure w i t h o u t the consent of the parties
                    that y o u can; and that is one of the p r o blems now, m y Lord.

                MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE: What y o u m e a n is that w i t h o u t              the consent of
                         the parties, I h a v e not got the power?
    B
                MR.      HYTNER:     I think that is right unless s o m e b o d y else can
                         point to some p r o c e d u r e that I k n o w not of.          I anti c i p a t e
                         that Mr. G l a s g o w and the Football Club will support that
                         direction.     In other words, they w o u l d consent.                 We clearly
                         consent.     The s u g g e s t i o n has b e e n m a d e b y Mr. F e n w i c k that
                         yes all right he does not re a l l y object to that, but he
                         thinks it b e t t e r for the P l aintiff to set out these
C                        findings that he w a n t s to be s u p p o r t e d or w a n t s to adopt,
                         and then it is for the d e f e n d a n t s to say w h e t h e r they agree
                         w i t h those findings or not.           That seemed to put it the long
                         w a y round.   If that w e r e the only w a y of g e t t i n g this
                         agreed, m y Lord, we w o u l d n a t u r a l l y agree as a second best;
                         but Mr. Justice S t e y n âs s u g g e s t i o n seems to us to be
                         sensible.

D                                  There are those findings b y L o r d Justice Taylor.        Have
                         we r e a l l y got to p r o d u c e evidence?     To take one simple
                         example, m y Lord, it was found b y Lor d Justice Taylor that
                         a po l i c e officer, several police officers, m a d e an error -
                         and a m a t e r i a l error - in o r d e r i n g the gates to be opened
                          to let in the i n f l u x of spectators w i t h o u t first clos i n g
                         off the p a s s a g e w a y into pens three and four.       Have I really
                         got to produce e v i dence that that po l i c e officer a d m i t t e d
E                        d oing that w h e n he was gi v i n g his evidence?        It is a
                         p o i n t l e s s exercise, and it w o u l d be a great shame if the
                         other three d e f e n d a n t s did not support Mr. G l a s g o w in his
                         agr e e m e n t w i t h us that this should be done.       That is the
                         first thing.

                               The second thing we ask, w h i c h I a n t i c i p a t e wil l not
p                       be o b j e c t e d to b y any of the parties, is that the
                        transcript of the e v i d e n c e at the H i l l s b o r o u g h Enqu i r y
                        should be e v i dence of what was said at the Enquiry.                    That
                        is a p e r f e c t l y usual order made, and was mad e in r e l a t i o n
                        to the inquest notes ---

                MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE:                  Yes.   It is a c c e p t e d as accurate?

G               MR. HYTNER:                   A true re c o r d not of the truth of what w a s            said.

                MR. J U S T I C E ROSE:                       Yes.

                MR. HYTNER:   Lastly, there are the pleadings.         Now, the reason
                    that perh a p s in grea t e r detail than should hav e bee n
                    necessary, I mad e it p l a i n at the outset that the p r i m a r y
                    case of the P l a i n t i f f is against the first two defen d a n t s

                     ma n n e r w h i c h I w o u l d submit is p e r f e c t l y usual and
A                    p r o f e s s i o n a l in this case, has simply r e p e a t e d and adop t e d
                     against in a p r o p o s e d amendment, my Lord, w h i c h we have
                     here.

                             Can I turn to the Chap m a n case.           What Mr. K i n g has
                     done is firs t l y he has a d o p t e d c e r t a i n a l l e g a t i o n s mad e

                     m y own h a d in case was to be i n c l u d e d in the original
                     statement of claim.            As far as I know, Mr. W o o d w a r d does
                     not c o m p l a i n about the ma n n e r of that pleading.                M y Lord,
                     what has b e e n said is that the Second D e f endant says that
                     yes he m a y hav e b e e n an o c c upier but, in the circumstances,
                     the First Def e n d a n t w a s also an occupier.             We h a d not
                     thought of that.

            MR.      JUSTICE               ROSE: Page 21, p a r a g r a p h J?

            MR. HYTNER:       No.   If y o u look at p a r a g r a p h A, y o u see Mr. King
                has p l e a d e d our own al l e g a t i o n s against Dr. Eastwood, but
                we then see w hat is a c t u a l l y b e i n g said against h i m by

            MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                 Yes.

            MR. HYTNER:         Now, it appe a r s that Mr. K i n g s l i ghtly jumped the
                gun, b e c a u s e the second Third Party Notice a p p a r e n t l y had
                that difference, and it m a y be that this d i f f e r e n c e has not
F               a c t u a l l y b e e n served, but this is a draft that we have
                seen, and I u n d e r s t a n d that Mr. F e n w i c k objects to that w a y
                of p l e a d i n g the case against him.         My Lord, I am not going
                to m a k e       a great deal of fuss about this.         If it appears
                that is an u n f a i r w a y of p l e a d i n g the case against him, and
                Mr. K i n g has to sit d own and w r i t e out all the a l l e g ations
                s e r i a t i m in the statement of claim, Mr. K i n g wil l do so.

            MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                 It m a y or m a y not h a v e b e e n served?
A
             MR. HYTNER:          I m a y h a v e b e e n served w i t h o u t leave.  I think
                  that is the situation.                 I simply say this: if at the end
                  your L o r d s h i p is p e r s u a d e d that this is an u n f a i r w a y of
                  p l e a d i n g against Mr. Fenwick, we will, as I say, p lead
                  seriatim, but for the time being, all I nee d is to ask for
                  leave to a mend this statement of c l a i m in the w a y in w h i c h
B                they h a v e a l r e a d y b e e n amended.      That is r e a l l y all I have
                  to say on the d i r e c t i o n s for the trial.

             MR. J U S T I C E ROSE:      Before y o u go on, wha t is you r e s t i m a t e of
                  le n g t h of this trial?        It depends on wha t h a p p e n s in Lord
                  Just i c e T a y l o r âs report.

             MR. HYTNER:        Yes.   If the findings in the report can be relied
q                on, the Plaintiffs' case should not last m ore than a day,
                  day and a half, but the D e f e n d a n t s â case a gain depends u pon
                  h o w m u c h oral e v i den ce they prop o s e to test over and above
                  the findings they a c t u a l l y h a d in the report.

             MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                I am not c o n c e r n e d just w i t h the P l a i n t i f f s â
                       case.

D            MR. HYTNER:           I hav e to say bluntly, I hop e I am not b e i n g over
                 p e s s i m i s t i c about the First Defendant, but frankly, b e a r i n g
                 in m i n d the w a y in they c o n d u c t e d the enquiry, b e a r i n g in
                 mi n d the w a y in w h i c h they c o n d u c t e d themselves since this
                 li t i g a t i o n started, m y Lord, I h a v e to say this: it depends
                 on h o w far they are g oing to contest each and e very finding
                 in the repeort.

E              MR. J U S T I C E ROSE: As at this stage,                            has   there b e e n any
                   e x c hange of experts reports?

             MR. HYTNER:    As far as we are concerned, w e do not hav e any.                     I
                 do not k n o w w h e t h e r the defen d a n t s h ave e x c h a n g e d reports
                 or not.

                   everybody, I h a v e an ap p r o x i m a t e v i e w of the le n g t h of this
                   case, it m a k e s it i m p o s s i b l e to fix it.

             MR.        HYTNER:             I agree,           but all I can say is ---

             MR.        J U S T I C E ROSE:               Y o u are the one that w a n t e d        a spe e d y trial.

G              MR. HYTNER: I k n o w we w i s h the trial to p r o c e e d w i t h some
                   speed b e c a u s e wha t we say is the facts be f o r e the court.

                          "Oh well, we don't a ccept the gates w ere open and floods
A                         pe o p l e came in", the actual people in pens three and four,
                          it c ould last a year.        But if what they are g oing to say is
                          "Well, yes those are the findings and we accept this
                          h a p p e n e d but it was not our fault, it was the fault ofthe
                          club", I w o u l d h a v e thought the case will not take m ore
                          than two to three weeks.

            MR.           J U S T I C E ROSE: The e s t imate that was g iven w h e n the m a t t e r
                          was be f o r e Mr. Justice Steyn b y the parties a p p e a r i n g
                          bef o r e h i m was six weeks.

            MR.           HYTNER:      Again, I do not k n o w on what p r o p o s e d e v i dence
                          they b a s e d that estim a t e on.  As I say ---

            MR. J U S T I C E ROSE: I m a y be wrong,                               but I assu m e d that was a
q               joint estimate.

            MR. HYTNER:                        Oh yes,           I was p a r t y to that.

            MR. J U S T I C E ROSE:                            That is what    I thought.

            MR. HYTNER:            But l o o k i n g at it sensibly, the b a r r i e r w ill take
                 a little time.              It wil l not take any time for the P l aintiff
D               b e c a u s e we will not be taking any part in it.                 M y Lord, I
                 a n t i c i p a t e that expe rts called b y the three part i e s or four
                 pa rt i e s in r e l a t i o n to the b a r r i e r s will h ave to give
                 e v i d e n c e of that, and this could take a w e e k for the
                 remainder.           As I say, m u c h depends on the a p p r o a c h of the
                 First D e f e n d a n t s to the findings of Lord Justice Taylor.
                 H o w far are they going to say he was quite w r o n g to find A,
                 B, C, and D; or h o w far are they going to say "We agree
E               w i t h that and we are not going to go thro u g h that a g a i n but
                 it was not our fault it was the fault of the Club.                        It was
                 the fault of Dr. E a s t w o o d or the city council".                 If that is
                 their approach, I w o u l d h ave thought six w eeks was a v e r y
                 fair and liberal estimate.

            MR.           J U S T I C E ROSE:                  T hank you.

F           MR.           HYTNER:         Can I deal w i t h one m a t t e r w h i c h does not affect
                          m y lear n e d friends in any way.                T h e y m a y think that this is

                          knows, there has b e e n a public fund for the vict i m s of
                          H i l l sborough.         The v a r i o u s P laintiffs will be e n t i t l e d to
                          seek a s s i s t a n c e from the fund, so that it follows that if
                          any P l a intiff wins; if one P l aintiff wins they all win.
q                         T hey will a l r e a d y have, or they m a y a l r e a d y have, if they
                          are infants.            A trust deed has a l r e a d y b e e n d r a f t e d by

                         trust deed, w o u l d agree to the trans f e r of the dama g e s to
                         the trust fund.             As y our L o r d s h i p knows, the p r a c t i c e in
                         re l a t i o n to pare n t s has n o w b e e n disapproved, but it has
                         not b e e n d i s a p p r o v e d in r e l a t i o n to infants.   Therefore,
g                        there is no re a s o n w h y the dama g e s for an infant still
                         cannot be pl a c e d in the trust fund.

                                   My Lord, wha t I was m i n d e d to ask you r L o r d s h i p was

                          ever b e i n g recovered.               I o nly ---

            MR.           J U S T I C E ROSE:        I t hi nk it is h y p o t h e t i c a l . I am
                          s y m p a t h e t i c to the a p p l i c a t i o n y o u make, and it m a y be - I
                          put it no h i g h e r than that - it will be, in the special
D                        c i r c u m s t a n c e s in this case, p r o p e r for any m o n e y w h i c h ma y
                          be r e c o v e r e d to go into such a trust fund, but at the
                          moment, I think there are several hurdles.

            MR. HYTNER:           I a p p r e c i a t e that.    I hav e m a d e the d i f f i c u l t y
                plain.          Obviously, in the o r d i n a r y way, it w o u l d be v e r y
                w r o n g to go in advance.                 We w o n d e r e d if y o u w o u l d  approve
                the trust dee d on b e h a l f of this case, and the p e c u l i a r
E               c i r c u m s t a n c e s are that it relates to a trust fund that is
                going to be set up.                    M y Lord, it w o u l d be u n f o r t u n a t e if
                the fund wer e set up on the basis of the deed, and then in
                a y e a r s time you r L o r d s h i p w e r e to look at it and say well
                I w o u l d have agreed to t r a nsfer the damages to this fund
                but I do not like that ---

F            MR.          J U S T I C E ROSE:      I can follow that, but I doubt if the
                          Court has p o w e r to deal w i t h s o m e t h i n g w h i c h does not
                          i m m e d i a t e l y arise from these proceedings.

             MR. HYTNER:       It w o u l d be not in r e l a t i o n to m a t t e r s that are
                 not a f f e c t e d b y the proceedings, but yes if that wer e the
                  trust deed.        I can see no problems, but it is a m a t t e r for
                  the trustees of this fund w hat they do w i t h their m o n e y ,
q                but if y o u are g oing to ask for e v i d e n c e for the purpo s e s
                  of damages, I do not like t h a t p a r t i c u l a r clause.          We could
                  then consi d e r c h a n g i n g it. That is the point.

              MR.          J U S T I C E ROSE:      Mr. Hytner, all I shall say is that those
                           r e s p o n s i b l e for d r a f t i n g the trust deed must hav e in min d
                           the p o s s i b i l i t y that mon i e s m a y come into it from another
                           source.



                                                                 10.

            MR. HYTNER:      My Lord, that is what I w a n t e d to k n o w from your

            MR. HYTNER:  As long as I know.  Those are the matt e r s I w ish

            MR. WOODWARD:       We came to M a n c h e s t e r to deal w i t h a pre trial

                                It is no secret that there are criminal i n v e s t i g a t i o n s

                       Now, the police officers did give evide n c e be f o r e Lord

                                  The e n q u i r y took place w i t h i n about four w e e k s of the

                        can think of.

             MR. WOODWARD:          It does; as in all civil l i t i g a t i o n one can
                 think of, o r d i n a r i l y e n q uiries are m a d e and the wit n e s s e s

                 as they can be anticipated, and deal w i t h points as they
                 emerge w h i c h h ave not bee n anticipated.

                                  The effect of that letter from those ac t i n g for the
                        Police F e d e r a t i o n is an i n d i c a t i o n that these officers will

D                      p r e p a r e d to give statements.          That s e v e r e l y embarrasses, in

             MR.        J U S T I C E ROSE:   It goes further than that: it says they are
                        not p r e p a r e d to advise the o f f icers to give oral evidence

E            MR. WOODWARD:         There m i g h t be d i f f i c u l t i e s over that, but one
                 w o u l d h o p e one w o u l d not hav e to wai t u ntil the o f f i c e r had
                 t aken the oath b e f o r e it was k n o w n e x a c t l y wha t he was
                 going to say.

                                 This touches u p o n anot h e r point Mr. H y t n e r raises, and
                        that is the status of the Taylor Report, if I m ight call it
                        that, m y Lord.             I will turn to our submis s i o n s in respect
*                      of that in a moment, but it seems that what the Pla i n t i f f
                       and e v e r y b o d y ought to put their m i n d s to is the
                        id e n t i f i c a t i o n of those facts and issues w h i c h will not be
                        in dispute.              That is a thing w h i c h we w o u l d support and
                       w o u l d do our utmost to attend to.

                                  The p o s i t i o n is this: given the tone of that letter,
G                      e f f e c t i v e l y the C hief C o n s t a b l e is u n a b l e to p r e p a r e for
                       his case - for his defe n c e - to s a t i s f y those m a t t e r s set
                       out in Mr. Justice Steyn's order, b e i n g p r o c l u d e d from
                       b e i n g able to a p p r o a c h those o f f icers identified, and that
                       is a serious embarrassment.

             MR.        J U S T I C E ROSE:    I do not follow that, Mr. Woodward, beca u s e
                        the d i r e c t i o n of Mr. Justice Steyn relates to the mu t u a l

          MR. WOODWARD:           W i t h respect, m y Lord, I am not sure that is,
               w i t h respect, the p r o p e r r e a d i n g of it.    The mutual

               As I u n d e r s t a n d the case, in so far as such state m e n t s have

               reference          to such statements.        In otherwords, they h a v i n g
               g iven evidence, all y o u see is the statement he gave; but
               it is the first part of that o rder that we will not be able
               to com p l y with.

          MR.        J U S T I C E ROSE:                   Yes.

q         MR.        WOODWARD: M y Lord, that also affects the expert evidence.
                    It does not touch so m u c h u p o n the consu l t a n t engineer, but
                    m y Lord he will r e q u i r e to know, and does r e q u i r e to k n o w
                    c e r t a i n details fro m cert a i n officers.                 It cannot touch
                    u p o n me t a l l u r g i s t s ,      but it does touch u p o n q u e s t i o n s of
                    safety.           The third expert c a t e g o r y a l l o w e d for in these

             MR. WOODWARD:         That is indeed right.              That is a grave problem,
                 m y Lord.       The d i r e c t o r as w r i t t e n in part in r e l a t i o n to
                 the q u e s t i o n of i n s p e c t i n g the b a r r i e r s beca u s e there was
                 some conc e r n about the i n t e g r i t y of that m a t e r i a l on 25th
                 Oc to b e r 1989.     Perhaps for c o m p l e t e n e s s m y L ord should see
                 that letter.         It gives no i n d i c a t i o n of the sort of time
                 that these i n v e s t i g a t i o n s m a y be e x p e c t e d to occupy.

             MR. WOODWARD:         It is r e a l l y the first part of the let t e r if it
                 was p o s s i b l e , o n e might expect h i m to i n d icate it will only
                  be a m a t t e r of weeks, or it will be a long time, but he has
                 not.     F r o m the i n d i c a t i o n g iven by Mr. M e r v i n Jones, these
                  e n quiries h ave a lon g w a y to go, so he cannot say there is
                  little p r o spect of this d i f f i c u l t y disappearing.          We are
C                embarrassed, and it is on that gr o u n d that we ask for a
                  s tay of these proceedings.

                                   I start w i t h that application.          It is one that is
                         n e c e s s a r i l y important b e c a u s e in the circumstances, we
                         cannot p r o p e r l y p r e p a r e the case, no r can we co m p l y w i t h
                         the orders that h ave so far b e e n made.

D             MR. J U S T I C E ROSE:    Just r e v e r t i n g for a mo m e n t to the q u e s t i o n
                   of expert e v i dence in r e l a t i o n to safety; was any evidence

                   b e h a l f of the police?

             MR. WOODWARD:           No, there was no e v i d e n c e advanced; no p o s i t i v e

                  Lord.        At the hearing, all the e v i d e n c e was called by
E                counsel to the enquiry, and the m a t t e r was dealt w i t h v ery
                  quickly.          There was no e v i dence put b e f o r e the e n q u i r y on
                  the q u e s t i o n of b a r r i e r s or safety, save to the best of my
                  recollection, Dr. E a s t w o o d himself.             There was m a t e r i a l
                  from the H e a l t h and Safety Executive.               Their in v e s t i g a t i o n s

            MR. WOODWARD:          My Lord, one might h ave thought that was agreed
                in r e l a t i o n to the H e a l t h and Safety Exe c u t i v e observation,
                but m y Lord, there is a letter fro m Mr. Robert Waly,
                s e c r e t a r y to the e n q u i r y w h i c h those i n s t r u c t i n g me have,
                d ated 24th Octo b e r 1989.

            MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                  T hank you.

            MR. WOODWARD:      This is part of the H e a l t h and Safety E x ecutive
                w h o s e letter I was r e a d i n g but a mo m e n t ago:

                                  "So far as the b a r r i e r is c o n c e r n e d .....................

                      as further i n v e s t i g a t i o n of it m a y be n e c e s s a r y in respect
                      of this enquiry".

q                            The tenor of that suggests that it is not in r e l a t i o n
                      to a n y t h i n g L ord Justice Taylor has said.            The rest of the
                      letter deals w i t h the e n q u i r y mad e c o n c e r n i n g the technical
                      report.        Then, my Lord, the next document, in fact, is the
                      letter of 25th O c t o b e r w h i c h m y Lord has, I think, from Mr.
                      Dor from the D i r e c t o r of Public Prosecutions.

             MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE:                  Yes.

            MR. WOODWARD:         L a y i n g dow n conditions, so it w o u l d seem.
                L o o k i n g at that c o rrespondence, taking it as a whole, the
                official r e s p o n s e was u n d e r no c i r c u m s t a n c e s can a n y t h i n g
                be done to this barrier, and it w o u l d seem that we are n o w
                in a position, subject to c e r t a i n conditions, and that
                r e q u i r e s some d i s c u s s i o n b e c a u s e the d i r e c t o r wi s h e s to
                impose cert a i n condi t i o n s u p o n m a k i n g an examination.
E
                                The rea s o n I am r e f e r r i n g to this is that it is h o p e d
                      that b y sensi b l e d i s c u s s i o n w i t h the director, the p o s i t i o n
                      can be m ade plain, and our m e t a l l u r g i s t and e n g i n e e r will
                      be able to mak e w h a t e v e r e x a m i n a t i o n in the p r o p e r frame
                      entitled, and not be m ade subject to terms and conditions,
                      for example, that all reports and date of supply to
F                     s o m e b o d y else.   A n y other r e q u i r e m e n t or c o n d i t i o n a t t ached
                      to m o n i t o r the test, of course, w o u l d be r e a s o n a b l e b e c a u s e
                      it w o u l d be imp o r t a n t to k n o w e x a c t l y wha t h a p p e n e d to the
                      p i ece of the barrier.

                                I m e n t i o n that b e c a u s e of the time r e q u i r e m e n t in
                      r e l a t i o n to Mr. Just i c e Steyn's order.            We expect to be
                      able to co m p l y w i t h it m y Lord, but there is a chance that
G                    we m a y not.           That is in respect of the c o nsultant engineer
                      and m e t a l l u r g i s t as to the sa f e t y of them.        We m a y be able
                      to s u b s t a n t i a l l y c o m p l y w i t h it, but not in r e l a t i o n to
                      such tests as I h ave b e e n r e f e r r i n g to as to the safety
                      matter.

                               My Lord the controlling, the p o l i c i n g the o r g a n i s a t i o n
                      and r u n n i n g of crowds.          That is a m a t t e r in respect of

^                      is a difficulty.

                             M a y I m ove on now, m y Lord.            There was an a p p l i c a t i o n
                       b efore Mr. Justice Steyn a s k i n g for other actions to be
                       stayed.     We h a v e n o t h i n g m o r e to add in r e l a t i o n to that.

                            M a y we m ove to 8 . That, in part, is coup l e d w i t h 11(1)
g                     of the order that in part is c o u p l e d w i t h the rider Mr.
                       Justice Steyn made, that the Taylor Report is not a matter
                       that can come b e f o r e the court and c o n s t i t u t e e v i d e n c e in
                       the hearing.     My Lord, the report is, of course, a set of
                       facts that are known.       It  sets out infe r e n c e s d rawn from
                       those facts; sets out m a t t e r s and co n c l u s i o n s and matt e r s
                       all known.

C                                In r e l a t i o n to that report it w o u l d seem that the
                      p u r p o s e that the Pl ain t i f f s requ i r e it to be b e f o r e the
                       court is r e a l l y as a sort of aide-memoire; a list of facts.
                      Now, m y Lord, in r e l a t i o n to that matter, I ind i c a t e d at
                       the b e g i n n i n g that is an end w h i c h all the parties, w i t h
                      respect, I think in one w a y or anot h e r w o u l d seek to comply
                      with, h a v i n g no i n t erest in caus i n g this trial to run on,
                       and on, and on.              T h e y all h a v e an interest in seeing what
D                     facts are common, and wha t can be agreed; so we respect the
                       s u g g e s t i o n that the Taylor Report should go be f o r e the
                       trial judge or it should be put in in evidence.                    In so far
                       as it m a y not seem capable as a m e a n s b y w h i c h one can
                       i d e n t i f y facts and i n d icate w h e t h e r or not we agree or
                       dispute, that is the end w h i c h we w o u l d seek to assist and
                       enc o u r a g e in the report to go b e f o r e the trial judge.

E             MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:     What is it that y o u are suggesting?                If it
                        be the case that the First D e f e n d a n t s are anxious to

                        in r e l a t i o n to w h i c h there is a dispute, is not one

                        Mr. Just i c e Steyn?

P             MR.       WOODWARD:    Not that the report should go in, but m y Lord,
                        the facts sought and the scale of the facts in the report
                        m a y be taken as the scale u p o n w h i c h one m a y p r o c e e d to
                        agree facts.

              MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:      Wha t is it y o u are c o n c e r n e d about: that the
                        judge who tries this m a t t e r will be i m p r o p e r l y i n fluenc ed

              MR. WOODWARD:             No, m y Lord.  In so far as any c o n c l u s i o n of
                  facts be f o r e Lord Justice Taylor wer e cast u p o n evidence,
                  that evide n c e will be there; but at the trial it is not

D              MR. WOODWARD:              W h e n the list of facts is d r a w n and p r e p a r e d and
                   the facts shor t l y stated, perh a p s all the facts m i g h t be
                   c o n v e n i e n t l y put on two sheets of A4.        It is not the
                   ob j e c t i v e that is challenged, it is the mode of s e e k i n g to
                   pursue it.

             MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                Yes.

E             MR. WOODWARD:            M y Lord, in r e l a t i o n to Mr. Justice S t e y n 1s
                  o b s e r v a t i o n 11 (1 ), the transcript, there is no issue about
                  that.         It r e a l l y is 11 (1), the last clause of that at
                  w h i c h we h ave b e e n looking.

             MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE.                There is no issue as to 11   (1) B

F             MR. WOODWARD:        No m y Lord, none at all.  We agree                    that is a
                   true r e c o r d of w hat was said at the hearing.

             MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:   Do I take it then that the First Def e n d a n t
                       is p r e p a r e d to agree to submit b e f o r e trial a list of those
                       findings of fact c o n t a i n e d in the e n q u i r y report c o n t e s t e d
                       at trial?

G             MR. WOODWARD:            We are p r e p a r e d to p a r t i c i p a t e in the
                  p r e p a r a t i o n of an ag r e e d list of facts, or an ag r e e d list

                   therefore.           M a y I m ove to the third p a r t y matter.

             MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                Yes.

            MR.          WOODWARD:            Does my L o r d have bef o r e h i m the third p a r t y
                         notice.           It is s t r i c t l y speaking, w h i l s t called third p a rty

            MR.           J U S T I C E ROSE:                 Just a moment.       Yes.

B            MR. WOODWARD:         My Lord, they h ave b een p r e p a r e d by my lear n e d

                   see.        It is at the end.      I was not sure if I h a d the right
                   document.        It is a v e r y short document.

             MR. WOODWARD:                          Yes.

             MR.          J U S T I C E ROSE:                 I hav e it.

D             MR. WOODWARD:            An d m y Lord,      in r e l a t i o n to the Fourth
                   D e f e n d a n t Dr. Eastwood,         recites and relies u p o n the matt e r s
                   p l e a d e d w i t h i n the Pl a i n t i f f ' s pleading, and w i t h the
                   ad d i t i o n a l four or five points that are there raised.                We
                   seek to raise these against our co-defendants, and that is
                   p r o p e r l y done b y the procedure.

                                    My Lord, in respect of these, we             have a sked for
E                         directions.            Does m y Lor d hav e that?       I have not h a d an
                          o p p o r t u n i t y to disc u s s that w i t h m y lear n e d friends, and
                          wha t their att i t u d e s to this third p a r t y not i c e are.        No
                          o b j e c t i o n has b e e n g iven but, m y Lord, that m a y be because
                          they h a v e not h a d a chance to s peak to me.

              MR.          J U S T I C E ROSE: I wil l see wha t counsel say about that. At
p                          the moment, y o u are ask i n g for an order in the form of the
                           summons?

              MR. WOODWARD:  Yes.     The y are fa i r l y standard.                               We ask for
                  these orders.   T h a n k you, m y Lord.

              MR.          GLASGOW:          There is v e r y little I n e e d to add on b e h a l f of
                           the Club.          Is it c o n v e n i e n t if I run through Mr. Justice
G                         Steyn's order w i t h y o u r Lordship.             The ple a d i n g s and the
                           d i s c o v e r y ought to be dealt with.           M ight I adva n c e to say
                           that I hope y o u r L o r d s h i p has not got the i m p r e s s i o n from
                           any of the lawyers that there has b e e n any delay.

               MR.          J U S T I C E ROSE:                I h ave not got any i m p r e s s i o n at all.

                      there has b e e n v e r y con s i d e r a b l e h a r d w o r k and co-
^                    operation.

             MR. J U S T I C E ROSE:                      I do not doubt that.

             MR. GLASGOW:             I hop e y o u do not, m y Lord, beca u s e m a n y do. It
                  is right that the Court should be aware of that, and that
                  c o - o p e r a t i o n continues.
g
                                M y Lord, the p r e - t r i a l r e v i e w was helpful,     and that
                       in d e e d has b e e n c o - o p e r a t e d with.

                                So far as m y lear n e d friend's p o s i t i o n on the stay is
                      concerned, ma y I say that for our part we s y mpathise
                      ourselves.            We u n d e r s t a n d it is d i f f i c u l t if y o u cannot get
                      y o u r h a n d s on statements, but we do wonder, a l t h o u g h we
C                    h ave no forceful case to mak e of it, w h e t h e r there                       is a
                      little p r o b l e m h ere other than one of p r o f e ssional
                      d i f f i c u l t y w i t h w h i c h one sympathises.

                                We accept and u n d e r s t a n d that the junior officers ma y
                      hav e b e e n a d v i s e d b y their own s olicitors not to prov i d e
                      any further statements.                     Is it in the i n terests of justice
                      simply to stay the w h o l e of the ac t i o n b e c a u s e of that?
D                     One w o u l d have thought that p o s s i b l y the action c ould
                      p r o c e e d on the timetable that we h a d all agreed, and that
                      we all thought sensi b l e on the last occasion, and the Court
                      sh o u l d look f a v o u r a b l y at any late a p p l i c a t i o n to serve the
                      s tat e m e n t s fro m any quar t e r w h e r e there h a d b e e n some
                      a c c e p t a b l e and r e a s o n a b l e d e l a y of the matters.

                                   I do not w a n t to single a n y b o d y out by name or rank,
E                     but       the fact that the senior officers wh o are clea r l y
                       thought m ost d i r e c t l y c o n c e r n e d for not only giving their
                       statements, but g i v i n g evidence, and there is no s u g g e s t i o n
                       that they w o u l d see k either to be advised, or they be
                       p r e p a r e d to h ide b e h i n d any p r o c e d u r a l d e l a y that m ight
                       arise in the future.

P                                There can be no q u e s t i o n of the criminal p r o c e e d i n g s
                       g o i n g on, or the i n v e s t i g a t i o n c o n t i n u i n g into the end of
                       next year, b y w h i c h time we wil l k n o w w h e r e we are going.
                       I do not think a n y b o d y w o u l d be e n t h u s i a s t i c about the
                       civil p r o c e e d i n g s b e i n g e m b a r k e d u p o n and people b e i n g

                       L o r d s h i p on the b a s i s that is a r e a l i s t i c prospect, and if
G                     that is so, p e r h a p s all we k n o w is u n d e r s t a n d i n g w i t h o u t
                       any separate order: that the order that w i t n e s s s tateme nts

                                 So far as the e x c hange of reports is concerned, we are
                       in the same p o s i t i o n as the police, and I i d e n t i f y the

                       difficult, and we m a y be a little late w i t h our actual

             MR.          GLASGOW:       My Lord, I antic i p a t e the d o c u m e n t rather like my
^                        friend Mr. Woodward.           The schedule of the not i c e to admit
                          facts, w h i c h one w o u l d h ave thought c ould h ave b e e n done on
                          two bit s of A4 paper, b e c a u s e the knife cuts b o t h ways.             I
                          am sure m y l e a r n e d friend Mr. H y t n e r w o u l d be the first to
                          accept that it is w h o l l y u n n e c e s s a r y from the Plaint i f f ' s
                          p oint of v i e w to list e very single fact l a b o r i o u s l y and to
                          go through the Taylor reports.                One w o u l d expect Lor d
g                        Justice Taylor did; but to take out those facts that really
                         matter, and to serve those.               If that cannot be fitted on to
                          two sheets of A4 paper, some of us p a r t i c u l a r l y those who
                          sit b e h i n d us, w ill be e x t r e m e l y disappointed.      I would
                         h ave thought that the e x e rcise c ould be a c c o m p l i s h e d in 14
                          days, and c e r t a i n l y in the time scale for the p r e p a r a t i o n
                          of this trial.

q                                   It w o u l d be s e n sible to a l l o w a longer p e r i o d b e c a u s e
                          the q u e s t i o n of w h a t is relevant, and wha t is l i k e l y to be
                          d i s p u t e d is, to some extent, a r e f l e c t i o n u p o n the v i e w of
                          the expert and w h e n the experts hav e h a d an o p p o r t u n i t y of

                          m a t t e r s in the Taylor Report that are no longer material,
                          and it w o u l d be for fear of m i s s i n g s o m e t h i n g out.      Surely
                          the sensi b l e thing is to say in 28 days if it is to be done
D                        this w a y round, then the P laintiffs c ould d r a w a schedule
                          of those facts c l e a r l y w i t h o u t pre j u d i c e them in any w a y at
                          all.        If they could m a k e their list of wha t they r e g a r d as

            MR. GLASGOW:      I think there is n o t h i n g further.     We all agree
                 about the transcript, that is the u s u a l order.           I think

                         y o u got a v i e w as to the length of this case?

            MR. GLASGOW:       We all have.   We all gave it and we all agree
                 five to six weeks.       We could all be wrong, but we did think
Â£               about it b e f o r e we said it.      We all k n o w there wil l be c o Â­

            MR.           GLASGOW:           Again, there is c o - o p e r a t i o n and m a y I m ake one
                          thing plain:              n o b o d y was s e e k i n g to go b e h i n d y our L o r dship
                          in trying to find out wha t the s i t u a t i o n was.                      It was
                          r e c o g n i s e d that the Plaintiff's, on an y view, w o u l d be

                          available.            M y Lord, we all rec o g n i s e that the Plaintiffs
                          hav e said right thro u g h this e n q u i r y "Can we get on w i t h
E                        the action", and so now, it is of p a r a m o u n t importance, and
                          th e refore we are u n c l e a r of w h e t h e r it was likely, given
                          that estimate, that a u t u m n w o u l d be available.                      We lo o k e d

                          w h e n it could be f i t t e d in.               It was agai n s t that
                          background, I think the three w h o tried to look at the

             MR. GLASGOW:             Yes, and the danger of r u n n i n g into the v a c a t i o n

            MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE:                  Oh,    clearly.

            MR.      GLASGOW:       We spoke of the five to six w eeks we think it is
                     l i k e l y to be that in any event.

B           MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:                 Yes.

            MR.       GLASGOW:       The o nly other m a t t e r is the third p a r t y matter.
                      N o b o d y is talking technical words, but we are talking about
                      an o rder 16 rule 8 notice.

                                T here is no n e w issue there is no third p a r t y notice,
                     and that is an imp o r t a n t point beca u s e we all recognised,

                     w o u l d be h i g h l y r e g r e t a b l e if people s t a r t e d s e r v i n g third
                     p a r t y p r o c e e d i n g s in this case, b e c a u s e that w o u l d lead to
                     d elays w h i l e third parties got involved.                    We w a n t e d
                      e v e r y b o d y to be equal d e f e n d a n t s so the timetable c ould
                      run.

D                    w i t h us to the exten t of sa y i n g if third p a r t y pr o c e e d i n g s
                      were issued, he w o u l d not give leave                      for them            to f o l l o w in
                      this trial.          They        w o u l d hav e to take those at                  a later
                      stage; and we are m o s t anxious that n o t h i n g sh o u l d n o w be
                      d one to u p s e t the           s m o o t h n e s s of that rhythm. If people
                      wan t to put their               p oint later in the form of third p a r t y
                      notice, n o b o d y can stop them.                    The y are w h o l l y u n n e c e s s a r y

                       purpose.         Wha t is the point in telling us that police want
                       to be i n d e m n i f i e d on the grounds of our n e g l i g e n c e ? It is
                       not r e m o t e l y helpful.     It was a good idea, but it will be
G                       ignored.

              MR.       J U S T I C E ROSE:               So y o u r answer is to mak e   no order?

              MR.       GLASGOW:               None at all.

              MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE: If I am a sked to m ake an order,                       I h ave     to
                       mak e an order of some kind.

           MR. GLASGOW:          That is w h y y o u r p o s i t i o n is so m u c h more
A              d i f f i c u l t than ours; but we do not think there is any
               a d vantage to them, and they do not ---

           MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE:                   They do not add anything.

           MR.      GLASGOW:            The y add nothing.              The y are p o t e n t i a l l y
                    i n t r o d u c i n g a c o m p l i c a t i o n w h i c h we w a n t e d to avoid.  If
R                   there is some s p e cific d i r e c t i o n in r e l a t i o n to that my
                    friend wants, he c ould ask; but it is a w h o l l y u n n e c e s s a r y
                    notice.

                          Unless I have m i s s e d something.                   Those are our
                     submissions.

           MR. MAXWELL:                    M a y I deal w i t h m a t t e r s in the order in w h i c h
q              they h ave                  b e e n discussed.

                                 The First D e f e n d a n t a p p l i c a t i o n to stay: we hav e no
                       o b s e r v a t i o n on m ake on that.

                            Secondly, the P l a i n t i f f a p p l i c a t i o n for a d i r e c t i o n
                     that L o r d Justice T a y lor's report of facts should be prima
                     facie e v i dence of such facts, and a n y b o d y wh o d i s p u t e s a
D                   find i n g mus t list them.      We find that to be an a t tractive
                     direction, not least b e c a u s e it looks as though it will
                     save so m u c h time.    It is not a d i r e c t i o n to w h i c h we feel
                     able to agree as m a t t e r s stand, m y Lord.

                               The re a s o n for that is not that we w i s h to be
                     obstructive, but it is b e c a u s e we hav e not h a d a d i s c l o s u r e
                     of w i t n e s s statements, and m y Lord, we do not know,
E                    therefore, the                 full extent to w h i c h any c h a llenge of the
                     findings of fact m a y h a v e to be made.                    We m a y k n o w the h a r d
                     core of the challenge, but we do not k n o w the full extent.
                     We find, therefore, that is not a d i r e c t i o n to w h i c h we can
                     agree.          On the         other hand, we will r e s p o n d c o n s t r u c t i v e l y
                     to a no t i c e to             admit facts of the k i n d envisaged, and if it
                     is a g r e e d the t i metable w h i c h was proposed, m y Lord, w h i c h
â                   was talked about to hav e a r e s ponse b y the end of January.
                     That w o u l d a l l o w us an o p p o r t u n i t y to reflect u pon
                     d i s c o v e r y w i t n e s s s t a t e m e n t s and experts' statements.

                               So far as the transcript is concerned, we agree to
                     the d i r e c t i o n w h i c h is sought; that that is proper evidence
                     of the facts.

q                              As to the amendments, we hav e no o b j e c t i o n to the
                     p r o p o s e d amen d m e n t s the P l a i n t i f f seeks, but we ask for
                     cons e q u e n t leave to a m e n d the d e f e n c e of the Third
                     D e f e n d a n t s if so advised.

                            M a y I turn to a part of the case w h e r e we are as k i n g
                     the Court's assistance.                It relates to a request for
                     furt h e r and b e t t e r p a r t i c u l a r s the T hird D e f e n d a n t s have
H                   m ade and the P l a i n t i f f ' s s t a tement of claim.


                                                                     27.

              MR.           J U S T I C E ROSE:               Just a moment.          Yes.

                       We n o w a p p r e c i a t e that there was some d i s c u s s i o n as to the
A                      p o s i t i o n of the Second D e f e n d a n t s in terms of b l a m i n g other

                       our w i t n e s s statements, is the an s w e r to the request for
                       further and b e t t e r particulars.             We w o u l d like to have

g                             That is the position, and we invite the Court to make
                       an o rder in resp e c t of that requ e s t for further and be t t e r
                       particulars, if your L o r d s h i p thought that was a sensible

              MR.      MAXWELL:            We think we w o u l d be able to make that and shall
                       be c o m p l y i n g w i t h that; but the requ e s t for furt h e r and

              MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE:  Is it n e c e s s a r y to do that, Mr. Maxwell?
                       C o u l d the case not be        left to the good sense of the

                       Mr. T i l s o n in attending.           My Lord, he has other commitments
                       t h roughout the summer u ntil October.

                                On investigation, the one w h i c h at present it appears
                      that he m a y not p r o p e r l y be able to return, is a six w e e k
                      case on 30th April, w h i c h should leave h i m free to start on
                      18th June.            So m y Lord, at the moment, h a v i n g due r e g a r d to
                      vari o u s commitments, un l e s s released, or unl e s s that case
                      settles, it is u n l i k e l y that he w o u l d be able to a t t e n d to
                      r e p r e s e n t the F o u r t h Def e n d a n t if the trial b e g a n before

                      be e m b a r r a s s e d ei t h e r b y that or other case.

                                It is not si m p l y a m a t t e r of the c o n v e n i e n c e of

                      a n d others of those r e p r e s e n t e d were pres e n t throughout
                      f rom the outset. My Lord, Dr. E a s t w o o d r e c e i v e d an

                      of the proceedings.                  In other words, it was n e c e s s a r y to
                      c atch up, and those r e p r e s e n t i n g h i m not done and wer e not

                       summons it was i n t i m a t e d that they w e r e g o i n g to be joined.
                       We did not attend, so m y Lord, we have to c a t c h up in the

                      p r o c e e d towards trial w i t h quite the speed of the other
A                     defendants, apart from our late join i n g of them in the
                      e n q u i r y a n d in the proceedings, is the u n c e r t a i n t y as to
                      the n a t u r e of the a l l e g a t i o n a g a i n s t us, and w h a t we are
                      g o i n g to have to do b y w a y of investigation, and r e a d i n g
                      the transcript, and r e a d i n g the w i t n e s s statements, and
                      those parts of the e v i dence that we are not as yet familiar
                      with.        I say that for this reason: y our L o r d s h i p has h e a r d
g                     that in the case of C h a p m a n c u r r e n t l y be f o r e y our Lordship,
                      we w e r e joined at the e n d of July, b e g i n n i n g of August
                      after the last direction.

                               It was i n t i m a t e d to us that at all times until, I
                     think, about the m i d d l e of September, that a l t h o u g h we were
                     in v o l v e d in that action, it was not e x p e c t e d b y the
                     P laintiffs that we w o u l d be in the second a c t i o n in
q                   r e l a t i o n to p e n 4.      In the event, for reasons w h i c h I
                     u n d e r s t a n d m a y be similar, all those i n v o l v e d are joined in
                     the C h a p m a n action.         We were, in fact, joined in that p e n 4
                     action, but it was i n t i m a t e d to us that we w ere u n l i k e l y to
                     be i n v o l v e d in the third a c t i o n w h i c h has not yet b e e n

                     outside the ground.

D                              As we n o w u n d e r s t a n d it, not at the b e h e s t of the
                     Plaintiff, but as I u n d e r s t a n d it at the be h e s t of one of
                     the o ther defendants, it is l i k e l y we are g oing to be
                     i n v o l v e d in that a c t i o n also.      At p r e s e n t we cannot, w i t h
                     great respect, for the life of us see what it is a bout Dr.
                     E a s t w o o d and his f irm w h i c h could give rise to a joinder in
                     that action.         C l e a r l y it has to be h o p e d that all the
                     acti o n s can be dealt w i t h at the same time, but u n t i l we
E                   k n o w w h a t is g oing to be said to us, eve n in the m ost
                     general terms, it is v e r y d i f f i c u l t for us to assess the
                     time that it wil l take to p r e p a r e for trial.

                                My Lord, that, in m y submission, i n dicates that our
                      c o n c e r n should be v i e w e d s y m p a t hetically.       It n o w appears
                      (I hop e I am right in saying this) that all part i e s are
                      e f f e c t i v e l y a g r e e d that the trial date w o u l d be b e t t e r in

            MR.       FENWICK:            I accept that.         It is p o s s i b l e for m y lear n e d
                      fr i e n d Mr. T i l s o n to absent h i m s e l f from w e e k one, and

                      that type of a d j o u r n m e n t is u n l i k e l y to do so.             Of course,

             MR.      J U S T I C E ROSE:                  T hank y o u v e r y much.
C
             MR.     FENWICK:            So far as the report of L o r d Justice Ta y l o r is
                      concerned, we w e l c o m e the a p p r o a c h that this d o c ument
                      should be b e f o r e the trial judge and should, as far as
                     possible, a l l o w u n c o n t e s t e d issues of fact to go b e f o r e the
                      court w i t h o u t the n e e d to call oral evidence.         Clearly a
                     wa s t e of time an d r e s o u r c e s that that should h a p p e n if not
                      a b s o l u t e l y essential.   It m a y be that there is no n e e d for
D                    me to address y our L o r d s h i p at l e n g t h in v i e w of the lack
                      of a g r e e m e n t fro m other parties, and lac k of jurisdiction.

                                M a y I m ake our p o s i t i o n clear.            We are sympathetic,
                      and w o u l d like to be able to agree to this.                        We have two
                      concerns, a n d we r e g a r d one as imp o r t a n t and the o ther as
                      s e n sible an d convenient.                 T hey can b o t h be r e s o l v e d by
                      organisation, and the Pla i n t i f f i n d i c a t i n g si m p l y by
E                    u n d e r l i n i n g or s i d e l i n i n g p a s s a g e s in the report; those
                      p r i m a r y findings of fact on w h i c h they w o u l d seek to rely
                      at trial.

                               We are a s k i n g for that for two reasons, the first
                      w h i c h I say is the im p o r t a n t one, is that m a n y findings of
                      fact are q u i t e c l e a r l y that; findings of fact.          On one
F                    view, it c ould be thought a f i n d i n g of fact, and on another
                      v i e w it c ould be see n as a n inference, or i n d e e d as a
                      conclusion.              We think that it is g o i n g to be im p o r t a n t that
                      a n y d i s p u t e as to w h a t the findings of fact g oing b e f o r e
                      the court are are r e s o l v e d bef o r e the trial, and not at
                      thetrial, so there is no doubt, and the P l a i n t i f f cannot
                      say this is a p r i m a r y find i n g of fact one or other of
                      th e d e f e n d a n t s w i s h e d to test; not it is a conclusion. It
G                    seems to us that it does not take time, or a n y signif i c a n t
                      time , o n the part of the Plaintiffs, a n d w o u l d lead to the
                      s i m p l i f i c a t i o n of the issues at trial.

                                The second p oint is this: that                          so far as the Fo u r t h
                      D e f e n d a n t is concerned, I have m ade                       clear our lac k of
                      familiarity.            In o rder to assist us                     in arrive s p e e d i l y in
                      our p r e p a r a t i o n for trial, m y Lord,                     it w o u l d be h e l p f u l to

                     on.   This can be put agai n s t any defendant.              I do not seek
                     to as k h i m to put w h i c h d e f e n d a n t he relies on those facts
                     for* just so we k n o w w h i c h areas of the transcript we have

                     to consent in the p r e s e n t terms sought.
B                              My Lord, as far as the expert i n v e s t i g a t i o n s are
                      concerned, we think it m a y be d i f f i c u l t to m e e t the date of
                      1 0th J a n u a r y w h i c h p r e s e n t l y stands u n d e r the order.       I do
                      not m a k e an a p p l i c a t i o n at this stage.            I would very much
                      h ope that at least we c ould say secure the e v i dence w i t h
                      that excha n g e of expert report say not less than three

                      a bout 2nd M a r c h or 16th M a r c h if you r L o r d s h i p a c c e d e d to

                      concerned, they are intertwined.               M a y I deal          w i t h them

                      done in that form, it w ill be. If he finds it easier to
                      plead, we will do it.              I have leave to a mend the s t a tement
                      of claim; also the d o c u m e n t in a c c o r d a n c e w i t h the

                                So far as the a p p l i c a t i o n for stay is concerned, I am
E                    not p e r s u a d e d that the p o s s i b i l i t y of junior officers

                      and I am not p e r s u a d e d that such small theoretical

                          as a true r e c o r d of wha t was said at the Enquiry.                 So far

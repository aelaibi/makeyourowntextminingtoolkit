I understand that earlier this morning you spoke to my
Assistant Chief Constable (Operations) Ian McGregor, in
relation to reports of the possibility of a National
Rail Strike.  I am pleased that provisional links have
been established which should be to everyone's benefit.

 I was naturally saddened to learn of the Hillsborough
 disaster and forward herewith a copy of a report which
 the Force was requested to prepare for the Home Office
 on the subject.

 I have also enclosed copies of a number of Intelligence
 Reports regarding the conduct of Liverpool Supporters
 when travelling on the rail system, which may be of
 interest to your investigating officers.

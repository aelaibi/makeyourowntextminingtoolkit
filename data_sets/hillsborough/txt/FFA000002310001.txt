          REPORT ON FA CUP SEMI FINAL AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY. ON 15TH APRIL 1989

  I first noticed that something vas wrong more or less     immediately after      the   ballhad
  hit the Nottingham Forest crossbar for I turned to my     left tosee the Liverpool
  supporters swaying forward, something seen many times at football matches.
  It was then that I noticed a spectator inside the perimeter fencing on the pitch and
  realised that obviously there vere problems at the Liverpool supporters end of the
  ground. The Public Address system vas very poor in volume although a number of
  announcements vere made. Later on when the volume vas turned up an announcement by
  the Liverpool FC Manager, Mr K Dalgleish, vas heard without any problems at all.
  The main complaint I have received is that the public did not know vhat vas going
  on and people felt that they could have been kept more in the picture.

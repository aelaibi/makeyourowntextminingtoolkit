        GOVERNMENT HELP FOR FOOTBALL ; CUT IN POOL BETTING OUT?

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, announced today                           that
the     cut in the rate of pool betting duty from 42.5 to 40 par cent
foreshadowed in his Budget statement will take                    effect        from   next
Monday, 28 May.


Commenting on the duty reduction, the Chancellor said


        "I   am delighted that the football authorities hays responded
        positively to my Budget proposal, and that I am able to                        help
        in   this    way.     The extra money available will allow clubs to
        invest in better facilities, improving spectator comfort                        and
        helping     to    ensure     that    disasters like Hillsborough do not
        recur.”


The announcement follows an understanding involving                       the    Football
League,      the    Football Trust 1990 and the pools companies that the
wrhole of the money saved will be spent on ground                      improvements     of
clubs     in the Football League and the Scottish Football League and
on the three national stadia - Wembley, Hampden Park                      and     Windsor
Park.


Phe     reduction in duty will last initially for five years, when it
will be reviewed.           It is expected to be worth around £100                million
for     football over that period.               It will be in addition to the £75
million from other sources that the Football Trust 1990 expect                           to
make available to professional football over the next ten years.

          Notes for Editors

          1.   The   reduction    in pool betting duty was     announced to
          Parliament today by the Chancellor in a Written      Answer to a
          Parliamentary Question.

          2.   The Government's proposal to help football in this way
          followed Lord Justice Taylor's report on        the   Hillsborough
          disaster, which recommended the significant improvements should be
          made to league football grounds to improve conditions, and to help
          to combat hooliganism.

          3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed in his Budget
          Statement on 20 March to reduce the rate of pool betting duty to
          40 per cent on the understanding that the revenue forgone by the
          Government was given to the Football Trust      1990 for use in
          bringing football league grounds up to the standards of safety and
          comfort recommended by Lord Justice Taylor,

          4.   Pool betting duty is paid by the pool promoters on the
          amounts staked with them. A two and a half per cent cut in duty to
          40 per cent will cost about £16 million in 1990-91 and £20 million
          in 1991-92.    Over the five years up to 1994-95 the Exchequer
          expects to forgo about £100 million revenue.        The resulting
          financial benefit to football is in addition to the amounts the
          Football Trust expects to allocate to professional  football over
          the next 10 years from Spotting-the-Bal1 competitions.

          5.   The Football Trust     1990 will maintain a separate account
          showing how the saving from the reduction in pool betting duty
          will be spent.     The account will be separately audited and a
          statement of the account and the auditor's report will be made
          available to the Government,

          S.    The Government will be introducing a new clause at Report
          Stage of the Finance Bill seeking to reduce the duty from 28 May
          1990.

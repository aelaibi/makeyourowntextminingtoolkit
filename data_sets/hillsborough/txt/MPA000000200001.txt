    there was a very large           crowd.

    The match was a fi rst di vi si on league game                 b etween S h ef f i e l d

    We dn es da y and M a n c h e s t e r City.   It was    the    last game of the s e a s e n

    and S he ffield W e d n e s d a y needed to win the g am e to rema in in the firs

    division.       It w ou ld be about       1971.

    It was an al l- ti ck et e ve ning game a nd m y ti cket was for Leppi ngs

  m u c h of the pitch,     but it was a ve r y u n c o m f o r t a b l e situation.        The

  was no room to m ov e a nd I remember,            at one time,      b ei ng s qu as ed

  grounds   before and since but had never e x pe ri e n c e d a n y th i ng quite

  like the pressure that was           created in this crowd at Hills bo ro ug h.

  I wonder,    now, wh e th er    the te rracing at the Le pp in gs Lane end of

  H i l l s b or o ug h is som^howi sus ce pt ib le to re taining the      pressure     creat

  in crowd build-up.

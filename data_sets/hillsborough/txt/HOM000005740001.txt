PART II OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT 1989 :
TERMINATION ORDERS : ISSUE OF CIRCULAR TO THE COURTS


1.     This submission seeks the Home Office Secretary's agreement
to issue a Home Office circular to the Courts               (draft attached)
outlining      the   procedures       to   be   adopted    for    considering
applications     for termination of restriction orders made under
Part II of the Football Spectators Act 1989.              The draft circular
has   been   cleared   with   legal    advisers,   the    Lord   Chancellor's
Department,     the Magistrates'Association,        the Justices'     Clerks'
Society and ACPO.


Background : Restriction Orders


2.     Part II of the Football Spectators Act 1989 gives the courts
the power to impose a restriction order on a person convicted of
a football-related offence.       The order requires him to report to
a police station in England or Wales to prevent his attendance
at    designated football matches being played abroad.              The court
may make a restriction order only if it is satisfied that this
would help to prevent violence and disorder at, or in connection
with, designated football matches.


3.     The 1989 Act also enables the courts to impose a restriction
order on a person convicted of an offence outside England and
Wales corresponding to a football-related offence as specified
in the Act.


4.      The central administration of restriction orders is carried
out by the Football Spectators Restriction Orders Authority (ROA)
which maintains records of those subject to restriction orders,
issues     notices       of    requirement              to    report    and     considers
applications for exemption from the requirement to report.


Termination Orders


5.      Restriction Orders must be for a period of 2 years                            (or 5
years     if    a   period    of   immediate            imprisonment       is   imposed).
Hi^ver,        a person subject to a restriction order may apply to a
court to have the order set aside after the order has had effect
for 12 months.       In considering such an application the court must
have regard to the applicant's character, his conduct since the
order was made,          the nature of              the offence    which    lead   to the
restriction order and any other circumstances of the case.


6.      One of the main objects of the draft circular is to ensure
that the ROA is informed of any application for a termination
order so that it may assist the court by providing information
about    the applicant's       record           since    the restriction order was
made.     The circular also reminds courts of the requirement to
provide a successful applicant with a copy of the termination
order    and     gives   advice    on         levying     costs.       Courts   are   also
requested to notify the ROA of any termination orders made.


Timing


7.      The first restriction orders were made on 8 May 1990.                           If
Ministers       are content we will                 arrange   for the circular to be
issued on 7 May.


8.      May we proceed to issue the Circular, as proposed?

Dear Sir/Madam


HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 34/1991
PART II OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT 1989 : TERMINATION ORDERS


1.   This    Circular describes          the procedure    to be adopted         for
     considering      the    termination      of   restriction     orders      made
     under    Part   II     of   the    Football   Spectators    Act    1989    and
     should be read in conjunction with Circular 31/1990                       (the
     role of the courts) and Circular 32/1990               (the role of the
     police) which introduced the restriction order provisions
     of the Act.


2.   A person    subject         to a restriction      order may   apply       to a
     court to have that order set aside.                The application must
     be made to the court which originally made the order (or in
     the case of a magistrates'              court a court acting        for the
     same petty      sessions area)        and may only be made once            the
     order has had effect              for one year.    The new restriction
     order provisions came into force on 24 April 1990 and the
     first orders were made on 8 May 1990.
Section 17(2)        of the Act requires that when considering
an application for termination of a restriction order the
court must have regard to the applicant's character, his or
her conduct         since the order was made,             the nature of the
offence which led to the restriction order and any other
circumstances of the case.                The Enforcing Authority            (the
Football      Spectators       Restriction Orders         Authority),    which
will    accept receipt of papers when an application                     for a
termination order is made, will be able to assist the court
on some of these issues.


Where an application for the termination of a restriction
order is made to a magistrates'                 court the Justices'      Clerk
is requested to notify the Enforcing Authority of the date
when an application for termination of a restriction order
is to be heard so that the evidence required by section
17(2) of the Act can be made available to the court.


Applications for termination of a restriction order to the
Crown     Court       should     follow     a     similar       procedure     to
applications for removal of driving disqualifications.                        An
amendment to Section 10 of the Crown Court Manual will be
issued in due course.


Correspondence         with    the   Enforcing      Authority      should     be
addressed to :


        The Football Spectators Restriction Orders Authority
        Tintagel House
        Albert Embankment
        London
        SE1 7TT


A court terminating a restriction order is obliged under
section      18 of the Act to hand a copy of the termination
order to the person to whom the order relates or,                       in the
case of a person serving a term of imprisonment, to send a
copy of      the termination order to the prison Governor.                     A
copy    of    the    termination     order       should    be    sent   to   the
Enforcing       Authority       as    soon     as    reasonably      practicable.
Specimen copies of termination orders are attached to this
circular and a master card will be issued to Crown Court
Centres in due course.


The court may order the applicant to pay all or part of the
costs of the application and,                  in the event that the court
refuses the application, no further application may be made
for a period of six months following the date of refusal.


Any enquiries about this circular should be made to Vivien
Pugh     (071   273     2698)    or    Brian        Mennell   (071    273    3390).
Enquiries       concerning           the     operation        of     Crown   Court
procedures should be made to Mr A Clarke at the Criminal
Operations Branch, Lord Chancellors' Department, Trevelyan
House,    30    Great    Peter       Street,    London    SW1P     2BY   (071   210
8724).

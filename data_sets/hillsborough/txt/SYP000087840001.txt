            On photograph marked __ p/21 I am reasonably certain that my son Colin
   W                 feoFTs*                                              ---------
C A i       ASHCROFT is on the photograph at the front of one of the pens, on a

            second photograph               10/36A,      I feel there is a possibility that my son

            Colin is on that photograph.                  Both photographs have been marked with
£Vi
            coloured dots.



            On the other photographs and video                       I have been shown I have been

            unable to recognise Col in.

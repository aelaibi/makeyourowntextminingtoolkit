    3reenway has confirmed the Dr. Naidoo
and PC. Jenkinson are both available for
Tuesday, 21-12-93 (and also 22.12.93 if required).

a letter confirming the details would be helpful.

(061 7360160)

His client is Father James Morrow and he would like
to clarify the following points:-

1.   Will he be able to ask questions of the witnesses?
     He feels he is an interested party in that
     he is involved in a case in the Divisional Court
     regarding a summons against Dr. Howe for causing      Tony
     Bland's death.

2.   He would like to know if Dr. Howe will be attending
     the inquest.


He said he would ring again on Monday morning if
he had not heard from us.

She has been in contact with the South

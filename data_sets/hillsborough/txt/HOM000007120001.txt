          We have        spoken          in the House about               the costs    incurred by        the   West
Midlands police in their inquiries following the Hillsborough disaster.                                          You
and other West Midlands MPs are understandably anxious that these should not
fall on the West Midlands police authority.


          It     seems     to       me    quite         clear     that,   wherever     the    costs   fall,     they
should not and do not fall to the West Midlands.                               The Chief Constable of the
West Midlands was initially invited by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
to review all aspects                of     the         police    operation.     And    subsequently       it was
agreed    that    the results of these inquiries should be made available to the
public inquiry which I announced on 24 April to be conducted by Lord Justice
Taylor.



          It will        take a while               to sort out the precise mechanics of how the
West Midlands police should be reimbursed.                                But I can guarantee now that at
the end of the day no additional costs will be borne by the West Midlands.

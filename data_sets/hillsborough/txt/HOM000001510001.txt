DATED:     290489



             On    Saturday          15.4.89           (1 5 0 4 8 9 )    I travelled            to H i l l s b o r o u g h       to s u p p o r t

             Liverpool            F.C.       We   travelled              by    ca r    and w ith me          were

                                                                                    and my      brother

             We    travelled          in                s car        and      parked       in a s i d e      street         near       to    the

             ground.           We    arrived           at a b o u t      11.0       am and went            straight         to    the       ground.

             None      of    us     had     tickets           a n d we     bought         tickets         f r o m a tout.            We     paid

             £20     each      for        the   tickets            and   they were            for    the    Spion       Kop.         I have        been

             to     the g r o u n d        a number           of    times       and we        knew    that we w a n t e d            to go       to

             the W e s t       Stand.           Although            we   had       the w r o n g     tickets we           k n e w we w o u l d

             be a b l e      to get         in,    or      at      least      we    intended         to    tr y    to get        in,      with       the

              Liverpool            supporters.

             The       ticket        tout       that     we     bought        the      tickets       off w a s       in the        Penistone

              T h i s m a n wa s          a w h i t e male,             about      late    2 0 ’s e a r l y       3 0 ’s a b o u t     5 ’8"     -

              aga i n .

              Prior       to      the m a t c h w e        went         to a puo,         the W h i t o      Horse,       we     hsd      tried       to

get     in a n o t h e r     pub    but        had    not       been       alloowed          in w i t h o u t    being          a

member,        or    so w e     were       told.           In    the W h i t e         Hor3e       it w a s     mainly

Liverpool           supporters            and    a few          Forest        supporters.                 There wasn't               any

trouble        between        the       fans.

At     about    half       past        twelve        the    pub        became          packed      bu t    I d i d n ’t n o t i c e

anyone        drinking         heavily           or    d e l i b e r a t e l y g e t t i n g dr u n k .       Myself,               I had

three      pints      an d     then       the p u b         ra n      out    or g l a s s e s       and     I had a bottle                  of

Lager .

We     left    the    pub      at      a b o u t 1.0        p m or         just after.              We w a l k e d to          tne

entrance        o West         Stand        in L e p p i n g s          Lane, t h is        was     after       we    had       caken

ou r    coats       back     to    ou r     car.       On       th e w a y        to     the W e s t      Stand we           h ad

called        in at     a Police            kiosk      by       the        South       Stand      and     a s k e d if        we c o u l d

g et    in    the     Liverpool           end.        We     were          told     to a s k      a Steward.             T he       person

we     spoke     to c o m m e n t e d       that      he w a s n ’t on d u t y               and    I     don    tthink             he w a s

wearing        any part           of     his     uniform.              He w a s        in c a s u a l     clothes.              I might

be     able    to     recognise           him again,                 but    I c a n ’t d e s c r i b e      him      except           to

say      he w a s     white,        late       2 0 's w i t h         dark        nair.

At     th e W e s t    Stand        we    spoke       to     a Steward who was                      standing with               a

 Police        Oficer       in u n i f o r m .         The       Steward           was      a white male             about          45-50,

 straight           greying        ha ir,       s l i m build.              We     explained         that w e         were

 Liverpool           Supporters           and        that       we    had     tickets         for    the N o t t i n g h a m

 Forest        end.

 Last      year      when     I attended              the       same       match       I a g a i n ha d       tickets          for     the

 Nottingham           Forest        end and           the       Police        put      us    in a s t a n d i n g        terrace

 between        Spion        Kop    and        the    North          St a n d .    They      t o l d us     that      the      pen was

 for     Liverpool           Supporters              but    they        also       put      Nottingham          Forest

 supporters           in t h e       same       pen    and       the       Police         came    and     formed         a    line

 between        us    to a v o i d        problems.

 The      Steward       se nt      us     to    the    far         left      turnstile,           marked        on    the m a p        as
LOWE                                            DAVID            PETER                                                                       PAGE


the       turnstiles             by       the       letters           A/G.         We    were         refused          entry       at     t ha t

turnstile               a n d we      went       back           to    th e    same       Steward            and       he    sent     us    to       the

far       right         turnstile.              He       commented            that        the       operator           tnere       had oeen

letting            people        in.

We      gained          entry        at    the       turnstile.               The       operator            took       our       tickets        and

then we went                  through           the        tunnel        into       Pen        4    (Four).

Over        the     past        5 years             or     so    I have           been       to     the     Hillsborough                Stadium           6

through            the        tunnel.           I was          not      aware           of    any     ocher a cc es s             r o utes.

W h e n we         got        into the          Pen       4     (Four)        t h er e       was     quite        a few people               in       them

but        it w as        not     packed.                Th e    Spion        Kop        end       seemed        to be       fairly        full

bu t      there were             very          few people              in     the        North        and      South        Stands.            inis

was        at      about      1.45        pm

We        chose      a position                to    the        rear     and        left       of     centre          of    the    pen.         At

about           2.30      pin the         Pen       started           to b e c o m e          full,       a nd    the       supporters

started             swaying, and                we       had     to     go w i t h           them.

At        the      same       time we       were          being         pushed           forward          a n d we         came    up     against

a barrier.                The        pressure             from behind               continued             to     increase           and

an d                     left        us   because                        was        frightened              and       I sent        them       to

     he    front         to     try a n d        get       out       onto         the    p it c h ,     through            the     gate     tnere.

                                      and       I ducked             under         the       barrier        and       that       took     the

 pressure               off     us    for       about          five minutes.                   We were           then       only        2 or      3

 steps          from      the        front       and we          again            began       to ge t       crushed          and     c o u l d n ’t

 move.             By    this        time       I realized              t ha t      we       had     to ge t      out        for    our     ow n

    s af e t y .        Other        fans       had       started            to    climb        the     fence         to g e t      out     and       at

    first       the      Police           tried          to p r e v e n t         them,       by     shouting          at     them.       Whilst

    the    people          at    the       front were                 concerned              for      t heir      safety          there were

    people         at    the b a c k        s t il l          chanting            and    obviously             t h e y d i d n ’t r e a l i z e

    how    bad       it w a s .

On       top    of    the       fence      were      some         supporters              who were              lifting            ou t    the

young          lad    and       the      gi r l s . _________ w a s            frightened                 and     crying           that        she

had       to g et         out.        I shouted            to     th e       people        on    to p of          the    fence            and       3he

was       lifted          out     over      the      side        fence        into        Pen     5.        I had       go t       separated

from|                       land a l t h o u g h     he w a s         only         a yard        away        from me           I c o u l d n ’t

see       him       because         of     the w a y       we     were        packed           in.        I kept        shouting               to h i m

if he w a s           alright            and    he    said        h e w a s n ’t.          After          what       seemed         like        a

l on g     time       I saw                       being          lifted        out.        He    got        stuck       on     the        fence

but       then       go t     safely        onto      the        pitch        a r e a.

Although             I was         close        enough       to      touch          the    fence,           I was       not        crushed

against             it.     There        were     other          people         r o u n d me,          but      I c o u l d n ’t m o v e             and

when       someone            tried        to    p u li    me     out        the     crowd was              pactced so             t ignt j.y

around me             that         I c o u l d n ’t be           lifted.             Due       to p e o p l e        trying          to    lift m e

an d      also       because          of    trying          to    push        back        against           the      fen c e,       my hands

turned           yellow.

After          some        time,      about        3.15        - 3.20          pm    I realized                 that    behind            me    the

crowd          had     thinned           slightly           and      I forced my                way        up    the    terrace            an d      was

helped           over        the    fence         into      Pen      5,      w h ic h was         initially             emp ty .

As       a result            of    the     incident            I suffered              a bruised                spine       and      shock.           I

                                   and     I joined             up   on       the    pitch        and we             left    as      soon       as we

 could.

 I did          not       see     any     person          in P e n       4    (Four)       that           I can d e f i n i t e l y             say

          Liverpool       Supporters        t h at    is,   and    th e w h o l e   event   seemed    to be      a   lot

          better    organised.           I feel      that   this    is a n    important      factor      that

          contributed         to   the    disaster.

          I think       the   Liverpool      fans      should      again     have    b ee n put   into    the    Spion

          Kop    end.

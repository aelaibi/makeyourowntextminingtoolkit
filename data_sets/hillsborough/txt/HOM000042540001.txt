DRAFT REPLY TO DAVID CLELLAND, M .P.




Dear Mr. Clelland,


     Thank you for your letter of 5th February.

     I think the proposal in favour of seating at football grounds
has been very fully presented in Lord Justice Taylor's Report, and
there is nothing I can add to it.

      In view of the vital importance of improving sa fe ty , it is
clear that the configurations of football stadia must be considered
as a whole, including in g r e ss , e g r e s s , accommodation, emergency
provisions and so on.       All th ese matters were v e r y carefully
considered during the Inquiry.

                           Yours sin cerely,

    Dear Professor Maundor

    I am enclosing a copy of an Early day Motion which I have originated. Do you
    not agree that barriers such as those described in it - perhaps modified to
    creatc individual standing places - would be able to prevent crowd waves up
    and down the terraces?

    I do not believe that barriers like this would need to be as substantial as
    the current short barriers because only a single row of spectators would be
    exerting pressure on each one. Thus they would be quicker to install than
    seaLs, and thus avoiding the possibility of another Hillsborough in the period
    before seats can be installed.

    Surely this would answer the problems without denying the pleasure o£ those
    who enjoy standing on the terraces, and without bankrupting Lhe clubs by the
    cosl of t.heir installation. I would welcome your considered opinion on this
    suggestion.               .... .                    .. .

    Yours sincerely

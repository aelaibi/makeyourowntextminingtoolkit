unaware               of      how        or       why     it          had               happened.

The        serial             Had        regrouped                    on            the          halfway                          line          and       as         the         ground                   becam

crowds               had      left           and    those                  that              remained                         were              quiet             and         stunned.

We        were        then          directed, back                             to          the          ground                     for          a    debriefing.                              The

numbers               dead          were          now     rumoured                           to         be          around                  thirty.                     By        the         time                 we

explanation                of    what         had       caused        it

seemed       to       be    taking            charge        of       the    situation               though          in     view       of       the     way

things       developed                 this      was      understandable.                          There       was a        problem                with

radio       conimunications                         in    that       only       Sgts and above                 had radios              so          there

was    an    obvious             difficulty               in        directing              officers         to      specific              points.

When    confronted                   with      that       situation              remaining              in a        serial        is

difficult             if    not        impossible               as    all       ones        attention            is      directed              to

assisting             as    best        as     you       can,        there       was        no     time     to      be     spent          on

looking          around          for      the       rest        of    your       serial.

In    fact       on    the       day      I did          no t       see    anay        other        member          of     my    serial

began       to    regroup.

The    public          address            system          was        either          under        utilised            or    ineffective                    as

it    was    impossible                 to     hear       it,when               it     would        seem       to     have       been          a

directing             the       public.             The    only           times        1    recall        it     being          used       was

prior       to    the       incident             and      to        inform       supporters               that        the       game       was

abandoned.

I    cannot       recall             seeing         a    steward           at    any        time       during         the       incident.

 ALM m m       POLICE CONSTABLE 190»W00DSEJfflS POLICE STATION.


 Sir,
        On Saturday 15th April 1989 I commenced duty at 8.^5am at Woodseats Police Station,

for deployment to Hillsborough for the F.A.Cup semi final.We arrived at the ground

 at 9*30am for a briefing in the North Stand at 10.00am•Foilowing the briefing we

 were deployed to the Penistone Road enclosure where we were given a further briefing

 by Supt.Greenwood and Inspector Booth regarding potential problems on both the

 turnstiles and on the Kop.I was then deployed as part of Serial 9 with responsibilities

for turnstiles number    kj>   and M+.We remained at those turnstiles searching Nottingham

Forest supporters entering the ground,and preventing dangerous articles being taken in.

At that time we were constantly supervised by the serial Sgttwho remained at the

turnstiles throughout,and periodically by both the Inspector and Superintendent.

 We remained at the Penistone Road end of the ground until around 3.10pm.Shortly prior

to leaving that location I heard a message passed via the tannoy system,asking spectators

to leave the pitchtwe were then told by Sgt Jessop to leave the turnstiles,and as we

did so several supporters jumped over the turnstiles,and the groundstaff were instructed

to close the gates to prevent further problems.We then followed the Sgt around the back

 of the kop,through the crowd to the perimeter fence and we were allowed through a gate

 directly behind the goals.The crowd was not densly packed at this end of the ground

 and we were able to walk easily to that fencing(The queueing at the        turnstiles had been

 light throughout the morning with numbers building only to around a maximum of twenty,

 though there was a constant flow of Nottingham supporters from early morning.)

On entering the playing area I could see there were a number of supporters on the pitch

 and that others were climbing over the fencing and others were being pulled into

 the seats behind the terracing.At first I thought we had been taken from the turnstiles

because of fighting - problems had been anticipated at that end of the ground with

Liverpool fans being amongst the Forest supporters,-but on entering the ground I

 formed the opinion that it was merely a pitch invasion.The Nottingham Forest supporters

must have thought the same as there were chants of abuse directed at the Liverpool fans

and also chants of "off the pitch".In view of the numbers on the pitch I thought-it would

take some time to clear the playing area and the start of the game had obviously been

delayed.There seemed less urgency to get to that end of the ground in view of the situation
 and most of the serial slowed to anormal walking pace across the pitch.At that stag©

.X^ras           of the nature of the incident or ’tha^lfae' game had acfeialy. startedfan#

 then beeirStopped .We crossed the pitch scad on getting' -'towards ^ke ~Lapping®. :|^ua® end >

got to? the fencing     X   could then see that those supporters nearest to th© fencing'were-                          .^

being erushed against the mesh.I realised immediately that quite a large number were

 already apparently dead.I immediately clinfeeidl on the'^fencing and began akouting far’

 pefbple to move backwards,but thejr Were just shouting back**bviottsly unaware of th©                         ■       "

seriousness of the situation#A gate directly behind the goal was opened and a crowd of

 police officers were around that gate pulling people through.I realised,because of the

density of both the crowd and polioe around that gate that I would be unable to get onto

 the terracing to assist.1 went to the next gate along towards the South Stand,which                                       /

was opened,and there was a steady stream of supporters emerging from that gate which

 opens into the southern section of the Leppings Lane terrace.After the pressure of fans

 had been reduced a number of officers .                      were able to get onto the terracing and make

 there way to the centre section.There was a problem around the gate with uninjurred people

trying to get out,thus impeding the removal of dead and injurred persons from the centre

section.I remained close to that gate along with a number of other officers leaving

a corridor along the front of the                      terracing to allow the removal of injurred

persons over the fencing and out onto the pitch .The crowd in this section was

 very agitated,some bordering on hysterical,as apparently dead persons were removed

from the centre section.As the movement of bodies stopped I.left the terracing and

 went back onto the pitch.By this time most of the dead and injurred had been removed

 from the terracing,and there were a large number, of persons" lying out on the pitch.
                                                                                        m
Some were obviously dead and had their heads covered with coafcs etc. hose that were

 injurred were being seen to;each person seemed to have several around them assisting.

 Many of the injurred were recieving mouth to month and heart massage .There was one-

 ambulance on the pitchfand ;I expected others to follow,though they dietat^he removal

The serial had regrouped on the halfway line and as the ground became empty we were

 directed to resume the duties we had been given,which was supervision of bus queues*

 This was unneccessary as most of the crowds had left and those that remained were

 quiet and stunned*
 We were then directed back to the ground for a debriefing.The numbers dead were now

 rumoured to be around thirty.By the time we left the ground that numbei? had become

 seventy.There was still no explanation of what had caused it.

 We returned to Woodseats and went off duty at 7*;l5p®»

 The mood of the Liverpool supporters ranged from anger to a stunned silence*there 3

 On getting to the Leppings Lane^of the ground and during the period I remained there

 was little if any form of command,no one seemed tcs be taking: charge of the situation

 In fact on the day I did not see any other member of my serial between reaching the
<■-


Leppings Lane end of the ground and being formed into a cordon on the halfway line#It

was only then that serials began to regroup#

The public address system was either under utilised or ineffective as it was impossible

to hear it,when it would seem to have been a suitable method of communications,for both

police officers and for directing the public.The only times I recall it being used was

 prior to the incident and to inform supporters that the game was abbandoned*

I cannot recall seeing a steward at any time during the incident.

 Some supporters were extremely helpfull and doing all they could to assist the injurred

 and remove bodies.Others however were a hinderence wanting to voice their opinions

 on ticket allocation and the uselessness of the police,and in the extreme wanting to

fight with the Forest supporters.

I was not involved in the removal of any dead persons,only one injurred youth and

I can recall little regarding his description,other than being a white male,early twenties
                                    A

 with dark hair.

I can only describe my feelings on the day as deep shock,infact the scale of the

disaster really did'nt start to sinkin until the following day.I don't think anyone

 on the serial was prepared for whatwe were faced with on our arrival at that end of the

 ground,and the shock at seeing suchdeaths when we thought we were dealing with a pitch

 invasion cannot be described.However,no ammount of preparation or training could

 prepare you for what we were confronted with on that day,and the degree of shock which some

 officers appeared to feel varied from panic to stunned silence.

    Andrew:


    A few more thoughts on Eastwood.

    1.   For barriers of more than two spans, say Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4 the
    test seems to have gone as follows:

               i.     load spans 1   and 2 (three cycles),

               ii.    load spans 2   and 3 (three cycles),

               iii.   load spans 3   and 4 (three cycles).

    This is reasonable so far as loading goes, but incomplete as
    regards measurements of deflections. His records show only one
    deflection measured for each two-span loading, which means that
    our span remained unmeasured during the sequence. If that
    deflection (or recovery) had been unusual, it would not have been
    noticed.

    2.   In 1988, barriers 124A, 133, 136, 137 and 144 deflected
    considerably more than the average. No. 133 was a particular
    offender.  Curiously, its recovery was perfect - but its
    deflection actually increased in successive cycles of loading, a
    clear danger signal.  In the event, extensive corrosion was
    spotted (presumably visually, so what was the value of the
    test?), and the rail was replaced. The rail on No. 144 was also
    replaced.  But nothing seems to have been done about the others.

   3.    As regards No. 124A, the 1988 record shows a residual
   defl    ion of 17mm after the three cycles of loading, compared
 * wit i    initial deflection under load of 29mm. This is a very
         cecovery.
    4.     HSE cannot find the 1983 test record.             They are still
    s ear rM-ng.

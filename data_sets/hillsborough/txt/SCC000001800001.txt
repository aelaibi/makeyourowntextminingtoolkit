DRAFT REPORT TO POLICY COMMITTEE EMERGENCY PEACE TIME PLANNING - UPDATE OF
RESPONSE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

I prepared a draft report to Policy Committee in response to Councillor Betts'
request that this matter should be reported to Members. It was agreed at the
time that the report should not be presented until after the legal proceedings
and inquest were concluded. As there has always been some legal proceedings
in progress and continue to be so, at this present date a cumulative report
has never been presented, although individual departments have reported their
response to the Hillsborough Disaster and action taken.

The position is now that the Emergency Peacetime Plan is about to be updated
again and a revised draft circulated to interested parties.  I have therefore
suggested to           that we should use the fact that the funding for
Emergency Peacetime Planning is undergoing a review, the Sheffield Airport
Emergency Peacetime Plan and the fact that departments are taking action in
relation to Emergency Peacetime Planning as a trigger to present a general
report to Policy which covers these areas.

We are therefore in the process of updating a draft revised plan which will be
circulated to relevant people shortly with a view to circulating a final
version at the beginning of September, we should then be looking at
presenting a report to Policy Committee which covers funding the airport and
departmental initiatives, together with a summary of the way that Emergency
Planning is organised in the Council to Policy towards the end of the year.

                         DRAFT REPORT TO POLICY COMMITTEE




    EMERGENCY PEACETIME PLAN - Update of Response to Hillsborough Disaster

                                 15th April, 1989


Introduction


Sheffield City Council have an Emergency Peace Time Plan to respond to major

peacetime emergencies.



The Emergency Peacetime Plan was brought into operation in response to the

Hillsborough Disaster on 15th April,    1989.


A report to the Policy Committee on 26th September,      1989, entitled

"Hillsborough Disaster - Overview and Proposals for the Future", dealt with a

number of issues, but included reports from the Director of Social Services,
Director of Libraries and Information and Director of Health and Consumer
Services on the action taken in their Department’s response to the Disaster.


This report outlines the basis of the Emergency Peacetime Plan and sets out
the issues identified at the time of the Disaster and the action taken.


It should also be said that during the investigation after the Hillsborough

Disaster, West Midlands Police confirmed that no complaints had been received
by them regarding the Council’s response after the Disaster,       rather to the
contrary,   they had heard nothing but praise for Social Services staff in

p a r ticular.


Outline of Basis of Emergency Peacetime Plan



The City C o u n c i l ’s Plan is supplementary to the Police Scheme for Major
Disasters and although it will usually be brought into operation at the

discretion of the senior police officers concerned, action can also be

instigated by any senior departmental officer.        A major disaster in peacetime

may occur in many forms and so requires definition to distinguish it from the

routine incidents that are the day to day sole concern of the emergency

services.    A the major peacetime emergency is therefore defined in the plan as
                                       - 2 -



"any disaster or serious disruption of life arising with little or no warning,

causing or threatening death or serious injury to, or rendering homeless,          such
numbers of persons especially those which can be dealt with by the local

authority and public services operating under normal procedures and which

calls for special mobilisation and organisation of both services."


The core plan identifies a number of departments and outlines their roles and

responsibilities in a major peacetime emergency situation.         The relevant

departments are required to draw up and maintain departmental plans to meet
the roles and responsibilities placed upon them.



Although the plan is updated in terms of personnel changes on a periodic
basis,   it has been considered appropriate to adopt arrangements whereby a
formal revision of the plan undertaken, at least every alternate year.            To

this end arrangements were put in hand on 18th January,        1989 to undertake a

further revision of the Council’s Emergency Plan with a view to the
circulation of a revised version during the Spring of 1989.         These

arrangements were overtaken by the Disaster at Hillsborough on 15th April,

1989 and the completion of a revised document was set back in order to take
account and incorporate in the plan,    issues and lessons learned from the
Hillsborough Disaster.

This work is in addition to the normal meetings that take place involving
South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority,        South Yorkshire Police and

Sheffield City Council to reconsider the Plan in the light of any warning of

possible emergency or in response to a particular issue.


The revised Emergency Core Plan was distributed in December 1989 and updated

in October,   1990,   i.e. telephone numbers and names were updated.      Individual

departments have updated their departmental plans.

RE:    HILLSBOROUGH FINAL REPORT BACK

Notwithstanding that   tactically it is felt appropriate, by all of us that the
final report back on   the City C o u n ci l ’s response to the Hillsborough Disaster
should await the end   of the Inquest I nevertheless think that it would be
appropriate to start   some work on this matter now.

In particular, to start to draw together all the practical and other issues
that have been examined in the light of what happened on Saturday, 15th April
1989 and to produce a comprehensive report drawing together in a simple,
factual fashion what lessons the Council had learnt in terms of the operation
of its various areas and how these have led to amendments in its procedures
while at the same time distinguishing between a disaster plan and a peacetime
emergency plan given that whilst the two are not totally separate, the scale
and nature of the incident will determine which one will be put into operation
notwithstanding that the initial stages of both have some degree of
similarity.

            The group started by brainstorming a series of issues that members felt
            should be component parts of any Disaster Plan.  These are listed as
            follows: ; ",        ~v:~;."       “T"".—       .■........... .......   ’’

            1       The need to distinguish clearly between a Disaster Plan and an Emergency
                    Peace Time Plan.                                          -       ■ -

            2       To establish and clarify F&CSs role in Disaster Planning.

( j         4       To identify key leaders wit h i n F&CS and achain of key people            who   would
                     be involved in Disaster Planning.

                6   To clarify the role of the local leader in respect to the staffing
                     control mechanisms and management of a locally based disaster response
                    ..from F&CS staff.                .■

                7   To consider the on-going training needs of staff in F&CS to orientate
                     them towards a disaster response.

                8   To consider the leadership elements requited in any response to a public
                     disaster.  To consider the relationship of the line manager and the
                     local control leader and the public and personal pressures on such
                     staff.

                9   To be clear about the co13arasi.cati.0 a systems necessary to respond to

            10      To consider the admin back up to Disaster Planning.

•1INADE
         11    To consider the F&CS recording systems.

         12    How to ensure that contingency and the maintenance                  ins 2 in$ivt.
               services occurs parallel to the disaster.

         13    Tc be clear of the work involved in the decision snaking power interfac.-
               to ensure that bureaucratic systems can be overridden at times of
               disaster so that political and corporate, support w i t h resources is
               available immediately and that managerial space can be created
               immediately in response to the crisis.

         14    To consider the long term relationship with the Police and to ensure
               that there is role complementality in the event of a disaster.

         15    To be aware of potential conflict zones during a disaster and that the
               qualities of both tact and diplomacy will need an acute expression.

         16   To recognise   the strong feeling components around a response to a
              disaster and   the feelings of ownership of actions - to clarify the
              personal and professional boundaries.

         17   To identify the role and tasks of F&CS at different stages of a disaste( j
              from the initial phase one response work, to the phase two immediate
              aftermath, and phase three longer term consequences of a disaster.   .

               The group brainstormed the key tasks that they considered F&CS should be
              •involved w it h around a disaster.

              To   focus thinking the group considered the.following d i m e n s i o n s i

              1     Work in respect to the dead

              2     Work in respect of survivors                                            - - r . . l7 ■ :?z.

              The range of tasks were seen as followst-

               1   F&CS along w i t h other agencies, would act as a link w o r k e r involved
                    in the contact of families and carers of the dead.
                                         /
               2   There were a series of work tasks involved -with personal pairing of
                   helpers,   and another to undertake support work.
                                 .. .

               3   There was a need for staff to be available to act as comfort runners
                   - these are staff who would seek to meet individual and group needs
                   by providing whatever resources were felt to be necessary at the
                   time eg blankets, food, etc.

               4   There was a clear need to establish an information base and for                                F&CS
                    to take a lead role in this in respect of families and carers.                                The
                    information base is seen of several kinds.

                    (a)    Recording information concerning victims and survivors.

                    (b)    Recording details of helpers.

                   r'(e)   Having clear information about key places for further action.

The group went on to discuss a model of'response to a disaster.  Phase
one would be activities within F&CS involving an initial response to the
disaster, this would involve a range of key staff in specific activities
over a defined period of time.  The period of time would vary according
to the disaster but would be characterised by being no longer than three
days.  Phase two would be work undertaken by an established special ; "
support team.                                    J'-"; ,

Phase One Work                                                                       ,: ,...

The group believed that in all d i s a st e r s 'the Police were the initial
agency to, respond.  It was important therefore that there were clearly
agreed policies and working practices e s t a b l i s h e d between the P,pl.i,cs,,and
F&CS.  The Police would initiate a response into F&CS.            A suggestion is
that this response is to the City Wide Alarm Service.            This a manned 24
hour communications section and they would hold the key documentation in
respect to contact points and processes f” ir F&CS Disaster Planning and
emergency planning.   Initial contact points within F&CS are assumed to be
as follows - Director and/or Assistant Directors and/or Divisional
Managers.   A proposal was made that F&CS should have a group of
approximately 10 staff who act as a designated disaster group.             These,
should be sufficiently senior F&CS staff, they should over a period of
time undertake training, they should meet at regular intervals to update
themselves, they will act as the repositories for all information
gathered nationally concerning disaster plans, attend conferences etc.
Whilst this group would be people who would develop their knowledge
concerning responses to disasters they would slso be the group  ho vculd
have knowledge -?f individual staff members. In response to a disaster
members of this group would contact staff throughout the Department to
attend a predetermined''disaster point.

Staff to be contacted would most instances include the Principal Hospital
Social Workers and also a administrative key worker staff.

The members of the designated disaster group called to a disaster site
would meet other staff and trigger off the initial disaster response work
on sites agreed w i t h the Police and other agencies.  In addition to the
F&CS manpower response at the site of the disaster the directorate staff
wo u l d immediately initiate agreement with both political and. corporate
members of the City Council to ensure that ringfenced resources were
released immediately .and managerial space was created to enable the
designated disaster groups to undertake action with confidence quickly.
Over the initial two days of a disaster members of the directorate and
senior managers have a responsibility to establish a support team to be
in place by the end of day three.

Phase Two

The special support team should be established with a seconded person
w i t h sufficient managerial status to be able to access resources outside
the normal lines of the operational systems.     An agreed number of staff
should be pulled into the support team and this should include social      -
work, residential, day care, home care and administrative staff as
required.     The support team should be ringfenced and protected in respect
to pay, conditions of work and tasks to be undertaken.

Phase Three          ... •    ..

Would be work involved with the support of the support           team, the ° r-.
establishments of time limits to support t e a m w o r k and the gradual
transfer of work from the support team back into the mainstream.         ".5


Other wo r k w i l l focus on the maintenance of mainline systems throughout
the m e d i u m and long term period of the disaster.

Further work W o u l d be involved at a senior level and cascaded throughout
the organisation concerning the briefing of staff.                      '
                              '                        '   .   ...

It is advisable for F&CS to consider the availability of a counselling
access point to provide confidential- help and support to the individuals
who have been involved in the phase one work of a disaster, the support
team and in follow through work.   This should be a commitment over a long
period of time.

            HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
            COUNCIL'S EMERGENCY ARRANGEMENTS



            As you know the Leader has mentioned several times
            that there are outstanding isses which need to be
            reviewed and reported back to Committee.   I am
            now clear that these relate to the operation of our
            own emergency services at the time of the disaster.

            I understand that various inadequacies in our
            operational arrangements were demonstrated (e.g.
            lack of mobile telephones) and some confusion as to
            who was supposed to be doing what.   Some p oints
            were noted in a memorandum at the time from
                        I presume these matters were followed
            up ana improvements to our practices made.

            Would you please arrange for this matter to be
            reviewed and for a short report to be put to
            Committee outlining the issues and the action taken.

                         RE:   HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER REPORT                           L ^ \    (


                         I have previously spoken to you on a couple of occasions  about my   belief
                         that we still have not had a report to Committee about the way in which the
                         emergency procedures operated following the Hillsborough disaster.

                     Having checked back I can find no record of such a report   and  feel  that
                     given  the  time  lapse  since   the disaster,  and the fact that Committee
                     specifically requested that a report be produced, that one  should now be
                     provided as a matter of urgency.

                     I d o n ’t think     I have        to  spell  it   out but   if a further disaster or
                     emergency, of any kind, were to occur and procedures were               to be   found
                     inadequate,   which were           also found t o be wanting after Hillsborough, then
                     the Council w o u l d , q u i t e rightly, be the subject of considerable criticism.

                     I look forward to your reply indicating when the report will be produced.

referred to in the documentation.

Given the focus of the Conference I have sent copies of the papers to
             .n Family and Community Services and the Director of Health and
Consumer Services.    Both these departments were principally involved in
the aftermath of the Hillsborough Disaster.

                 First Report: April 1990                                               5 .5 S


The First Report of the Hillsborough Project was published in May-
1990.         It     is over 300 pages and presents the          findings    of   the
first         phase      of   the   research   into   the   aftermath      of     the
Hillsborough           Disaster.      Chapter   One   introduces     the   Project,
locates         the    work    in relation to    the   official     inquiries     and
considers          the need for in-depth research.         Chapter Two     examines
the     relationship          between   Crowd Safety and     Crowd    Control,     in
particular          the     predominance   given to     'hooliganism'     in media
coverage, academic research and political comment.                   Chapter Three
evaluates          the    two    reports of Lord    Justice    Taylor    and    their
impact.         Chapter Four is an extensive analysis of the role of the
med ia      at and after Hillsborough.          It considers the      creation     of
myths, the introduction of the 'Heysel Factor', doorstepping                      and
the use of explicit              descriptions and photographs.       Chapter Five,
entitl ed 'A Tragedy out of a Disaster', uses extensive interviews
w it h    bereaved        families,    social   workers,    ambulance     officers,
clergy,           the police and other agency workers to           establish     what
happe n e d         in the    immediate   aftermath    of   the    Disaster.       It
concludes          that lack of preparation and forward planning             by   the
authorities added considerable distress to the bereaved and                      that
the process of identification was inappropriate and                    insensitive.
Chapter           Six is an initial discussion of the          operation    of    the
Disaster         Fund concentrating on the issues of criteria used                for
financial          distribution      and the impact of     payments     on welfare
benefits.          The First Report is a unique document covering             issues
neg l e c t e d       by     the    other    inquiries.       It    contains       50
recommendations.             The Second Report will be published in November
1990.

HILLSBOROUGH AND AFTER: RESPONDING TO DISASTER




       Friday 14th September 1980 at

   Edge Hill College of Higher Education
       Oriskirk, Lancashire, L39 4QP.
Introduction
The Hillsborough Project is based at the Centre for Studies in Crime
and Social Justice at Edge Hill College of Higher Education.       The
four-person research team was commissioned to examine the immediate
aftermath of the Hillsborough Disaster, including the authorities'
responses and the impact of the media coverage, and to monitor and
evaluate the Home Office Inquiry.   The Police investigation and the
Coroner's Inquest.   In May 1990 the team published its First Report,
Hillsborough and After: The Liverpool Exper i e n c e . It is over 300
pages and presents the findings of the first phase of the project.
The main issues covered include: the relationship between crowd safety
and crowd control; and evaluation of the Taylor Inquiry; the role of
the media including the creation of myths, the introduction of the
 Heysel Factor', intrusive journalism and the use of explicit
photographs and descriptions.   A further section, entitled "Tragedy
out of a Disaster", uses extensive interviews with bereaved families,
social workers, ambulance officers, clergy, the police and other
agency workers to establish what happened in the immediate aftermath
of the Disaster.   It concludes that lack of preparation and forward ,
planning by the authorities added considerable and avoidable distress
to the bereaved and that the process of identification was both
inappropriate and insensitive.   The Report concludes with an initial
discussion of the Disaster Fund concentrating on the issues of
criteria used for distribution and the impact ofpayments on welfare
benefits.  Overall the Report makes 50 recommendations and it will be
followed by a Second Report in November 1990.

Mote s on P r n g r n i i a   and C o n t . r i h n t . o r s :

This one-day conference is the first opportunity to present the
initial findings of the Hillsborough Project to an informed audience
committed to the development of effective and efficient responses to
future disasters.   It should be of interest to all local government
agencies, non-statutory bodies and private institutions concerned with
developing thorough and sensitive policies inthe aftermath of
disaster.   On this occasion Hillsborough will be considered in terms
of the response of the emergency services, the setting up of the
temporary mortuary, the process of identification of the dead, the
interventions of the media and the role of the official inquiries and
investigations.

Phil Scraton is the Director of the Hillsborough Project, Head of the
Centre for Studies in Crime and Social Justice and the author of
several books on policing and the criminal justice process.   Sheila
Coleman, Ann Jenphrey and Pau la Skidnore are the Project's researchers
with broad knowledge of the criminal justice process and specialisms
in inquest procedures, the role of official inquiries, the welfare
system and the media.  John Ashton is Senior Lecturer in Community
Health at the University of Liverpool and a founder member of Medics
at Hillsborough.

Introduction

The Hillsborough Project is based at the Centre for Studies in Crime
and Social Justice at Edge Hill College of Higher Education.  The
four-person research team was commissioned to examine the immediate
aftermath of the Hillsborough Disaster, including the authorities'
responses and the impact of the media coverage, and to monitor and
evaluate the Home Office Inquiry.  The Police investigation and the
Coroner's Inquest.  In May 1990 the team published its First Report,

pages and presents the findings of the first phase of the project.
The main issues covered include: the relationship between crowd safety
and crowd control; and evaluation of the Taylor Inquiry; the role of
the media including the creation of myths, the introduction of the
 Heysel Factor', intrusive journalism and the use of explicit
photographs and descriptions.   A further section, entitled 'Tragedy
out of a Disaster', uses extensive interviews with bereaved families,
social workers, ambulance officers, clergy, the police and other
agency workers to establish what happened in the immediate aftermath
of the Disaster.   It concludes that lack of preparation and forward
planning by the authorities added considerable and avoidable distress
to the bereaved and that the process of identification was both
inappropriate and insensitive.   The Report concludes with an initial
discussion of the Disaster Fund concentrating on the issues of
criteria used for distribution and the impact ofpayments on welfare
benefits.  Overall the Report makes 50 recommendations and it will be
followed by a Second Report in November 1990.

Notes on Programme and C o n t r i b u t o r s :

This one-day conference is the first opportunity to present the
initial findings of the Hillsborough Project to an informed audience
committed to the development of effective and efficient responses to
future disasters.   It should be of interest to all local government
agencies, non-statutory bodies and private institutions concerned with
developing thorough and sensitive policies inthe aftermath of
disaster.   On this occasion Hillsborough will be considered in terms
of the response of the emergency services, the setting up of the
temporary mortuary, the process of identification of the dead, the
interventions of the media and the role of the official inquiries and
investigations.

Phil Scraton is the Director of the Hillsborough Project, Head of the
Centre for Studies in Crime and Social Justice and the author of
several books on policing and the criminal justice process.  Sheila
Colenan, Ann Jenphrey and Paula Skidnore are the Project's researchers
with broad knowledge of the criminal justice process and specialisms
in inquest procedures, the role of official inquiries, the welfare
system and the media.  John Ashton is Senior Lecturer in Community
Health at the University of Liverpool and a founder member of Medics
at Hillsborough.

(1)          My name is                                                       I have been employed by Sheffield

             City        Council       since          1966     in     a     variety             of    administrative                 posts.

             I     was    appointed              Principal          Assistant              in        the   Administration               and

             Legal       Department              in    1982.        My     duties          have        included      the         role    of

             Emergency         Liaison            Officer        for      major        peacetime             emergencies              since

             that time.



(2)          Section          138     of    the        Local      Government               Act        1972       enables         a    Local

             Authority to incur expenditure in taking action which is calculated

             to avert,         alleviate or erradicate the effects or potential effects

             of    an     emergency             or    disaster        involving            destruction             of,     or        danger

             to, life or property.



(3)          Sheffield         City- Council               has       had      an      emergency             peacetime            plan    at

             least       since       the        1960's,      although          there        is       no    statutory provision

             requiring          such        a    plan.         The       basis        of    Sheffield             City      Council's

             emergency peacetime                      plan and my role as Emergency Liaison Officer

             has    not       changed            significantly              since          1982.           The    demise         of     the

Continuation of statement of


         South       Yorkshire             County           Council           in 1986 and               the     establishment

         of    the        South          Yorkshire           Fire      and      Civil            Defence       Authority             were

         not     fundamental               to        the     operation           of        the     City       Council's           Plan.

         Obviously,             the        demise           of     the County          Council           meant       that         its

         functions             were        distributed to,                   for       example,           the       City        Council

         and     the          Joint        Authorities and                   there          were,        therefore,             changes

         in the contact points for these services.



(4)     The     City           Council's             Plan    is      supplementary                to     the    Police           Scheme

        for Major Disasters and                             although       it will           usually be brought                      into

         operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned ,

        action           can also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.

        A     major           disaster          in    peacetime           may      occur in            many     forms           and     so

        requires              definition         to       distinguish           it     from       the routine              incidents

        that        are       the    day-to-day             sole      concern          of    the       emergency           services .

        Neither           the       numbers          of     persons involved,                    nor    the     scale           of    the

        damage           by    themselves             would       necessarily              determine          the    involvement

        of     local           authority             resources          and      a     major           peacetime          emergency

        is     therefore             defined           in    the      Plan       as        "any    disaster           or        serious

        disruption              of       life        arising       with      little          or    no     warning,              causing

        or     threatening death or serious                               injury to,             or rendering homeless,

        such        numbers          of    persons           in    excess        of        those       which     can       be     dealt

        with        by    the       Local       Authority           and    Public           Services          operating           under

        normal           procedures             and       which     calls        for        special       mobilisation                aad

        is     to    inform          the    Chief           Executive         or       the       Head    of    Administration

        and Legal Department of the emergency and, under her/his direction,

        to     act       as     Liaison          Officer          between        the        departments          and        services

        involved              and    produce          any        progress       or      other          reports       required          by

        her/him.              The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines

        their        roles          and    responsibilities                in      a    major          peacetime          emergency

        situation.                  The    relevant              departments           are        required           to     draw       up

        and         maintain              departmental               plans            to     meet         the        roles            and

        responsibilities                   placed           upon     them.           The      response          of        the    local

        authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve

        any    or        all    the       departments              concerned,           depending upon                the       nature

        and demands of the situation.

          Authority           and        with       the     South          Yorkshire          Fire      and     Civil        Defence

          Authority           who,        through           their          Emergency          Planning         Unit     with      its

          team     of     full-time                professional                 officers,          were     able       to     pursue

          contacts        across               the        range        of       emergency           services          and      local

         authorities            throughout               South     Yorkshire               and North East Derbyshire,

         and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling the revised

         Plan.        Although            the       Plan    had been             up-dated in terms               of personnel

         changes         on     a       periodic           basis,          it     was      considered          appropriate         at

         that time, to adopt arrangements whereby in future a full revision

         of     the     Plan       would        be       undertaken,            at     least    every       alternate          year.

         To     this     end        arrangements               were         put       in    hand     on   18     January         1989

         to     undertake           a    further          revision          of    the Council's             Emergency          Plan,

         with     a     view        to       the     circulation            of       a revised version                during      the

         Spring of 1989.                     These arrangements were overtaken by the disaster

         at     Hillsborough              on       15 April       1989 and the                completion of a revised

         document was set back in order to take into account and incorporate

         in     the     Plan,           issues        and      lessons           learned        from      the    Hillsborough

         disaster.

 (7)         The        revised        draft          of    the       Council's Peacetime Emergency                                Plan      was

             also       prepared          in    consultation                with        the         South Yorkshire                Fire      and

             Civil Defence Authority, taking into account the issues highlighted

             in    the       above        review          and    meetings            with       emergency             services.              The

             revised          draft       is     currently             awaiting            the       approval              of    the

            Executive.               In     accordance                with       previous            practice,              the        revised

            draft        identifies             an        ’initial         action'         procedure             for        the        Police.

            The          plan       does        not       require          a    code word            for implementation                      and

            the         question          of     code       words         has       not been        mentioned              at    any      of my

            meetings with the emergency services.

            at my home,             shortly before 5.00 pm on 15 April 1989.                                                The Director

            gave     me       an     outline          of    the       situation           and       his     assessment               of     what

            was needed.               I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major

            Peacetime          Emergencies which                      is kept          at my home               and        I immediately

            contacted           the        (then)          Chief          Executive            (Mr        Ian    Podmore)              at    his

            home        to    appraise           him       of     the       situation.                I    then        contacted             the

            Assistant           Director             of     Family         and       Community             Services              (Mr      David

            Snaith)          who     was       at     this       time          still      at    his        home,       and       requested

            the     implementation                   of     his       Department's                  role        in     the       Emergency

            Plan     with          particular             reference            to    the       provision              of    rest        centre

            accommodation and care of the homeless.                                            His Department had already

            taken       active        steps           to    get       Social         Workers          to        the        scene       of    the

         followed           by        a     call        from      me       to     the            (then)        Acting           Head         of

         the     services             of     the     Local        Authority.                 I    was      not        contacted              by

         South        Yorkshire              Police        during          the    course           of     Saturday              evening.

         of     meals       for       persons        attending          the       rest       centres.               This        was       done

         through           the    Principal             Administrative                 Assistant              in     the    Education

         reported          these           arrangements          back       to Mr        Snaith           who       was     to      inform

         me     if    and        when       they     were        required.              It       was     not        yet     clear          how

         many        persons          would        attend        the       rest        centres          nor        for      how       long,

         but    3 centres              had       been     opened       up       at. Burngreave                Vestry        Hall,         the

         Kelvin Community                   Centre and the Sacred Heart Church Hall.                                                Social

         Workers           were        attached           to    distressed              families              on     a     one-to-one

         basis.        I ascertained from Mr Snaith that the Hospitals and Police

         had     clear       instructions               as      to   where        the        rest       centres            were.          ^he

         Burngreave              Vestry ' Hall            was        not      required             and        was     subsequently

         closed but the Kelvin and Sacred Heart Centres continued to operate

         overnight.              Mr       Snaith     subsequently               informed me that the Education

         Department's              emergency              feeding          arrangements                were         not     required,

         food    being           provided          by     the    WRVS       at Kelvin              and        by    volunteers             at

         the Sacred Heart Centre                          and I was able to                      'stand-down'              the School

    Continuation of statement of



          Executive              was    fully           briefed.              The     afore-mentioned                  actions       formed

          a     continuous              sequence                of     events         which         began        with        the    initial

          contact           by    Mr     Purchon                and    extended          late        into        the    evening.           The

          pressure           of        the        problem            did     not      allow         time     for       a     transfer       to

          a     central          base        in    the Town              Hall.          Contacts          had     been       established

          and        people       knew        where             I was.          The      potential          for        confusion,          had

          a     move        been       attempted,                 would         have      been        considerable.                 I     did,

          however,           transfer             operations               to    a      central       control          office        in    the

          Town        Hall        on     the       morning              of      Sunday         16    April and               this centre

          many        days       after        the           disaster.              The    action           taken        by    the       Local

          Authority in terms of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved

          was        the    subject           of        a       letter       dated       5 May        1989        which       I    sent     to

                 2.    Call-out protocols. ‘
                       It was generally felt that it was useful for the different agencies to be in
                       regular contact so that they were familiar with each others responsibilities
                       and resource capabilities in the event of a disaster.
                       There was much discussion about the merits of making radio appeals to get
                       staff to an incident.     Some felt that this should not happen and that
                       the District emergency plan should be adhered to.    Others felt that in
                       certain circumstances such an appeal was beneficial.
                       It was felt that it would be useful if District officers had some highly
                       visible form of identification, (eg. tabards) when they turned up at an
                       incident so that the Police could help them get through.   There is a danger
                       that if too many people think they can help then roads and access points get
                       clogged up.   The Police may be needed to get both local authority staff and
                       equipment through to the scene of a disaster.
                       In general the Police Officers on the ground are not aware of the Districts'
                       plans or arrangements.    However, they should, contact the South Yorkshire
                       Police Operations Room in the event of a disaster as all of Malcolm
                       Edmundson's staff are aware of the Districts'        emergency arrangements.
                       Malcolm Edmundson is trying to make sure that middle ranking officers are
                       also aware of these arrangements.
                       District liaison officers emphasised that Police contact should primarily be
                       with their main call-out points who will alert all other council staff.
                       Malcolm Edmundson agreed to call a meeting to discuss lessons learnt
                       following the Hillsborough disaster once the Inquiry report has been
                       released.

 Exercises
 Barnsley aim to have an exercise every 18 mbnths. The next is planned for 17
 November 1989.   Roy Poster has issued reports on their November 1987 and
 December 1988 exercises.
 Malcolm Edmundson said the Police would be willing to participate in any
 exercise.   Contact should initially be made through Malcolm Edmundson's
 office but local Divisional Police would probably be involved as well.


 Resources
 The District representatives emphasised that different departments in each
 District may have different responsibilities and resources. Therefore it was
 important for police contact to be through the District Controller.   It was
 felt that resources could not be listed in any great detail in plans as they
 were constantly changing.


 Rest Centres

All Districts have rest centres earmarked in their emergency plans.       The
choice of exact centre to be used would, be made when it was needed taking
into account the prevailing circumstances.   The Sheffield experience is that
it is preferable to co-locate rest centres with feeding centres.
All District representatives stated that they did not want the voluntary
services to take over setting up rest centres as this created many problems.


Church Initiatives
Archdeacon Lowe of Sheffield is currently preparing a call-out plan for the
clergy in the event of a disaster where counselling is required.         At
Hillsborough many priests had problems getting into the ground.   This plan
will designate an incident controller    to sort out clergy, eg. different
denominations, etc.

There was some debate as to whether the District controllers should alert the
clergy or the police should do this directly.      It was agreed that if the
Archdeacon's plan was limited to the clergy and providing a counselling
service then the police should contact them directly.   However, if there was
any role in the plan which overlapped local authority services then the
District Controller should alert the clergy via social services.    This will
be clarified by the Police after liaison with the Arch Deacon.


Home Secretary's statement to CACFOA, 5 September 1989.
 The Home Secretary has announced that Fire and Civil Defence Authorities r.re
 to be given a new power to co-ordinate the Districts peacetime emergency
 planning.   He is looking for a legislative opportunity to introduce this so
 the timetable is currently unclear.   However, he has stressed that the main
 role for peacetime emergency planning is to remain with the Districts and he
 does not intend, to merely give Fire and Civil Defence Authorities powers
 under section 138 of the Local Government Act.   The Districts could however
 create an agency agreement under section 101 of the Local Government Act
‘1972, to contract the FCDA to carry out their peacetime emergency planning.
 A paper will go to CoCo on 24 September 1989.
8.   Chief Executives' Seminar
     Simon Turney passed a copy of a letter from Somerset County Council to the
     District  representatives   concerning the   response to an emergency    in
     Metropolitan areas.    District representatives were asked to forward any
     comments to Simon Turney for incorporation in an Emergency Planning College
     exercise.


9.   Role of the Hazrdous Waste Unit
     Following the meeting between the District liaison officers and the Fire
     Service             ^iad investigated the role of the Hazardous Waste Unit in
     an emergency.    The Hazardous Waste Unit is now based in Rotherham.     They
     should be called out via any of the four Chief Environmental Health Officers,
     but in practice they are often contacted directly.      Their role is purely
     advisory.  They will provide information about waste materials but they will
     not remove them or dispose of them.


10. Cycle For Future Meetings.
     It was agreed that the group should aim to meet once per year.   Malcolm
     Edmondson agreed to call a further meeting once the Hillsborough Inquiry
     report was released to discuss lessons learnt.

(1)      My name is                                               .       I have been employed by Sheffield

         City       Council     since         1966    in       a       variety          of     administrative            posts.
         I    was     appointed          Principal            Assistant            in     the       Administration              and

         Emergency         Liaison        Officer        for          major       peacetime            emergencies        since

Continuation of statement of



         South        Yorkshire                County       Council           in        1986       and       the     establishment

         of     the       South        Yorkshire             Fire           and     Civil        Defence           Authority           were
         not     fundamental                   to    the     operation              of       the      City     Council's              Plan.
         Obviously,              the        demise          of        the     County            Council        meant           that     its

         functions              were       distributed                 to,     for         example,          the     City        Council

         and     the           Joint       Authorities                and     there          were,       therefore,              changes

         in the contact points for these services.



(4)      The     City           Council's            Plan        is     supplementary               to       the    Police           Scheme
         for Major Disasters                         and although it will usually be brought                                            into

         operation at the discretion of the Senior Police Officer concerned,

         action can              also be instigated by any Senior Departmental Officer.

         A     major           disaster         in        peacetime          may       occur       in    many        forms        and     so

         requires              definition            to    distinguish              it      from      the     routine          incidents

         that     are          the     day-to-day            sole         concern          of    the     eme rgency            services.

         Neither           the       numbers          of    persons           involved,            nor       the     scale        of     tlie

         damage           by    themselves            would           necessarily            determine             the    involvement
         of     local           authority             resources              and       a     major       peacetime             emergency

         is     therefore                  defined          in        the    Plan as "any               disaster          or     serious
         disruption              of       life       arising           with        little        or     no    warning,           causing

         or threatening                    death or serious injury to, or rendering homeless,

         such        numbers              of    persons           in      excess of those                which       can       be     dealt

          and Legal" Depai Linidiih of the emergency and, under her/his direction,
          to    act        as    Liaison             Officer          between          the      departments              and    services

          involved             and         produce          any       progress or other                  reports          required        by

          her/him.              The plan identifies a number of departments and outlines

          their       roles          and       responsibilities                   in       a major       peacetime             emergency

          situation.                 The       relevant           departments                are      required            to    draw      up

          and        maintain               departmental                    plans          to      meet        the         roles         and

          authority in a major peacetime emergency situation may thus involve

          any    or       all        the       departments             concerned,            depending             upon    the       nature
          and demands of the situation.

         authorities             throughout                   South Yorkshire and North                        East Derbyshire,
         and offer invaluable assistance and advice in compiling the revised

         Plan.        Although                the Plan had been up-dated                             in terms          of personnel
         changes           on        a       periodic          basis,        it      was       considered          appropriate          at

         that time, to adopt arrangements whereby in future a full revision

         of     the       Plan       would          be     undertaken,              at      least    every        alternate          yeai.
         To     this        end          arrangements                were        put      in    hand     on    18      January         1989

          to undertake                   a    further          revision of the Council's                          Emergency          Plan,

         with     a       view           to    the       circulation             of a revised             version            during tlie

          Spring of 1989.                      These arrangements were overtaken by the disaster
          at Hillsborough                     on     15 April          1989 and the completion of a revised

          document was set back in order to take into account and incorporate
          in    the        Plan,             issues        and       lessons           learned       from      the      Hillsborough

          disaster.

          The     plan       does        not       require          a     code      word       for        implementation                 and

          was needed.               I have a copy of the City Council's Scheme for Major

         of meals         for persons           attending          the        rest       centres.           This was              done

         reported         these       arrangements           back       to Mr        Snaith who was                    to     inform
         me    if    and       when    they     were        required.               It       was     not    yet        clear        how
         many       persons       would       attend        the        rest     centres             nor     for        how        long,

         but    3 centres            had     been    opened        up at Burngreave Vestry Hall,                                    the

         Kelvin      Community Centre and the Sacred Heart Church Hall.                                                       Social
         Workers         were        attached        to     distressed              families           on        a    one-to-one

         basis.          I ascertained from Mr Snaith that the Hospitals and Police

         had    clear       instructions             as     to    where       the        rest       centres           were.          The

         Burngreave            Vestry        Hall     was        not     required              and     was           subsequently

         closed but the Kelvin and Sacred Heart’Centres continued to operate

         overnight.             Mr Snaith       subsequently informed me that the Education
         Department's            emergency           feeding           arrangements                 were     not        required,

         food       being       provided       by     the       WRVS    at     Kelvin          and by volunteers at
         the Sacred Heart Centre and I was able to                                            'stand-down'            the School

          contact         by     Mr    Purchon          and        extended            late    into     the       evening.             The

          pressure          of       the     problem             did     not       allow       time for       a    transfer             to

          a    central         base     in the          Town        Hall.             Contacts       had been          established

          and    people          knew      where        I was.               The       potential for          confusion,               had

          a    move       been        attempted,             would          have        been     considerable.                I    did,

          however,          transfer          operations to                 a central          control        office        in         the

          Town       Hall       on     the      morning            of       Sunday       16     April       and     this       centre

          provided          the       focus       for        all       information            and     decision         making          for

          many       days       after       the        disaster.              The       action        taken       by    the       Local

          Authority in terms of care, comfort and counselling of the bereaved
          was    the       subject         of      a    letter          dated          5 May     1989      which        I   sent        to

2.    Call-out protocols. '
      It was generally felt that it was useful for the different agencies to be in
      regular contact so that they were familiar with each others responsibilities
      and resource capabilities in the event of a disaster.
      There was much discussion about the merits of making radio appeals to get
      staff to an incident.     Some felt that this should not happen and that
      the District emergency plan should be adhered to.    Others felt that in
      certain circumstances such an appeal was beneficial.
      It was felt that it would be useful if District officers had some highly
      visible form of    identification, (eg. tabards)  when they turned up at an
      incident so   that the Police could help   them get through. There is a danger
      that if too   many people think they can   help thenroads and access points get
      clogged up.    The Police may be needed to get both local authority staff and
      equipment through to the scene of a disaster.
      In general the Police Officers on the ground are not aware of the Districts'
      plans or arrangements.    However, they should contact the South Yorkshire
      Police Operations Room in the event of a disaster as all of Malcolm
      Edmundson's   staff are aware    of the Districts'  emergency arrangements.
      Malcolm .Edmundson is trying to make sure that middle ranking officers are
      also aware of these arrangements.

      District liaison officers emphasised that Police contact should primarily be
      with their main call-out points who will alert all other council staff.

      Malcolm Edmundson agreed to call a                  meeting to discuss lessons learnt
      following the Hillsborough disaster                 once the Inquiry report has been
      released.




                                              -   1   -
Exercises
Barnsley aim to have an exercise every 18 mbnths. The next is planned for 17
November 1989.               has issued reports on their November 1987 and
December 1988 exercises.
Malcolm Edmundson said the Police would be willing to participate in any
exercise.   Contact should initially be made through Malcolm Edmundson's
office but local Divisional Police would probably be involved as well.


Resources
The District representatives emphasised that different departments in each
District may have different responsibilities and resources. Therefore it was
important for police contact to be through the District Controller.   It was
felt that resources could not be listed in any great detail in plans as they
were constantly changing.


Rest Centres
All Districts have rest centres earmarked in their emergency plans.       The
choice of exact centre to be used would be made when it was needed taking
into account the prevailing circumstances.   The Sheffield experience is that
it is preferable to co-locate rest centres with feeding centres.
All District representatives stated that they did not want the voluntary
services to take over setting up rest centres as this created many problems.


Church Initiatives
Archdeacon Lowe of Sheffield is currently preparing a call-out plan for the
clergy in the event of a disaster where counselling is required.         At
Hillsborough many priests had problems getting into the ground.   This plan
will designate an incident controller    to sort out clergy, eg. different
denominations, etc.
There was some debate as to whether the District controllers should alert the
clergy or the police should do this directly.      It was agreed that if the
Archdeacon's plan was limited to the clergy and providing a counselling
service then the police should contact them directly.   However, if there was
any role in the plan which overlapped local authority services then the
District Controller should alert the clergy via social services.    This will
be clarified by the Police after liaison with the Arch Deacon.


Home Secretary's statement to CACFOA, 5 September 1989.
The Home Secretary has announced that Fire and Civil Defence Authorities r.re
 to be given a new power to co-ordinate the Districts peacetime emergency
planning.   He is looking for a legislative opportunity to introduce this so
the timetable is currently unclear.    However, he has stressed that the main
role for peacetime emergency planning is to remain with the Districts and he
does not intend to merely give Fire and Civil Defence Authorities powers
 under section 138 of the Local Government Act.   The Districts could however
 create an agency agreement under section 101 of the Local Government Act
‘1972, to contract the FCDA to carry out their peacetime emergency planning.
 A paper will go to CoCo on 24 September 1989.
8.   Chief Executives* Seminar
     Simon Turney passed a copy of a letter from Somerset County Council to the
     District    representatives  concerning  the  response to an emergency   in
     Metropolitan areas.    District representatives were asked to forward any
     comments to Simon Turney for incorporation in an Emergency Planning College
     exercise.


9.   Role of the Hazrdous Waste Unit
     Following   the meeting between the District liaison officers and the    Fire
     Service              had investigated the role of the Hazardous Waste Unit in
     an emergency.     The Hazardous Waste Unit is now based in Rotherham.    They
     should be called out via any of the four Chief Environmental Health Officers,
     but in practice they are often contacted directly.       Their role is purely
     advisory.     They will provide information about waste materials   but  they wi
     not remove them or dispose of them.


10. Cycle For Future Meetings.
     It was agreed that the group should aim to meet once per year.   Malcolm
     Edmondson agreed to call a further meeting once the Hillsborough Inquiry
     report was released to discuss lessons learnt.

                  Apologies for Non-Attendance


MINUTES OF THE MEETING HELD ON   6 TH   SEPTEMBER, 1989

COMMUNICATIONS

(a)   A petition from 373 residents of Upper Heeley requesting the
      installation of a pelican crossing at the junction of Carrfield
      Road and Gleadless Road in view of the dangers caused to people
      using the shopping, medical and other facilities in that area
      by the increasing volume of traffic around the Heeley Green
      area, by the siting of bus stops on either side of Carrfield
      Road and from parked delivery vehicles.
      (To be referred to the Planning and Transportation Programme
      Committee.)

(b)   A petition    containing 2,116 signatures protesting at the proposed
      closure of Park Baths and requesting the City Council to review
      the matter with a view to keeping the Baths open.
      (To be considered with the minutes of the Leisure Services
      Programme Committee - Item 13 on page 602 refers.)

(c)   A petition containing 46 signatures of residents of the Meadow
      House Drive/Carsick View Road area requesting the provision
      of a bus service to Carsick Hill Road.
      (To be referred to the Planning and Transportation Programme
      Committee and a copy to be sent to  the South Yorkshire Passenger
      Transport Executive.)

(d)   A petition   containing 31 signatures objecting to the action
      of the Recreation Department in discontinuing as from 2nd
      October, 1989 the public swimming session held at 5.15 p.m.
      on Mondays and Thursdays at King Edward VII Baths.
      (To be referred to the Leisure Services Programme Committee. )

(e)   A petition   containing 1,220 signatures mostly of residents
      of Wharncliffe Side and Oughtibridge insisting that the proceeds
      from any sale by the City Council of Glen Howe Park Lodge
      at Wharncliffe Side, which was donated to the local community
      by Joseph Dixon, should be made entirely available to the
      Wharncliffe Side Village Hall and Oughtibridge Community
      Association.
      (To be referred to the Leisure Services Programme Committee. )

(f)   A petition   containing 688 signatures of women who are strongly
      opposed to the proposed closure of Glossop Road Turkish Baths
      which they consider is a service that has been enjoyed by
      the people of Sheffield since 1903.  The petitioners believe
      that such a move does not take into account their needs or
      interests as women and residents of Sheffield and they urge
      the Council to reject any plans for the closure of this unique
      baths as the baths play such an important part in their emotional,
      physical and social well being.
      (To be referred to the Leisure Services Programme Committee.)

REPORT OF THE ACTING HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION AND LEGAL DEPARTMENT
TO THE POLICY COMMITTEE



Hillsborough Disaster - Overview and Proposals for Future



Purpose of Report

The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of action taken by the
City Council since the Hillsborough disaster and also to address the general
recommendations of the Taylor Report regarding the issuing of safety
certificates by the City. Council as the enforcing authority.

Copies of the following reports are attached:-

(a)    Report of the Director of Social Services to Family and Community
        Services Programme Committee on 10th May on the involvement of
        the staff of his Department and recommending the setting up of
        a task team.  The recommendations were approved.

(b)    Report of the Director of Libraries and Information Services to
        this Committee on 23rd May.

(c)    Report of the Director of Health and Consumer Services to Health
        and Consumer Services Programme Committee on 20th June concerning
        the involvement of his Department's staff.

(d)    Report of the Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department
        to General Purposes Panel on 17th August, 1989 advising members
        of interim action taken.

(e)    Report of the Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department
        to MEGS Programme Committee on 18th September together with supporting
        documents which informed members of action already taken and made
        a number of recommendations for future action.  The recommendations
        of the Committee will be reported verbally.

(f)     A copy of the Prohibition Notice served on Owlerton Sports Stadium.

(g)     Copies of letters from South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service,
        the Building Surveyor, Department of Land and Planning and the
        Director of Health and Consumer Services on the review of the
        administration and inspection system.


Summary of Action Taken

The report to MEGS Programme Committee summarises the action which has
already been taken by the Council in its capacity as licensing authority
and no need is seen to repeat it here; however, members should be aware
that the General Purposes Panel, acting under delegated powers, considered
a report of the Advisory Group at its meeting on 15th September concerning
Owlerton Stadium and resolved to serve a Prohibition Notice with immediate
effect.

Members should also be aware that the Advisory Group is at present being
chaired by one of the Department's Principal Solicitors as an interim
                                         - 2 -


measure pending a decision by the Council on its future and to respond
to the views of the Taylor Report that the Group should be chaired by a
senior officer.

Finally, the views of other interested bodies and Departments have been
requested on how the responsibilities of the Council should be carried
out in future; as already indicated, copies of these observations are attached.



Matters for Consideration

A number of matters now require members' consideration;        these include

(i)       The staffing requirements necessary for the effective and efficient
          running of the licensing service.

(ii)     The level of fees which should be charged for the issuing        of
          certificates and the length of such certificates.

(iii)     The future administrative arrangements and decision-making procedures
          required to operate the service.

This report addresses these three issues in turn.

(i )     Staffing

            It has to be said that the existing staffing arrangements  in the
          ■ Licensing Section of my Department are totally incapable of handling
            the additional volume of work likely to arise from the implementation
            of the recommendations of the Taylor Report as well as the existing
            licensing obligations.   Members will see that the report to MEGS
            Programme Committee recognises this and proposes a new structure
            and additional staffing to handle the increased workload.   It has
            to be said that the additional expenditure of £26,400 needed to
         • implement this additional staffing requirement cannot be found
            from within the provisional cash limit notified to the Department
            for 1990/91.   It may be possible to meet some limited expenditure
            in the remainder of the current financial year but not in a full
            year.

(i i )   Fees

          At the present time fees are not charged by the Council for the
          issuing or amendment of any safety certificate.  Regulation 14
          of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976 enables a local
          authority to "determine the fees to be chargged in respect of
          applications for the issue or amendment of safety certificates
          but such fees must not in a particular case exceed an amount
          commensurate with the work actually and reasonably done."

          The guidance quoted in the Taylor Report is that every safety
          certificate should be reviewed annually and renewed annually;
          therefore it can only be assumed that the expenditure will increase.

          Accordingly it is recommended that with immediate effect fees be
          charged to all applicants for safety certificates at w h a t e v e r 'level
          is considered to be appropriate for the work done - clearly, fees
                                    - 3 -


        may be different in different cases.  Any increased income would
        of course be used to offset the increased expenditure referred
        to above.

(iii)   Future Administrative Arrangements

        Paragraphs 16 and 17 of the interim recommendations of the Taylor
        Report state that a local authority should review its administrative
        arrangements and set up an effective Advisory Group with a Chairman
        from the local authority and an effective procedure which should
        produce regular written reports for consideration by the local
        authority.

        The revised administrative structure that is summarised in the
        report to MEGS Programme Committee would in my view provide an
        administrative structure within my Department which would enable
        the Council to deal adequately with the administration of the
        certificate, but clearly the Council must consider whether its
        procedures would need to be amended in the light of the recommendations.

        So far as the Advisory Group recommendation is concerned, such
        a Group already exists, although it does not have representatives
        from the Clubs and Supporters' Club and is at present charied by
        one of my Principal Solicitors.  Members may wish to consider whether
        these arrangements are considered satisfactory or whether it would
        be appropriate for the local authority Chairman to be a member
        rather than an officer.  In any event, members should consider
        whether it is desirable that an Advisory Group reporting directly
        to the Council on matters related to safety of the public should
        include representatives of the Clubs and Supporters' Clubs or

        whether an additional body including representatives of Clubs and
        Supporters' Clubs should be created to advise the Advisory Group
        as and when appropriate.

        I am of the opinion that the Council should be advised in the exercise
        of its functions under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act by an
        independent and impartial Advisory Group, chaired by one of my
        senior officers as at present and consisting of the professional
        officers who have an input into the recommendations that the Council
        need to consider.  To include representatives of the clubs, stadia
        and supporters' clubs on such a Group would cloud the matter and
        leave the public, and indeed the Council, unclear on the role of
        the Group, since inevitably the views of the clubs and supporters
        will be based on different attitudes from those of professional
        officers with a responsibility to advise the Council on the exercise
        of its functions.

  -_    I feel that the views of the Taylor Report on the importance of
        consulting clubs, stadia and supporters should be recognised by
        the creation of a different group, which would contain representatives
        of the formal ^Advisory Group and of the clubs and supporters and
        whose function would be to make representations to the Advisory
        Group and through it the Council on matters of particular concern
                                         - 4 -


        to the members, whether on the functions of the Council under the
        Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 or otherwise.             Such a group could
        a p p r o p r i a t e l y be chaired by a member of the Council to emphasise
        the link recommended by the Taylor Report.

(iv)    Future Decision - Making Arrangements

        Finally, any consideration of the Council's procedures must clearly
        include the formal decision-making process of the Council.   At
        present the powers and duties of the Council under the Safety of
        Sports Grounds Act 1975 are delegated to the General Purposes Panel
        of MEGS Programme Committee, with urgent matters delegated further
        to me.  Members need to consider whether this arrangement is
        satisfactory, and if not, whether another Committee or Sub-Committee
        of the Council should be responsible for such matters.  Members
        need to be aware that Annual Council resolved at its meeting on
        17th May that ".... the powers and duties exercised by MEGS Programme
        Committee in relation to licensing matters be referred to the Health
        and Consumer Services Programme Committee ....".

        It would seem to be consistent with that decision that the licensing
        functions of the Council should in due course be transferred to
        Health and Consumer Services Programme Committee, presumably at
        the same time as this Committee considers the date of transfer
        of the other licensing functions.  Such a decision should, however,
        take into account the need to consider what level the delegation
        to the Programme Committee and any Panels or offices would need
        to be established.



Recommendations

Members are asked to note this report and to

(i)     agree with the proposed new staffing structure and to indicate
        how this should be funded;

(ii)    agree with the basis of charging fees;

(iii)   agree with the recommendations concerning the future of the Advisory
         Group, its constitution and chairmanship and also with the creation
         of a separate group including representatives of the stadia and
         chaired by a member of the Council; and

(iv)    consider what Committee/Panel arrangements should be brought into
         force to deal with the statutory responsibilities of the Council
         under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975, in the light of the
         decision of teh Council on 17th May.

         10TH MAY 1989


         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER/INVOLVEMENT OF F. & C.S. STAFF/PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE
         ACTION


         1. INVOLVEMENT OF F. & C.S. STAFF

            In the afternoon and evening of Saturday, 15th April and on Sunday, 16th
            April over 150 F. & C.S. staff were active in giving support and
            assistance to victims and relatives of the Hillsborough Disaster.

            Help given during this period included

                Counselling relatives and friends of bereaved and injured people.

            -   Assisting Police in organising reception and support of relatives
                coining to Sheffield to identify people in hospital or who had died.

            -   provision of transport and food in support of the above.


            Since the weekend of the‘disaster there has also been substantial ongoing
            involvement

                Support and counselling to people in Sheffield who have been severely
                shocked by their experience of the disaster, including people who were
                close witnesses of the events or involved in helping.

                Support and counselling to people from Merseyside and other Local
                Authorities coming to Sheffield to visit relatives or friends in
                hospital or visit the football ground again.

            -   Follow up work and liaison with other Local Authorities over continued
                help to people who had been in Sheffield and who had been helped by or
                in contact with Sheffield F. & C.S.

            This ongoing staff work has been co-ordinated by a task team set up and
            based in the Hillsborough F. & C.S. Divisional Office. A review of the
            Department’s contribution to emergency services in major disasters has
            also been initiated and reports consequent on this review will be
            presented in due course.

         2. PROPOSALS FOR FUTURE ACTION

             From their experience over the past three weeks it is the recommendation
             of the temporary task team that a task team needs to operate for a longer
         ___ period; some months, and if necessary up to a year.

            This recommendation takes account of the advice we have received from the
            Kent Staff involved in the Zeebrugge Ferry disaster and Bradford Staff
            involved in Bradford City Football Club fire.




RPTABP
          The prime focus of such a team would be ongoing work with people from
          Sheffield. There is a secondary focus of work, which is to support
         “LTverpool Social Services Department in anyway possible in their work
          with bereaved families, or families of those injured (physically or
          emotionally). The only possible exceptions to this would be families
          from outside Liverpool whose choice it was to work directly with
          Sheffield.

         We know that there will be key times in the future when support to
         Liverpool Social Services Department will be more intense:- e.g. when the
         enquiry findings are made public; at the Coroner's Inquest or on
         Anniversaries. To some extent this work can be planned for in advance
         because dates will be known.

         All such work is as a support to Liverpool and secondary to the p r imary
         focus.

         The Task Team are of the opinion that the primary focus needs to
         concentrate on Sheffield residents. There are considerable numbers
         involved:-

            Sheffield Wednesday F. C. Staff - 600

            Sheffield Wednesday supporters at the game - 1000

            Local Residents who offered help;     cannot be estimated at this moment.

            Red Cross staff - not known as yet.

            St. John’s Ambulance Staff - 35 + 2 ambulances.

            South Yorkshire Police - 1111 (257 inside the ground) and unspecified
            number of special constables.

            Staff from F. & C.S. and other helping professions, including clergy,
            estimated conservatively at 300 plus environmental health/mortuary
            staff.
            (Some of these'agencies will probably prefer to provide counselling
             within their own organisations)

         The impact on such numbers, because of the sudden violent way in which it
         happened, will have an effect on the Mental Health of the Community.

         The Task Team believed that the on-going work following the disaster
         should be seen in Mental Health Prevention terms. If this does not
         happen it seems certain that some of the people in the groups above will
         go into crisis at some future date. We are informed that research shows
         that some people can become chronic depressives if not helped in a
         pro-active way.

         One of the impressive features since the disaster is the amount of work
         being done by Voluntary Organisations, the Churches, Area Health Staff,
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the Local Authority.  There is so
         much being done that one of the problems is co-ordinating, because
         sometimes it is being done by individual organisations or sometimes in
         pairs.

         The temporary Task Tead are convinced that there is a need to consider
         the setting up of a longer term Task Team initially for six months, to be
         extended as required if proved to be necessary, to establish a Mental
         Health Prevention Service to Sheffield residents affected by the
         Hillsborough Disaster, and to act as a support service to Liverpool
         Social services Department and other Local Authority Social Services
         Departments affected by the events at Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989

         However the Temporary Task Team would want to ensure the ongoing
         commitment of Voluntary Organisations, the Churches, Area Health and
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

         The following is therefore proposed:-

         1.   The setting up of a Steering/Advisory Group with representatives of
              Voluntary Organisations; the Churches; A.H.A; Sheffield Wednesday
              Football Club; The Local Authority and the South Yorkshire Police if
              they wish to participate.

              This Group’s remit would be:-

              "To advise the Manager and Task Team Leader about important issues in
              order to co-ordinate the range of services needed”.


         2.   The setting up of a permanent Task Team for one initial period of six
              months comprising of:-

              1 Team Leader (preferably with Mental Health
              Training) POld/e                                       £17,267)
                                                                            )
              3 - Level 3 Social Workers equivalent but able to                  )
              offer group work and community work skills             £45,349).
                                                                            )
              1 Admin Officer scale 6                                £12,852)
                                                                            )
              3 Clerks Scale 2/3                                     £27,000)
                                                                            )
              Printing, stationery, postages   and telephones         £5,000)
                                                                            )
              Computer costs                                          £3,000)

                                        TOTAL including on-costs     £110.468 full
                                                                              year
                                                                              costs

                                                 six months costs     £55.234



         It is also proposed that- the District Health Authority should be asked to
         second a psychologist to work with the team. Where possible existing
         staff would be seconded to these posts and replaced by temporary
         appointments

         A further sum of money needs to be identified for running costs and some
         initial training in Stress De-briefing Techniques.




RPTABP
          A review of the work, remit and composition of the Task Team should be
         conducted at quarterly intervals so that the Staffing levels and suppport
         costs can be adjusted as necessary.




         3.   This team should be    based in Hillsborough (possibly at the Library in
               the rooms currently   occupied by Helpline) and accountable to the
               Divisional Officer,   Division 2, through to Assistant Director
               (Operations).



         RECOMMENDATION

         That approval in principle is given to establish a task team and that
         the Director of Social Services be asked to bring forward detailed
         proposals at the earliest opportunity and to initiate discussions with
         the City Treasurer to advise on appropriate means of financing these
         proposals.

         The Hillsborough Tragedy: The Libraries Response


Following the tragedy at Hillsborough Football Ground in which 95 people
were killed and many more were injured there was an urgent need for
Council Departments to work in a concerted effort to assist those who
had been involved.  To this end this Department approached Family and
Community Services with the offer of running a telephone service as a
way of coping with the many demands being put upon it for information
related to the tragedy.  Family and Community Services accepted this
offer, and this Department's Information Projects Co-ordinator was
requested to bring it into operation as soon as possible.  This report
provides a brief review of this service after two weeks of operation..

On Tuesday, 18th April - three days after the tragedy - a meeting took
place between officers from the F & CS Divisional Office and from
Libraries Department.  This decided what form the telephone information
line should take and it drew up a list of key telephone contact numbers
between the two Departments.  It was agreed that the service would be
based at Hillsborough Library and that it would be called the
"Hillsborough Helpline".

Publicity for the Helpline was of paramount importance so this
Department circulated a news release to the two local radio stations,
"The Star" and other newspapers, and the two regional television
services. Posters and leaflets were produced and sited in shops in the
Hillsborough area and throughout the Libraries service.  Besides the
initial publicity "The Star" agreed to carry a daily free advert
inviting readers to call the Helpline.

For the first three days the Helpline was in operation it was extremely
busy.  Requests for help fell-into the following categories:

(a) People wanting to find out if relatives or friends had been involved
    in the tragedy;

(b) Survivors wanting to re-establish contact with people who had helped
    them in the aftermath of the tragedy;

(c) Requests for counselling services from people who had,suffered
    trauma from the event;

(d) Enquiries from bereaved relatives in relation to the Disaster Fund;

(e) Many calls from all over the country asking about methods of making
    payments into the Disaster Fund;

(f) Many offers of assistance - people offering free transport between
    Sheffield and' Liverpool for survivors and bereaved families, offers
    of accommodation.

The Helpline was staffed by volunteer helpers who usually staff the
Department's annual Winter Hotline and by staff at Hillsborough Library.

To ensure that as much information -as possible was provided to callers
close liaison between this Department and other agencies was maintained.
The co-ordinator attended the daily F & CS Task Team meetings which
                                      2



     consisted of Hillsborough F & S staff, hospital social workers and a
     representative of South Yorkshire Police.   The co-ordinator also met
     with voluntary agencies in the city which were providing counselling
     services for those who had been deeply .affected by the tragedy.

6.   After two weeks of operation the Helpline is now much quieter, dealing
     mainly with requests for information concerning donations to the
     Disaster Fund.  The Helpline will be kept open for the next couple of
     weeks, and the decision to close it down will be made in consultation
     with F & CS and with relevant voluntary groups.

Conclusions

The experience described above demonstrates that the City Council does have
the ability to set up and operate a Helpline Service very quickly and
effectively.  With foresight the "Helpline" could have been operating from
the evening of the tragedy.   This suggests that arrangements for setting up
an emergency Helpline .should be specifically written in_ta-the1Planning for
Peacetime Emer g en c ie s .

Recommendations

1.   To note the arrangements made by Sheffield Libraries and Information
     Services to operate the Hillsborough Helpline.

2.   To investigate the potential for developing arrangements for
     establishing a "Helpline" as part of the Plan for Peacetime Emergencies

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - BEREAVEMENT & SUPPORT SERVICES DIVISION
         HEALTH & CONSUMER SERVICES


1.0      Purpose of Report

  1. 1   To inform Committee of the action taken following the Hillsborough
         disaster, and for the need for provision for the replacement of emergency
         supplies and the provision of additional equipment.


2.0      Background

  2.1    Following news items on Saturday 15th April, Medico-Legal Centre staff and
         managers in the Bereavement and Support Services Division reported for
         duty to the Medico-Legal Centre. M r _________, former man-ager of the
         Medico-Legal Centre also attended to render assistance.

  2.2    Between 4.00 p.m. on Saturday and 11.00 p.m. Tuesday these officers, apart
         from a few hours for sleep_and odd meal breaks worked non stop to deal
         with the 95 victims and their relatives and other visitors.

  2.3    For example the Manager of the Centre was on duty for a total of 62 hours
         between the hours stated above and most staff worked stints with snatched
         mealbreaks of 16 or 17 hours on Sunday 16th.

  2.4    Very briefly the tasks performed in Liasion with the police included
         undressing and admitting 95 bodies to the mortuary in accordance with
         procedures; cleaning and preparing them for identification/viewing by
         relatives; preparing for and assisting with post mortems, storing bodies
         in refrigerated areas; receiving and comforting distraught bereaved
         relatives of the victims, liaising with social workers, clergy and other
         voluntary helpers and cleaning all areas thoroughly as required.

  2.5    Several pathologists, their technicians plus morticians from the Royal
         Hallamshire Hospital assisted the Home Office Pathologist in performing
         autopsies on all the victims during Sunday and Monday.

  2.6    This was carried out so effectively and efficiently that the first
         inquests could commence at 2.00 p.m. on Tuesday and the first victims
         were removed by funeral directors during Tuesday afternoon - less than 72
         hours after the tragedy. The remaining inquests were completed on
         Wednesday.

         Several council members, including Cllr. C Betts, Leader of Sheffield
         City Council, and Neil Kinnock M.P. Leader of the Parliamentary Labour
         Party, visited the mortuary during this period and witnessed the
         mortifying scenes and the awesome tasks being accomplished.
                                              -   2 -


3.0     Comment

  3.1   It is satisfying— fco-feoort that the Centre, its staff, systems and
         supplies, though placed under tremendous pressure were equal to what
         hopefully will be their greatest test.

  3.2   The staff involved are unlikely to forget that weekend or the effects of
         experiencing such stress and mental anguish and a debt of gratitude is
         owed to all concerned for their unstinting efforts and commitment to a
         task which was outside all possible expectations.

  3.3   Sadly their crucial role and unselfish effortsappeared to go  largely
        unnoticed outside council circles but it would be wrong for it to go
        unrewarded, even though reward and recognition are not expected by the
         staff.


5.0     Costs - Resource Implications

  5.1   Under the emergency plan arrangements emergency stocks of equipment and
        consumables are held. These of course were greatly depleted and an
        additional twenty five stainless steel body trays had to be purchased.

  5.2   The trays and replacement consumables could not be afforded from within
         the normal cash limited budget.

  5.3   The volume of typewritten work in connection with case notes and inquests
        and the need for efficient storage and retrieval of lengthy records
        necessitated the urgent provision of quality word processing equipment in
        the Coroners Office. Sufficient funds are not available in the Coroners
        budget this year.

  5.4   In order to bring the newly installed chiller units into operation earlier
        than planned to cool down the whole mortuary suite, emergency weekend work
        was required involving engineers from London at an additional cost to that
        planned.


6.0     Recommendation

  6.1   That

        a)     the deepest gratitude and appreciation of the City Council be conveyed
               to those employees of the Bereavement & Support Services Division who
               worked for long hours in the reception and the public mortuary at the
               Medico Legal Centre following the Hillsborough Disaster,

        b)     The committee note the need for additional resources to the cash
               limited activity budgets of the Medico Legal Centre and H.M. Coroner
               and refer the matter to the Policy Committee for determination.

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
HEALTH AND CONSUMER SERVICES - PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION


1.0     Purpose of the Report

  1.1   The purpose of this report is to outline the role which thePublic
        Health Division was able to contribute towards the aftermath of the
        Hillsborough Disaster.

2.0     The Role of the Public Health Division

  2.1   The multi-functional and diverse nature of the Public Health  Division
         resulted in the contribution of its officers in a variety of different
        ways :-

        2.1.1   Safety in Sportsgrounds - Officers from the Environmenmtal
                Protection Unit (Health and Safety Section) contribute their
                health and safety expertise towards the corporate evaluation and
                control of Safety in Sportsgrounds legislation which is
                administered through the Licensing Section of the Administration
                and Legal Department.   Within an hour of the disaster becoming
                known a manager from the Environmental Protection Unit was on
                site, later joined by the senior manager in the Unit.
                Furthermore, within the first hour liaison had been established
                between the Assistant Director of Health and Consumer Services.

                The subsequent investigation into the physical conditions on site
                relevant to the Safety at Sportsgrounds aspects of the disaster
                was co-ordinated through the Divisions staff, including using the
                expertise of the Health and Safety Executive's Safety Engineering
                Laboratory and the Field Consultative Group. This investigation
                was subsequently terminated by the announcement of the Public
                Inquiry.

        2.1.2   Sports Hall Disinfection - Officers from the Environmental
                Services Unit satisfactory completed the cleansing and
                disinfection of the Sheffield Wednesday Sports Hall which was
                used as a temporary mortuary and for medical treatment
                immediately after the disaster.

        2.1.3   Flowers and Memorabilia - The Manager and officers from the
                Environmental Services Unit removed the flowers, memorabilia,
                etc. from the ground for incineration to permit the scattering of
                ashes on the pitch.

        2.1.4   Corporate Co-ordination - to ensure that the City Council
                maintained an effective and appropriate response to the disaster
                the Director and Assistant Director contributed to the operation
                of the Co-ordinating Group established by the Acting City
                Solicitor.   Furthermore, the Director was the Council's
                spokesperson following the incident, pending the announcement of
            V   the public inquiry.
                                               -   2   -




  2.2   The work consequent on the Hillsborough Disaster had to be accommodated
        by re- scheduling other work of the Division. To minimise the further
        disruption of the service, it was deemed appropriate to pay the officers
        involved in working out of hours the appropriate overtime rate.

3.0     Recommendations

  3.1   That the officers involved in the Public Health Division's response to
        the Hillsborough Disaster be thanked by the council for their
        willingness to assist and for the high standard of professionalism
        demonstrated under distressing and difficult conditions.

  3.2   The Committee note the need for additional resources to the cash limited
        budget of the Public Health Division and refer the matter to the Finance
        Committee for determination. •

C E R T I F I C A T E S ................ _ ............    ..... .


PURPOSE OF REPORT
      To advise members of interim   action which has been taken in
respect of the issue of a general Safety Certificate to Sheffield United
Football Club pic., and in respect of the amendment of the general Safety
Certificate issued by South Yorkshire County Council to Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club pic.


INTRODUCTION
     r Members have already been made aware of the fact that Lord Justice
Taylor published his interim report upon the Hillsborough Disaster on 4th
August, 1989. A copy of Che interim recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor are attached at Appendix A. A number of the interim
recommendations are specified as requiring implementation before
commencement of the 1989/90 Season. These items are asterisked in the
interim recommendations. The official date for commencement of the
1989/90 Season is the 19th August, 1989. However, it was drawn to the
attention of the Council that a football match was to take place at
Sheffield United Football Club on Saturday, 12th August, 1989. In view of
the fact that a Safety Certificate had not been issued to Sheffield United
Football Club, urgent consideration was therefore given to the matter on
Friday, 11th August, 1989. Additionally, consideration was given to the
serving of a notice of amendment of certificate in respect of Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club.

SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB
          When it came to the attention of officers>that a pre-season football
match was to take place at Sheffield United Football Club on 12th August,
consideration was given to whether an interim safety certificate should be
issued to the Club prior to a match taking place. Members are referred to
recommendation 14 of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations which states
that where a sports stadium has been designated under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act 1975 and a safety certificate has not yet been issued, the
Local Authority should proceed forthwith to issue a certificate. In the
light of this recommendation, a general safety certificate was issued by
the Chief Executive on 11th August, 1989. A copy of the certificate
issued is attached at Appendix B. This contains what can be best
described as basic safety provisions and particularly incorporates those
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which he considered should be
implemented immediately.
           Condition 7 specifies the number of first-aid attendants which are
considered necessary taking into account Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations in this respect.
           Condition 7(c) also requires the attendance of the medical
p r s e c i o n * » r as reronjmand**^ by lord J u s t i c e Taylor.

ambulance service where appropriate, again as recommended by Lord Justice
Taylor.
      Conditions 22-28 also take account of Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations. The capacity levels have also been amended. Members
will appreciate that this is one of the key issues considered.
          SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
                There is already in force a Safety Certificate in respect of
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. This certificate was issued by South
          Yorkshire County Council. A notice of aaendment of the Safety Certificate
          has therefore been served. The Notice of Aaendment was served as a natter
          of urgency to give the Club the maximum available time to comply with its
          requirements. This was served upon the Club on 11th August, 1989. The
          first football match is to take place at Sheffield Wednesday Club on 19th
          August, 1989.. The amendments and additions reflect the recommendations of
          Lord Justice Taylor which he required to be implemented before the
          commencement of the new football season. A copy of the. notice of
          amendment is attached at Appendix C. The amendments relate to first-aid
          provisions.and capacities at the ground. The additional conditions
          incorporate the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.
                Members of the Advisory Group and representatives from Sheffield
          Wednesday Football Club have-had lengthy discussions about the use of the
          north west terrace at the Sports Ground. The terrace is divided into an
          upper and lower area. It is considered that it is reasonably safe to use
          the upper area but no use should be made of the lower area at the moment.
          One option would be to prohibit the use of the entire north west terrace.
          However, the upper portion is considered to be reasonably safe andthe
          police have indicated that for operational purposes they would like to be
          able to utilise a part of the upper portion of the terrace. The
          suggestion has been made by them as a result of the interim
          recommendations   of Lord Justice Taylor since it is suggested in    the
          interim report that the police should have contingency plans to      dealwith
          the problem of large numbers of ticketless fans arriving at football
          grounds.  If use is made of that portion of the ground, fans will gain
          access by turnstiles servicing only that area and the perimeter gate at
          the back of the area will remain open during the match. There is no
          access to the pitch area from the portion of the stand which is proposed
          to be in use.
                The amended Safety Certificate envisages that use will be made of
          both the upper and lower areas of the north west terrace. It is therefore
         'necessary to issue a further notice of amendment either specifying that no
          use of the west    terrace should be made or amending the capacity   and
          Condition 10 to    reflect the fact that only the upper area should beused.
                A copy of the Sheffield Wednesday General Safety Certificate is to
          be found at Appendix.^).

              GENERAL ISSUES
                   The whole issue of Safety of Sports Grounds will be the subject of a
             detailed report to the Policy Committee at its meeting in September,

                               CHAPTER 24- THE RECOMMENDATIONS

   315. The recontmendaiions which follow are the m inim um necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which i have heard at Sheffield and other
inform ation I have received. They complement the recommendations which M r Justice Popplewell set out
after his in qliiry at Bradford.

  316. Those which are asterisked should be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
started forthwith and completed as soon as possible.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
★    1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
    should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

    A pen or area is to be deemed “ self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
    another peri or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

★    2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
    Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density' in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
        in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide:

    (b) after assessing “the Green Guide figure", a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
        margin.

★     3. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to lim it the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


Riling and Monitoring Terraces
★     4 . There should be a written agreement between the club and the police setting out their respective
    responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
    other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
    variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

★     5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
    area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are monitoring it) whose
    sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
    period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
    or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
    below, and by radio to the control room.


Fences and Gates
       6. A ll police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
    duties under Recommendation 5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
    crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
    < i r e . p " * i r ' i w rtf ' h r    nhnrnumntis dpsigned m enable stewards and officers ro recognise
    uuicrciu ciuv*u ucu m u c:> .

*     7. A ll gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
    different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “ Emergency Exit”.
*    8. Where there are perimeter fences, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully open durinc the period
    when spectators are on the terrace.

*     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieiew g cn m d in g .
    The officer so authorised in respect of each gate should be identified for each match and known to be so by all
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either himself or via an officer close at hand.

*     10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there
    are perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police. the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to useitshouldbeadetisioaofa
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crash Barriers
*      11. A ll crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any hairier found
    to be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

*      12. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteria-contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not. the assessment of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 2 above, should
    reflect the fac t


Safety Certificates
       13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority',
    which should consult the dub in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service. the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    object should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

      14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 1975 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing.Safety Certificates. Such review should require that there exists or is prmided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are r e g u la r l y and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance
    with the local authority's rules.                                                                     ‘

        17. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an A dvisory Group consisting
    o f appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the club and of a recognised supporters' ciub. The Advisory Group s terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority,
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular
    written reports for consideration by the local authority.


Duties oi each Football Club
*      18. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured. Thereafter, regular
    inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate
    anticipated.
* '      19.’ The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such
      as to ensure.that ail the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the
      turnstiles within one hour. I f that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced
      accordingly.

*       20. Turnstiles should be dosed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be
      reached and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile
      operators for this purpose.

        21. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
      concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before and throughout a match.

*       22. A il signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively
      reviewed. It should, in relation to the arrangements for each match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple
      and dear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of spectators to their appropriate viewing
      area.

*        23. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and dear and should correlate absolutely with
       the information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs
       should contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

*       24. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed
       by dubs in conjunction with the police to ensure that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for
       admitting spectators to the ground.

         25. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
       entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.


Police Planning
*       26. The C hief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated stadium or more
       should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football dub and local authority
       concerned in respect of die safety and control of crowds.

-*■      27. The Operational Order for each fsatch at a designated stadium and the pre-match briefing of all
       officers on duty there should aien such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and. if any
       is detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

*        28. The Operational Order for each match at a designated stadium should enable the police to cope with
        any foreseeable pattens is the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
      . sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

*       29. The option to postpone kick-off shottid be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
       Crowd safety should be the paramosnx consideration in deciding whether to exerdse it.

          30. There should be available in the police control room the results of ail closed circuit television
       monitoring outside and inside the ground aad the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers
       at turnstiles or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled
       in the interpretation and use of these data.


Communications
         31. There should be suffident operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
                          nnW           TH»          stem «ho?*Jd be snrh as to give operators in the control room

       used, where necessary, ta prevent overcrowding o f the airwaves. Consideration should be given to
       sound-proofing the control room against excessive crowd noise.




                                                            59
       32. To complement radio commiinicadoiis. there should be a c o m p le te ly separate system of land lines
    w ith telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

      33. W ithin the control room, there should be a public address system t& communicate with individual
    areas outside and inside the around, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important
    announcements shocid be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of
    noise in the ground. This arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every
    match.

      34. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.
    Consideration should       ov gi»«n t« the •«« by police officers of a simpie code of hand signals to indicate to

       Dear Sirs,

       Re: Safety of Spores Grounds - Hillsborough Irrcuirv

       The City Council has decided that in view of the recommendations of Lord
       Justice Taylor pursuant to the Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster, it is
       appropriate for an interim Safety Certificate to be issued to Sheffield
       United Football Club.

       I, therefore, enclose for your attention, a copy of the Safety Certificate
       which has been issued.  You will note that it contains basic safety
       provisions and also incorporates the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor
       which he considered should be implemented immediately.

       The Council is in the process of reviewing the conditions which should be
       attached to the Safety Certificate and it is likely that this will be
       concluded in the neac future and you will be issued with a new final Safety
       Certificate.

       I should also say that in the intervening period, it is likely that
       amendments will be made to the Certificate you have been issued with today
       and you should, therefore, regard the Certificate as temporary.

       Please acknowledge receipt of the Certificate.

       Yours faithfully,




       Chief Executive

           Dear Sirs,

           Re: Safety of Sports Grounds - Hillsborough

           I enclose, for your attention, Notice of Amendment of the Safety
           Certificate. The amendments are as enumerated in Appendix 1 and additional
           conditions are as enumerated in Appendix 2. The amendments and additions
           reflect the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which he required to be
           implemented before the commencement of the new Football Season.

           You will, therefore, appreciate that the issue of this Notice should be
           regarded merely as an interim temporary measure. It is likely that further
           amendments will be required shortly. In any event, the Council is in the
           process of drafting a completely new set of Conditions.  It is hoped that
           these will be in force in the near future.

           Please acknowledge receipt of this Notice.

           Yours faithfully.,

                 INTERIM   RECOMMENDATIONS OF LORD
       REPORT OF ACTING HEAD OF ADMINISTRATION & LEGAL DEPARTMENT CONCERNING
       SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS TO SPECIAL MEETING OF THE MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISE
       AND GENERAL SERVICES COMMITTEE

1.     Purpose of Report

       To update members upon the action taken as a result of the Inquiry of Lord
       Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster and to enable members to
       give consideration to further action which is required. This report
       contains a summary of the action which has been taken so far and
       enumerates a number of issues which require views from members.

2.     Summary of Action Taken

2.1    Following the publication of Lord JusticeTaylor's    Interim Report on the
        4th August, 1989, copies of the Report were madeavailable in the Members
        Library.

2.2-   A copy of the Interim recommendations contained in the Report is attached
       at Appendix A. The items marked with an asterisk required implementation
       prior to commencement of the football season.

2.3    Immediately after publication of the Report, the Acting Head of the
       Administration & Legal Department wrote to Sheffield Wednesday Football
       Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium asking
       for confirmation of the action they had taken to activate those
       recommendations.

2.4    The Acting Head of the Administration & Legal Department also wrote to the
       Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor and the Director of Health.
       & Consumer Services for their views upon the interim recommendations and
       the action which needed to be taken as a matter of urgency.

2.5    On the 9th August, it became known that a pre-season match was taking
       place at Sheffield United Club. To regulate the position, the Chief
       Executive, in the absence of the Acting Head of the Administration and
       Legal Department, issued an interim Safety Certificate to the Club. This
       contained basic safety provisions and also made specific reference to the
       interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor, which required
       implementation forthwith.

2.6    The Chief Executive also issued a Notice of Amendment in respect of the
       certificate issued to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to reflect the
       items which needed immediate implementation pursuant to Lord Justice
       Taylor's interim recommendations.

2.7    The action of the Chief Executive was approved by the General Purposes
       Panel on the 17th August. The General Purposes Panel also approved
       further amendments relating to the use of the North Stand at Sheffield
       Wednesday Football Club and the use of the North West Terrace at Sheffield
       Wednesday Football Club. A copy of the resolution of the General Purposes
       Panel is attached at Appendix 2.

2.8    Most of the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor have been
       implemented. The following paragraph provides more detail about this.

3.     Implementation of Recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor

       Revised capacities have been calculated and the appropriate
       reduction made. Arrangements have been made to count the number of
       spectators entering each self-contained area. Written agreements have
been entered into with both the Football Clubs and the Police setting out
responsibilities for crowd safety and control and the filling of terraces.
Stewarding arrangements have been improved in accordance with Lord Justice
Taylor's interim recommendations. Gates in radial or perimeter fences
have been painted in a distinctive colour. The Football Clubs have
confirmed that gates to the pitch will be kept open during specified
activities. Police Officers have been allocated in respect of each
perimeter fence. Cutting equipment has been made available. Inspections
of crush barriers have taken place and arrangements are in hand for
replacement of those affected by corrosion. The question of layout of
barriers has also been addressed. The Clubs have also inspected
turnstiles. Signposting has been reviewed and also the information
printed on tickets. Police planning has also been revised and the
co-ordination of emergency facilities. The first aid and medical
facilities as required in recommendations 39 to 42 of Lord Justice Taylor
have also been effected. Members should, however, note that a
satisfactory response has not been received from Sheffield Sports Stadium
concerning these general safety issues.

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
(a)    Revised capacities for calculation have been made in accordance
       with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide and a deduction of 15$ made to
       improve the safety margin. The revised capacity is reflected in
       the notice of amendment of the Safety Certificate. Thus,
       recommendations 1 and 2 of Lord Justice Taylor have been
       implemented.

(b)   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have indicated that they propose
       to limit the number of spectators entering each self contained pen
       or area using a computer system. The detail of this is provided in
       the agreement they have entered into with the Police in accordance
      with recommendation 4 of Lord Justice Taylor. It is not clear from
       this how they propose to achieve a closing of access to the pen or
       area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached. The Acting
       Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the Club on
       the 16th August for clarification of this matter. Response has not
       yet been received.

(c)   A copy of the agreement between the Club and the Police as required
       by recommendation 4 is attached.

(d)   In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have agreed to
       appoint stewards on the perimeter track for the purpose of checking
       crowd conditions for possible overcrowding or distress. There will
       be a need to revise the Safety Certificate to reflect the new
       levels of stewarding.

(e)   Discussions between the Football Club and Police are taking place
       and training sessions to ensure that officers and stewards are
       fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of crowd
       densities, signs of distress and crowd dynamics. There is a need
       for enquiry to be made as to the full details of this.

(f)   In accordance with recommendation 7, the gates and perimeter fences
       have been painted in a different colour from the rest of the fence
       and marked "emergency exit".                   —

(g)   In accordance with recommendation 8, the requirement for perimeter
       fence gates to remain open during specified activities has been
       made a condition of the Safety Certificate. Sheffield Wednesday
       Football Club have also confirmed that this will be done.
(h)   In accordance with recommendation 9, the Club have confirmed that a
       Police Officer will be stationed at each gate inthe fence and will
       be easily identifiable by the stewards.  He will be able to make
       contact with the Police Control Room and will be in control of that
       gate.

(i)   In accordance with recommendation 10, the provision of cutting
       equipment has been made a condition of the Safety Certificate. The
       Club have also indicated that they have provided four sets of bolt
       cutters. Two sets will be dispersed at each fence area, stored in
       boxes, clearly marked "emergency equipment". The stewards for each
       area will be trained in the use of this equipment and it will be
       the policy of the Club to ensure each steward is regularly deployed
       in the same area with the same responsibilities.

(j)   In accordance with recommendation 11, the Club have confirmed that
      crush barriers have been inspected and that those showing signs of
      corrosion will be repaired or replaced.   The ActingHead of ‘
      Administration.and Legal Department has written to the Club asking
      for the details of inspections and details of which barriers have
      been repaired or replaced. Site meetings have been arranged with
      the Building Surveyors, the Fire Service and Environmental Health
      Officers in order that further progress can be made in this area.

(k)   In accordance with recommendation 12, site meetings have been
      arranged with all interested parties to discuss this complex
      matter.

(1)   In accordance with recommendation 18, the turnstiles have been
      inspected. The Club has provided a report of the examination.
      This is attached. The Club have also provided statistics assessed
      by the Health and Safety Executive which assess the potential rate
      of flow. It must be appreciated that this ,js purely speculative
       and further steps will have to be taken tcT~undertake further tests.
      This will be essential to ensure compliance with recommendation 19.
      The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to the
      Club on the 17th August asking for this information for the third
       time. It has not yet been supplied.

(m)   No action has*been taken, as far the Acting Head of Administration
       and Legal Department is aware to install closed circuit
       television.

(n)   In accordance with recommendation 22, the signposting has been
       reviewed. An inspection has been undertaken by the Chief Licensing
       Officer who confirmed that it complied with recommendation 22.

(o)   In accordance with recommendation 23, the Club have confirmed that
       the printing of tickets has been reviewed and styled in accordance
      with the recommendation. A copy has not yet been supplied.

(p)   In accordance with recommendation 24, the Club have confirmed that
       tickets will be printed with the request that spectators should be
       in position not later than 45 minutes before commencement of the
       game.

(q)   Recommendation 25 has not yet been addressed from the point of view
       of the Local Authority.

(r)   In accordance with recommendation 26, Mr. P. Hayes, Deputy Chief
       Constable has been designated as the Senior Officer.
(3 )   With reference to recommendation 35, the Police and Ambulance
        Services have nominated senior officers. Enquiries will need to be
        made to establish the proposed liaison. Essentially, the
        co-ordination of emergency services is a matter for those
        Authorities.

(t)    The requirements of recommendation 39 have been incorporated in the
        amended Safety Certificate. The requirement to employ a medical
        practitioner in accordance with recommendation 41 has also been
        made a condition of the Certificate. The Club have confirmed that
        both these recommendations will be implemented. Similarly, it has
        been made a condition of the revised Safety Certificate that one
        fully equipped ambulance where a crowd of 5,000 or* more is
        anticipated shall be in attendance. Again, this has been confirmed
        by the Club. It will be necessary for the Local Authority to take
        the advice of the Ambulance and Emergency Services to ensure that
        compliance with recommendations 40 and 43 is achieved.

Sheffield United Football Club

(a)    A revised calculation of the capacity in accordance with
        recommendations r~and~2 have been made by the Building Surveyor and
        incorporated in the interim Safety Certificate issued to the Club.

(b)    The Club proposes to use the computerised counting system to limit
        the number of spectators entering each terraced area to comply with
        recommendation 3. When the number of spectators admitted to any of
        the terraced area reaches within 10$ of the capacity figure, the
        computer monitor operator will inform Police Control who will take
        the appropriate action to close down the necessary turnstiles. The
        Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to
        the Club seeking exact details of the procedures to be followed.
        They responded on the 21st August indicating that the computer
        monitor operator will inform Police Control by telephone and Police
        Officers will then be given instructions to instruct the turnstile
        operator to close down the necessary turnstiles.  Consideration
        will need to be given as to whether or not this is the best
        practical means of ensuring that the terrace is closed off before
        its maximum capacity is reached.

(c)    In accordance with recommendation 4 r Jthe Club has supplied a copy
        of the written agreement with the Police setting out
        responsibilities for crowd safety and control.

(d)    In accordance with recommendation 5, the Club have indicated that
        they propose to deploy six crowd safety stewards on the perimeter
        track to monitor specific areas for possible overcrowding and
        distress. It will be necessary to revise the stewarding figures in
        the Safety Certificate to reflect this fact.
                                                         •
(e)    With reference to recommendation 6 that Police Officers and
        stewards are briefed and trained with regard to recognition of
        crowd densities and signs of distress, I have not had any
        information to the effect that action has been taken to implement
        this recommendation.

(f)    With reference to recommendation 7, the perimeter fence gates have
        been removed at Sheffield United Football Club. The Club have
        painted the frame of the gate in a different colour and erected
        emergency exit signs above each gate. The Chief Licensing Officer
        has inspected this.
(g)   To comply with recommendation 9, the Club have confirmed that
      Police Officers will be provided as required and their identity
      known to stewards and other officers in the vicinity. The Police
      Officers will have radios to make contact with the Control Room.
      It should be noted that the agreement entered into with the Police
      also deals with stewarding aspects.

(h)   To comply with recommendation 10, the Club have confirmed that they
      will provide four bolt croppers. These will be used by stewards of
      the Club. The Club have asked the Fire Service to provide
      instructions for stewards in their use.

(i)   In accordance with recommendations 11 and 12, the Club have
      supplied a letter from their Consultant Engineer, Messrs. Eastwood
      and Partners who have confirmed that a visual inspection of the
      barriers has been carried out. The letter confirms that some
      rusting has occurred but that none of the barriers is sufficiently
      infected by rust for it to be necessary to carry out emergency
      strengthening or replacement before commencement of the football
      season. They also confirmed that a review of barriers has revealed
      that in some places they do not comply fully with the criteria in
 “    the Green Guide and that drawings are being prepared showing the
      extra barriers which will be required so that tenders can be
      invited. This matter will need to be given full consideration by
       the Building Surveyor and Fire Service and a further report
      supplied to members in due course.

(j)   With reference to recommendation 18, the Club have instructed an
      independent turnstile servicing company to carry out an inspection.
      A copy of their report has not been supplied.

(k)   In considering recommendation 19, the Club have responded as
       follows: "I can confirm that the correlation between the viewing
      areas of the Spion Kop (southern end), New South Stand, John Street
       Stand and Terraces and the turnstiles serving those areas is such
       that all spectators intended to be admitted to those areas can pass
       through within one hour. In the Bramall Lane End Stand and Terrace
       areas on the Spion Kop (main area) servicing is necessary to some
       turnstiles before this criteria can be met. We hope to complete
       the work prior to the start of the'season on the 22nd August but if
       this is no.t possible, will reduce the capacity in those areas
       accordingly and inform you prior to the game taking place". This
       matter has been referred to the Building Surveyor and the Fire
       Service for their comment for independent checks to be made.

(1)   I have no information that closed circuit television has been
       installed.

(m)   The Club have confirmed that the signposting has been reviewed in
       accordance with recommendation 22. The Chief Licensing Officer has
       also inspected the grdund and confirmed that this is the case.

(n)   The Club has supplied a copy of their current tickets which seem to
      conform with recommendation 2 3 .

(o)   The Club do not request supporters to be in their places by a
       specified time.

(p)   The comments made in relation to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
       are equally pertinent to Sheffield United. This is also the case
       concerning the recommendations pertinent to co-ordination of
               emergency services.

      (q)      To comply with recommendation 39, the Club have confirmed that they
               have made arrangements with the St. John Ambulance Brigade to
               ensure at least one trained First Aider for 1,000 spectators is in
               attendance. This has been made a condition of the interim safety
               certificate.

      (r)      With reference to recommendation 40, consultation with need to take
               place with the Ambulance Service and other appropriate
               professionals to discuss this recommendation.

      (s)      The Club have confirmed that they will employ a medical
               practitioner in accordance with the provisions of recommendation
                41. This is also a condition of the Safety Certificate. The Club
               have not confirmed that he is trained and competent in advanced
               First Aid. Again, this is a matter which needs to be taken up with
               the appropriate professionals.

      (t)      With; reference to recommendation 42, the Club have confirmed that
                they have made arrangements with the Ambulance Authority for the
               necessary ambulance cover. Again, this is a provision in the
                interim Safety Certificate.

      (u)      With reference to recommendation 43, this is a matter which will
               require consultation by the Local Authority with the appropriate
               professional bodies.

3.3   Sheffield Sports Stadium

      The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
      Sports Stadium asking for the proposals on the implementation of the
      interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor. The Club have not
      provided the necessary details. The Building Surveyor, the Fire Service
      and Environmental Health Officers are to visit the Sports Stadium to
-     undertake a detailed inspection of the Ground with a view to establishing
      whether or not it is safe for the admission of spectators. The Acting
      Head of Administration and Legal Department has written to the Sports
      Stadium indicating that unless a satisfactory response is received to our
      letter seeking their'-proposals for implementation of the interim
      recommendations, then the Council have no choice but to consider issuing a
      prohibition notice relating to the premises. It is anticipated that a
      full report will be made to the General Purposes Panel at the"end of
      September once the members of the Advisory Group have reported back
      following their inspections.

4.    Matters for Consideration

4.1   Visits

      At its meetings on the 17th August, the General Purposes Panel stated an
      intention to visit all sports grounds with the City. All three Clubs have
      been notified of this request and a suitable date for a visit will be
      arranged.

4.2   The function of members in the future.

      It is clearly essential that there is a tightening up of existing
      procedures and a clarification of the terms of reference for dealing with
      the issue of Safety of Sports Grounds. At present, the General Purposes
      Panel has delegated authority to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds
issues. In the past, matters have been referred to the General Purposes
Panel for decisions as and when they were necessary. Members have
indicated an intention to participate more fully in this area; indeed,
this is required by the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.
The function of the Advisory Group must be to advise members and assist
them in providing enough information for members to make an informed and
rational decision as and when required. The Advisory Group is made up of
the Police, the Fire Service, the Building Surveyor, a representative from
the Department of Health and Consumer Services and the Ambulance Service
since the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor were published.
Prior to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, the meetings of the Advisory Group
were not as tightly controlled as they should have been. This has now
been improved. Arrangements have already been made for the Acting Head of
Administration and Legal Department to nominate a senior officer to Chair
the meetings of the Advisory Group and for full detailed minutes to be
taken. When the approved departmental structure has been completed, one
of the new Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department (Legal) will
undertake the function. It is suggested that one way of members becoming
more involved in this issue would be for them to be supplied with agendas
of the meetings prior to the meeting taking place and minutes of meetings
which have taken place. It is recommended that this is implemented.

Inspections

There is a statutory duty upon the local authority to inspect designated
sports grounds at least on an annual basis. In his interim
recommendations, Lord Justice Taylor has said that he feels more frequent
inspections would be of benefit. It is suggested that it may be
appropriate to undertake quarterly inspections, once during the close
season, once at the commencement of the season, once in the middle of the
season and once at the end. This would obviously require a substantial
devotion of resources. It is recommended that this is implemented.

Emergency Procedures

In the normal course of events, matters will obviously be referred to a
Sub-Committee of the Council for consideration. The delegated authority
in respect of these functions is vested the General Purposes Panel.
Recent events have highlighted the need for a proper emergency system to
be set up. In view of the fact that the Licensing Department is part of
the Administration & Legal Department,_it would seem logical for this
emergency delegation to be granted to the Acting Head of Administration &
Legal Department in consultation with the chair of the General Purposes
Panel. Members are asked to comment upon this.

Resources

The existing structure of the Licensing Section is shown in the attached
diagram. It consists of a Chief Licensing Officer, a Principal Licensing
Officer, three Licensing Officers and an Administrative Assistant. The
Section was originally comprised of five staff which were increased to six
by the addition of the Administrative Assistant's post in 1986 upon the
abolition of South Yorkshire County Council. The increase was to take
account of the additional responsibilities taken on by the Section upon
abolition of South Yorkshire County Council.

The Section is responsible for the processing, issuing, monitoring and
enforcing of numerous licences and consents; for example hackney carriage
licences and private hire licences, public entertainment licences, cinema
licences, theatre licences, street collection permits, sex shop permits,
mini bus licences and the licensing of sports grounds. The work requires
 a comprehensive knowledge of the relevant legislation and much of the work
• is carried out under delegated powers.

 The Effect of the Hillsborough Disaster

 This has had repercussions throughout the Section since the Chief
 Licensing Officer has been engaged full time since April in dealing with
 the Inquiry and subsequently the interim recommendations of Lord Justice
 Taylor.

 One of the recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor is that "each Local
 Authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring,
 enforcing, reviewing', amending and renewing safety certificates." It is
 clear that at present, this requires a substantial devotion of officer
 time and that this is likely to continue indefinitely. Whilst the Chief
 Licensing Officer is engaged full time on this task, other important
 duties are neglected.

  It is clear that further resources need to be devoted to the issue of
_ safety of sports grounds. It is"anticipated that it will require between
  75$ and 100$ of one persons time to deal with safety of sports grounds
  issues in the short term. This will entail dealing with the existing
  designated sports grounds in the City, namely Sheffield Wednesday Football
  Club, Sheffield United Football Club and Sheffield Sports Stadium. It is
 hoped that by next Spring, a workable and well understood administrative
  system will be in effect which should mean that there will be no need to
  repeat much of the work which has been done to improve the administrative
  systems. However, the World Student Games Facilities are currently under
  construction and will have a significant impact in respect of the work on
  safety of sports grounds.

 It is anticipated that additional staff will be required to fulfill these
 functions. A proposed new structure is shown in diagram form and attached
 to this report. The proposal is that an additional post of Chief
 Licensing Officer with- specific responsibility for sports grounds is
 created. There is also a need for an additional Licensing Officer who
 will have direct responsibility to the Chief Licensing Officer for sports
 grounds. Also attached to this report are draft job descriptions. In
 addition to their specific duties relating to sports grounds, it is
 anticipated that the'se two officers will as and when necessary provide
 support to the existing structure which will continue to deal with the
 general licensing functions.

 The benefits of the changes

 The increase in staff should ensure that the Licensing Section can
 continue to function efficiently and provide a reasonable level of
 service. It should enable the Licensing Section to improve its service
 delivery and enable a review of licensing systems to be undertaken, and
 proper enforcement of legislation to take place. During the last two
 years, it has become clear that the quantity of work carried out within
 the Licensing Section has increased. There has been an increase in the
 number of private hire vehicle licences issued in particular as well as a
 general increase in most areas. The World Student Games Facilities will
 also in all probability require public entertainments licences requiring
 additional devotion of time from the Licensing Section. In the light of
 the Hillsborough Disaster, it is important that a proper allocation of
 resources is made and consideration needs to be given to the allocation of
 resources and priorities in other areas.
The cost of the proposals

Taking account of the recent pay offer, the cost of implementing the
proposals in a full year will total £26,460, taking account of salaries
and additional costs. Clearly, some of this will be recoverable by way of
licensing fees which can be charged for the issue and amendment of safety
certificates for sports grounds. There is statutory authority to enable
the Council to charge fees for the issue, amendment and transfer of Safety
Certificates. The fee charged must be commensurate with the work actually
and reasonably done. No charge has yet been made for the issue and
amendment of certificate since the first amendment and certificate which
were issued with those issued recently. The original certificate issued
to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was that which had been issued by the
former County Council. The Acting Head of Administration and Legal
Department has sought the views of the various bodies which have an imput
into Safety of Sports Grounds issues to enable a full discussion to take
place about the levels of charges which should be levied. A full report
will be made to members once further information is available in this
respect. For the future, however, it is anticipated that in accordance
with Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations, certificates will be issued on
an annual basis and thus a charge will be made annually. This charge will
reflect the inspections which take place and the administrative
procedures. There may be a need for additional devotion of resources to
cover the necessary expenditure.

Recommendations

Members are asked

      "To note the contents of this report and to authorise the creation
       of two additional posts of Chief Licensing Officer and Licensing
       Officer to deal with Safety of Sports Grounds issues subject to the
       proposals being discussed and agreed with the appropriate Trade
       Onions in line with the Council's (Responding to Change) agreement.

                                  CHAPTER 24- T H E RECOMMENDATIONS.

  315. The recommendations which follow are the m inim um necessary to ensure that existing football
grounds can for the present be safely used, based upon the evidence which I have heard at Sheffield and other
inform ation I have received. They complement the recommendations which Mr Justice Popplewell set out
after his inquiry at Bradford.

  316. Those which are asterisked should be'carried out before the 1989/90 season starts. The rest should be
started «forthwith
         •   k
                   and completed as scion as possible.
           k*
M aximum Capacities for Terraces
*       1. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas ■which are self-containetL'the Safety Certificate
      should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

      A pen or area is to be deemed •‘self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
      another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

*      2. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green
      Guide (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

      (a) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
          which should reduce the permissible densiry in accordance with the range of maximum figures specified
          in paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide:

       (b) after assessing **the Green Guide figure”, a deduction of 15% should be made to improve the safety
           margin.

         3. Arrangements should be made:-

       (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
           figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 2 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
           ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

       (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.


F illing and Monitoring Terraces
»        4. There should be a written agreement berween the club and the police setting out their respective
     • responsibilities for crowd safety and control and in particular for the filling of each self-contained pen or
       ether terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. .Any
       variation of the agreement in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

*     * 5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
       area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a poiice officer t if the police are monitoring it ) whose
       sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
       period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other steward
       or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under Recommendation 9
       below, and by radio to the control room.


F ences and Gates
         6.     All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the terraced areas and especially those with
       duties under Recommendation5 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
       crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
       demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise
       different crowd densities.

■»        7. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
       different colour from the rest of the fence and marked " Emergency Exit” .
★    8. Where there are perimeter fences, ail gates to the pitch should be kept fully open during the period
    when .spectators a n oa the f m r * .

★     9. There should be in respect of each gate in a perimeter fence (or group of gates if they are close together)
    a police officer authorised to deride whether or not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve overcrowding.
    The officer so anthorised ia respect of each g3te should be identified for each match and known to be so by ail
    stewards and police officers in that vicinity. He should be able to make radio contact with the control room
    either himself or ria an officer dose at hand.

★   * 10. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the ciub at each ground where there
    ire perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
    necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether t h r equipment should be used by police, the fire
    brigade or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
    nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crash Barriers
★     11. All crush barriers should be visually inspected immediately for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found
    » be affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

★     12. The layout of harriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately to ensure that it
    complies with the criteria contained in Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not. the assessment of the
    maximum capacity figure for that pen or terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation I above, should
    reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
      13. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate by the responsible local authority,
    which should consult the ciub in respect of which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the
    ambulance service and the building authority. Such a review.should include an inspection of the stadium. Its
    ooject should be to ensure that the operative conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or
    sabsrimte any condition shown to be necessary as a matter of urgency following the findings and
    recommendations in this report.

     14. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium designated under the 19?5 Act for
    which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

      15. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authorin' at least once annually and each
    Certificate should require to be renewed annually.


       16. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
    amending and renewing Safety CertificatesvSuch review should require that there exists or is provided an
    accountable administrative structure whereby the functions of the local authority are resuiariv and
    effectively supervised by senior officers and elected members and decisions are property taken in accordance
    with the local authority's rules.

       I <. To assist the local authoriry in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group consisting
    of appropriate members of its own stalL representatives-of the police, of the fire and ambulance services, of
    the building authority, of the ciub and of a recognised supporters’ club. The Advisory Group’s terms of
    reference should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the
    ground and attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from tiie. locai auihorin.
    and an effective procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce reguiar
    written reports for consideration by the locai authority.


Dunes of each Football Club
r                   tu rn stile should be inspected a nd its p o te n tia l rate of flo** m e a su re d . T h e re a fte r, r e s u i a r

  UPDATING REPORT TO MUNICIPAL ENTERPRISE AND GENERAL SERVICES COMMITTEE

                     SUBJECT: SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS


PURPOSE OF REPORT:

This report is an appendage to the general report upon this issue. That
report gives details of the responses which have been received from the
respective football clubs within the City to the proposals of Lord Justice
Taylor in his interim recommendations pursuant to the enquiries into the
Hillsborough Disaster. There were a number of oustanding issues referred
to in the general report.   The Acting Head of Administration and Legal
Department has taken these matters up with the various clubs and this
report updates that position.

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB

The Acting Head of Administration and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
Wednesday Football Club on 5th September, 1989 in respect of the matter
which did not seem to have been dealt within accordance with the interim
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor. Copies of the letter of 5th
September and the response of the Club are attached. The matter was
referred to the General Purposes Panel on 8 th September who confirmed that
they were satisfied that the Club had responded appropriately and that it
was not therefore appropriate to consider the issue of a prohibition
notice. There is now a need to consider in detail via the Advisory Group
the responses of the Club.

SHEFFIELD UNITED FOOTBALL CLUB

The Acting Head of Administration .and Legal Department wrote to Sheffield
United Football Club on 6 th September. A copy of that letter and the
Club'_s responses are attached. The matter was referred to the General
Purposes Panel on 8 th September who confirmed that since the Club had
responded in accordance with the interim recommendations of Lord Justice
Taylor, it was not appropriate to consider the issue of a prohibition
notice at this stage,. Again, the matter will need to be considered in
detail through the Advisory    Groupand matters referred to members in due
course.

SHEFFIELD SPORTS STADIUM

Owlerton Stadium have now responded in accordance with the interim
recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.    The Advisory Group is meeting on
14th September to consider whether or not the ground is safe. The General
Purposes Panel will meet on15th September to consider whether or not to
issue a prohibition notice.    This will depend upon the content of the
report it receives from the Advisory Group. Copies of the relevant
correspondence are attached for members information.

RECOMMENDATION

Members are asked to note the contents of this report.

    Dear Sir,

    Re;       Safety of Sports Grounds Act

    I am in receipt of your letter dated 5th September 1989.

    In respect of the points raised please find enclosed a copy of our matchday
    tickets for the current season. The wording on the tickets for visiting
    supporters was printed at the request of the Police.

    In addition I am able to confirm that the additional medical practitioner is
    trained and competent in advanced First Aid.

    The stewarding plan has been completed but at present it is still in draft form
    as the Police and ourselves have been making minor amendments at each of our two
    hone matches. Once the plan has been finalised I will have it typed and forward
    a copy.

    Withrregard to your letter dated 17th August 1989, containing Officers comments,
    I will deal with the points that were raised in order:

Dear Sirs,

Re: Safety of Sports Grounds

I refer to previous correspondence in connection with this matter. I refer
particularly to the interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor which
required implementation prior to commencement of the football season. The
General Purposes Panel of the City Council recently gave consideration to those
matters which required implementation prior to commencement of the football
season and remained outstanding. These -appear to be as follows:-

(a)     With reference to recommendation 41, I have not received confirmation frou
        you that the medical practitioner you propose to employ is qualified in
        advanced first aid.

(b)     I refer to your letter of 16th August in which you indicated servicing was
        necessary to some turnstiles in the Bramall Lane stand and terrace areas
        and the Spion K.op area. I look forward to hearing from you with some
        indication as po whether or not this servicing has been completed and the
        effect upon capacity in those areas.

(c)     The rinal point is a minor one, but please would you confirm that ste-aras
        have now been trained in the use of bcut croppers. You indicated that
        there was a proposal for the Fire Service to undertake such training.

The members of the General Purposes Panel indicated that unless a satisfactory
response is received to these items by the close of business or. 7th September
1389, they felt they had no option but to consider the issue of a Prohibit io-.
'otice in respect of the Sports Ground.  I therefore look forward to hearing
from you.

Yours faithfully,                   _____________

            Dear Sir,

            Re: Safety of Sports Ground

            Further to your letter date 6 September, I set out below our replies
            to the points therein:-

            a)    I con firm th a t our m ed ical p r a c t i t i o n e r i s competent in advanced
                  f i r s t a id .

            b)    I confirm that the necessary turnstile servicing has been completed.

            c) The stewards who will bo operating the bolt croppers have been
               trained in their use. In addition the fire service is organising
               a half day course to incorporate fire extinguisher and cutting
               equipment use which will serve as a useful refresher course.

        -   Yours f a i t h f u l l y .

                         Policing however is reo.uired for Rugby matches and they will only provide
                         such policing if the Stadium is issued with a Safety Certificate.

Hr:-:. Woodhead.                                                                                                              7th September, 1989.


     c)      A random sample of the barriers and perimeter walls on the back straight
             terrace have been load tested. Stress tests indicate that the barriers
             and walls will safely withstand Category ’B* loading. The general condition
             of the barrier is good.   _ ,

             The opening between the perimeter wall and rows of barriers satisfies ^
             the requirement of the Green Guide in respect of the slope of the terrace.
             However, the spacing of the individual barriers, along the rows does
             not strictly comply with the suggested arrangement shown in Figure 3 of the
             Green Guide. We would therefore expect the capacity of that particular
             area of terrace to be reduced accordingly.

     d)     We have checked the turnstiles which are in use three nights a week and we
             can average ten people per minute per turnstile. On this calculation with
            ten turnstiles operating at the main entrance we would easily accommodate
            the imposed limit within the Statutory Hour. For sports other than Rugby
            League we can accommodate expected crowds within thirty minutes.

             The turnstiles themselves are awaiting mechanical checks by Mayer Turnstiles.

     e)     The Interim Report requires us to have 1 first aid member per 1,000 ofcrowd
            and we usually have at least double this for stock car racing.

     r)     Our medical prac-t-itioner for motor sports is:-
             Dr. Colin Shawcross,

             Sheffield, 5.
             (Tel.No.|                   1

             He is retained and approved by the R.A.C. and is qualified to the highest
             degree in advanced first aid.

             He is located in the Private Box with the Duty Safety Officer throughout
             the evening where he can observe the racing and where he can reach the
             First Aid Room. He is contactable by telephone and the Duty Officer's radio.

             As far as the 156 greyhound racing days are concerned we have been unable
             to obtain the services of a Doctor as yet as racing clashes with surgery
             hours. We are arranging with Para Medical Organisations that a member of
             their staff is present at the First Aid Room at every meeting and would
             ask the General Purposes Panel to consider our request that this measure
             would suffice for the time being.

                       Fire Service Requirements



The following   means of escape must be checked

(a)   Area 1 - The East Terrace

        (i)     Egress from Liversey Street endvia Gate ’H ’ steps   or a
                ramp, with handrails is required from the top gangway
                adjacent TH ' .

       (ii)     Egress at the opposite end should be via a ramp or steps
                etc. descending down from the NE corner of the terrace
                around the back of the Sportsman Tavern linking up with
                the walkway to Gate 'A'.



(b)   Area 2 - The Sportsman Terrace and Tavern

        (i)     In order to provide an alternative means of escape from
                the "dead end" area of terracing, a new exit should be
                formed adjacent to the Sportsman Tavern leading down to
                the walkway at the rear of the terracing.  The exit
                should be signed and constructed in accordance with the
                "Green Guide".  This new exit route should be signed so
                as to terminate at Gate TA'.



(c)   Ares 3 - Panorama Suite and Main Stand Seating Ares

        (i)     The single unit emergency exit route at the front south
                corner of the Panorams Room requires attention.   The
                outer door should be fitted with a panic bar mechanism
                and the external wooden stairs require maintenance.   The
                approach to the final exit door from the Panorama Room
                should be level throughout.   Also the wall that separates
                the Panorama room off from this exit lobby should be made
                half hour fire resisting in order to afford protection
                for persons using the "judges" rooms.

       (ii)     The inner set of double fire resisting doors in the
                Panorama Room that are situated adjacent the kitcher. and
                betting office require to open outwards only.    They must
                be made single siring and fitted with 25 mm rebates
                around the edge.   Smoke seals and intumescent protection
                 to rebates and meeting stiles should be provided.

      (iii)     The double fire resisting doors at the top of the stairs
                opposite the ones mentioned in (ii) above also require
                 the same attention.

       (iv)     The double doors leading from the Panorama Room into the
                 Sponsors Box are partially obstructed by tables and
                 chairs.  These should be rearranged so that the full exit
                width is kept clear.

        (v)     Final exit Gate 'F' is partially obstructed by s ccr.crete
                 statue.  This requires removing.
         (vi)    Another area of concern to this authority is the means of
                 escape for staff situated in the Hare Control Box.   This
                 room is situated above the main seating stand roof.
                 Access is via the betting offices located within the
                 Panorama Room.  The travel distance from the control rooa
                 into the betting office is about 20 metres.  Although the
                 route across the stand roof is constructed to a minimum
                 standard of half hour fire resistance the exit of the
                 betting office is not so constructed and due to the
                 louvred windows via which betting is carried out, it
                 would be very difficult to achieve any standard of fire
                 resistance.

                 Alternative escape must therefore be provided from the
                 Hare Control Box.



(d)     Area H

          (i)    A clear walkway should be provided across the front of
                 the Greyhound bar leading to properly constructed steps
                 or ramps etc. that lead up and over the banking behind
                 the East Face of the Greyhound Bar and then to exit via
                 gate 'G*.  This would alleviate the dead-end situation.


Fire Alarm System

(a)     All buildings within the grounds to which the public or staff have
        access should be provided with an electrical fire warning system
        to alert staff.  Areas underneath spectator accommodation are to
        be provided with automatic fire detection in the form of heat or
        smoke detectors connected into the main fire alarm system.  The
        installation must comply with British Standard 5839 Part 1 1988
        and consultation with the Fire Authority should take place before
        accepting installation designs or specifications.


Ground Safety Control Room

A central control room must be set aside for supervisory officers such
as Police Safety Officers etc. and should contain:-

  (i)      Fire Alarm Control and Indicator Panel.

 (ii)      Telephone with exclusive line.

(iii)      Public address equipment so that messages can be heard under
           reasonable conditions (including emergencies) by all persons of
           normal hearing in any part of*the ground to which the public
           has access.  The system should be capable of addressing
           messages to each zone of the premises.  The power supply to the
           system should enable it to operate after failure of the mains
           supply and cables should have similar protection to that
           required for the fire alarm system.
                                         -   10-

4.   Emergency Lighting System

     (a)     Emergency Lighting must therefore be provided in all parts of the
             premises accessible to the public and along all exit routes with
             exit signs clearly illuminated; Installation should be in
             accordance with British Standard 5266 Part 1 1988 and have a
             duration of at least 3 hours after mains failure.



5.   Signs

     (a)     A comprehensive system of signposting which clearly indicates
             routes to the various parts of the ground, and to the exits from
             the ground should be provided.  Signs relating to fire safety
             should be in accordance with British Standard 5499 Part 1 1984.
             Exit gates themselves are to be clearly indicated and signs should
             be illuminated by the lighting system.



6.   Other Fire Safety Items

     (a)   The     timber seated area requires the following work:-

                 (i)   remove rubbish from underneath.

              (ii)     seal the outer faces of the stand to prevent unauthorised
                       access.

             (iii)     seal all gaps in order to prevent rubbish falling into
                       the void beneath the stand (Para. 149).

     (b)   Any LPG cylinders must be stored in accordance with        relevant
            guidance notes.

     (c)   Walls and ceiling linings within stands, bar areas, viewing rooms
            and covered terraces should have a flame spread classification of
            not less than Class 1 when tested in accordance with BS 476 Part
            7.

     (d)   The timber constructed buildings that adjoin escape routes should

     Dear Mr Bownes

     In reply to your recent letter and meeting at my Headquarters, I would like
     to elaborate on points which have direct bearing on the involvements of
     this Service in playing its part to ensure that places of public activity
     are made as safe as possible.    Should this Service be required to attend
     such specified activities, it will do so in the knowledge that that the
     preparation for its part has been undertaken by the only professional
     organisation in South Yorkshire, with the expertise and resources to do so,
     The South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service.

     The South Yorkshire Ambulance Service should be involved in the formal
     planning stage in any function and have a right to be represented at
     committee stages if there is a need to raise formal objections.

     This service would expect involvement with the Certification Authority to
     any public   gathering which they   licence,  i.e. Pop Concerts,   Sports
     Complexes, World Student Games etc.

     SYMAS would not automatically accept Police or any other                         organisation's
     decisions" on Ambulance requirements at specified activities.

     There is a positive need to identify inadequacies in communication systems
     and satisfy ourselves that they are up to the required standard.

     The South Yorkshire Ambulance Service would most certainly expect to be
     consulted regarding the location and accommodation for casualties, i.e
     First Aid Rooms, and      the  standard, quality  and quantity of medical
     equipment retained on-site.   SYMAS is able to supply and replenish stocks
     of medical equipment*at reasonable rates, and can assess the need for each
     individual stadium or area of specified activity.

     SYMAS would be able to offer advice on the most suitable access and egress,
     Casualty Clearing and Temporary Mortuary Points.

     If the Club Doctor is    there specifically to treat players then it is
     recommended that another named doctor be identified who is available to
     treat spectators.    It is   imperative that     the doctor is trained in
     resuscitation skills to the    National Health Service Training Authority
     Paramedic standard.




                                                                                                CP65/32586

Mr Bownes


The British Red Cross Society and St John's Ambulance Brigade will need to
be informed of any activity in which SYMAS has a role to play.  SYMAS will
take overall charge of the situation and the voluntary organisations will
work under SYMAS directions.

The South Yorkshire Ambulance Service have mass evacuation, crowd situation
and civil disorder training and have practical experience in all these
problem areas.   SYMAS staff are NOT first aiders - Ambulance aid is the
function of this Service.

Any provision    stipulated   by   the Licensing   Authority will   be   provided   by
this Service.

Any alteration to plans and planning for Football Stadiums and specified
activities must be noted to the Statutory Ambulance Authority. The Service
would also require plans of changes to the surrounding area.

SYMAS should be automatically included on all mailing lists with particular
emphasis on PLANS, OFFICIALS and MEETINGS.    The Service may then take the
decision as to whether or not they will attend specified meetings.

SYMAS will be the organising authority for its resources.  The charges for
such resources will be levied at the certificate holder, who will only pay
for the initial resources7~requested in writing to SYMAS.

SYMAS is an accredited Health and Safety training organisation and would
very much like to be involved with the training of all support staff to
Football Stadiums and specified activities.

I feel sure that with regard to the areas I have covered, you will be
convinced that this organisation can be of valuable assistance to your
department   on  the  annual  inspection  for   the   granting  of  Safety
certificates.   Should you feel this is the case, my services to the
Licensing Authority will be free from any charge.   I look forward to your
reply.

If I can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate to contact
either myself or my Staff Officer, Mr R Morley, at the above address.

                          Improved communications are bound to feature in any review
                          of a system which by its very nature involves disparate
                          agencies and individuals.   Some specific comments on
                          improvements in   communications will be made later inthis
                         memo in relation to other review areas.     However, in
                          general terms I feel that communications both within and by
                          the Officer Advisory Group will only achieve a satisfactory
                          level if we have tight role definition of individuals,
                          agencies and forums, an efficient secretariat, and strong
                          and informed leadership to provide co-ordination.    I feel
          ?              that this will only be achieved by    the investment of a
                          significantly increased resource into this area by the City
                          Council.

                 1.2     Public Relations.

                          I am not clear as to your meaning when you refer to
                          improvements in   public relations, consequently, I have no
                          comment to make in regard to this issue.

                 1.3     Role of Elected Members.

                          It is difficult for me to comment on this issue with regard
                          to the present system, as central to the review of the
                          involvement of elected members is an understanding of the
                          level of delegation of authority from the City Council to
                          its relevant Committees, Sub-Committees, Panels and
                          Officers, this information I do not have.  I will, however,
                          suggest that a suitable future arrangement would involve
                          the delegation of full authority for enforcement of the
                          1975 Act to a suitable Chief Officer who would then be in a
                          position to expediently carry out the function. Involvement
                          of elected members would then be ensured by periodic
                          reports to a relevant Sub-Committee of progress in carrying
                          out this function.  A suitable analogous position is that
                          within my own Department where the Director and Assistant
                          Director of Health and Consumer Services have full
                          delegated power including the power to approve the
                          instigation of legal proceedings.  Members are kept
                          informed by frequent reports on progress to the relevant
                                   - 2 -


             Sub-Committee of the Health and Consumer Services Programme
             Committee.

2.   THE ROLE OF EACH MEMBER OF THE ADVISORY GROUP.

     2.1    The Role of Health and Consumer Services is as I see it to
             provide a general safety overview, to assess safety,
            management, planning, and performance, and to provide
             advice on specific issues, for example, the provision of
            medical and first aid facilities.

     2.2     It should be noted that the role of the Department will
              significantly change in April of 1990 when the re­
              allocation of enforcement responsibilities   for theHealth
              and Safety at Work Act 1974 is undertaken.    It is
              understood that responsibility for the enforcement of this
              legislation in sports grounds will be transferred from the
              Health and Safety Executive to the Local Authority Sector
           _ and therefore this Department.

     2.3     Though I have stated quite clearly what I feel tobe the
             role of this Department in the Advisory Group, I am
             conscious of the fact that in providing a general safety
             overview, there is almost bound to be some overlap between
             our role and the role of other members of the
             Advisory Group.  I think it is essential that the Advisory
             Group find the time to discuss the allocation of
             responsibility to ensure that the primary objective of
             covering all aspects of public safety at sports grounds
             does not lead to unnecessary duplication of effort and
             potential conflict within the working group.


3.   REVIEW OF THE COUNCIL'S APPROACH TO CLUBS.

     3.1    I agree with your assessment of the Council's approach in
             the past and also that a much more positive approach is
            required.   In formulating this more positive approach I
            would "suggest that the following issues should be borne in
            mind.

             (i)    The club should be in no doubt as to what is required
                    and when.  They should, therefore, be provided with a
                    concise schedule of matters requiring their attention
                    which includes time scales and explanation of the
                    implications of non-compliance.

             (ii)   The schedule of matters should represent the
                    Council's opinion, i.e. it should be formulated as a
                    result of the joint deliberations of the members of
                    the Advisory Group.  All communications with the
                    clubs relating to the schedule of matters should be
                    by the City Council.  Contact by individual
                    disciplines should be only with the agreement of the
                    City Council.

             (iii) The responsibility of assessing the satisfactory
                   completion of works or action should be allocated to
                   a relevant named member of the Advisory Group who
                   then would then be in a position to report back to
                   the group.
                                    - 3 -


4.   RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE CLUB AND THEIR ADVISERS.

     4.1     I absolutely agree.   The Council should deal with a
              nominated member of the club's management structure.  In
             most cases this will probably be the club's safety officer.
              Direct dealings with the club's advisers would not in most
              cases be appropriate.


5.   INSPECTION-AND ENFORCEMENT OF CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS.

     5.1     Accepting of course that inspections of designated sports
              grounds should be in accordance with Home Office Circular
              72/1987, I feel that there should be four levels to such
              inspections.

             (i)    An immediate assessment of the designated stadia for
                    compliance or otherwise with green guide design
                    criteria should be undertaken.   Though the inspection
                    reports dated June, 1989, provided by this Department
                    would suffice from our perspective, I anticipate that
                    the other agencies involved would wish to carry out a
                    full and complete reassessment of the stadia.   If
                    this is to be undertaken with the minimum of
                    duplication and with the maximum of efficiency, then
                    it is essential that some standardisation is agreed
                    upon to enable all inspection reports to be
                    complementary.

             (ii)   "During progress" inspections of the stadia should be
                    carried out at different types of event and in
                    different conditions, i.e. rain, snow, darkness,
                    etc., to assess compliance with the operational
                    aspects of safety management and performance.

             (iii) Inspections should be carried out to assess progress
                   with the completion of works required by the City
                   Council as a result of previous inspections.
             (iv) *A full annual inspection of the stadia in accordance
                   with HOC 79/1987.

     5.2     The results of any inspection would need to be discussed by
             the Advisory Group in order to produce a concise, consensus
             of matters requiring attention to be forwarded to the club
             with time scales, etc. as previously indicated.

     5.3     Though there must of course be provision to deal with
             urgent matters (this issue would be covered by having
             executive authority vested in a relevant Chief Officer) as
             a general rule the inspection should provide information
             for discussion in the Advisory Group. On site unilateral
             decisions should be avoided if possible where there is the
             potential for a conflict of interest.

     5.5     With regard to the enforcement of the 1975 Act I believe my
             previous comments with regard to delegation and executive
             authority would in most instances make for efficient and
             speedy enforcement of the legislation.  There is, however,
             a need for a system to be set in place which identifies how
             any breach of certificate conditions would be brought to
             the attention of the relevant Officer of the Council by any
             of the other agencies involved in inspections of stadia.
                                       - 4 -


               Once again the existence of an Officer with executive power
               would much simplify this situation.

6.     THE ROLE OF THE ADVISORY GROUP AND ITS ADMINISTRATION.

       6.1    It is this issue that warrants most comment and
               consideration.  From my limited experience of the workings
               of the Advisory Group, I would make the following comments
               and recommendations.

               (i)    The role of the Group should be to provide the City
                      Council with expert and technical advice and comment
                      on the wide range of issues relating to safety of
                      sports grounds.

       '      (ii)    The Group should be formally constituted and its
                       relationship with the City Council established.   It
                       should be chaired by a Senior Officer of the Council
                       who has a technical grounding in safety matters and
                       is able to interpret and assimilate technical
                       reports.  In the light of Mr. Bownes evidence to the
                       Inquiry, I would suggest that a more appropriate
                       Officer would be available from within Health and
                       Consumer Services or the Building Surveyor's
                       Division of the Department of Land and Planning.

               (iii) The Group should be provided with a permanent
                     secretariat who would therefore be in a position to
                     provide the formal minutes of the meetings which are
                     essential and to advise on procedural matters.

               (iv)    The Advisory Group should meet at the request of the
                       City Council and these meetings should be held
                       regularly on pre-determined dates (say bi-monthly).
                       In this way it would be possible to consider reports
                       of "during progress" inspections, to deliberate on
                       proposals for work notified under Section 8 of the
                       1975 Act and make recommendations.  The clubs should
                      'be notified of the frequency and dates of Advisory
                       Group meetings and be required to submit proposals-
                       accordingly. In this way the Advisory Group will not
                       be swamped by numerous proposals for work immediately
                       before the start of the closed season.

7.     SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

       I do have some minor comments to make on the draft condition,'
       however I believe that these could be properly discussed at a
       furture meeting of the Advisory Group.


I hope that you find my comments constructive and I look forward to
discussing them with you in the near future.

         From Director
            Department of Land and t‘lapsing                           s    / u 3 uvV
    Vour Ref SP/262/D223/
    Our Re: ES/KwGE \fty>
    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975(as’amended).
    Review of Administration and Inspection Procedures.
    I refer to your memo of 25 July which I nave now considered in relation
    to Re«meB«ations 13-1? of the Interim Hillsborough Report. (4 Aug),
    Clearly they cover siaiiar ground.
    I vvcS sore than a little dismayed at the terms m which your memo
    is couched, As the Department responsible for administration of the
    function I vrould have thought that you were already well aware of
    the shortcomings of the present system and would have produced a
    draft revision c: procedures on which interested parties could have
    been asked to consent.
    However I will endeavour to respond to the matters raised.
    1 Role cf the Advisory Group and its Administration.
    a) 'Given that your Department is to retain the co-ordination role-??hich I
    support in principle-1 feel that the existing Advisory Group
    arrangements must be reinforced on the lines set out in Interim
    Recommendation 17. However I see it as essential that the Group is either
    chaired by you or another Council Chief or Assistant Chief Officer.
    The Group must be seen as the principal source of advice to the appropiate
    committee or panel considering Ground Safety Certificates,et ai.
    bWhilst Member involvement should be confined to the approval or
    consideration of the recommendation of the Advisory Group,this poses
    questions as to the frequency of meetings and the need to define officer
    delegations.
    c'il suggest that your Licensing Section should be the Secretariat of
    the Group but it must be reinforced for this role.
    d)The Secretariat must be capable of ensuring that all salient advice has
    been sought and has been given at the appropriate time and be able to distil
    the essence of that advice to Clubs.
    This is most important because many aspects of ground conditions
    are of concern to several different officers or Authorities-
    there are few areas discrete to one person.
    2 Role of each member of the Advisory Group.
    I note that under the Act as amended this year the role of"Building
    Authority".which in Shire Counties is a separate responsibility undertaken
    by Districts,is now subsumed into the Council's general role as
    Local(Certifying) Authority, Nevertheless it appears to me that the Building
    Surveyor’s Division should continue to be the principal adviser on the
    following:
 ;A11 setters relating to the structural condition of buildings and other
structures at Sports Grounds designated under the Act such as freestanding
walIs,fences,pylons,crash barriers,steps,stairways and also replated
stands.etc."

■5 -jccisunications
?.esulrr and properly minuted meetings c: the Advisory C - r o •‘fould deal with
m e essence of these problems.
4 Council's appreash to the Clubs
A clear and positive stance.as outlined,is vital and is supported.
5 Relationships with Clubs and their Advisers.
Vlhilst I agree v?i:h the suggestive: yutiiacd I s:. pv u ^ v-1. ;hr-:
this should not preclude direct discussions taking plaoe between
officers of th-                     ^
in order to sfrpfove, ?cssible solutions to problems. This is
particularly important where,apart froa considerations under the
Safety of Sports Ground Act,there are concurrent considerations
relating to meeting Building Regulation requirements on deposited
plans or submitted Building Notices. It as an important part of the
process which should not be compromised unduly by the need for the
Council to :1speak with one voice".
6 Inspection and enforcement of Certificate conditions.
Bearing in mind that it remains the duty of Clubs to ensure safety, 1 feel
that an annual full inspection by approporiate officers should suffice
supplemented by ad hoc random visits at match days,or otherwise,by certain
designated officers reporting back to the Advisory Group, However,this will
require a detailed procedural guide to be established and agreed.
Given that at this stage v;e are stuck with the legislation as it
stands,we must not,of course,overlook the fact that the Government may yet
choose to adopt a different body to carry out the certifying
function in future.
I note the latest revision of Draft Safety Conditions, These are being
examined and will be the subject of a seperate memo in due course.
My apologies for the quality of the memo which has been produced under
the difficulties created bv the current industrial action.

 Dear Sirs

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
 REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE/INSPECTION SYSTEM

 Thank you for your letter of 25th July, 1989, inviting my comments upon                                                                                the
 above mentioned review which you are undertaking as a result of                                                                                        the
 Hillsborough Inquiry.

 Since you invite comment on matters other than those you havelisted,                                                                             I    take
 this opportunity of giving my thoughts on other aspects.

 The comments cure in three parts as follows

  (i)   My thoughts on how the City Council might proceed.
  (ii)  The legal position regarding consultation, acceptance of advice and
        enforcement.
  (iii) Comments on the headings contained in the letter.

 !•         How the Council Might Proceed

 1.1        I consider that urgent priority needs to be given to the replacement of
             the Sheffield Wednesday certificate and the issue of General Safety
             Certificates in respect of Bramall Lane and Owlerton Sports Grounds.

 1.2        To achieve the above objective I recommend that the multi-disciplined
             safety team approach which has always been used should be retained.    I
             am of the opinion however that the City Council will have to become more
             actively involved in the process than it has in the past.

 1.3        Manpower resources will be needed to enable the City Council to co­
            ordinate the inspections and advice of the Advisory Group, evidence at
            the Inquiry suggested that the officer concerned was overburdened.    In
            my view your officers must arrange and Chair meetings and produce prompt
            and accurate minutes for circulation; correspond directly with the clubs
                                     - 1 -

                               All communications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.
      to obtain plans and information pursuant to the issue of certificates;
      generally act as the catalyst to ensure that General Safety Certificates
      are issued as soon as possible and that clubs get on with any
      outstanding work is requiredjto inform the Council when it has been
      completed so that arrangements can be made for the safety team to
      inspect.

1.4   I would emphasise that the City Council is not entitled to take the view
      that it is for the Fire Service rather than the Council to pursue the
      clubs to ensure that work is completed. As you may know it has been
      necessary in the past for the Fire Service to ask the Council to remind
      clubs of the need for action. The Fire Service has limited manpower
      resources at its disposal and, in addition to its main statutory
      responsibility, for issuing fire certificates under the Fire Precautions
      Act 1971, it also gives advice to the Council on means of escape and
      fire precautions in literally hundreds of premises for which the City
      Council is the responsible licensing Authority.

1.5   I am of the opinion that all three designated grounds and in particular
      Sheffield Wednesday should be comprehensively surveyed by the individual
      members of the Advisory Group. This is emphasised by the views on the
      apparent low level of maintenance of grounds noted by the Building
      Surveyor and Health & Consumer Services. Each department should act in
      unison in this respect rather than separately. The Green Guide and the
      interim recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor should form the basis of
      the standard to be achieved and in this connection the City Council will
      need to consider and make known its policy as regards the use of
      professional judgement in cases where provisions within sports grounds
      fall below that of the Green Guide. I say this in the light of the
      attitude which was apparent from some quarters during the Hillsborough
      Inquiry that the Green Guide should be applied without flexibility. I
      would emphasise that I will always require my officers to apply their
      professional judgement in applying any code of guidance.

1.6   At the same time the many recommendations stemming from the extremely
      comprehensive safety audits carried out by the Council's Health and
      Consumer Services Department, many of which cut across the expertise of
      other disciplines will need to be actively considered except for those
      aspects which are required to be implemented before the commencement of
      the football season. I note one recommendation for the restriction of
      use of two sections of the Spion Kop at Hillsborough which you will need
      to decide upon before the new season. Has a similar report been done on
      Owlerton?

1.7   A copy of the report of each discipline should be sent by the City
       Council to each other discipline after which the City Council should
       Chair a meeting to enable problems to be discussed so that an accepted
       approach might be determined by the City Council and consolidated into a
       single report of requirements which should be forwarded to the clubs or
       included as requirement conditions in the General Safety Certificates
      when they are issued. In my opinion this method of working is necessary
       in the case of all new applications and where alterations and extensions
       are made to certificated grounds. The City Council must arrange the
       meetings not put the onus on individual disciplines to ask for a meeting
       as it has previously done.

1.8   It is my view that the necessary comprehensive surveys could not be
      undertaken satisfactorily without accurate and detailed drawings of all
      parts of the grounds. Duplicate sets of drawings should be obtained for
      all disciplines so that one set can be marked up and sent to the City
      Council and one be retained on file for record purposes. As a minimum
      the following drawings are needed:-
                               -   2   -
       (i)   A site plan showing the ground and its surroundings at a     scale   of
             1:500

       (ii) A plan view of the ground showing entrances, exits, gates, stands,
            terraces etc at a scale of 1:200

       (iii)Drawings of each stand, terrace, building within the ground and the
            use of rooms - including areas beneath stands at a scale of 1:100.

       (iv) Drawings of emergency lighting and       fire   alarm   and   detection
            equipment and public address system.

1.9    I also take the view that the plans which have been supplied on behalf
       of Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United by Eastwood and Partners
       have often contained insufficient detail.      Often   for example  such
       details as entrances and exits or their widths, perimeter fences and
       gates or their widths, the area and rake of terraces, the location of
       emergency lighting, and fire warning and fire equipment are not shown.
       I am of the opinion that much more detail needs to     beshown on    the
       drawings forming part of General Safety Certificates as is the case with
       fire certificates issued under the Fire Precautions Act 1971. This will
       facilitate     the re-inspection  of     the sports    grounds and the
       identification of any unauthorised alterations which might have been
       made.

1.10   Following receipt of drawings I suggest that the City Council calls a
       meeting of     the Advisory Group toagree on common identification
       procedures.     In order that each disciplineis able to identify parts of
       grounds in a uniform manner, I suggest that stands      and terraces are
       clearly identified, exit routes, passages, gateways, doors etc. numbered
       in a consecutive manner and stairways lettered.    At   the same time a
       suitable deadline for submission of survey reports by each discipline to
       the City Council should be agreed after which the procedure outlined in
       1.7 above would operate preparatory to the issue/replacement of a
       General Safety Certificate to each ground.

2.     The Legal Position

2.1    I have included this part in order to outline my understanding of the
        legal position and to indicate a number of aspects about which I think a
        clear understanding is necessary.

2.2    As I see it the powers, duties and functions of the City Council are
       clearly set out     in the 1975 Act.    The Advisory Group (safety team)
       approach is not     covered in the Act although      it   is   obviously
       advant ageou s.                 ~J

2.3    The Council is required to send a copy of any application for a safety
        Certificate or a transfer of a safety certificate to the Fire Authority.
        In the case of an application for a Safety Certificate, the council is
        required to consult the Fire Authority about the terms and conditions to
        be included     in the certificate.    This requirement to consult also,
        applies to    any proposal to amend,    replace or transfer a safety
        certificate.

2.4    To consult means to seek information or advice from; to take into
        consideration. It imposes no requirement on the City Council to accept
        the advice    of the Fire Authority.For example, the Council may
        sometimes have to balance the merits of conflicting advice and make a
        judgement which it considers will provide for the reasonable safety of
        spectators. This is the reason why I regard my recommendations at 1.2
                                 - 3 -
       and 1.7 to be extremely important. Ultimately the City Council sets the
       standards having first considered professional advice it has received.

2.5    The Council is also required to give notice in writing to the Fire
       Authority as an interested party of its decision to issue, replace or
       amend a Safety Certificate or to refuse to amend or replace a Safety
       Certificate.   As an interested party the Fire Authority has a right of
       appeal which could be used for example where the Fire Authority did not
       agree with the standard set by the City Council perhaps as a result of
       its judgment of the merits of conflicting advice as mentioned in 2.4
       above.

2.6    Once the Council determines that, in its opinion, an applicant is a
       qualified person, it is then under a duty to issue a General Safety
       Certificate.   It has no power to withhold the issue of a Safety
       Certificate pending the carrying out of alterations or additions to the
       sports ground.    However, the terms     and conditionswithin the Safety
       Certificate may be such as to involve alterations or additions being
       made at a sports ground. Pending the satisfactory completion of such
       works, the crowd capacity of the ground or parts can      for example be
       limited or the use of a stand or a terrace entirely prohibited etc.    By
       this means the General Safety Certificate becomes an instrument of
       continuing control.

2.7    In issuing a Safety Certificate the City Council has power to require an
        applicant toprovide them within such time as they specify with such
        information and such plans as they consider necessary to enable them to
        determine the terms and conditions which ought to be included in any
        certificate issued in response to his application.        It would seem
       therefore that although once having determined an applicant to be a
       qualified person a Safety Certificate must be issued, the Act recognises
       that this is not possible if the necessary plans and information are not
        furnished within a reasonable time. The Council has power to extend the
       time allowed after which the application is deemed to have been
       withdrawn and an offence is committed if the sports ground is then used.

2.8    If   while a   General Safety Certificate is in force it is proposed to
        alter or extend the sports ground or any of its installations in a way
       which is likely to affect the safety of persons, the holder is required
       to give notice to the City Council.    Notice is particularly required
       when it is proposed to alter the entrances to or exits from the sports
        ground or any part of it (including any means of escape in case of fire
        or other emergency) or the means of access to any such entrances or
        exits.   Since such changes would necessitate the replacement        or
        amendment of the General Safety Certificate the City Council would be
        required to consult the Fire Authority as set out in 2.3 above.

2.9    The Fire Authority have powers of entry and inspection of sports grounds
       under Section 11 of the 1975 Act and has authorised its officers
       accordingly.

2.10   I feel that the Council should inform the disciplines in the Advisory
       Group what its policy is as regards enforcement of the Act particularly
       as regards the use of prohibition/restriction powers under section 10 of
       the 1975 Act and as regards contravention of Safety Certificate
       conditions.   Is there a procedure     and standard form in being for
       implementing    Section   10?   In what form would the Council wish
       information to be passed to it where contraventions          of   Safety
       Certificate     conditions are found    by fire officers at a "during
       performance"   inspection? Do you have your officers on call and would
       you want them to be called to the grounds? If so, details need to be
       supplied of names and telephone numbers.
                                 - 4 -
2.11 My view is that any legal proceedings for contravention of Safety
     Certificate conditions is the responsibility of the City Council. It
     has in the past been suggested       that the FireService couldinstitute
      legal  proceedings regarding matters within      its expertise regarding
     contravention of Safety Certificate conditions in view of its powers of
     entry   and inspection under Section 11 or the 1975 Act. As indicated
     above, this is not a view to which I subscribe but I would be gratefuL
      for your view on the matter for the purposes of clarification.

2.12   As you know, Section 10 of the Fire Precautions Act 1971 is broadly
       similar to Section 10 of the 1975 Act. As such it can be applied by the
       Fire Authority to structures within sports grounds as regards fire risk.
       I do not envisage a situation arising where it would be appropriate to
       use the power since I regard the power under the 1975 Act to be the
       primary controlling legislation. Should a fire risk which merits the use
       of Section 10 powers come to the notice of the Fire Authority it will be
       my policy to consult the City Council with a view to it using its
       Section 10 powers.     Only in the case of a dispute where the Fire
       Authority considered a Section 10 notice should be served and the City
       Council did not, would the Fire Authority use its powers under Section
       10 of the 1971 Act.

       I stress that this is very unlikely to    occur sinceany usewould be a
       last resort, after consultations with     the ground operatorhad failed to
       secure a reasonable standard of safety. I would be grateful for your
       comments regarding agreement or otherwise with this position so that any
       differences might be sorted out.

2.13   Under Section 10B, the City Council is     required toenforcethe 1975 Act
       and arrange    for annual inspections of designated grounds in accordance
       with guidance issued by the Secretary of State under cover of Home
       Office Circular 72/1987.

3.     Comments on Content of Letter

3.1    In addition to givingadvice to the City        Council the Fire Authority
       advises Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster Councils.    Under the former
       South Yorkshire County Council there was a common Safety Certificate.
       This was convenient because a fire officer (or a police officer) being
       county based knew 'that certificate conditions were identical. Under the
       District Councils there axe now four different sets of conditions which
       is in my view confusing and unnecessary. I recommend that liaison takes
       place between the District Councils to produce a common standard.

3.2    Communications

       I think my comments in part one indicate          my    views   regarding
       communication between the City Council and the members of the Advisory
       Group. It will obviously be necessary for there to be extensive
       consultation with clubs when dealing with applications for safety
       certificates, extensions or alterationsto grounds and statutory and
       other inspections.    In this respect I refer to paragraph 4 of Annexe C
       to Home Office Circular 7/1986. A firm but friendly and helpful approach
       should be adopted when dealing with the clubs. You mention that Council
       members may wish to have a more prominent role in relation to the system
       although you do not state what that involvement might be. So far as the
       carrying out of inspections is concerned I feel that the Council should
       receive its advice from the professional members of the Advisory Group.
       Clearly, however, it is for the Council members        todetermine any
       involvement they consider appropriate. My only note of caution would be

                                   5 -
to avoid any lengthening of the process leading to the issue   of   Safety
Certificates.

Role of each Member of the Advisory Group

I think that the group needs to meet to discuss this-aspect in-detail
taking into account any recommendations in Lord Justice Taylor's interim
report.   The comments of each discipline would have to be restricted to
those aspects for which they have expertise. The objective has to be to
ensure that no aspects are missed. Simply put, I perceive the role of
the Fire Service as giving advice on means of escape and fire
precautions in their broadest sense and ground capacity based on the
capacity of exits only. There are many areas of overlap particularly
between the Fire Officer and the Building Control Officer.           The
objective of designating a primary authority for certain aspects adopted
by the South Yorkshire County Council and in amended form by the City
Council is sound and both should be used as a basis for any review.

Review of Council's Approach to the Clubs

I am in general agreement with your comments although I will want to
discuss with you the exact method you propose and I would draw your
attention to my comments in Part 1 regarding surveys and the provisions
of plans etc.     It should be emphasised to all members of the Advisory
Group that they must not deal direct with clubs on matters covered by
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 because of the danger that the
clubs will make alterations which may affect the safety of spectators
without the knowledge of the City Council or the other members of the
Advisory Group. All correspondence with the clubs on Safety of Sports
Grounds matters must be via the City Council.

Another problem which I feel needs addressing with the clubs is the
tendency for a sudden rush of proposals usually in July when time is
short and    they want the     work done before the start of the new season.
Because of the timing, key officers are often on holiday.     Often   the
alterations could have been submitted for approval long before the end
of the playing season so that work could commence immediately after the
end of the playing season.

Inspections and Enforcement of Certificate Conditions

So far as inspection prior to the issue of a general Safety Certificate
or in the case of extension or alteration of a certificated sports
ground is concerned. I refer to my comments in Part 1. As to a rolling
programme of inspections I refer to my comment at 1.5.

I feel that inspections carried out under Section 10B of the 1975    Act
should be    in accordance    with the statutory       guidance and alsothe
supplementary but non statutory guidance given in Home Office Circular
72/1987.   Where there is no outstanding work to be done an annual
inspection should suffice but where work is outstanding or general
housekeeping and maintenance give cause for concern inspections should
be carried out more frequently. During performance inspection should be
carried out on an ad hoc basis, the frequency being determined according
to the standard of compliance found. Normally a DP inspection should be
carried out in the early part of a season. There may be advantage in
having the odd joint DP inspection, although I don't consider that
should be more than once per season, perhaps the first early season
inspection. The police should normally be notified in advance when a DP
inspection is to be made and any comments forwarded to the City Council.
So far as enforcement is concerned, I would refer you to my comments in
Paragraphs 2.10, 2.11 and 2.12. A standard inspection form similar to
        that attached to HOC 72/1987     would   be   invaluable   for   carrying   out
        section 10B inspections.

        Role of Advisory Group and its Administration

        I believe that the role of the Advisory Group has to be limited to
        giving professional advice within its area of expertise to the City
        Council to assist it to carry out its enforcement function. The City
        Council is ultimately responsibility for setting the required standard
        hopefully on the basis of agreed common advice from the Advisory Group.
        I do not believe that the notes (minutes) of meetings have been adequate
        in the past (often non were done). To maintain the impetus of such a
        diverse group needs active central administration and co-ordination.
        Hence my comments in Paragraphs 1.2 and 1.3. Properly devised forms
        could be of very great benefit. Obviously their objective and content
        would need careful consideration.      The notes or minutes of meetings
        whatever they are called should seek to record what was agreed or
        decided so that the progress made is identified. The whole objective
        being to ensure any differences are ironed out and a consolidated view
        reached.

        Safety Certificate Conditions

        There are a number of the conditions which I would like to discuss with
        Mr Bownes. Although I have not had time to give detailed consideration
        to them as yet. What I have mainly in mind is what detail should be
        recorded on the Safety Certificate plans. See Paragraph 1.9

I hope you find the contents of this letter both helpful and constructive and
I look forward to your response.        I look forward also to receiving the
comments of the other members of the Advisory Group which you stated in your
letter you would circulate.

ACO Seaman is on annual leave between 4th and 21st August and recognising that
the interim report will shortly be issued, I would ask that you contact my
Senior Fire Prevention Officer, Divisional Officer Hildreth or in his absence
either Divisional Officer Binnington or Temporary Divisional Officer Ryder.

   (2) SH EFFIELD’S TERTIARY EDUCATION SERVICE FO R PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HANDICAPS
     The Chief Education Officer submitted the third and final draft of a report on Sheffield’s
   Tertiary Education Service for people with Mental Handicaps and entitled “A Plan for Service
   Development 1989 to 1992”.It was stated that the report had been prepared as part of a process
   of review of the service which the Education Department, through itsTertiary Colleges, provided
   for those Sheffield citizens who lived on Health Authority premises and had mental handicaps
   and was designed to overcome the difficulties which had been experienced following the transfer
   of the former Northern General Hospital School into the Tertiary College system in September,
   1988. These problems included lack of co-ordination, clear lines of communication and
   coherence between activities of staff at such premises. The report contained a number of
   recommendations which were summarised as follows—
       All staffinvolved in the Tertiary Service for the Physically and Mentally Handicapped, namely
       the lecturing staff, care assistants. College Co-ordinators for Special Needs and the Head and
       Deputy Head of Service meet on a regular basis, (not less than three times per year) to discuss
       the organisation of the Service. Where apparently irreconcilable difficulties are identified, the
       Chief Education Officer will be informed as soon as possible.
           The College Co-ordinators meet on a regular basis with the Head of Service.
          In order to provide maximum service effectively, cover in the event of short-term absence of
        colleagues be secured on the basis of client-need in the clients’ location, irrespective of the
        base-colleges of the staff. When College Co-ordinators know they are unlikely to be able to
        make such an arrangement, responsibility for that will rest with the Head of Service.
          Current timetables showing location, times and composition of flient-groups for all staff to
        be made available to the Head of Service to enable the monitoring of provision which has been
        promised to students living in Health Authority premises.
          For the purposes of liaison with the Health Authority on all matters relating to the Tertiary
        Service for People with Mental Handicap, the Local Education Authority will normally be
        represented by the Head of the Service.
          The issue of line management for care assistants be kept under review, and that
        consideration of any change be deferred until the Second Part of the Service Review.
                     EDUCATION PROGRAMME COMMITTEE

  Individual preferences be notified to the relevant College Special Needs Co-ordinator as
early as possible, but no later than will enable the College Co-ordinators to provide the Head
of Service by October with a complete set of proposals. In collating those to ensure coherence
across the City, the Head of Service will make appropriate information available to the
Recognised Further Education Teachers’Associations.
  If such arrangements prove unworkable in 1989-90, the matter be addressed in the Second
Part of the Review.

  Service Managers keep the balance of teaching/non-teaching staff under review, and that
such adjustments as may be necessary be recommended to the appropriate governing body and
to the Chief Education Officer.

  The Local Education Authority give consideration to making transport/escort systems for all
students with disabilities an Excepted Item under the Scheme of Delegation.

   Until a comprehensive solution can be found, the Head of Service makes such interim
arrangements as are necessary to ease the problem of getting students with severe learning
difficulties to college classes.

  Five categories of people with severe learning difficulties be given priority for educational
services should priorities be needed—

   (i) Young adults in the 19-25 age group. This group may in future include 16-25 year olds,
   subject to Council’s policy regarding the special schools which currently keep pupils up to
   the age of 19.
   (ii) Older people with identified educational needs who are receiving no other day services
   from organisations mentioned earlier.
   (iii) People in hostels and hospitals who are scheduled to move into community
   accommodation.
   (iv) People who have recently moved into community accommodation.
   (v) Younger people with challenging behaviours.

  Every effort be made to ensure that educational services are offered and delivered as part of
an inter-disciplinary system of support for people with severe learning difficulties. This will
involve regular consultation with managers and other staff in the Health Authority; in the
Family and Community Services Department and in schools; and also with students’families
and with the representatives of voluntary organisations.

  In constructing the curriculum, due regard should be given to the wishes of the clients
themselves and of their representatives; to the skills of the staff; and to the weight of
knowledge and experience contained in such documents as “New Directions”.
  An ongoing process of Curriculum Review should take place, as a major element of staff
development for those lecturers and Care Assistants working in the Service. Parent
representatives, student representatives and colleagues from other disciplines should be
involved wherever posssible.

  Every effort be made to promote an inter-disciplinary approach to learning, so that the aims
and objectives of college courses are known and understood by parents and other carers, and
can therefore be reinforced in situations outside college classes.
  The potential of Supported Employment be further explored and developed.

  Responsibility for the overall coherence and effectiveness of the curriculum rests with the
Head of Service.

  For teaching staff appointed to the Service a series of short courses be designed (in
consultation with College Co-ordinators and Service Staff) and offered over the next three
years which will help to remedy some of the skill-deficiencies identified by the staffthemselves.
These would include First Aid training, life-saving and the teaching of swimming, rebound
therapy, relaxation techniques, outdoor education, PE/movement, advocacy training and
dealing with challenging behaviours in students. There is also a need to give more staff some
expertise in Computer Aided Learning techniques.

    Although Care Assistants are very experienced, few are formally qualified, and those who
  are qualified have a qualification (NNEB) which although it is recognisable for incremental
  purposes is of questionable relevance to the education and care of adults with SLD. Therefore
  certain qualifications should be added to the list of those which are recognised for incremental
  purposes. These should be—
         (a) The Certificate in the Further Education and Training of Mentally Handicapped
       People (validated by the University of Manchester).
         (b) the CGLI 731/7 course “The Care and Training of Mentally Handicapped People”.
         (c) The Certificate for Teaching the Handicapped (CGLI 731/4).
    The course of training now mentioned be offered to those Care Assistants already in post as
  soon as is practicable.
    Further consideration be given to the staff development needs of care assistants and its
  adequate resourcing.
    Lecturers teaching students with severe learning difficulties for any part of their timetables
  be as fully involved as possible in the Curriculum Review now mentioned and that their felt
  needs regarding further staffdevelopment be taken fully into account during the following two
  years.
    The Chief Education Officer give consideration to the inclusion of aspects of post-16 Special
  Education in any ESG-funded programme of training for governors.
    The Head of Service, in consultation with the College Co-ordinators, actively seek ways to
  provide appropriate levels of SD/awareness-raising among all support staff in the colleges.
     The Local Education Authority as part of its Strategic Planning role under ERA,
  encourages the colleges to make available such accommodation as may be necessary to
  facilitate a neighbourhood provision for students with severe learning difficulties; and such
  specialised accommodation as may be required for a comprehensive city-wide curriculum.
    The second part of this Review of the Service be undertaken by the Chief Education Officer
  after Christmas 1989, to report to Committee by Easter 1990.
  Resolved: That approval be given to the recommendations for the development of Sheffield’s
Tertiary Education Service for people with mental Handicaps in accordance with the details
contained in the report now submitted.

    The Chief Education Officer submitted a report on the outcome of a conference which had
  been held at the University of Birmingham on 30th June, 1989, to share information and provide
  an educational perspective of the development of Conductive Education in Great Britain. It was
  stated that Conductive Education was a revolutionary teaching system which aimed to help
  certain motor-disordered children and adults overcome their disability. The teaching system had
  been introduced in Hungary immediately following the Second World War and was currently
  being developed at the Peto Institute in that Country.

    In 1986, the Foundation for Conductive Education had been registered as a National Charity to
  develop the work of the Peto Institute in the United Kingdom and had established an Institute in
  Birmingham to train Conductors. This Institute was supported largely by the Cities of
  Birmingham and Coventry with medical services provided by agreement with the South
  Birmingham Health Authority. It was stated that Sheffield had been approached to be a part of
  the research project but that certain representatives from the Sheffield Health Authority had
  reservations about the nature of the research being undertaken.
      Resolved: That (a) the information contained in the report now submitted be noted;
    (b) the Local Education Authority is of the opinion that participation in the research project
  currently being undertaken in Birmingham into Conductive Education is desirable and requests

  requested with a view to the possible preparation, in consultation with the Chair of the
  Committee, of a public statement on the current financial situation and its effect on requests for
  assistance for parents wishing to send children for treatment at the Peto Institute in Hungary, in
  the light of the reported inclusion of an additional clause in the Children’s Bill now going through
  Parliament which would enable local authorities to give financial assistance to the families of
  children with special needs who received treatment abroad.

★   (1) OBSERVATIONS AS ADJOINING A U T H O R I T Y
      The Director of Land and Planning reported verbally on a request from the North-East
    Derbyshire District Council for the observations of the City Council, as adjoining planning
    authority, on an application which had been submitted to the District Council for outline
    planning permission to erect a retail store, car parking and filling station on land at Batemoor
    Road, bounded by Chesterfield Road South and Jordanthorpe Parkway.
      Resolved: That the North-East Derbyshire District Council be informed that the City Council
    objects to the outline planning application because it is considered that (a) since the site lies
    within the North-East Derbyshire Green Belt and adjoins Sheffield Green Belt, the proposals
    would be contrary to the Green Belt policies of both Councils which do not permit such
    development in the Green Belt and in this case would seriously prejudice policies to separate the
    urban spread of Sheffield and Dronfield and (b) the proposed development would (i) adversely
    affect the viability of nearby district shopping centres and (ii) provide an unsuitable location not
    easily accessible by customers who do not have access to a car, such grounds being supported by
    the shopping policies contained in the South Yorkshire Structure Plan and the Sheffield City
    Council interim policy on major out-of-centre retail development.

  (3) CITY C O U N C I L ’S F I N A N C I A L R E G U L A T I O N S
    The City Treasurer submitted a report reviewing the City Council’s Financial Regulations in
  the light of the Council’s schemes of Local Financial Management in schools and colleges. It was
  explained in the report that the current Financial Regulations covering financial planning,
  revenue, budgetting and rate-making and the matter of the carrying forward of over and
  underspendings on delegated budgets could all be accommodated within the schemes. However,
  amendment was required to the parameters relating to the diversion of resources prepared in
  accordance with Financial Regulation 10 because of conditions in the schemes which gave
  governing bodies of schools and colleges freedom of diversion across all delegated budget
  headings without the prior approval of the Education Programme Committee. Itwas also pointed
  out that the Council’s Standing Orders were also being reviewed in the light of the Education
  Reform Act which might necessitate additional amendments to the Financial Regulations.

    Resolved: That, in the light of the information contained in the report now submitted, the
  following amendments be made to the parameters set out under Financial Regulation 10 and
  under which Programme Committees may manage their revenue budgets—
  Existing Parameters                                          Proposed Parameters

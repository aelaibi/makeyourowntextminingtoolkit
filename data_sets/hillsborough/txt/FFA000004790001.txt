 FA/HILLSBOROUGH



  ima spent looking at the FA's filas together with speaking
 co               ]about the arrangements for Sunday and the fact
 that'' Graham Kelly ought to be at that meeting on Sunday
 evening if at all possible.      Considering the amendments that
had been made to the statement following ^           Interview
with Clark and 1 ......        I also spoke to
".Julian Gibson-Watt's clerk who suggested that             » fees
should be £20,000 on the brief with £850 per day regardless
of whether he was here or in London.               also mentioned
to me that if Julian had to do quite a lot of work at the
weekends he may also be asking for a refresher of that time.
I said I did not see that that was going to be any problem.
I would have to put the matter formally to the clients but
it would go with a recommendation from us to agree them.

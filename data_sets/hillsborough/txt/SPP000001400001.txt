Dear Stan,

Further to our meeting on 13th March at my home in Nottingham
I am writing to inform you that as soon as it possible to do
so the following summaries (together with the front page summary)
may be released to the respective solicitors and Mr. Frazer.

In some of these cases there may be outstanding matters which need
sorting out in respect of statements or plans etc but I do not think
that these affect the release of the summaries.

Ino 79. Graham John Roberts   Please see comments h/files 30/3/90



1 curs sincerely,




S. L. Copper.
     Coroner.

Dear Stan,

As mentioned in m y letter of same date but under reference B/conments
I have a few comments on the under mentioned files. These do not need
hold up the sending out of the summaries bit no doubt you will arrange
for the points to be dealt with or sorted out in due course.


 Ko 79. Graham John Roberts

a. Every time I look at Mr Websters statement I seem to find something
else. Apart from what 1 have alreeady pointed out before I now
notice:

i. 4.45 am is not 1645.

ii. I thought that Ins. Timms had gone off duty and allowed DC Weigold
to hold the fort during the night. If that is so whom did Mr. Webster
brief ?

b. Page 32.   Pathologist was Dr. Clark

c. Page 63. hr Carden in the last sentence says that he sawGraham
last prior to entering the tunnel. The Plan shows him as having seen
him well within the tunnel. Which is correct ?

d. Have we got a statement from PC Sherwood   ?



Yours sincerely,



S. L. Popper.
H.M. Coroner.

If I read Mr Johnston's letter of 21 September rightly, you have
managed to pull off an agreement with South Yorkshire, and if I may say
so you are to be congratulated on it.   This was always going to be a
difficult issue and the prospect of its leading to litigation between a
police authority and Home Office was most unwelcome, not least looking
to the handling of future police investigations outside the mainstream.

           ^ . On Saturday?                 15 April      1989 (150489)        I came on duty at 8.30 am <0830)

                 at the DSG Office.                     B riefing was at 10.00 am (1000)                     in the North Stand

                 at Hi 1lsborough, as our dut ies that day consisted of Poli cing the FA

                 Cup F inal Semi-Final between Liverpool and Notts F o r e s t .                                        Three

                  senior officers spoke during briefing which was                                      concIuded around 10.

                 30 (1030)            upon whi ch the serial went back to the Police van where a

                  snack was taken in car park.

                 At 11.15 am (1115) as stipulated,                         the serial was placed in the West.

                 Enclosure at the Leppings Ln end as a standby se ri al ? where we

                  remained for 55 minutes approximately and only prior to leaving this

                 area did a few supporters start to enter the ground at
                                                                      PAGE       2
                                                                      S;10 7 0

the Leppings Ln end.    These numbers however were minimal.

The serial   received an order to go to the turnstiles on Penistone Rd

at 12.10 pm (1210)    in order to supervise the entrance of Nottinqham

Forest supporters onto the Spion Hop.      Upon arrival there were fans

already queueing at turnstiles of which the majority were open and the

rest were subsequently opened on our arrival.

The Forest fans were generally very well behaved and orderly and made

an effort to get into the ground in good time and at no time were

there excessive queues of people waiting to enter the ground.         One

thing that was very evident throughout our duties on that section of

the ground were the numbers of Liverpool Supporters milling around
                                                              S'
openly requesting if any supporters     (which were of cour/e Forest fans)

wanted to sell any spare tickets.      Some Liverpool Sj/japorters were on

Penistone Rd with ti ckets be cause a section of tj/vs Hop had been

reserved for them.                                /

During the course of my duties on the turnstiles?       I had cause to eject

one youth on ground regulations.      This youth, along with two others

"were from Liverpool and had made several attempts to gain entry via

the turnstiles on Penistone Rd without a ticket.       Two youths got in

obviously by paying the turnsti lyfe man and the thi rd youth had handed

over money and got in when I trald another officer on the other side to

stop him.    The youth from L/verpooi was taken to the Police room and

after his details submit te d, he was ejected from the gr ou nd .    His

details were recorded b y myself but lost during the events that

followed.    Turnstile duties were resumed and it was obvious again the

Forest supporters we/re making a conscious effort to get into the

ground.

At 3.00 pm (1500) we were directed tc^*€% gymnasium under the North

Stand and once there, were givep/orde o s to proceed along the t-rackside

at the North Stand,    but at >rfo time >6as I told what was happen ing .
           Upon reaching the L e pj*Tngs Ln fencing,                instructed to make a cordon

           •along touchline o^r pitch as numerous fans were c 1 imbing the perimeter

           fence and w e r y spi 11ing onto the pitch.                They looked in distress and

           obviously     jbo me   were hurt but initial           thoughts we re only of pij

           invasion.'      No orders were given except to keep cordp**r,*§'nd get fans off

           pitch and into ground again,                 during this a^f'iThe players and officials

           left playing area.            More fans spdJHP^d over the fence and it was

           obvious something serJ^o><r^was occurring but still no orders had been

           g i v e n , it was^j&sCyh e m .    I didn ’t p ejrsom                                 t those w ho

           did a                             the same position as myself.          As fans passed us

       /   .they were saying people were dead and being crushed.                     By this time
     / f t officers     had taken things on their own and began making their own

           deci si o n s , myself     included.         I made my way to the fence and there saw

           one dead man of quite heavy bui Ld and in m i d - 2 Q " s , being passed over

V          the heads of other supporters^

           Myself and Police Constabl</2372 JUSTICE went to an c                             ite and

           climbed across a small ga/ and jumped into the terracing of Pen

     \/\   four where t(-i/^e^i youth was.                   The kiss of life was given to him but
^v         —
           it was    no use./
                             I/       A
                                  looking back I can't see why we bothered because                     it

           was obvious hey d b&ari dead a while.                  Officers on t racks ide were told
                                              /
           that we needed an ambudance and it was then that along with

           supporters,      the p e r / m e t e r    fence was pushed and pulled then it gave

           way,    creating a hj/le big enough for the passage of~ persons.                        The body

           was    passed out and onto the trackside by which time fans had filtered
                                                                              y'
           back and spaces appeared on terracing.                    I c1 imbarf out of the gap and

           went onto the pitch and began administering ^asi c first aid as quite a

           few other officers did.                  Again,   another obviously dead youth was
                                                                                   fV S .1 9 ^
           placed on the pitch and along with P o 1i c/ Constable 2304 CROOKES kiss

           of life given,         no use again, why did we bother?            All the time things

           were happening and emergency services began to arrive,                      but still        1

w a s n ’t aware of any specific orders given.         Liverpool   supporters and

Police then began         breaking up hoardings to use as makeshift

stretchers and those dead and injured were             carried across the pitch

and round to the gy mna si um.         When the situation had recindered our

unit   re-grouped and were stood on reflection looking useless because

no one was telling us what to do now the situation had cleared.                 We

were stood on the pitch,           me personally feeling so inadequate and not

believing what had happened.            Supporters were hailing abuse at us from

terracing.     I ca n’t say now how I felt,       except numb.     Eventually

directed to rear of Leppings Ln but prior to that,              two announcements

were made,    one by Kenny DALGLISH appealing for co-operation etc., and

o ne over tannoy systems saying match had been abandoned and for

supporters to remain orderly and leave ground sensibly but to keep

tickets for replay. Once at rear of Leppings Ln all fans eventually

dispersed and one fan walked past our serial             in obvious distress and

shouted,    ’Murderers,     Murderers,    Y o u ’re all fucking murderers"

It was then I         realised some of the enormity of what had happened.

Duties then consisted of mobile transit patrols and went off at 8.30

pm CS030).     Looking back thoughts obviously come to mind and some are

clearer than others.         The main one that causes me still distress         is

why w e r e n ’t orders given and if so why w e r e n ’t they passed on and why

d i d n ’t someone    in authority take the situation in hand and take

command of a         disaster as it turned out,     instead of doing nothing or

so it appeared, as it was normal bobbies took it upon themselves to

organise and implement        'orders’ given by themselves.

One    last thought     is that,    personally next to work,    football   is my life

but after that S a t u r d a y ’s deb acl e, I doubt   it will ever be the s a m e .

When people are packed into cages like animals with nowhere to go,

panic sets in which happened at Leppings Ln and with animals,                only the

strong survive,        the rest die,    just like those 95 at Hillsborough.

                We did our best,    our job, what we get paid for.      The first point

                applied but the other two d o n ’t, that is not what happened on Saturday

                15 April   1989 <150489) around 3.05 pm <1505) and onwards.        Yes we deal

                with sudden deaths but not 95 en mass.      When we were stood around and

                even doing initial work during the disaster,       blue shirted bobbies were

                getting abused,    blamed and mocked.   It w a s n ’t our fault.

                 SERIAL 21.



                 On Saturday 15 April                        1989 <150489)?          I came on duty at 0830 h o u r s , at

                 the D.S.G. Office.                         Briefing was at 1000 ho u r s , in the North Stand at

                 Hillsborough,            as our duties that day consisted of Policing the FA Cup

                 Final Semi Final?                 between Liverpool and Notts Forest.                      Three Senior

                 Offi cers spoke dur i ng briefing which concluded around 1030 h o u r s , upon

                 which the Serial went back to the Police van where a snack was taken

                 in car park.

                 At 1115 hou rs, as stipulated,                             the Serial was placed in the West

                 Enclosure at the Le p pi ngs Ln end as a standby seri al, where we

                 remained for 55 mi nutes approximately and only prior to leaving this

                 area did a few supporters start to enter the ground at the Leppings Ln

                                                                        S 1 070A

end.   These numbers,   however, were minimal.

The Serial   received an order to go to the turnstiles on Penistone Rd

at 1210 hours in order to supervise the entrance of Nottingham Forest

supporters onto the Spion Kop.     Upon arrival there were fans already

queuing at turnstiles of which the majority were open and the rest

were subsequently opened on our arrival.

The Forest fans were generally very well behaved and orderly and made

an effort to get into the ground in good time and at no time were

there excessive queues of people waiting to enter the ground.           One

thing that was very evident throughout our duties on that Section of

the ground were the numbers of Liverpool supporters milling around

openly requesting if any supporters       (which were of course Forest fans)

wanted to sell any spare tickets.        Some Liverpool   supporters were on

fenistone Rd with tickets because a section of the Hop had been

reserved for them.

During the course of my duties on the turnstiles          I had cause to eject

one youth on ground regulations.     This youth, along with two others,

were from Liverpool and had made several attempts to gain entry via

the turnstiles on Penistone Rd without a ticket.          Two youths got in

obviously by paying the turnstile man a nd the third youth had handed

over money and got in when I told another Officer on the other side to

stop him.    The youth from Liverpool was taken to the Police        room and

after his details were submitted,    he was ejected from the ground.

His details were recorded by myself but lost during the events that

followed.    Turnstile duties were resumed and it was-, obvious again the

Forest supporters were making a conscious effort to get into the
                                     /

g round.

At   15QQ hours, we were directed to the gymnasium under the North Stand

and once there, were given orders to proceed along the trackside at

the North Stand,   but at no time was I told what was happening.
                                                                         PAGE       3
                                                                         S 1 070A

Upon reaching the Leppings Ln fencing,          instructed to make a cordon

along touchiine of pitch as numerous fans were          climbing the   perimeter

fence and were spilling onto the pitch.          They looked in distress and

obviously some were hurt but initial          thoughts were only of pitch

invasion.     No orders were given except to keep cordon and get fans off

pitch and into ground again,       during this all the players and officials

left playing area.

More fans spilled over the fence and it was obvious something serious

was occurring but still       no orders had been given,    it was mayhem.   I

d i d n ’t personally have a radio,   but those who did around me were in

the same position as myself.

As fans   passed us they were saying      people were dead and being     crushed.

By this time Offi cer s had taken things on their own and began making

their own decisions, myself       included.

I made my way to the fence and there saw one dead man of quite heavy

build and in mid 20's being       passed over the heads of other supporters.
.                         “           v t W
Myself and Police Constable 2372 JUSTICE went to an open gate and

climbed across a small gap and jumped into the terracing of Pen Four

where the dead youth was.       The kiss of life was given to him but it

was no use,    looking back I can't see why we bothered because        it was

obvious h e ’d been dead a while.

Officers on trackside were told that we needed an ambulance and it was

then that along with supporters,       the perimeter fence was pushed and

pulled,   then it gave way,     creating a hole big enough for the passage

of persons.

The body was passed out and onto the trackside by which time fans had

filtered back and spaces appeared on terracing.          I climbed out of the

gap and went onto the pitch and began administering basic first aid as

quite a few other Officers did.        Again, another obviously dead youth

was   placed on the pitch and along with P olice Constable 2304 C R O O K E S ,
                                                                                   PAGE      4
                                                                                   SI070A

kiss of life given,         no use again,   why did we bother?

All the time things were happening and emergency services began to

arrive,   but still       I w a s n ’t aware of any specific orders given.

Liverpool    supporters and Police then began breaking up hoardings to

use as makeshift stretchers and those dead and injured were                     carried

across the pitch and round to the gymnasium-

When the situation had eased our Unit            re-grouped and were stood on

reflection looking useless because no one was telling us what to do

now the situation had cleared.

We were stood on the pitch, me personally feeling so inadequate and

not believing what had happened.            Supporters were hailing abuse at us

from terracing.       1     c a n ’t say how I felt,    except numb.

Eventually directed to rear of Leppings L n , but prior to that,                   two

announcements were made,         one by Kenny DALGLISH appealing for co­

operation etc, and one over tannoy system saying match had been

abandoned and for supporters to remain orderly and leave ground

sensibly but to keep tickets for replay.

Once at rear of Leppings Ln all fans eventually dispersed and one fan

walked past our Serial         in obvious distress and shouted,           "MURDERERS,

MURDERERS, YOU'RE ALL FUCKING MURDERERS."

It was then that I realised some of the                enormity of what had      happened.

Duties then consisted of mobile           transit      patrols and   went off    at £030

hours.

Looking back thoughts obviously come to mind and some are                     clearer than

others.     The main one that causes me still distress               is why     weren't

orders given and if so why weren't they passed on and why didn't

someone   in authority take the situation              in hand and take

command of a disaster as it turned out,                instead of doing nothing or so

it appeared, as it was normal bobbies took it upon themselves to

organise and implement the orders given by themselves.

           One last thought is that,      personally next to work, football       is   my   life

           but after that Saturday's debacle,       I doubt    it will     ever bythe same.

           When   people are packed into cages like animals with nowhere to go,

           panic sets in which happened at Leppings Ln and with animals only the

           strong survive,     the rest die,   just like those 95 at Hillsborough.



           We did our best,    our job, what we get paid for.         The first    point

           applies but the other two don't that is not what happened on Saturday

           15 April     1989 (150489) around 3.05pm (1505) and onwards.            Yes we deal

           with sudden deaths but not 95 en m a s s e .



           When we stood around and even doing initial work during the disaster,

           blue shirted bobbies were getting abused,          blamed and mocked,    it w a s n ’t

           our fault.

                                                                           A WEST SIGNED

              At 8.3 0 a.m.            (0830)       on Saturday,        15th April,           1989,    (150489),          I

               commen ced duty at W oo ds e a t s Po l i c e S t a t i o n                in order      to a t t e n d the

              s emi-final           betw e e n Liverpool         F.C.     and N o t t i n g h a m Forest F.C.             to take

               place at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football           Ground.

              At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    10.00 a.m.       that     day,     I was      present     during a briefing

               conducted by C hief S up er i n t e n d e n t              Duc k e n f i e l d ,   given to a large

               contingent           of o f f icers     on the N o r t h S t a n d       of the ground.              I

               consi d e r e d the       briefing        to be    concise an d           "to the      p o i n t 5 - the

               overall        message        in terms     of our P o l i c i n g       tactics was          to be firm but

               fair.         There was an air            of good humour and eve r y b o d y                 s e e m e d to be

               looking        forward to the game going a h e a d with o u t any                        problems.

              The         gates   to the ground were o p e n e d to the                   public at m i d d a y and the

              few fans who e nt e r e d the ground at                      this       time were very good humoured.

              My duties,            under the        leade r s h i p of     Inspector         (Serial       11),    wer e      to

              m a i n t a i n order      on the upper          level      of the N o r t h S t a n d and to              pay

               particular a t t e n t i o n          to the betting          booth and            cafeterias       where

              trouble         had o c c u r r e d    last year.

              As the kick off time                   neared    I remember          commenting         that    the N o t t i n g h a m

              F orest        end was     full       of spectators         whi l s t   the L e p p i n g s    Lane       end was

              sparse         x n c o m pa ris o n
At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 .40           p.m.     several        s u p p o r t e r s were     informing me            in

passing        that       problems were               o c c urring       outside       the L e p p i n g s Lane

turnstiles wit h o v e rc ro w d in g/ p u s h i n g .                     X recall       one or two          people

rushing         past me w ith obvious m inor                         leg    injuries               they ‘"ere         limping.
                3 I'     SJ f c S                                             —
I was       e xp e r i e n c i n g      d i f f i cu lt y    in receiving           radio t r a n s m i s s i o n s      during

that    period but                  I could hear officers                  outside      the L e p p i n g s    Lane       end

di scuss ing           the     crowd s it ua t i o n but             there was         no sign of any              panic,

they    seemed to be                  in control            of the    situation.

As 3 p.m.          (1500)            neared,      large numbers             of Liverpool           s u p p o r t e r s were

still       entering           the      ground and           coming      into the N o r t h Stand.                 The

s i tu a t i o n outside at                the    time was         o b v i o u s l y getting worse.                The    radio

communi c a t i o n s          between the           officers         outside and           the    control         room was

d o minating           the transmissions.                    The a t t i t u d e     of the       crowd had also

changed,         large         numbers were             o bv io u s l y drunk and were              shouting

obscen i t i e s        at the Police               in r e l a t i o n     largely to the s i t u a t i o n

outside        the      turnstiles,              they were         compla i n i n g     of the      pushing and

stating we w e r e n ’t doing a n y thing                          about     it.      In turn,        I had to speak

to several             suppo r t e r s about            their      language and general                conduct,

although         I a c c e p t e d by now that                there was a problem.                    It was        not

practic able            to turn any of these                      s u p p o r t e r s awa y due     to the         large

numbers        of drunks              coming      in.       I c o u l d n ’t have       ejec t e d them thro u g h

the    turnstiles anyway.                          People were           coming      into the N o r t h S t a n d wit h

tickets        for other              parts        of the gr o u n d a n d on one o c c a s i o n I a l l o w e d

ac c e ss    to the N o r t h Stand                 of one        pe r s o n who     had a ticket            for    the

Le p p i n g s Lane          end.        I felt at this              time    that we were           short      of

officer s at the                    rear of the N or t h S tand              but     clearly,       the problems

were    outside L e p p i ng s Lane an d any                         deployment         of officers           w o u l d be

there and          not       the N or t h S t a n d .

Also at this             time a very              large       number of Liverpool               supporters          were

reproached about                     u ri na t i n g at     the    r^r/)^f        %fre N o r t h S t a n d    near       to the
Le p pings Lane turnstiles.                       A large        ’s t r e a m ’ of urine was          evident          on

the     concourse.            We were then d i r e c t e d            to the     pitch are a        in response

to a pitch           invasion at the L i verpool                     end.

My s e l f and Police C on st a b l e B r o p h y a t t e m p t e d to

particular area               by going       from the         top of the N o r t h S t a n d          thro u g h the

aisles and onto               the    pitch.        However,          it was     clear that         the moo d of

the supporters              was an a g g r e s s i v e       one an d there         is no doubt           in my mind

that     had we gone           that way,          fighting w o u l d         have   broken out.               Onl y

minu t e s     earlier        the stewards          on the N o r t h S tand w a r n e d            that       they were

e x p e r i en ci ng       trouble with fans and were                   scared for their              safety.

I went wit h Police C on st a b l e B r o p h y to the area outside                                 the g y m n a s i u m

where we were              held back.         It c er ta i n l y a p p e a r e d at this            time       to be a

pith     invasion,          several        fans    could be seen on the                  pitch     in front           of

the N o t ti ng ha m Fo r e s t         end and g e s t i c u l a t i n g a g g r e s s i v e l y     in their

direction.

I was then d e p l oy ed with other                      o f f icers    in front         of the N o r t h Stand

to    prevent       the      i n v asion spreading.

It became          clear      both from some             injured       persons      passing me and              crowd

reaction to events                  at the L e p p in gs L ane          end that         it was     not a pitch

invasion         in that       sense.        I c o u l d n ’t u n d e r s t a n d why      the offic e r s at

the L e p p in gs Lane          end were          stood w a t c h i n g an event           in v o l v i n g    injury

to persons and not                  helping       them en mass.              I a s s u m e d that     it must          have

been an        invasion of the              pitch and that             the    injuries      s u s t a i n e d were as

as a result            of fans       fighting       one another.              Certainly,         there w ere           no

t ra n s m i s s i o n s    informing       us of what was a c t u a l l y occurring.                          The

tannoy system               could    be heard       but again,          it was      to    calm the        fans        down,

but nothing was               heard to tell             people       in the    crowd of the           injuries

     curring.          I feel       sure    that    had we        been told simply            to    ’h e l p ’ the

crowd we w ould             have     done en mass.

Having       realised         that    injury,       s    e   r   i    r ^ury^ was    occurring          to fans,            I
                ' I                                                                   .PAG E                .4

                                                                                                   R 253

         left my serial        and a t t e nd ed the L e p pings Lane end.        It was apparent

         that   some s upporters         had been killed.       I a t t e n d e d to one   person with

         the assis t a n c e    of members    of the    public.     He was    placed on a

         stretcher and taken to the gym.                En   route to w hich     I had     coins   thrown

         at me from     people     on the N or t h Stand.

         That   person was       later    identified as Fran c i s McALLISTAIR.             I had found

         this   deceased       person    lying to the    left of the goalposts at that

         Leppings Lane end.

         I w i t ne ss ed fans fighting       or arguing w ith other officers and              cameramen.

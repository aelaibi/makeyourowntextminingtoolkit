 Dear M r J a c ks on


 In r e s p on se to you r r e q u e s t for s t a t e m e n t s r e g a r d i n g the tragic events at
 Hillsbor ou g h, I w ou ld like to subm it the f o l l o wi n g o b se rv at io ns h oping these
 will be of h el p to you.


 I left Li ve rp oo l at 11 .3 0 am in c o m p a n y w i t h 5 friends, we t ra ve ll ed on a
 coach w i t h the A n f i e l d T ravel Club.            A l t h o u g h the journ ey is o n l y about 75
 miles we e n c o u n t e r e d s e v e r e d e l a y s on the M62 and it was n e a r i n g 2.00 pm
 bef ore we left the Ml n e a r Sheffield.                   D e s p i t e the late arrival and road
 c on ge s t i o n in the area, the p o l ic e wer e s t o p p i n g and s e a r c h i n g every coach
 for alcohol, was this r e a l l y necessa ry , in vi ew of the fact that all public
 hou ses in the area w e r e o p e n ?


The c oa ch d r iv e r took us dow n to the L e p p i n g s Lane end of the gr ound s h o wi ng
us wh e re the coach es w o u l d be parked, but the p ol ic e w o u l d not a ll ow us to
leave the c o a c h at the ground, we had to go w i t h the c oa c h a long w a y up a
hill, this left a c o n s i d e r a b l e w a l k to the ground.                   We arriv ed at the Le ppings
Lane t ur ns t i l e s at 2.25 pm.             A l o n g w i t h one of m y friends I had a seat in the
West stand, E n t r a n c e C.         T h e r e was se vere c o n g e s t i o n at E n t r an ce B and we
r e m a rk ed we wer e glad we did not hav e to use that entrance.                           T h e r e were very
few poli ce at the t u r n s t i l e s and those that wer e there were mo re intent on
s e a r c h i n g p eo pl e than e a s i n g co ngestion, this ma de the s it ua ti on eve n worse.
I was s e ar c h e d twice d e s p i t e b e i n g r e s p e c t a b l y dressed, 35 years old and
h a vi n g a s tand seat.        I s a w p o l i c e m e n s e a r c h i n g o ld er women.    All this time
suppor te rs we re r e q u e s t i n g the p o li ce to do s o m e t h i n g about the congestion.
This was o b v i o u s l y not a p r o bl e m w h i c h just o c c u r r e d at 5 m i nu te s to three.

Upon e n t e r i n g the g round I took               up m y seat in the West stand at the rear of
L eppings Lan e terrace.                  So me 10    to 15 m i n u t e s p ri or to kick off my friend and
m y s e l f r e m a r k e d h o w e m p t y the w i n g s ec ti o n s wer e and o b v i o u s l y a lot of people
had still to en te r the ground. On ce the m a t c h                        s t a rt e d it was obvi ou s the
m i dd l e sect i on was overc ro wd ed .              I was sat on the b ac k row of the West Stand,
just p r i o r to k i c k - o f f h u n d r e d s of s up p or t e r s wer e stood b e hi n d the back row'
several of these sh owed m e intact gr ound tickets and said there was no c h e c k i n g
going on outside.


A f te r a few m i n u t e s we s a w p e op le c l i m b i n g onto the pitch to escape the
ob vious overcro wd in g, p o l i c e we re f o rc in g them b a c k into the crowd.            Even
when the scale o^ the p r o b l e m b ec am e apparent, the p olice did not treat the
dis as te r in the w a y you w o u l d e xpect from trained offi cers, it was left to
y oung su pp or t e r s to help in the best w a y they could.              The di ff er e n c e between
the po lice r e a ct io n and the e x c e ll en t w o r k of the Fire Brigade was very
marked.
Wi th r egard to late arrivals, this shoul d hav e been a n t i c i p a t e d b e c au s e the
s i tu ation was the same last year.             In 1988 I t r a v el le d by car ov er the Wo o dh ea d
Pass d e s p i t e leavi ng at 11.00 am it was 2.5 5 pm by the time we arri ve d at the
ground.      T he c h o ic e of grou nd was ridi cu lo us .         The F A say H i l l s b o r o u g h is a
safe venue.        Le pp in gs Lane is w i d e l y r e g a r d e d amongst su pp or t e r s as o ne of
the worst s t a n d i n g areas in the Fi rs t Di vision, it is o v e r c r o w d e d and badly
fenced, w h y do they have d i v i d i n g fences, when only away s up po r t e r s use this
end?     I s tood at Leppings La ne for a L ea gu e ga me between S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y
an<1 Liverpool.         T he gr ound was c r o w d e d ve ry u n c o m X o r t a b l y so , and it was a
relief to leave at the end of the game.

The choic e of gr ound and the w ay the FA h a n d l e d the gam e was ver y bad, the
a ll oc a t i o n of tickets c ould ha ve given L i v e r p o o l the two largest se ctions
i.e. the P e n n i s t o n e end and the N o r t h Stand w i t h very s i m i la r access from the
Motorway.         Thi s w ou ld have a l l e v i a t e d a lot of the di fficulties.

The one l e ss on that mu st be learnt from this t r ag ed y is that s af et y of
specta to rs is param ount.             A n t i - h o o l i g a n m e a s u r e s m us t not be at the e x p e n s e
of s af et y or e v e n s p e c t a t o r com fort.

I feel that a w a y su pp o r t e r s get a r ou gh deal, they are o f t e n ba d ly treat ed by
the poli ce and c r a m m e d into the worst s e c t io ns of grounds w i t h no ro o f and if
they f ol lo w a su c ce ss fu l team like Liver po ol , find prices in cr eased at almost
e very game th ey attend.

I ho pe you find these few c o m me nt s u s ef ul to your enquiries.

Yours s i n c e r e l y

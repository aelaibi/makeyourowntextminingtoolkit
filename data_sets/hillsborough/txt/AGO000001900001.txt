     CROWD CONTROL AND HOOLIGANISM IN FOOTBALL GROUNDS


     Thank you for your letter                       dated 31st January.

     I had been alerted by the press reports, and have asked Roger
     Daw to look further into the matter and establish contact with
     those concerned at Home Office.

     I was interested in the accompanying correspondence.   I don't
     think we here are in danger of becoming "too Sir
     Humphreyesque". More seriously, I am pleased that the
     possible resource implications have been noted in the letter
     from the Chief Secretary; this is an aspect which I had asked
     Roger to keep in mind and he will alert our Finance Division
     at an appropriate stage .

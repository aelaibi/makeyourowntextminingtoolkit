                     JULIE ANN WEBSTER   -   Temporary Control Room
                                             Assistant




      On the 15th April 1989 I was  on 6.00a.m. - 6.00p.m. duty in
      the Operations Room on Console 5.

      At 1513 hours I recieved a call from the Fire Service on their
      direct line informing me of a house fire.
      I can't remember the address but whilst I was still connected
      to the Fire Service I heard Chief Inspector Edmundson shout
      to tell them we wanted cutting equipment at Hillsborough
      Football Ground.

      I told the Fire Service Operator but she wanted to know the
      location and I didn't know exactley, I can't remember the
      call but I remember there was some confusion as to what was
      required and Chief Inspector Edmundson took the phone from me
      and explained to them.

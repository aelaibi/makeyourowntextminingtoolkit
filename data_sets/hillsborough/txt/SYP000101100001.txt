DAVID JOHN FROST                                                                                                  R375




POLICE CONSTABLE 2130




HEELEY DHQ




I came on duty at 8.30 a.m. at Heeley DHQ, along with other members of the

Crime    and    Vandal        Squad       with   which        I   work:    Inspector        Beresford,         Sergeant

Eddison,       Bob    Crookes,        Russel          Wilks,      Andy    Justice,       Gary     Griffiths,         John

Trewick, Andy West and Martyn Smith.                              With us that day as a replacement was

Police Constable Alan Hampshire.                           Briefing from Inspector B.

We   travelled        to     the   ground.            On    arrival,      parked     our    van    in a prominent

position.

Briefing in the stand by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

As    Serial     21    we     were    standby          in     Leppings      Lane     pen.         We    took    up   our

positions. .

A call from the control box to be deployed at the turnstiles Penistone Road.

I paired       with Police          Constable          John Trewick         at    turnstiles       allowing       Notts

Forest fans into the K o p .                As in the past fans are in the main friendly and

well behaved with the odd exception.

A    number    of     fans    had     cans       of    beer       and    were    asked     to    finish    it    before

entering       the    ground.         I    assisted          Police      Constable       Andy    West     to    eject    a

Liverpool fan for jumping the turnstile.                                 He was taken to the Police room,

his details obtained and then he was ejected.

Time    14.15 p.m.         crowds building now but again apart from the odd drunk all

quiet    and    well       behaved.         I    returned         to    John    Trewick     on    the     turnstiles.

Police Constable Brougham                  (E2) had duties at the Pelican crossing in front

of us.     Dick arrested a very drunken fan, I assisted him to the Police room

which now is thronged with officers and their prisoners.                                         I returned to the

turnstiles naasing a number of my colleagues carrying two or three prisoners



                                                 fcav^o.
who were throwing themselves about shouting and swearing.

I went outside the ground again.                   By now very busy many people asking about

tickets, "Where can we buy tickets", both Notts and Liverpool fans.

It must have been 2.55 p.m.                 (1^55) we were called into the ground and sent

along    the    perimeter         track.    I was     at    or near     the    front    of the unit.        I

remember looking down the front of the North Stand, it seemed like chaos.                                   A

line of bobbies were facing the crowd as we approached the Leppings Lane end

of the stand, people were all over the track.                        I saw a Special Constable and

Police Constable 1785 struggling with a fan.                       I went to their assistance and

got    the fan in an arm lock and marched him back to the charge room, rushed

him    through the office area             which was full and straight into the cell.                   This

was also full of drunken, blood covered fans and about five officers just to

keep    the peace.          The    atmosphere      was     very   volatile.      There    were    about    12

prisoners,       all   but    two     or   three    were     screaming    and     shouting      about   they

wanted to watch the game.

I remained in the charge room for a couple of minutes because I thought it

was going to errupt any second.                    Absolute chaos.            A fan with a beard with

cut    lips and blood all over             his face was going berserk.            I tried to calm him

and    sit him down.He sprayed blood in my face                     as he shouted and swore.              The

match, the match.

I decided to leave the charge room and get back outside,                               there were enough

officers there.         On leaving I walked towards the main track gates.                          I saw a

line of Police dogs and handlers                   from near the gym door right round to the

ground gates, where they were intermingled with horses and bobbies.                                I began

to run my mind working fast.                 I thought it's really blown now the crowd was

very noisy.          I am on the perimeter track now running towards                         the Leppings

Lane, people and some officers ahead.                       People everywhere outside the fence

at Leppings Lane end.

On arrival at the other end, very strange scene people sat down by the fance

watching       the   game    whilst    others      frantic    looking    in towards       the    fence.     I
pushed        through to the fence near to the gate far right.                                  The holding area

was     still       near    full    fans     pouring      out.        I       look     inside    and      see    Police

Constable Justice spreadeagled against the fence, protecting a bobby between

his legs,       giving mouth to mouth and cardiac massage.                               Both their faces are

strained.             The officer       is     being knocked          all       over    by    fans     rushing     past

towards       the open gate.            I forced my way to the gate and climbed above the

escaping fans forcing my way through.                           I reached Police Constable Justice.

We     broke         away the      fencing      with other       Police          outside      and      fans     inside.

Everything was so chaotic, the fans just kept pulling at the fence after it

was broken.           I forced them off and we got the body out.                                Police Constable

Justice and I moved towards the                   centre of the pen, we                       saw another two bodies

right down at the front under the fencing.                             Blue, dead eyes open.                    Both of

us went to them and each started mouth to mouth and cardiac massage.

The    fence     above     is being ripped down,               flecks of blue and white paint fall

around.             Money on     the    ground    everywhere.                 Hands    picking      up.       Fence    is

wrecked, people            pouring out, force the two bodies out.                            Fans above shouting

and swearing, "You fucking bastards".

A     brief     state      of   calm.Climb       the    fence          into       the    centre       pen.       Police

officers        everywhere now.              Fans part,    a pile 4 or 5 deep of                    bodies.      Start

dragging        the bodies out passing            them through the fencing one                        after another.

Bobby    ties back the             ripped fencing.         All out.             Move further towards South

Stand.        More    bodies     in another       pile    in front of the gate.                  Again get them

out.      Megaphone        giving      orders.    Bodies are being passed                     from behind.            Two

chains of officers passing bodies out now meeting at the gate.

Call    comes       through     this ones      alive,     I shout repeatedly in a choked voice,

"This one alive".               Broken bodies being dragged apart trapping each other.

All out onto the pitch, make-shift stretchers and away.

All    the      bodies     are out      on    the pitch    now.        Bobbies working                away    on them.

Walking       and lying wounded everywhere.                     Fit    fans venting anger blaming us.

"You're       all    useless       bastards."          Loads    more          abuse.     Form     a    chain     across



                                                                          â€¢
halfway      line,    Notts    fans     chanting,   they   don't    know.     Liverpool         fans want

someone to fight with tremendous feeling of tension.                         With other officers I

then went to rear of Leppings Lane.                 Fire engines everywhere.

A    lad   called              barely    conscious    laid   by    the    fence   amongst       the    dead.

Nearby      a son    sits     by    the covered body of his dead            father.       Try and keep

           conscious.       Doctor examines.                 goes    in the Ambulance.                I help

lift him in.

Back into the ground.               Onto the pitch, find others in the unit, re-group.

We    return    to    the     fencing,    a    Liverpool   lady    comes    round.        We    are     just

standing      staring.        She    holds our arms and says,            thanks   lads.        I begin to

cry.

Sometime later we van up.               General patrol around Hillsborough.

0830 off duty.

This account of my experiences on that day is garbled and blurred.                                How can

you describe         such an event.           It is impossible,     I feel,       to describe such a

scene adequately.

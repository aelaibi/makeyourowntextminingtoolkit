   Thank you for your letter of 9 August and the results of the
   survey of costs, which we shall study with interest.

   Can I use the opportunity presented by this letter to raise
   the question of an agenda for the meeting which we have
   arranged for 30 August.

   We would like to know in advance what issues you will want to
   discuss so that we can arrange for representatives from other
   Divisions of the Home Office/DOE and other Government
   Departments if this is necessary.

   A phone call will suffice.    I have made a similar request to
   Graham K el l y .

                                                 Yours sincerely




                                                 P E BOLTON

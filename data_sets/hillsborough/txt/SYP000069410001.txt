                  had a packed lunch meal and the serial was briefed by PS HOpS^TTS as

                  to the specific duties we would be undertaking.                              These duties were to

                  patrol the area where Vne TV vans were.

                  UJe went      round to this side of the ground and I was detailed to control

                                                                                           ykfEMIS a nd a PC frgwf Eg

                  These gates were the               last entrance for the Nottingham Forest
                                                                                 PAGE         2
                                                                                 S13&7

supporters along t p i s side of the ground,          being ad J^rtfint to the

Leppings Lane s/Cd stand.         Because of this     and due to the fact that         no

Liverpool     supporters had been allowed to pass towards the South Stand

area from the Leppings Lane end comparatively few supporters                  came by

this entrance.          Nottingham Forest supporters who did not have tickets

for this entrance had been screened out by a check point,                 just at the

end of the rear of the South S t a n d .

Consequently there was only good humoured             talk with the few Nottingham

Forest supporters who         came our way and directing     people who weren't

sure where they should go.            On two occasions definitely some 'Lriy/?r poo 1

supporte^s/ ^anie from the Lep\^igs Lane end.           One two who projKfced

steward^gijfrds but did not have tickets claimed that they had been told

that they could collect         ’complimentary*    tickets from somewhere behind

the South Stand.          They were   informed that there was no chc             ■ entry

without tickets and 1 thi nk PC Ug^IS took them to have a word with PS

HOOOETT^        THe second occasion a „ „      who Ha, a , i c k ., for   tHo L a p p i n g

Lane End came from that direction and tried to gain entry through

Entrance E into the area beyond.            This was just prior to kick-off, 2.

40pm and he claimed that         it made good sense to enter at this entrance

because the crowds were so big at the Leppings Lane End.                  After a

few minutes talking PC Lewis escorted this man back ,to the Leppings

Lane end.      About this timjr I was aware of mounted/of f i cers

rushing t o w a r d s   the Lappings Lane end from somewhe^re^^trehi nd the South

Star^jK    Shortly after this the barrier fence was moved to a position

on the Leppings Lane side of entrance E from the end of the South

S t a n d .Durj.ng all this time, apart from mentioned above,         there were no

problems on the entrance and the majority of the fans were                 in good

humour enjoying the day out.From the cheering             inside the stadium it

was obvious that the match was beginning and the gatemen who was

minding my anorak told me he was closing and gave me mine and PC LEWIS
                                                                                PAGE      3

anorak before he went.         As   I was putting my anorak on I saw PC LEWIS

returning from the Leppings Lane end and as I was giving her the

ano rak I was told that fans had i nvaded the pitch and we we re required

i nsi d e .Immediately    I was with other officers at the large gate of

this entrance and when tS'ui opened we- went quickly through a tunnel,

down some steps through the seats and over a small wall oTVj>< the

pitc^/'a'rea.     At this stage Iwas not aware of the stadium           or the pitch

but as I looked at the .Le p p i ng>§/t!ane end I saw that the re       we re

s u p p o r t e r y an the pitch area behind the goals as I went over         I told

one fan to get back on the terraces,          I saw from his expression and

attitude that he was not looking to cause trouble and that he was

distressed.     He told me that      pea pie we re be i ng c rus hed in the terraces

and he had to get o u t .

I now began to reali se that        it was not just a pitch i nvas ion and it

may be more s er io us .     As I walked to behind the goals      I was aware of

people moving about but I was unsure where to g o .           I looked into one

area of the terrace and saw an open                n the fence.    As    I foil owed

the fence towards        the North Stand I saw supt^QJ^ers trying to he 1 p

people over $/fence w hich ran perpendi cular to the perimeter fence and

they seemed      disorganised but I think short of panic.       On the other

s ide of the     te r race dividing fence I saw that people we re       being    pushed

up against the fences        by the weight of the crowd in side.        As    I looked

along the perimeter fence I saw that some people we re splashed with

what    I think was vomi t front othe r people    i ns ide the crowd.        At this

point    I knew that people would be seriously injured.

I could see that there we re distraught supporters around the perimeter

fence on the pitch side        I began to tell them to move onto the pitch to

help    people as they were brought out.        It was obvious to me that they

were hindering the rescue of people i ns id e.

When the immediate area around me was          relatively c 1ear I turned back
                                                                                     PAGE       *
                                                                                     SI 367

to the fence and saw that some of the people at the front of the

ground were        in dange r of the i r life if they had not died already.                 I

saw that nsi de were trying to ^ ^ y ^ t h e       per imet e jj/fe r \c e and

were struggling to get over the top due to it being angled inwards.

At this     point I climbed onto a concrete wall which is just before the

perimeter fence and helped to pujtfT people o v e                      p of the

fenca^j     1 can remember    pulling about three people over the top of

the fence and passing them to officers stood on the floor behind

me.     I can't    remember what these people looked like but I think they

were all young men.         One was      practically exhausted at the top of the

fence and I had to drag him down and lower him to another officer.

I could see that people at the front of the fence were dying and at

this   point I made an attempt to pull the mesh away from the fence in

desparation.        I could not do this though.         During this period I was

aware of other officers doing similar things around me and there was a

senior officer to my right an Inspector             I think who had also been

pulling people over the fence.

I then saw that the o fj^ c e r         immediately to my right was         1eap^ig o v e r

the top of t j ^ f e n ce t ry i ng to reach people       in the crowd and pul 1 them

up.     I saw that he was     in danger of falling        into the terrace         in his

efforts to reach so as        I stood on the concrete wall            I he 1d hij^ 1egs so

t hat he cou-ld reach f ur ther wi thout any danger to himself.                   I thi nk it

was PC j / i z .     iW3       k*

I now had the opportunity to look round.               I saw the size of the crowd

in the whole stadium and could see people on the pitch tending to

injured.                            ^

As I looked into the tec/ace             I could see that gyUfple were obviously

dead a m d the crush at the front was developing              into a tangle of dead

and injured people as the pressure of the crowd subsided.                        I could see

officers were now inside the terrace area having                 c1 imbed the dividing
                                                                               page:      :
                                                                               81367

fences.

They had begun to pull bodies and injured people from the tangle                  in

front of me.       They were obviously upset by what was happening but

carried on.        I thought that all officers seemed to have worked

together despite there being no apparent direction.

I saw a dark hai red^cfi"rl^fSi^n^f^ ? g h t    blue jog suit she was   laid against

the fence in front of me.          She was trapped by her legs by other people

but she was trying to hold the upper half of her body off a

young       lad below her she said she was okay but        could not get up.      I

think the lad below her was dead.

I don't know how long         I held on to the officers      legs or if he managed

to lift anyone from the crowd but it became obvious to me that he

would not be able to reach anyone else and I pul 1ed him back onto the

concrete w a 11.

By this time the injured were being passed over the dividing fence and

through the perimeter gate onto the pitch.              I saw the dark haired girl

lifted free,      her feet had been trapped against a support for the

perimeter fence.

I then went to the gate where the injurgd were being passed onto thp

pit c h .    As I got there a man was parsed to me and together witiW'rC

3   2   and ^ n o t h e r man we carried him onto the pitch.     The man was
                                                                      vi \er~n \>
uncons/ious and I >could not find any pu ls e .          Together with PC Z&jfb I

tried to resu^iyjltate the man.        PC 3246 gave nxoj^Th to mouth whilst           I

gave C,         Whilst we we re doing this       I became aweare thatt the/rran
                                                                       the

who helped carry him was a friend,             who called the uncans ^j/pus man

Eri/r. After s o m e t i m e with no success, a man who said he was a dcuHTor
          ftoci,A|/u4                /
looked at E r i y arid said he w a ^ e a d . I told his friend to stay with

him for I.D.      purposes.    We then had to move the deceased further onto

the pitch as an ambulance was making             its way along the edge of the

pitch area.

                                                                             S1367

By this time I was     in a very bad s t a t e , and saw that Barbara    (PC 3246)

was also very u p s e t .   An other officer   came up and said we should both

to go the Gym area to rest.        As we started walking to the gym a cross

the pitch Barbara said she d i d n ’t want to go, and we both turned back

and headed towards Leppings Ljroe end.         I think at this time I saw

people taking the nets off the goal        posts.     At first I thought that

they were vandalising them but then realised that they were moving

them to help access.

I think at this time supporters at the Nottingham Forest end began to

chant at the Liverpool      fans who responded by running up the pitch in

their direction.      I immediately ran over telling       people to go back to

their end of the pitch to try to help the injured.            Some of the fans

were helping    in their own way,    others were angry and frustrated others

had obviously been drinking and some were crying,           others shouting

obscenities at Nottingham Forest fans and police and some just

shouting.    Some were claiming that they should have had the other end.

1 looked at the Nottingham Forest end and tome it loked full             I

couldn't understand what difference        it would have made.

I became aware that a cordj/n was being, formed a c r o s / t h e   pitch and I

joined this at the end adjoining to the South Stand.             As the cordon

moved down the pitch ushering Liverpool         fans down to the Leppings Lane

half of the pitch.      When the   cordon stopped near the half way line I

think   it became apparent that the Liverpool         supporters on the pitch

were starting to hurl abuse and vent their frustration on the

Nottingham Forest fans       in the South S t a n d , at this the cordon was

extended along the t o u c h l '

At this time I saw PC 313           n_s again and PC Ro             (?) who were

in my sarial   both appeared shaken.       PC Lewis    informed me of the time

15.5Q../ I thought    it woul d have been later than t h a t .

After this I can remember talking to fans on the pitch and trying to
                                                                           PAGE        7
                                                                           S1367

calm them down or reassure them         but   Iwas very upset and disturbed

myself at this stage.       I became    aware of    people bringing water out and

I had a few drinks from them.          I was very dazed and numb.      I can

remember Ron helping me by talking and myself and PC Lewis             crying

together for a while.       Then I was stood there just numb.         A Liverpool

supporters asked if I was okay and then asked how Everton had gone

on.     Around this time the decision was announced that the game would

not go ahead and the ground began to empty.            We started to move people

off the pitch.       There were different attitudes from the supprters             I

remember three in paticular who         shook my    hand and thank me for all the

efforts of the emergency services saying           that we'd done everything we

could.     This attitude was by far the mi no r i ty that I s a w „    Most were

angry,    some abusive,   some frustrated,      some dazed other were drunk and

just shouting for the sake of it.

                                       ally cleared X saw i              > with

Gill Lewis and Ron/Kraig and we         looked for the rest of the serial.

After    looking   inside the pitch we went to the entr^         _E where we were

originally and there met most of the other members of our serial.

Some of the caterers had made a big pot of coffee and I drunk about 3

or 4 cups.     My hands were shaking.         All offi cers looked devastated and

exhausted no one was talking very much.

I don't know how/touch later it was when we went back into the ground

for the debrie/ a nd after we ha'd given a brief summary of what we did

we were stood down to Claywfyee 1s for transport to El.

As well as the above      I carfi remember seeing the SOCO being attacked by

a group of Liverpool      %ns   near the perimeter fence.      I only saw the

group from a distance and as I approached the disorder           I saw officers

escorting the SOCO out whilst the groups shouted abuse at h i m .              I

thought at the time that he had beentaking           pictures and the fans

thought that he was a press photographer and that they did not
                                                                                     PAGE       8

            understand.

             I c a n ’t place this   i nc i dent chronologi cally but as I looked up the

            pitch I can remember seeing the SOCO go to behind the cordon across

            the centre of the pitch.

            During all the proceedings        I was aware   of the efforts being   put in by

            all of the emergency services and          to a large extent a lot of the

            supporters were helpful.         I spoke   with a nurse who had come from the

            crowd to help and a doctor.        With    that in mind,   I was also aware of a

            large number of people who for one reason or another were aggressive,

            abusive and unhelpful,       some of whom were sober and others obviously

            drunk.

                                                                            N MUTCH SIGNED

I have viewed a mortuary photograph;              Ref No 41 of Eric HUGHES but am

unable to be 1007. positive that it was the face of the Eric                     I dealt

wit h «



I first caffie        into contact with Eric HUGHES at       the emergency gate at

the front of          Per / 2, where he was handed to me     by other Officers. I
               -■■■     —                               ;      ;                    “
have marked on a plan by means of a dot this point and can produce the

plan as Ref No Ntil (Exhibit No                    ).   I then carried HUGHES to a

point on the          pitch outside the 18 yard box but inside the penalty area

and rendered          first aid there.



I left HUGHES at this point and had no further contact with h i m .

I have marked this point on a plan, Ref no NM2                 (Exhibit No               >.



I have viewed the following              list of photographs       in which Eric HUGHES)

can be seen getting           carried across the pitch and lying on the floor at

the Spion Kop end of the ground.               I am not in any of these

photographs.          The body is indicated by a blue dot marked 41,                is that

which I have referred to as moving from Pen 2 to the pitch.

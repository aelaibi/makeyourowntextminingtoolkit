MINISTER’S CASE             AND THE HILLSBOROUGH FUND


You asked whether I had any ideas for a reply to j
letter of 18 April (enclosed for copy recipients).


As we discussed, the drafting is very difficult given the high
emotional element and the need to avoid any possible inference
that his son's severe handicap is unimportant.      My first try is
attached, offered for critical scrutiny.


I am copying the letter here to Richard Kornicki who may comment
in relation to previous emergency fund contributions,     and to
David Mould on Hillsborough.   Any views, please?


(Phone numbers are Mr Lee, 276 0608; Mr Kornicki 273 3221;
Mr Mould 273 3099.   I am on 273 2952).

                                              F8 Division
18 May 1989
Thank you for your letter of 18 April to the Prime Minister about
your son in the context of the Government contribution to the
Hillsborough disaster fund.    I have been asked to reply.


I am deeply sorry for the personal tragedy of your son's serious
handicap.    It is impossible fully to compare two very different
types of tragedy, although I entirely understand your wish to do
so. 'Everyone inevitably experiences grief in very personal
terms: through their own direct contact with it, or through the
insight of past experience or imagination.    I am sure many people
entirely fail to comprehend the anguish you experience.


As a single incident, Hillsborough does stand out from most other
severe personal tragedies not only on account of the very large
number of people killed, which I do believe contributes to the
grief experienced by bereaved relatives, but also for the
widespread public distress (not simply sympathy)   in Liverpool and
elsewhere.    I think it is right the Government should make
difficult decisions, in exceptional cases, to make special public
expenditure available.    I believe the contribution to the
Hillsborough fund was reasonable in relation for example to the
overall provision for the severely disabled, and followed
occasional contributions to similar funds in the past.


[DSS:? I am not sure how far you may have explored the
availability of payments to assist with your son's support, but
the general position is ...]


Nothing can bring back to life someone killed at Hillsborough, or
restore to full and normal health the chronically sick or
disabled, hard as it is for everyone concerned to come fully to
terms with that.    The Government's task is to try to make the
best arrangements it can in each case, recognising overall limits
and competing claims on resources.


I hope this explanation at least offers you some reassurance.
Please accept my very real, personal sympathy and - as best I can
- my understanding of your distress and difficulties.

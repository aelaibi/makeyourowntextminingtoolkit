It    was       not           long       before         the       medical          students            could          not      keep       up    with        t

circulating                     around          the     patients,,               We    needed          a    trained            Accident           S

Emergency                 Nurse          who     did        not    need       as      much       supervision                as      the    medical

was      given            sufficient               staff          and      the     operation               became        much        more

efficent,,                    Later        in    the        afternoon,             Doctors            and     staff         were      arriving              i

great         numbers               and        were     seeing          patients            in     any        s p a r e room        or space

The      patients                  suddenly            stopped          coming         m       and     we     certainly              had       Doctors

As    the      patients                  slowed         down       I    then       contacted               the       X -R ay     Department                to

see      if    it         was       clear        of     major          and    moderate            patients             and       could         taka        th

This       would              not      have      been        any       mors      than       twenty          patients.

I    recall             that        at     one     time          during       the      afternoon,                I    called         all       nursing

staff         together                 because          they       were       looking            to    give          patients         physical

care,,         The            situation            was       that       physical            care       was       not     needed           in    the
    t            major:!, ty of       cases      but what was             needed was       psycho log i cal         care,,

                 One   of the major             o p erations        was    to direct       them    to   care    for      patients

                 and then       put      them     in toucn with            other v o lunteers       on tne          Department,         if

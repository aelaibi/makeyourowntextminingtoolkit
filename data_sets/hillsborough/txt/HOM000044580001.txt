   Dear Jack,


   Hillsborough Inquiry Decision

  You may recall that I wrote to you on 26th January on this matter. As I predicated at
  the time there is an overwhelming feeling of disappointment - indeed anger - in
  public opinion In Merseyside.

  Justice must not only be done but be seen to be done. In this case it has not been
  seen to be done as far as people in Liverpool are concerned.

  I know that your hands are tied somewhat by procedures and existing legislation, but
  I would urge you to find some way around those and reconsider your decision.


  Yours sincerely,


                                                                                              RECEIVED BY

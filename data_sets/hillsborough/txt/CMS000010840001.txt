HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY:   CORRESPONDENCE   FROM   COMMANDER   FENTON,
ST JOHN'S AMBULANCE

I understand that it was agreed with The Speaker's office that
we should reply direct (officially) to Commander Fenton and that
a copy of the letter should be passed to his office for
information. I have now written as within.

You may care to know that Commander Fenton is a long standing
correspondent with the Division.    We agreed some time ago to
include more detailed advice in the Home Office/Scottish Office
Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds on first aid. That is being
taken up within the general revision of the Guide following the
Hillsborough Inquiry's Final Report.

I enclose a short draft note which you may care to send with a
copy of the reply to the PS to The Speaker.

Dear Commander Fenton

SAFETY OF   SPORTS    GROUNDS:   FINAL REPORT OF   THE HILLSBOROUGH
INQUIRY

The Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr Bernard Weatherall has
sent a copy of your letter of 23 February about the role of
St John Ambulance at football grounds to the Home Secretary.
I have been asked to reply.

First, I am sorry you have not received a reply to your letter
of 15 February marked for the attention of Mr Brown. I am afraid
we have not been able to trace any record of having received that
letter so perhaps I can take this opportunity to respond to the
points you raise both in that letter and the one which you sent
to The Speaker.

The importance of first aid and medical provision at major sports
grounds is, I believe, reflected in Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations. The contribution made by St John Ambulance at
football grounds and elsewhere is both known and valued by
spectators and participants alike. I think this is implicit in
the Interim Report, (paragraphs 296 and 297) in describing the
prompt response of St John's Ambulance on that fatal day at
Hillsborough.

The amendment to the Interim Report recommendation on the
provision of ambulances so as to include ambulances approved by
the ambulance authority is not intended to exclude St John's or
other voluntary organisations. Indeed, it has quite the opposite
effect by giving clubs more choice when providing ambulance
cover. That cover can be from a private firm or from a voluntary
organisation.   The safeguard on standards is that whatever is
provided must be approved by the ambulance authority.
    We are pleased to learn that St John Ambulance is able to play
    such an effective role in the provision of improved first aid
    and medical facilities at football grounds in London. We shall,
    as you suggest, provide more guidance on this issue in the
    revised Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.         We shall be
    consulting Commander Hammond, among others, shortly.

    The membership of the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) has yet
    to be determined.   I cannot therefore give you an assurance on
    its composition at this stage but we have noted your views.
    I am arranging for a copy of this letter to be passed to the
    office of The Speaker and for an additional copy to be sent to
    Commander Hammond for information.

                                            Yours sincerely

 I mentioned to you the tremendous amount of input we are having
 at present.

TAYLOR FINAL REPORT
We are very disappointed that the voluntary support St. John
Ambulance has given to sport, and football in particular, is
not mentioned in the final report.

Of the 92 clubs in England and Wales we provide members for 85.
In London alone we have 12, plus of course Lords, The Oval,
Twickenham, Wimbledon tennis and Greyhounds etc.

 Speaking for the London designated grounds I, through my own
 initiative, am on 14 safety teams / advisory committees and, as
 a result, have since the Bradford fire and before next season
 ensured that new or re-furbished accommodation is provided.

 I have written to the Home Office hoping that the Football
 Licensing Authority should include a person with "hands-on"
 knowledge of the medical input.

AMBULANCE DISPUTE
I enclose statistics of the assistance we have given in London
to Regional Health Authorities and the Police.
These speak for themselves.

 Hopefully you will be able to help.

 Kind regards,

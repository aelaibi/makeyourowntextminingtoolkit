Police Sergeant 2264


I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police presently stationed at
HQ Training Centre, Green Lane, The Common, Ecclesfield, Sheffield.


At 8.30am on Saturday, 15 April 1989, I commenced a special duty in relation
to the F.A. Cup Semi-Final, Liverpool v Nottingham Forrest at Hillsborough,
Sheffield.


At that time I collected a radio from the gymnasium at Hillsborough and then
made my way to the Traffic Headquarters at Claywheels Lane, Sheffield.      I
had been allocated duty at that location to act as "Logistics Officer."


On arrival, Inspector D. Lawson (HQ's Research and Development Department)
briefed me regarding the duties of "Logistics Officer" which included :-

1. Ensuring that sufficient tables and chairs were laid out to cater for 400
   other officers taking meal in the afternoon.
2. Ensuring the tea urns were topped up with boiling water to provide tea
   and coffee as required.
3. Ensure the security of Claywheels Lane and to prevent the unauthorised
   parking of cars in the car park affronting the building.
4. Ensure that all radios and de-brief sheets were handed in by officers
   going off duty.

At about 2.00pm I used my personal radio to inform ground control that
Claywheels Lane was full of parked coaches and there was no room for any
more.     I received an acknowledgement and I heard the controller then pass
that information to Inspector Sykes advising any further coaches from
Liverpool to park on Halifax Road.         That is the only time I used my personal
radio that day.        At that time I can say communications were good.


As the kick off time approached I remember the volume of messages being
passed over the radio increased.         I recall an urgent request being passed to
"open the gate"        and I recognised the voice to be that of Superintendent
Marshall.      From then on there were continuous transmissions over the radio
network from many officers, all with a sense of urgency and panic in their
voice.       At that time I formed an opinion that           there must have been some
fighting in the        crowd   which is not unusual at a football match.           I then
thought there had been a pitch invasion and it was not until I heard a voice
say "There are people dying" that I realised that a major disaster was taking
pi ace.


A short while later Superintendent Brougham (Superintendent, Traffic) arrived
at Claywheels Lane and I asked him if I should attend at the ground.              He told
me   to man     the    telephone   switchboard   which      I did.   I received   several
telephone calls requesting Police Motor Cyclists to escort ambulances and
assist with traffic flow.          I passed all messages to Superintendent Brougham

who was directing traffic mobiles accordingly.


At   about    4.10pm     I received   a telephone    call     telling me   to   attend   at
Ecclesfield Training Centre to assist            in setting up a Casualty Enquiry
Bureau.      I arrived there at 4.20pm and formed part of the Casualty Enquiry
Bureau Team until going off duty at 10.45pm that day.

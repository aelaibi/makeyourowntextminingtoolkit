    Dear Mr Dabbs

    Adlington v Duckenfield: Adlington v Murray

    You may be aware that a further abuse of process hearing will take place at Leeds Crown
    Court in January 2000. In order to prepare for these proceedings, I should be grateful if you
    would forward a transcript of the proceedings held in July at the Magistrates’ Court. We will,
    of course, meet all costs involved.

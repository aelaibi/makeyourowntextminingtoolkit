INTRODUCTION
In 1987 Barclays took a bold decision to become involved
in soccer, a sport experiencing high profile problems.
Despite continuing difficulties, the initiative has proved
successful. Barclays is firmly associated w ith a sport that
appeals to all ages and groups.
The potential now exists to establish Barclays as an active
force in the rebirth of the national game as family
entertainment.
The Football League has been perceived, through lack of
communication, as a body contributing little or no benefit
to the sport.
A proactive form of cooperation is needed to enhance the
game's image, and Barclays, w ith the Football League, is
now ideally placed to take the initiative.
To assist Barclays and the Football League, Panini, the
newest member of Maxwell Communication Corporation,
w ith its years of involvement in football worldwide, and
special appeal to youth markets, can and will play, an
im portant role shaping the industry of tomorrow.
The three form the fabric of the soccer industry and
collectively represent a potentially powerful force.
PROPOSAL
Having gambled and w on two years ago, Barclays are
now presented with another difficult decision. Should
they "quit while ahead" or go for the jackpot.
Our aim is to assist Barclays in reaching a positive
decision to support the Football League, and avail
themselves of promotional and commercial opportunities
which are bankable, and serve to enhance the image both
of the bank and the game.
This presentation will focus on three principal initiatives
aimed at offering opportunities for transforming relatively
passive involvements, into collective, proactive roles.
    • Barclays League Soccer Visa - a card
      intended to satisfy the disparate needs of
      supporter, club and government, providing
      identification w ithout stigma, whilst
      offering attractive benefits to the
      cardholder.
    • Club Panini - a club which will embrace
      the established association between
      children, football and Panini. It provides
      a vehicle for Barclays to develop
      the child and youth market in a sympathetic
      manner.
    • Soccer Challenge - a magazine which will
      provide a platform allowing the Football
      League to answer to its critics by
      encouraging direct response from the
      spectators, and advertising the positive
      input of Barclays and The Football League to
      the game.
The three proposals, and in particular the Barclays League
Soccer Visa and Soccer Challenge, represent innovative
and im portant initiatives w ithin the industry. In the light
of this, the M irror Group, already a highly respected
figure w ithin football, w ould welcome the opportunity to
work together w ith Barclays and the Challenge Group to
the benefit of the national game.
Challenge Group proposes that these three marketing
initiatives are the trum p cards which collectively give
Barclays the winning hand.
THE CHALLENGE GROUP
These marketing initiatives have been developed by the
Challenge group of companies, a global marketing and
communications company which was recently acquired by
Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC).
The Challenge Group has been incorporated w ithin
Panini, the w orld's largest manufacturer of sticker
collections for the children's market and premium market,
itself acquired by MCC in October 1988.
Challenge w as formed specifically to achieve global
marketing objectives through the development of
innovative communication packages.
The company is currently applying its expertise to a
variety of distinctive projects including:
'Driving the Dream' - a major communications project to
stimulate and harness the enthusiasm and support of the
country for the Manchester Olympic bid.
'Challenge Gold' - an innovative communications vehicle
for the marketing of financial services in the high street.
'The Spirit of Brooklands' - a communications programme
to develop the commmercial potential of a sporting
landmark.
'The America's C up' - creation and implementation of the
commercial strategy for the British challenge for the
Americas Cup.
'The World Yachting Grand Prix' - a major marketing and
promotional project involving the application of
match-race sailing to a global market.
'A rena Football Europe' - the integration into the
European market of a new sport tailored for television and
arena audiences.

BARCLAYS LEAGUE SOCCER VISA
Introduction
The events of recent seasons have led the government to
believe that soccer is unable to put its own house in order -
to such an extent that the Government has now taken an
active role in the game.
The principle of a compulsory ID card is here to stay. The
footballing public consider it to be an infringement of civil
liberties.
The Barclays League Soccer Visa card, however, w ill be a
benefit card first and an ID card second, deflecting
current criticism.
The Concept
The Barclays League Soccer Visa card is a joint venture
initiative between Barclays and the Football League.
It will be a benefit card providing a whole range of
exclusive privileges and high street discounts to the
holder.
It is a form of personal identification allowing supporters
controlled entry to all football grounds.
The cardholder is provided w ith access to an electronic
ticket purchasing facility exclusively through Barclays,
either on a cash or credit basis i.e. all season/entry ticket
sales.
Benefits
On any Saturday in the season, nearly half a million
people pay by cash to attend Barclays League matches.
Over a season, gate receipts (excluding season tickets)
approach £50 million.
Barclays would be seen as a driving force behind a
positive move aimed at eradicating soccer's most
contentious issue.
Barclays w ould manage the ticket income of 92 Football
League clubs.

CLUB PANINI
Introduction
Panini International SpA, w ith its head office in Modena,

year for the children's market and premium market
making it the biggest company of its type in the world. In
the UK Panini will sell over 300 million stickers for their

The Concept
"Club Panini" is a major marketing initiative to be
implemented by Panini later this year.
Its target is to package its existing database of young
customers into a membership w ith a potential to embrace
the whole family.
This will create a customer base to which can be targeted
its existing product range, along w ith more diversified
Panini products.
Currently Panini customers range from 3-15 years old, and
the development of Club Panini and new products will
extend this age spectrum into the late teenage market.
Benefits
Barclays Bank w ould have access to upw ards of 2.5-3
million children passing through the Bank to join Club
Panini.

SOCCER CHALLENGE
Introduction
Soccer Challenge is a new initiative developed for
Barclays by The Challenge Group.
The Concept
It is a free quality magazine distributed to all 92 clubs in
the Barclays Football League.
The objective of Soccer Challenge is to provide the football

cards, crowd control, violence, safety, ground facilities,
admission prices, Europe, artificial pitches, superleague,
television, sponsorship, community involvement, league
structure, transfer system, etc.
Soccer Challenge will be supported by advertising and
sponsorship and thus is a self liquidating promotion.
Soccer Challenge, acting as a guardian of the interests of
today's football follower, issues the challenge to all
parties to come together and positively seek the
rem edies necessary to make soccer B ritain's prem ier
sport.




                11
Benefits
Barclays will be seen to be supporting and developing the
industry it sponsors.

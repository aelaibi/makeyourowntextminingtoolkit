    FROM:   ACC (Operations) West Midlands Constabulary

    From 19 April 1989 Superintent Roy Taylor will assume responsibility for

    the enquiry based     at Hammerton Road.         He will be responsible     for all

    mattters of policy under the authority of Lord Justice Peter Taylor.



    With immediate effect only those enquiries necessary to preserve evidence

    will be undertaken.    For example, no interviews will be undertaken, except

    under circumstances where people volunteer information and an enquiry is

    necessary   to   ascertain   the   nature   of    the   information   and   preserve

    evidence.   Superintendent Taylor will make the necessary decision in areas

    of ambiguity.

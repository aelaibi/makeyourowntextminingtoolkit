                I   have      lived here         for about        12 m o n t h s .

                As a rule           the shop       is open for        busin e s s    on      most m a t c h days a l t h o u g h    I

                do very        little      trade         on these    days.

                The       shop was      proba b l y       open   in 1988 w h e n L i v e r p o o l    an d N o t t i n g h a m

                F o r es t    played at H i l l s b o r o u g h      in the semi-final;,             however      I cannot

                remember a n y th in g          to note about           this game.

                On Saturday,            13th A p r i l , 1989 I was            in the        shop on my own all           d a y ,the

                § hop      being open        for    business,        from 9 . 0 0 a m     to about 3pm.
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               S90 3

F r om about 9 . 0 0 a m w h e n         I op e n e d up that day there were                    one     or two

s u p p o rt e r s about       by the     ground and this               built    up s t e a d i l y all      day.

I w o u ld say about             11.0 0 a m there were            supporters          passing     the    shop       in

numbers.             The mai n front          shop w i n d o w only gives              asmall     v iew of

L e pp in gs Lane and doesn't                 cover       the a r e a by the ground e n t r a n c e            so        I.

c o u l d n ’t see whet h e r       or not       these        supporters        were    going     straight          into

t h e ground.

1 went        out     of the shop about           1 pro to have a look what was                      happening

d own by the ground               entrance.          T here were         quite a few s u p p o r t e r s        around

by the e n t rance           1 c o u l d n ’t see        if they were a c t u a l l y going             in the

ground.         There were quite a few people                          drinking       from    cans    on their way

to the match.              Most    of    these    can:; w® re          lager    but    there were        one    or two

CjpHs .of      coca-cola.          N o b o d y at the         time     s e e m e d to be drunk        or drinking

e x c e s siv ely.        I thought at         this       time    that    there w ere         quite a lot           of

s up p o r t e r s   about     c e rt ai nl y more        than    I see       for a normal       match

day    but     then a ga in       it was      a semi          final.

B u si ne ss    was     very     poor   by    this       time and under        yfie c i r c u m s t a n c e s w h e n
                                                     \                       /
my    partner         returned we d ec i d e d           to   lock up t h e / s h o p f or the rest of the

day this w ou ld be a bout 2 . 3 0 pm.

When     I. locked       up I     d i d n ’t notice any           particular          crowd    p r o blems     and

traffic        in L e p p i ng s Lan e was        flowing         freely.

I noti c e d that          on the       grey box         next    to the       pelican    crossing

                were a number           of    beer       coke and       lager    c a n s , and one       or two

bottles        of beer and         lager at       the foot           of this     box    on the       pavement.

I c o u l d n ’t see       the    front      e n t rance at       this    time    but all       the     fans

appeared         to be going        into      the entrance             most    of them were          drinking

up their         cans and d is ca r d i n g       them along            the    roadside.        Generally

t h o ug h    I d i d n ’t see a n y o ne      that was          drunk and       the    crowd    see m e d     to

be b e h a v i n g     r e a so na bl y well     a n d orderly.

              is a w h ol es al e w a r e h o u s e       near       the P A R K W A Y M A R K E T area,    in Shef f i e l d .

             On this         short    j ou r n e y    I remember         seeing a lot of          people      still       making

              their way        to the football             ground.

             We    retur n e d from the W a re ho us e                at about 3 . 4 3 p m but was          un a b l e    to get

              into L e p p i n g s Lane at first               because         it was    bloc k e d   off e v e n t u a l l y

             after      ex pla i n i n g where we          lived to the           police we gained            entry       to

             L e p pi ng s Lane.

             As we drove along L e p pi ng s                  Lane      there were a        lot   of fans w a l k i n g         up

             the     lane a w a y from the match,                    a lot of t hem se e m e d d azed a n d              confused,

              I could see           by the g ro u n d a couple              of fire      engines      and some       police

             vehicles.          The    fans       d i d n ’t seem noisy or a g g r e s s i v e         and m y s e l f     or

                             were    not    t h r e a t e n e d or    even spoke        to by these        fans.

             We    parked      the    car    in                             and went      into    the shop by the               rear

             entranee.

             From     time     to time we            looked    out     of the     upstairs window           fans     gradually

             d i s p er se d t hr o u g h o u t      the even i n g      but   I d i d n ’t see an y       i n c idents        of

             d i s order      or drunkeness.

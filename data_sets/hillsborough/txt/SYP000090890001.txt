We    arrived           at       the    L e ppi n g s            Lanj^turnstiles                      at       about            half past             two

(1430)          and     it       was    very        croi                     There          was       just           a    crowd        of      people        al l

trying          to    get        into    the yfro u nd .                    T h e re    was          no       queues            Just      one     mass

making          their        way       towards          the        ground.              It       is       awkward               getting          in    the       end

because          it     becomes          pretty              narrow          at     the      outer             way        gates.

I have          been        to    this       ground              and    know        exactly               where           I was        going.

As    I got          nearer        to    the        turnstiles                 it      got       very          tight            a n d I was           crashed

and       once       inside        the       outer           iron       gates          it    was          very           frightening              because

of    the       crowd        crush.           The       situation                 was       made          worse           because           there       were

not       any    signs           showing          you        which           turnstiles                   to    go        to     and      people        were

crossing             each        other       to     try          and    find/their                   way       in.

           and                     had       tickets              for       jme     terrace               and        the        rest      of     us    had

tickets          fo r       the    stand          so    they/left                 us,                                                            and    myself

were       together              and    slowly          ma^fe          our     way      to       a    turnstile.                     It     took       about        a

quarter          of     an       hour    to       g e y to         th e      turnstile                I only              saw     one       Policeman             on

a    horse       near        the       turns      X.JL 1 e   .     I went           through               a    turnstile               gave       up    my

ticket          and     o n c e \insidsf t h e                   turnstile             there          was        no       crowd        crush.           I met

up    with       my     friends          a/id w e            made       our       way       towards              the       steps,           which       lead

to    the       West        Stand.           I cannot              remember             if m y            ticket           was       again        checked

or    not .          I went        up    the        steps          and       I think             I showed                 my     ticket          at    the       top

to    a    steward           who       pointed          out        my       seat.           Although                 it    was       very        busy,

there       was       no      problems             and    I got          to    my    seat       without          any       problems,            My

seat    was         empty          when       I'reached             it    it    was        situated         about          half    way    down

the    stand          in      tlw^entre.                  At    the       time       I re a c h > « K 7 n y      seat       I think       it        wa<

about       ten       t jr    three       (1450)          and       the       playerswere               not      on    the       pitch.

I took       xx\w     seat         the    players             came       out    and        everything            appeared          to    be     in

order.       iThe            first       time       1 heard          of       any    trouble          was      when        someone       said,        !I

Theres       crowd            t r o u b l e , 11        I looked          down       into       the     Leppings            Lane    terrace

and    saw       people            climbing             over    the       perimeter             fence       into       the       pitch.         I

saw    the       Liverpool               goal       keeper          speak       to    a     Policeman,              and     the    Policeman

ran    across            the       pitch       to       the    referee.              1 was        aware        of     the    game       being

played       and             I remember             Liverpool             hitting           the     cross        bar ,      and    after        this

the    game         was       stopped.

I could          n ot        see    people          being       pulled          up    into        our     stand,           but    I could           see

people       climbing               over       the       fence       around          the      pitch.           1 could           also    see

people       being            pulled          up    from       the       crowd       over       the     fence         and    onto       the

p i t ch.

I was       looking               around       from       the       stand       for                 and                     but    c o u l d n ot

see    them,          I was         worried             because          I knew       they        were      in      the     terrace.            I

realised            the       situation             was       very       serious           when     I saw        people          being

covered          up     with        coats          on    the    pitch          an^they            appeared            to    be    dead.         I

was    too       far         away       from       the    pitch          tj/identify              any     injured           or    dead

             I heard      on    the    Tannoy       that          the   game     had    been    abandoned          a n d we    all      left

             family      but    could      not     before         we    reached        Liverpool     and     the      supporters

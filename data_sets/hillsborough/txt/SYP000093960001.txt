between the       rear   of the West S ta nd and the             rear of the terrace

turnstlrl^ block.          In this a re a there were a            lot of people mil ling

about as    I w a l k e d from the West S tand stair                   towards        the entrance

to the Cent ral turmal, beneath the West S t a n d , I                            body        lyi nq on

the floor,     the head of this body had been                  covered up wit h some                 sort

of garment,       1 think       that    the body was    that of a male           person        but    I

cannot    remember what          clothes    that    person was wearing.               I also      saw

other supporters         sitting        on the floor    in this area at           the        rear of the

West Stand,       who    I presume were eit-hef^injured or in shock.



At the    time of the H i l l s b or o ug h D is aster        I was a t t e n d i n g    an Health

and Safety First Aid             course,    a course a rr an g ed by            e/)np 1 o y e r




Because    of my knowledge             of resusc it at io n techniques         I had         left the

West S ta nd   intending         to go onto the       pitch to assist w ith              rendering

First Aid.



I went    from the area at the             rear of the West Stand and ente re d the

Central    tunnel    I ran along the entire               length of the tunnel          out onto

the Leppings Lane          terraces.



As    I ran d                           I saw people walking         back up the tunnel            to

leave    the terraces       I think      there were       people     lying down or sitting              in

the tunnel.        I cannot       say    if there were any daad or            injured    persons         in

the    tunnel    or describe any of the             people who       I saw   inside the tunnel

because    I rushed thro ug h the tunnel               to get out onto        the   pitch.



As    I came out of the tunnel             onto the terraces          I looked to my      right

into    pen number       three    I saw that P o l i c em e n were still         in pen number

three    passing    injured or dead supporters                out of that      pen onto      the

pitch through the gateway                in the front      perimeter     fence.      I couldn't

describe any of the supporters                   I only   looked at this       scene    for a short

time and then       I made my way down pen number                  four towards      the front

perimeter       fence.



As    I got towards       the front      of pen number        four    I saw a number      of    people

milling about       in that       pen.     I never saw any bodies            or injured      people

in pen four at that          time.



I left    pen number       four    through either a hole             in the front      perimeter

fence or it m ay have            been the gateway         in the fence.



I got out of       pen number four and onto the                 pitch at a time        I can only

estimate    to have       been about 3.23          pm {1323)     or 3 .30    pm (1330).



As    I got out of       pen number       four    I saw a St J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e m a n who was

at tending a supporter.             They were       positioned behind the L ep pings Lane

end goals,       they were       on the grassed are a at the            rear of the goal           on
                                                                                                   P AGE      4
                                                                                                   S3822

the North S ta nd side of the goal?                     at that time         I remember      the goal

nets were still            up.     I a p pr o ac h ed them to see          if I could assis t as the

St J o h n ’s man was         on his own.



The St J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e m a n was a white male,              quite     elderly     in probably

his early sixties,               he had grey hair,          he was wearing a cap and was                in

full    uniform and wearing a uniform jacket wit h white                              belt and band

across     his shoulder and             chest.



The supporter          was    lying    on his back the St J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e m a n was

a dm i ni st er in g    both m o u t h - t o - m o u t h and heart massage.



I joined them           I then a d mi n is t er e d m o ut h - t o - m o u t h   r es us ci ta ti on whilst

the St J o h n ’s man did the heart massage.



When    I first a p p r o a c h e d them I had looked at the supporter and had

thought     that       he looked dead,          his face was         purple and there was a blood

type    liquid coming            from both of the mans             ears and his        nose.



We a tt e mp t ed      to resuscitate         this supporter          for about       three or four

minutes,      he failed to make any                response,       I noticed as        I gave m ou th to

mouth that       the supporter           had been drinking            1 noticed a strong smell of

alcohol     from his mouth.



Having a tt e mp t ed to          resuscitate       this supporter           for about     three or four

minutes a man a p pr o a c h e d us he said he was a doctor,                          this man examined

the supporter           for any signs         of a pulse,        this man told us that            the

supporter was           dead and not to bother               continuing.



The man who         i dentified himself as a doctor was a white male aged about
                                                                                                  PAGE
                                                                                                  S3S22

25 to 30 years w ith short                 light brown hair and was              casually d ressed he

was well       spoken.



,he supporter we tried to                  revive    I can describe as white male a ged

about    eighteen years,               he was about 5ft 7ins         tall with a small           frame

an d very thin,         he had shortish brown              coloured hair.            I cannot    remember

what    this    lad was w e a r i n g .          Do<£^    Cede     OuSSlo^      HL



Both myself and the St John's A m b u l a n ce m an then                    left this     lad    in the

same    position.          A P o l i c e ma n and a supporter        put this        lad on an

ad ve rtising     hoarding and as far as                 I can remember         carried the hoarding

ar ou nd the     rear      of the goal and onto            the    playing    surface     on the North

S t an d side    of the ground,            1 cannot      say where    they went        to after      this.

I cannot       be positive         but    I think as the hoarding was                picked up some

one threw a jacket               over    the   lad's body,       covering    his middle,        I cannot

say what       type   or    colour the jacket was.



After    leaving      this       first    lad,    1 tried to revive and having seen him

being    taken away myself and the St John's a m b u l a n c e m a n                   remained

together       to see      if we       could assist any other         supporters.



There were a couple               of    lads   in their    early twenties who           had been

behind us trying            to    revive another         supporter whilst we were

resuscitating the first an d above m e n t i on e d                  lad.



These    s upporters were              right next to where         I had first        been on the

grassed area behind the Leppings Lane                       goal    (North S tand side).



I could see       that      these       lads were    not a d mi n is te ri ng    resusc it at io n

correctly and because                  of this myself and the elderly St John's man

took   over from them          I was a ga in giving m o u t h - to - mo u th whilst          the St

John's man gave          heart massage.

                                                                n d t c v s& td t re G a r tu v d y
This   second supporter who we a tt e mp t ed to                revive      on first      looking at

him    I saw that       his eyes were open and staring               he wasn't       breathing         but

because     the     colour   of his    c omplexion was almost              normal   I thought        it

may be possible          to revive     him.



We a d m i n i s t e r e d m o u t h - t o - m o u t h and heart massage    for about     thirty

seconds when the man vomitted,                we turned him onto             his side and        cleared

his airway,           he d i d n ’t show any signs of life and I could not find                        any

pulse,    we turned the supporter               onto his back and continued m ou th to

m ou th and heart massage we             continued for just over a minute and the

supporter      v om itted again,       we    carried out the same            procedure as before

but again there was            no signs of      life.      We   continued to        resuscitate

a gain until          we were a p pr o a c h e d by a man who      identified himself as a

doctor this           man was also young and well spoken               I cannot     say    if   it     was

the same man who            had come to us before and            looked at the first

suppo rte r .



This   man who        said he was a doctor           looked at the supporter            on the       pitch

very quickly and said something                 like,      "You might as well          leave     him

he's. dead. "         I said to him,        "No he    isn't,"    but he said something               like,

"There's nothing we            can do for him,        we h a v e n ’t got the       e quipment."



As we were         saying    this someone was         putting    the dead supporter             onto an

ad ve rt is in g    hoarding,    as far as      I can remember a number              of su pporters

then    carried this         supporter across        the    pitch towards       the North Stand

side of the ground.             After we had tried to revive                 this second

supporter       the    elderly St J o h n ’s man di sa pp ea re d from my view               I have

  no idea where       he went.



9 Ihxs second supporter myself and the St John's man tried to                                 revive,         1

 would describe as a white male age d about 22 to 25 years,                                he was       tall

 about 6 feet,         he was     of me d iu m to heavy build,          with fair        hair     I think

 he had b l ue y /g re en eyes.           I cannot     remember what         this man. was wearing.

 After    this     I saw a couple         of supporters       behind me who were            trying       to

 resuscitate another            supporter,       1 took over       from the fans who was

 giving m ou th — t o- mo ut h for a couple           of minutes,       until a P o l i c e m a n       came

 up,   the P o l i c e ma n had a plastic ai rw ay w hich he put down the

 s u p p o r t e r ’s throat,   the ai rw ay had a kind of plastic                bag w hi ch         covered

 the   injured fans m o u th and            prevented the P o l i c e m a n ’s m ou th       coming      into

 contact with that           of the      injured person.



 After    the P ol i ce m an    inserted the a ir w ay he started giving m o u t h - to -

 mouth,    but     I saw that      the m a n ’s chest was        not    rising,     I pointed this

 out to the P o l i c e m a n and        I went and      put my hand under the supporter

 neck and tilted his head back to open the airway,                            the P o l i c e m a n

 continued m o u t h - t o - m o u t h   but the supporter         never     responded.



 After    some time,       other P ol i ce m en and s upporters            came over and          put the

 supporter       on an a dv e rt i si n g    hoarding and       carried him away,           a gain

 towards     the   other     end of the ground on the N orth S tand side                      of the

 ground.



  I cannot describe          this third supporter            I tried to revive           other        than

 to say he was a white male age d about 23 to 30 years and of                                 large

 build.      I cannot      remember a ny thing        else about his a p p ea r an c e          or the

  clothes he was wearing.

I did not have any other                involvement with any other d ec ea se d or

injured     persons.



After helping          the above    supporters,       I wa lk ed ar ou nd on the      pitch for

some    considerable       time    in a sort of daze.



At a time       I can only guess w ould have            been about 3 . 5 0 p m    (1530)   or

3.55pm     (1535)      I was    still    on the   pitch on the S ou th S tand side         of the

L e p p i n g s Lane   end goal    in the area of the six-yard box               line a nd the

goal    line,    when a .few feet awa y from my              position on the      pitch,   1 saw

two men shouting at a P ol i ce m an on the              pitch,    I could see these

supporters were          very upset^\l       think    one of them swore at the Pol ic em a n

and    lashed out at him with his fists,                the s upporter's      friend took hold

of him to restrain him.                 I can't say if the supporter's            punch made

contact,      I only saw for a short time the                 incident.     I couldn't

describe either          the s upporters      or the P o li ce ma n   involved      in this

incident      I didn't     really take that much notice at the time                   it occurred.



I am a white male,             six feet tall.        I am of me di um build,        w ith short

straight      black     hair,    on that day       I may have had a full         black beard and

moustache.



On that day        I was wearing         blue faded denim jeans and a faded blue

denim jacket.           1 cannot    remember      the details     of my other       clothing,

although      I may have        been wearing a blue denim shirt.



Whilst     dealing wit h either           the first or the second supporter             I tried

to revive,       I can recall a small             portable    transistor    radio    playing,     it

was either       in one of these dead supporter's                hands or    lying very       close

                                                                                               S3822

              to them,        I can say that when either       the first   or second supporter was

              carried away on the          hoarding   the sound of the t ransistor    radio    had

             also      gone.     I cannot describe the small transistor radio in any better

FOOTBALLS SUPPLY DATE DEBATE, TUESDAY 30 JANUARY



You    said    that    Mr   Moynihan    would    like     some    speaking      notes    on
football's finances,          to amplify the statistics which                we provided
for    No.10    yesterday and      to   contribute        to    a draft speech          for
Tuesday's debate. These are attached.


I     also    attach   a    consolidated    list     of   the     main   incidents       of
football hooliganism this season and last.                       The Home Office has
confirmed       that    the   information       is   correct      for    most     of the
incidents; they will          complete the checking on Monday.

FOOTBALL FINANCES



1.    Much      interest   has    been      generated      by     the    Prime Minister's
reference to £70m spent on transfer fees in the 1988/89 season.
The estimate was          supplied by the           Football       League      itself. I am
aware that a significant proportion of this money is circulating
between clubs; the total amount would not be available at any one
time to spend on ground improvements. But individual League clubs
do have a choice to make, when they sell their players, sometimes
for   millions      of    pounds,      to     other   English          clubs    or    to     clubs
abroad. Do they spend those millions on safety and on facilities
for   their     supporters       or on new        players?      At     each point          in the
transfer chain, a club selling a player has the same choice. And
we know the choice that is usually made.


2.    Taylor      quoted    the    circulation        argument.         He     also    made the
point that transfer fees "have reached a point which many regard
as grotesque and certainly out of proportion to the amounts spent
on ground improvement". He went on to advocate a levy on transfer
fees to be handed over to the Football Grounds Improvement Trust.
The effect of that would be that the more the money circulated
between clubs, the more the levy would bring in, I hope that the
football authorities will consider it.


3.      There    should    be     no   doubt       that    large       sums    of     money    are
flowing regularly into English football                      - and not just                flowing
round    it.     Take    transfer      fees      first.    When    a    leading       French or
Italian club - or for that matter a Scottish club - pays millions
of pounds for English League players,                      that money is coming into
the English game from outside. There are, of course,                                 significant
other sources of income, as well. The Prime Minister quoted some
of them last week.

4.      The income from television is running at £18m a year -nearly
£12m from ITV to the Football League; £6m from the BBC and BSB to
the Football Association.              The pools companies pay £6m a year to
the     League     for     the     use      of     their    fixture           list     and    this
contribution is separate from the total of nearly £10m which the
pools companies pay for grounds improvements through the Football
Trust      and   the   Football      Grounds         Improvement    Trust.    (EverT) the
Government makes its contribution, through the YTS scheme -£3.65m
last year.


5.      I know that not all of this money is evenly spread among the
92     League    clubs.      As    far   as    the     income    from    television    is
concerned, a large share of the money goes to the big clubs. But
that is football's choice. The Football League could decide on a
more equitable distribution if they wished. If they choose not to
do   so,    they can hardly         expect     the    Government    to bail     out   the
smaller     clubs.     Nor   can    they      - or    the   Opposition     - reasonably
expect the Government to give back tax revenue to football,                           any
more     than    th©    hotel      industry      or    cinemas     would     expect   the
Government to pay for their safety improvements.

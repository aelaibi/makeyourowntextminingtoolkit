           On Saturday the 15;th April           1989 < 150489)   I attended Hi 1 lsborough

           F oot bal 1 Stadi yrfff after the temporary/friortuary had been established in

           the gyronasi

           I was w orjging alongside                          , DC                and DC


                                                                     J   Z
           I   d i d n ’t take any polaroid photographs myself but followed DC

           around as he did.         The bodies were laid out in rows.          We started at

           one end,                        and                the other.     We met roughly

           in the middle.

           The photographs were then numbered up for eventual                display,
